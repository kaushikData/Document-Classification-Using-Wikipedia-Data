'''An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery''', passed by the [[Pennsylvania]] legislature on 1 March 1780, prescribed an end for slavery in Pennsylvania. It was the first act abolishing slavery in the course of human history to be  adopted by a democracy. The Act prohibited further importation of slaves into the state, required Pennsylvania slaveholders to annually register their slaves (with forfeiture for noncompliance, and [[manumission]] for the enslaved), and established that all children born in Pennsylvania were free persons regardless of the condition or [[race (human categorization)|race]] of their parents.  Those enslaved in Pennsylvania before the 1780 law entered effect remained enslaved for life. Another act of the Pennsylvania legislature freed them in 1847.  Pennsylvania's "gradual abolition"—rather than Massachusetts's 1783 "instant abolition"—became a model for freeing slaves in other Northern states.

==1780 Act==
The 1780 Act prohibited further importation of slaves into Pennsylvania, but it also respected the property rights of Pennsylvania slaveholders by not freeing slaves already held in the state. It changed the legal status of future children born to enslaved Pennsylvania mothers from "slave" to "[[indentured servant]]", but required those children to work for the mother's master until age 28. To verify that no additional slaves were imported, the Act created a registry of all slaves in the state. Slaveholders who failed to register their slaves annually, or who did it improperly, lost their slaves to manumission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/gradual.htm 1780 Gradual Abolition Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222073819/http://www.ushistory.org//presidentshouse/history/gradual.htm |date=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1780 Act specifically exempted members of the [[U.S. Congress]] and their personal slaves. Congress was then the only branch of the federal government under the [[Articles of Confederation]], and met in [[Philadelphia]].

==1788 Amendment==
An Amendment, created to explain and to close loopholes in the 1780 Act, was passed in the Pennsylvania legislature on 29 March 1788. The Amendment prohibited a Pennsylvania slaveholder from transporting a pregnant enslaved woman out-of-state so her child would be born enslaved; and from separating husbands from wives, and children from parents. It required a Pennsylvania slaveholder to register within six months the birth of a child to an enslaved mother. It prohibited all Pennsylvanians from participating in, building or equipping ships for, or providing material support to the [[slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/amendment1788.htm 1788 Amendment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626015903/http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/amendment1788.htm |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1780 Act had allowed a non-resident slaveholder visiting Pennsylvania to hold slaves in the state for up to six months. But a loophole was soon identified and exploited: if the non-resident slaveholder took his slaves out of Pennsylvania before the 6-month deadline, it would void his slaves' residency. The 1788 Amendment prohibited this rotation of slaves in and out-of-state to subvert Pennsylvania law.

==Washington's dilemma==
The 1780 Act had exempted personal slaves owned by members of Congress. By 1790, when Philadelphia became the temporary national capital for 10 years, there were three branches of the federal government under the [[US Constitution]]. There was confusion about whether or not the Pennsylvania law extended to all federal officials; members of Congress (legislative branch) remained exempt, but there was uncertainty regarding whether justices of the [[US Supreme Court]] (judicial branch) and the [[US President]] and the [[US Cabinet]] (executive branch) would also be exempt. [[US Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edmund Randolph]] lost his personal slaves to manumission because of his misunderstanding of the state law. He conveyed his advice to President [[George Washington]] through the president's secretary, [[Tobias Lear]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This being the case, the Attorney General conceived, that after six months residence, your slaves would be upon no better footing than his. But he observed, that if, before the expiration of six months, they could, upon any pretense whatever, be carried or sent out of the State, but for a single day, a new era would commence on their return, from whence the six months must be dated for it requires an entire six months for them to claim that right.&lt;ref name=Lear2Wash&gt;Tobias Lear to George Washington, 24 April 1791.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Washington argued privately that his presence in Philadelphia was solely a consequence of the city being the temporary national capital and that he remained a citizen of [[Virginia]] and subject to its laws on slavery. Still, he was careful not to spend six continuous months in Pennsylvania, which might be interpreted as establishing legal residency. Litigating the issue might have clarified his legal status and that of other slaveholding federal officials, but it also would have called attention to his slaveholding in the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]] and put him at risk of losing those slaves to manumission.&lt;ref&gt;Washington brought 8 slaves to Philadelphia in November 1790. Four of them, he returned to Mount Vernon in Spring 1791, before the 6-month deadline. Two of them were taken on a short trip to New Jersey by Martha Washington, which interrupted their 6-month residency. Two of them were trusted not to take advantage of the Pennsylvania law to seize their freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that he followed Randolph's advice and knowingly and repeatedly violated the state's 1788 Amendment by rotating the enslaved Africans in his presidential household into and out of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Edward, Jr |url=http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/slaves/numbers.php |title=The President's House: Slavery by the Numbers |website=[[UShistory.org]] |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no record of Washington being challenged. According to Lear, the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]] seems to have turned a blind eye to the President's actions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the Society in this city for the abolition of slavery, had determined to give no advice and take no measures for liberating those Slaves which belonged to the Officers of the general Government or members of Congress. But notwithstanding this, there were not wanting persons who would not only give them (the Slaves) advise, but would use all means to entice them from their masters.&lt;ref name=Lear2Wash/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Federal officials==
Other slaveholding officers of the executive and judicial branches faced a similar dilemma. [[US Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] swore that he would eventually free his enslaved cook, [[James Hemings]], if Hemings would agree not take advantage of Pennsylvania's abolition law.&lt;ref&gt;The affidavit is quoted in Garry Wills, ''Negro President: Jefferson and the Slave Power'' (Boston &amp; New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2003), pp. 210-11. {{ISBN|978-0-618-34398-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia's hostile environment for slaveholders was one of the reasons that the Constitution was written to give Congress exclusive control "over such District... as may... become the seat of the government of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom in 1847==
Those enslaved in Pennsylvania before its 1780 Act became law continued to be lifelong slaves, unless manumitted. Also, the 1780 Act and its 1788 Amendment did not apply to [[fugitive slave]]s from other states or their children. Pennsylvania tried to extend rights to fugitive slaves through an 1826 [[personal liberty laws|personal liberty law]], but it and the 1788 Amendment were ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in ''[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]'' (1842).

Although slavery steadily declined in Pennsylvania, the state that had initially led the way toward abolition tolerated it for decades after it ended in [[New England]]. The [[1840 U.S. Census]] listed 47,854 (99.87%) of the state's blacks as free, and 64 (0.13%) as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity: A History of African-American Slaves'' (2003), pp. 276-78. {{ISBN|0-674-01061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal slavery ended in Pennsylvania in 1847, when the several dozen remaining slaves (the youngest was 67) were freed.

==Other states==
{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}
*1777: The [[Constitution of Vermont (1777)|Constitution of Vermont]] bans slavery. &lt;ref&gt; This is a common citation in this context. It should be recognized that Vermont was not among the original 13 states. The land which 'Vermont' claimed was also claimed by New York. Vermont did not become the 14th state until the State of New York allowed that to happen. In that context, 'Vermont' was not a legitimate legal entity before 1791. &lt;/ref&gt;
*1783: [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] rules slavery illegal based on the 1780 [[Constitution of Massachusetts]]. Slavery ended in Massachusetts by the time of the census in 1790.
**[[Maine]] was part of Massachusetts in 1783 and entered the Union as a free state in 1820. 
*1783: [[New Hampshire]] Constitution contains a bill of rights that is interpreted as ending slavery. In 1857, a law was approved that formally prohibited slavery.
*1784: [[Connecticut]] begins a gradual abolition of slavery. A law was approved in 1848 that freed any remaining slaves.
*1784: [[Rhode Island]] begins a gradual abolition of slavery.
*1791: Vermont enters the Union as a free state.
*1799: [[New York State]] begins a gradual abolition of slavery. A law was approved in 1817 that freed all remaining slaves on July 4, 1827.
*1804: [[New Jersey]] begins a gradual abolition of slavery.

New Jersey's gradual abolition law freed future children at birth, but male children of enslaved women could be held until age twenty-five and females until age twenty-one. Those enslaved before passage of the 1804 law remained enslaved for life. The last vestiges of slavery remained in New Jersey until December 6, 1865 when ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] ended slavery in the United States. New Jersey's legislature did not approve the Thirteenth Amendment until February 1866, two months after it had been ratified by three-fourths of the states.

He was the elder brother of [[William Dalrymple Maclagan]], who would become [[Archbishop of York]]; and of the engineer and soldier Gen Sir [[Robert Maclagan]]. His youngest brother was the eminent accountant, David Maclagan [[FRSE]] (1824-1883) manager of the Edinburgh Life Assurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico has limited protections for animals by international standards.&lt;ref name="wap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/mexico |title=Mexico |date=November 2, 2014 |accessdate=July 10, 2016 |author=World Animal Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

Most of Mexico's states and the Federal District have prohibitions against [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]]. In [[Michoacan]], [[Quintana Roo]], and the Federal District, cruelty by negligence is included.  This is not the case in [[Tlaxcala]], and in [[Baja California]] applies only to certain kinds of animal.  [[Chiapas]] and [[Baja California Sur]] did not have animal welfare protections as of November 2014.&lt;ref name="wap"/&gt;

The Federal Animal Health Act 2007 contains a number of provisions concerning the welfare of farm animals (not including aquatic animals).  The main purpose of the Act is to diagnose, prevent, and control diseases in animals, but welfare is also addressed.  Owners or keepers of domestic animals must provide adequate food and water, veterinarian supervision and immediate attention in case of injury.  The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food is responsible for protecting the health and welfare of animals in "primary production", determining rules on animal welfare, [[Livestock transport|transport]] and slaughter.  State-level anti-cruelty provisions also apply to farm animals.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt;

In 2014, Mexico received a D out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on [[World Animal Protection]]'s Animal Protection Index.&lt;ref name="wap" /&gt; They are working progressively to get a better grade. Now they have a B.{{quotation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Animals used for food ==

The majority of Mexican pigs are raised on [[intensive animal farming]] operations.  Between 1990 and 2005, pig production increased by 50%, and by 2009 over 15 million pigs were slaughtered for food each year.&lt;ref name="hsipig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/pig_factory_farming_in_mexico.pdf |title=An HSI Fact Sheet: Pig Factory Farming in Mexico |author=Humane Society International |accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 world cattle inventory, Mexico has the ninth-largest cattle herd in the world at 16,450,000 cows.&lt;ref name="cattleinventory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beef2live.com/story-world-cattle-inventory-ranking-countries-130-106905 |title=World Cattle Inventory: Ranking of Countries |author=Rob Cook |date=July 4, 2016 |accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mexico had the seventh-largest number of chickens at approximately 500 million.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/07/global-livestock-counts |title=Counting chickens |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2016 |author=The Economist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cc-by new.svg|thumb|120px|[[Creative Commons]] license symbol for attribution.]]

'''Attribution''' in copyright law, is acknowledgement as credit to the copyright holder or author of a work. If a work is under copyright, there is a long tradition of the author requiring attribution while directly quoting portions of work created by that author.

An author may formally require attribution required via a [[license]], legally preventing others from claiming to have written the work and allowing a copyright holder to retain reputational benefits from having written it.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In cases when the copyright holder is the author themselves, this behavior is often moralized as a sign of [[decency]] and [[respect]] to acknowledge the creator by giving them credit for the work.

This said, a work in the [[public domain]], which is any not covered by copyright, has no such attribution requirement in most parts of the world. This is the distinguishing factor between [[plagiarism]], which is not a crime, and [[copyright infringement]], which may be a cause of legal action from the author.

== Copyright holder attribution ==
The most fundamental{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} form of attribution is the statement of the copyright holder's identity, often in the form ''Copyright © [year] [copyright holder’s name]''. The preservation of such a notice was an invariable requirement to prevent a work entering the [[public domain]]; this changed in the United States on March 1, 1989 when the requirement of copyright registration and copyright signment was ended. Copyright holder attribution is in most countries in the world not required, due to [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]].

== Author attribution ==
Author attribution is required by several licenses, such as the [[open content|open-content]] [[Creative Commons licence|Creative Commons]] licenses and most [[Free software license|free]] and/or [[Open source software license|open source]] software licenses such as the [[MIT Licence|MIT permissive license]]. Open content licenses without the requirement for author attribution include [[public domain equivalent license]]s, like [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]].

'''Australian insurance law''' is based on commercial [[contract law]], but is subject to regulations that affect the [[Insurance in Australia|insurance]] industry and [[insurance]] [[contracts]] within [[Australia]]. [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]] has power to make laws with respect to insurance and insurance companies under [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]](xiv) (insurance other than state insurance) and [[Section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution|(xx)]] (the corporations power) of the [[Australian Constitution]]. Generally, the ''Insurance Act 1973'' and ''Insurance Contracts Act 1984'' are the main acts that apply, however there are a number of other pieces of legislation enacted by the [[Australian states|states]], private codes and volumous [[case law]] all of which forms the body of insurance law.

== Legislation ==
The ''Insurance Act 1973'' (Cth) sets minimum capital and solvency requirements for companies wanting to enter or operate in the insurance market.&lt;ref&gt;''Insurance Act 1973'' (Cth), s 2A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 7 of the ''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth) regulates the way in which insurers and insurance agents and brokers carry on business and how they deal with the people they do business with and intend to do business with.

The ''Insurance Contracts Act 1984'' (ICA) applies to most insurance contracts with an Australian connection and is intended to ensure that a fair balance is struck between the interests of the insurer and the insured.

The primary federal laws affecting the industry include:
* [[Life Insurance Act 1995]] (Life Insurance prudential regulation)
* [[Insurance Act 1973]] (General Insurance prudential regulation)
* [[Health Insurance Act 2007]] (Health insurance prudential regulation and consumer protection)
* [[Corporations Act 2001]] (especially Ch 7, consumer protection in respect of insurance policies)
* [[Insurance Contracts Act 1984]] (consumer protection in respect of insurance policies)
Other legislation which affects the industry includes:
* A Nex Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Taxation rules in respect to insurance e.g. Division 78)
* Privacy Act 1988 (The National Privacy Principles)
Further regulations include:
* The General Insurance Code of Practice which all general insurer signatories agree to self-regulate under.
* [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS)

== Regulators ==
The prudential aspects of general, life and health insurance (solvency etc.) are regulated by the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA), which has the power under the ''Insurance Act 1973'' to investigate a general insurer, freeze its assets or direct it to take specific action (for example, stop writing new business).

The [[Australian Securities and Investment Commission]] (ASIC) is responsible for the general administration of the ''Insurance Contracts Act 1984''.&lt;ref&gt;''Insurance Contracts Act'' section 11A.&lt;/ref&gt; Matters relating to advice or disclosure of insurance products sold are regulated by ASIC. The [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) also has a regulatory role with respect to [[competition law]]. 

In certain states, various bodies also have powers in regulating certain types of statutory insurance. For example, in [[New South Wales]] the Motor Accidents Authority regulates [[Compulsory Third Party]] motor liability insurance. In many cases these bodies have powers regarding premium rating and reinsurance rules.

== Insurance contract ==
The formation of an insurance contract is governed by ordinary contractual principles&lt;ref&gt;''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th ed, vol. 25 (2003 reissue), [70].&lt;/ref&gt; however, as a commercial contract, a policy of insurance should be given a businesslike interpretation "having regard to the language used by the parties, the commercial circumstances the document addresses, and the objects which it is intended to secure."&lt;ref&gt;''Horsell International Pty Ltd v Divetwo Pty Ltd'' [2013] NSWCA 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Code of Practice ==
The General Insurance Code of Practice is a self-regulatory code that binds all general insurers who are signatories to it. It has been approved by ASIC pursuant to s 1101A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).&lt;ref&gt;According to ''ASIC Regulatory Guide 183'', ASIC's approval does no more than inform consumers that they can have confidence in the Code of Practice.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial Ombudsman Service ==

If a person doesn't agree with the outcome of the insurer's Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) process, they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service with a request that the Service resolve the dispute.

A '''bank holding company''' is a [[Holding company|company]] that controls one or more [[bank]]s, but does not necessarily engage in banking itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== United States ==

In the United States, a '''bank holding company''', as provided by the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] ({{usc|12|1841(a)(2)(A)}} ''[[wiktionary:en:et seq.|et seq.]]''), is broadly defined as "any company that has control over a bank".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6000-300.html#6000sec.2 | title = Bank Holding Company Act | publisher = FDIC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All bank holding companies in the US are required to register with the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]].

===Regulation===
The [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]], under Regulation Y ({{CodeFedReg|12|225}}) has responsibility for regulating and supervising bank holding company activities, such as establishing [[Regulatory Capital|capital standards]], approving [[mergers and acquisitions]] and inspecting the operations of such companies. This authority applies even though a bank owned by a holding company may be under the primary supervision of the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] or the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]].

===Bank holding company status===
Becoming a bank holding company makes it easier for the firm to raise capital than as a traditional bank. The holding company can assume debt of [[shareholder]]s on a tax free basis, borrow money, acquire other banks and non-bank entities more easily, and issue [[stock]] with greater regulatory ease. It also has a greater legal authority to conduct [[share repurchase]]s of its own stock.

The downside includes responding to additional regulatory authorities, especially if there are more than 2,000 shareholders (note: prior to the Jobs Act or [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act]], the shareholder number was 300), at which point the bank holding company is forced to register with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. There are also added expenses of operating with an extra layer of administration.

===2008 credit crisis===

As a result of the [[global financial crisis of 2008]], many traditional [[investment banks]] and finance corporations such as [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.morganstanley.com/about/press/articles/6933.html | title = Morgan Stanley Granted Federal Bank Holding Company Status By U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Express]], [[CIT Group]] and GMAC (now [[Ally Financial]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h4GEaYlHfefh9VOVG0czn7d4KWig | title = AFP: Fed approves GMAC bank request in boost for GM | publisher = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; successfully converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to [[liquidity]] and funding.

The '''Board of Veterans' Appeals''' (often referred to as '''the Board''') is an administrative tribunal within the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA), located in [[Washington, D.C.]] It determines whether U.S. military veterans are entitled to claimed [[veterans' benefits]] and services.  The Board's mission is to conduct hearings and decide appeals properly before the Board in a timely manner. 38 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 7101 (a).  The Board's jurisdiction extends to all questions in matters involving a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects a provision of benefits by the Secretary to Veterans, their dependents, or their Survivors.  38 U.S.C. §§ 551(a); 7104(a).  Final decision on such appeals are made by the Board based on the entire record in the proceedings and upon consideration of all evidence and applicable provisions of law and regulation.&lt;ref name="bva.va.gov"&gt;http://www.bva.va.gov/docs/Chairmans_Annual_Rpts/BVA2015AR.pdf {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Board's review is de novo.

The Board is led by the Chairman of the Board of Veterans' Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bva.va.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chairman is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  The Chairman position was vacant from February 2011 - December 2017.  On September 5, 2017, President Donald J. Trump nominated Cheryl L. Mason of Virginia to be Chairman of the Board of Veterans Appeals for a term of six years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/932&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman Mason was sworn in by Dr. David J. Shulkin&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=David Shulkin|date=2018-10-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Shulkin&amp;oldid=862370787|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, on December 11, 2017.

In Fiscal Year 2018, the Board issued over 81,000 decisions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/52405/va-achieves-historic-goal-delivering-81000-appeals-decisions-veterans-fiscal-2018/|title=VA achieves historic goal by delivering 81,000 appeals decisions to Veterans in fiscal 2018|last=|first=|date=September 14, 2018|website=VA News Release|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Veterans and their families, which is the highest number of decisions issued by the Board since the 1988 enactment of the Veterans' [[Judicial Review]] Act (VJRA), which established the [[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]] (CAVC).  The FY 18 total of 85,288 decisions is a 62% increase over the FY 17 total of 52,537. Additionally, the Board held 16,422 hearings.

==Appeals Process==
The appeals process in the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA of the Department) is a complex, non-linear process, which is set in law and is unique from other standard appeals processes across the Federal and judicial systems.  A feature of the current VA appeals process is a continuous open record that allows a Veteran, Survivor, or other appellant to submit new evidence and/or make new argument at any point from the beginning to the end of the appeals process.  Additionally, the duty to assist throughout the appeals process requires VA to develop further evidence on the Veteran's behalf and pursue new argument and theories of entitlement. Each time arguments are presented and evidence is added/ obtained, VA generally must issue another decision considering that evidence, which protracts the timeline for appellate resolution.&lt;ref name="bva.va.gov"/&gt;

Due to increasing difficulty to address the growing number of appeals in the current system, there have been various attempts to streamline the appeals process. {{As of|2017}}, the most recent proposal was the ''Department of Veterans Affairs Appeals Modernization Act'', a reintroduction of S. 3328 from the 114th U.S. Congress.  The bill was reintroduced on March 24, 2017 by a group of sixteen U.S. Senators, which include original cosponsors of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-overhaul-broken-va-appeals-process&lt;/ref&gt;  The Appeals Modernization Act passed through Congress and was signed into law by President Trump on August 23, 2017. The Appeals Modernization Act is to be implemented on February 14, 2019.

==History==
The Board of Veterans Appeals was established in July 1933.&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;[[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], ''[http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/archives/docs/history_in_brief.pdf VA History in Brief]'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It was given authority to hear appeals on benefit and services decisions.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt; Members of the Board are appointed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with the approval of the [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;

===Background of Veteran's Benefits===

The United States has the most comprehensive system of assistance for Veterans of any nation in the world, with roots that can be traced back to 1636, when the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony were at war with the Pequot Indians. The Pilgrims passed a law that stated that disabled soldiers would be supported by the colony.  Later, the Continental Congress of 1776 encouraged enlistments during the Revolutionary War, providing pensions to disabled soldiers. In the early days of the Republic, individual states and communities provided direct medical and hospital care to Veterans. In 1811, the federal government authorized the first domiciliary and medical facility for Veterans. Also in the 19th century, the nation's Veterans assistance program was expanded to include benefits and pensions not only for Veterans, but for their widows and dependents.  This commitment is reflected in [[U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s words  "to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for this widow, and his orphan,"  which is also the current motto of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/celebrate/vamotto.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
An individual may file a claim for VA Veterans benefits and programs, such as: Disability Compensation; Education Assistance (GI Bill/ Post 9-11 GI Bill); Insurance; Dependency and Indemnity Compensation; Medical; Pension; and Vocational Rehabilitation and Education (VR&amp;E).  The most common claim is for Disability Compensation, which comprised 93.88 percent of all appeals in Fiscal Year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS ANNUAL REPORT FY2015, Page 26. http://www.bva.va.gov/docs/Chairmans_Annual_Rpts/BVA2015AR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a Veteran who receives an injury, or develops a medical condition while serving in the [[United States Armed Forces]], is generally entitled to receive compensation based on the degree to which the injury affects things like the person's mobility, future earning capacity, or quality of life. A claimant seeking such benefits first files a claim with a Regional Office of the VA located near the claimant. When a claimant's application for benefits has been denied by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction, such as the [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] (VBA), [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA) or [[National Cemetery Administration]] (NCA), an appeal can be made to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Shedd, "Overview of the Appeal Process for Veterans' Claims", [[Congressional Research Service]] Report 7-5700 (April 29, 2013), page 3, citing 38 U.S.C. §7104(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The Board is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, located in Washington, DC, and makes the final determination on an appeal within the VA's jurisdiction. Board members make the final decision on appeals within the VA. The Board also employs staff attorneys that assist the Board members while preparing a decision for a claim, much like a clerk for a judge.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Shedd, "Overview of the Appeal Process for Veterans' Claims", [[Congressional Research Service]] Report 7-5700 (April 29, 2013), page 3, citing [http://www.ptsdmanual.com/y2000.pdf BOARD OF VETERANS' APPEALS, VAPAMPHLET 01-00-1, UNDERSTANDING THE APPEALS PROCESS] (2000), page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions of the Board may be appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Shedd, "Overview of the Appeal Process for Veterans' Claims", [[Congressional Research Service]] Report 7-5700 (April 29, 2013), page 3, citing 38 U.S.C. §§7252, 7266.&lt;/ref&gt; which is not part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and from there to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Shedd, "Overview of the Appeal Process for Veterans' Claims", [[Congressional Research Service]] Report 7-5700 (April 29, 2013), page 4, citing 38 U.S.C. §7292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process of filing an appeal with the Board===
The process of appealing an unfavorable decision consists of several steps:

* '''Step 1''': If a Veteran disagrees with all of part of a VA decision, he or she must file a Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  An NOD is filed on a VA Form 21-0958, which is available at http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0958-ARE.pdf.  A NOD must be filed one year from the date of the letter notifying the Veteran of the claims decision and must be filed on the standard form.
* '''Step 2''': the local VA office will review the Veteran's file again, prepare a written explanation of why the claim was denied, known as the Statement of the Case (SOC), and provide a copy to the claimant by mail. If any evidence or request that VA obtain any evidence is submitted after the mailing of the Statement of the Case, the claimant may receive a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) after the local VA office reviews that evidence.
* '''Step 3''': After reviewing the Statement of the Case (SOC), the Veteran (appellant), usually via his or her attorney, claims agent, or Veterans Service Officer, files a formal notice of appeal on a VA Form 9, Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals', which is available online at http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA9.pdf.  At this time, the appellant may elect an optional hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.
* '''Optional Step 4''': If an optional in-person or video teleconference hearing with a Veterans Law Judge at the Board of Veterans’ Appeals is selected on the VA Form 9, the hearing will be scheduled at the appellant's local VA office (Regional Office).  Central Office hearing requests in Washington, DC are scheduled by the Board. An appellant's travel costs for a hearing are not paid by VA.
* '''Step 5''': After a Substantive Appeal (VA Form 9) is filed and hearing held (if applicable), the local VA office will certify and transfer the appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, where a decision will be prepared and mailed to the appellant.

A more detailed overview of the appeals process can be found in VA Pamphlet 01-15-02B, which is available online at https://www.bva.va.gov/How_Do_I_APPEAL.asp.

The '''Broadcasting Act 1980''' (1980 c. 64) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was repealed by the [[Broadcasting Act 1981]], though the provisions of the Act remained in force.

The most significant effect of the Act was to amend the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973]], giving the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] the power to provide a second television station. This began the process which would lead to the creation of [[Channel 4]] in 1982.

It also made provision for the broadcasting of television programmes in Wales, and established the [[Broadcasting Complaints Commission (United Kingdom)|Broadcasting Complaints Commission]].

It also allowed the government to take over control of the [[BBC]] in a time of [[national emergency]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19868">'''Compact theory''' refers to two theories related to the development of [[Federation|federal]] [[constitution]]s. In the United States, it differs from the contract theory in that it favored the rights of states over those of the Federal Government.

==Compact theory in the United States==
Regarding the [[Constitution of the United States]], the compact theory holds that the country was formed through a compact agreed upon by all the states, and that the federal government is thus a creation of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Compact of the Republic: The League of States and the Constitution]] |last=Benner |first=David |authorlink=David Benner |year=2015 |publisher=Life &amp; Liberty Publishing Group |location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, states should be the final arbiters over whether the federal government had overstepped the limits of its authority as set forth in the compact.

===Arguments in favor of the theory===
Leading proponents of this view of the U.S. Constitution primarily originated from Virginia and other southern states.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Notable proponents of the theory include [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomformula.us/classes/live-class-resources/jefferson-giles-12-26-1825/ Jefferson to William B. Giles in letter dated 12/26/1825].&lt;/ref&gt; Under this theory and in reaction to the [[Alien and Sedition Acts|Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798]], Jefferson claimed the federal government overstepped its authority, and advocated nullification of the laws by the states. The first resolution of the [[Kentucky Resolutions]] began by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, that the several States composing the [[United States of America]], are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government; but that by compact under the style and title of a [[United States Constitution|Constitution for the United States]] and of [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]] thereto, they constituted a General Government for special purposes, delegated to that Government certain definite powers, reserving each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self Government; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party; that the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1798|Kentucky Resolutions of 1798]]; see also "Reclaiming the American Revolution," Wm. J. Watkins, Jr.,Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Arguments against the theory===
Others have taken the position that the federal government is not a compact among the states, but instead was formed directly by the people, in their exercise of their sovereign power. The people determined that the federal government should be superior to the states. Under this view, the states, which are not parties to the Constitution, do not have the right to determine for themselves the proper scope of federal authority, but instead are bound by the determinations of the federal government. The state of Vermont took this position in response to the [[Kentucky Resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;In response to the Kentucky Resolutions' assertion that the states formed the federal government by compact and retained the right to judge the federal government's laws, Vermont said: "This cannot be true. The old confederation, it is true, was formed by the state Legislatures, but the present Constitution of the United States was derived from an higher authority. The people of the United States formed the federal constitution, and not the states, or their Legislatures. And although each state is authorized to propose amendments, yet there is a wide difference between proposing amendments to the constitution, and assuming, or inviting, a power to dictate and control the General Government." {{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Frank Maloy | chapter = [[s:Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions/II|Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] | publisher = American Historical Review | year = 1899 | location = | pages = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Webster]] advocated this view in his [[Webster-Hayne debate|debate with Robert Hayne]] in the Senate in 1830:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t cannot be shown, that the Constitution is a compact between State governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; it, declares that it is ordained and established ''by the people of the United States''. So far from saying that it is established by the governments ''of the several States'', it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several States; but it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States, in the aggregate. . . . When the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between the States, he uses language exactly applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as States, were parties to it. We had no other general government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate to the public exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better. They undertook to form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a ''Constitution''; a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it the name of a ''Constitution'', therein they established a distribution of powers between this, their general government, and their several State governments.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Great Speeches and Orations of Daniel Webster/The Reply to Hayne|Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, January 26, 1830]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leading nineteenth century commentary on the Constitution, Justice [[Joseph Story]]'s ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'' (1833), likewise rejected the compact theory, concluding that the Constitution was established directly by the people, not by the states, and that it constitutes supreme law, not a mere compact.&lt;ref&gt;Story wrote: "In what light, then, is the constitution of the United States to be regarded? Is it a mere compact, treaty, or confederation of the states composing the Union, or of the people thereof, whereby each of the several states, and the people thereof, have respectively bound themselves to each other? Or is it a form of government, which, having been ratified by a majority of the people in all the states, is obligatory upon them, as the prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power, to the extent of its provisions? . . . There is nowhere found upon the face of the constitution any clause, intimating it to be a compact, or in anywise providing for its interpretation, as such. On the contrary, the preamble emphatically speaks of it, as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government. The language is, 'We, the people of the United States, do ''ordain'' and ''establish'' this ''constitution'' for the United States of America.' ''The people'' do ''ordain'' and ''establish'', not contract and stipulate with each other. The people of the ''United States'', not the distinct people of a ''particular state'' with the people of the other states. The people ordain and establish a '''constitution'',' not a '''confederation''.' . . . Nor should it be omitted, that in the most elaborate expositions of the constitution by its friends, its character, as a permanent form of government, as a fundamental law, as a supreme rule, which no state was at liberty to disregard, suspend, or annul, was constantly admitted, and insisted on, as one of the strongest reasons, why it should be adopted in lieu of the confederation." {{cite book |title=[[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States]] |last=Story |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Story |year=1833 |publisher=Hilliard Gray &amp; Co. |location=Boston |pages=318–319, 326 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before the Civil War, the compact theory was used by southern states to argue that they had a right to nullify federal law and to secede from the union. For example, during the [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1828-1832, [[John C. Calhoun]] argued in his [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] that the states, as the parties to a compact, had the right to judge for themselves whether the terms of the compact were being honored. Calhoun described this "right of judging" as "an essential attribute of sovereignty," which the states retained when the Constitution was formed. Calhoun said the states had the right to nullify, or veto, any laws that were inconsistent with the compact.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter bold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights. . . . But the existence of the right of judging of their powers, so clearly established from the sovereignty of States, as clearly implies a veto or control, within its limits, on the action of the General Government, on contested points of authority. . . . May the General Government . . . encroach on the rights reserved to the States respectively? To the States respectively each in its sovereign capacity is reserved the power, by its veto, or right of interposition, to arrest the encroachment." [[s:South Carolina Exposition and Protest|South Carolina Exposition and Protest, 1828]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the southern states seceded in 1860-61, they relied on the compact theory to justify secession. The southern states argued that the northern states had violated the compact by undermining and attacking the institution of slavery and the slaveholders' property rights in their slaves. The southern states stated that they therefore were justified in withdrawing from the compact among the states.&lt;ref&gt;For example, South Carolina's statement of secession said: "Thus was established, by compact between the States, a Government with definite objects and powers, limited to the express words of the grant. . . . [T]he constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation. . . . Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection." [[s:Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, 1860]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states. Rather, the Court has stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people of the United States, not by the states.

In one of the Supreme Court's first significant decisions, ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'' (1793), Chief Justice John Jay stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people. Jay noted the language of the Preamble of the Constitution, which says that the Constitution was ordained and established by "We the people," and stated: "Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound."&lt;ref&gt;"[The people] made a Confederation of the States the basis of a general government [i.e. the Articles of Confederation]. Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed from it, and then the people, in their collective and national capacity, established the present Constitution. It is remarkable that, in establishing it, the people exercised their own rights, and their own proper sovereignty, and, conscious of the plenitude of it, they declared with becoming dignity, 'We the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound, and to which the State Constitutions should be made to conform. Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner, and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to general objects in a certain manner." ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'', 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793). Jay went on to say that the people had delegated to the federal judiciary the task of interpreting the meaning, construction, and operation of the Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' (1816), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states, stating: "The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'" The Court contrasted the earlier Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, characterizing the Articles of Confederation as a compact among states, while stating that the Constitution was established not by the states, but by the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.' . . . The Constitution was for a new Government, organized with new substantive powers, and not a mere supplementary charter to a Government already existing. The Confederation was a compact between States, and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the National Government. The Constitution was an act of the people of the United States to supersede the Confederation, and not to be ingrafted on it, as a stock through which it was to receive life and nourishment." ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'', 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Supreme Court stated that the federal Constitution proceeded directly from the people, and was not created by the states. The Court stated that the Constitution was binding on the states and could not be negated by the states. The Court again contrasted the Articles of Confederation, which was established by the states, to the Constitution, which was established by the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The government proceeds directly from the people; is 'ordained and established' in the name of the people, and is declared to be ordained, 'in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity.' . . . It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the State Governments. The Constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties. . . . To the formation of a league such as was the Confederation, the State sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, 'in order to form a more perfect union,' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective Government, possessing great and sovereign powers and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The Government of the Union then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case) is, emphatically and truly, a Government of the people. In form and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit." ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, in ''[[Texas v. White]]'' (1869), a case discussing the legal status of the southern states that had attempted to secede, the Supreme Court stated that the union was not merely a compact among states; rather, the union was "something more than a compact."&lt;ref&gt;"When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States." ''[[Texas v. White]]'', 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compact theory in Canada==

In the [[Canada|Canadian]] context, compact theory posits that [[Confederation of Canada|Confederation]] was an agreement between the two founding peoples, [[French Canadian|French]] and English, and that therefore [[Quebec]] should have special [[veto]] powers relating to its position in the federal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brooks, ''Canadian Democracy: An Introduction'', 5th ed. (Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2007), 201.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, compact theory was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the 1981 [[Patriation Reference]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Compact theory is often advanced by [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]].

The '''English Convention''' (1689) was an assembly of the [[Parliament of England]] which transferred the crowns of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] from [[James II of England|James II]] to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as [[coregency|co-regents]].

==Assemblies of 1688==
Immediately following the [[Glorious Revolution]], with King [[James II of England]] in flight and Prince [[William III of Orange]] nearing London, the [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]] summoned the [[Lords Temporal]] and [[Lords Spiritual]] to assemble, and they were joined by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy councillors]] on 12 December 1688 to form a provisional government for England. James II returned to London on 16 December; by the 17th he was effectively a prisoner of William who arrived in London the next day. Subsequently, William allowed James to flee in safety, to avoid the ignominy of doing his uncle and father-in-law any immediate harm.

William refused the crown as ''[[de facto]]'' king and instead called another assembly of peers on 21 December 1688. On 23 December James fled to France. On 26 December the peers were joined by the surviving members of Charles II's [[Oxford Parliament (1681)|Oxford Parliament]] (from the previous reign), ignoring the MPs who were just elected to James's [[Loyal Parliament]] of 1685. The [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Earl of Nottingham]] proposed a conditional restoration of King James II, an idea supported by [[Archbishop Sancroft]], but the proposal was rejected and instead the assembly asked William to summon a convention.&lt;ref name="HarrisTim"&gt;{{cite book | title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685 – 1720 | publisher=Allen Lane | author=Harris, Tim | year=2006 | pages=312–313 | isbn=9780713997590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention of 1689==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
The Convention Parliament met on 22 January 1689. The parliament spent much time arguing over whether James II was considered to have abdicated or abandoned the throne in some manner and who then should take the crown. The Whigs referred to theories of [[social contract]] and argued that William alone should now be king.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720'' Allen Lane (2006) p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; A few 'Radical' Whigs argued for a [[republic]], but most Whigs argued for a [[limited monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720'' Allen Lane (2006) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tories favoured the retention of James II, a regency, or William's wife, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], alone as queen. Archbishop Sancroft and loyalist bishops preferred that James II be conditionally restored.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720'' Allen Lane (2006) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, it was resolved that England was a [[Protestant]] kingdom and only a Protestant could be king, thus disinheriting a Catholic claimant.&lt;ref&gt;Fritze, Ronald H. &amp; Robison, William B.  ''Historical dictionary of Stuart England, 1603–1689'' Greenwood Press (1996) p. 126 entry on Convention Parliament (1689)&lt;/ref&gt; James was a Roman Catholic.

By the beginning of February, the Commons agreed on the descriptor "abdicated" and that the throne was vacant, but the Lords rejected abdicated as the term was unknown in [[common law]] and indicated that even if the throne was vacant, it should automatically pass to the next in line, which implied it was to be Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720'' Allen Lane (2006) p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 6 February the Lords capitulated, primarily since it became apparent that neither Mary nor [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] would agree to rule in place of William.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, Julian ''A Land of Liberty?, England 1689–1727'' Oxford University Press (2000) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As a compromise, the Lords proposed that [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] should both take the throne, which the Commons agreed if William alone held regal power.

The parliament drew up a [[Declaration of Right]] to address abuses of government under James II and to secure the religion and liberties of [[Protestants]], which was finalised on 12 February.

On 13 February, William and Mary were proclaimed King and Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. The acceptance of the Crown was conditional not upon acceptance of the Declaration of Right but on the assumption that they rule according to law.&lt;ref name="Bogdanor"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Monarchy and the Constitution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Bogdanor, Vernon | year=1997 | pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisTim2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720 | publisher=Allen Lane | author=Harris, Tim | year=2006 | page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 1689, King William III reconvened the Convention into a regular parliament&lt;ref name="Horwitz"&gt;{{cite book | title=Parliament, Policy, and Politics in the reign of William III | publisher=Manchester University Press | author=Horwitz, Henry | year=1977 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by dissolving it and summoning a new parliament, which regularised the acts of the Convention Parliament by passing the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]].

===Effect on Thirteen Colonies===
The Convention Parliament of 1689 would be imitated in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and the use of such conventions as an "instrument of transition" became more acceptable and more often used by the Colonies, resulting most notably in the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] which drew up the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="CaplanRL"&gt;{{cite book | title=Constitutional Brinksmanship: Amending the Constitution by National Convention | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Caplan, Russell L | year=1988 | pages=6–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current '''Copyright law of the Russian Federation''' is codified in part IV of the [[Civil Code of the Russian Federation]]. It entered in force on January 1, 2008.

The first post-Soviet copyright law of the Russian Federation became effective on August 3, 1993. It completely replaced the older Soviet legislation that had been in effect until then. The new Copyright law of 1993 was based upon [[WIPO]] model laws and followed the continental European tradition: it clearly separated economic and [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], and it included detailed provisions for [[neighbouring rights]].

The Copyright law of 1993 had specified a general duration of copyrights of 50 years beyond an author's death, or 50 years since the publication of an anonymous work. The implementation act for the law made the new law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights (and neighbouring rights) on works on which the shorter [[copyright term]]s from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. In 2004, this copyright term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted.

In 2006, completely rewritten [[intellectual property]] laws were included in part IV of a new [[Civil Code of the Russian Federation]]. These new laws entered into force on January 1, 2008, replacing all previous intellectual property legislation, including the separate copyright law from 1993. The copyright term has been extended to 70 years for works published by Russian authors and copyright protection has been retroactively granted to works which had their 50-year protection term expire in 1993–2003, bringing many notable works out of [[public domain]]. For works that have been created or published in other countries, the law now implements the [[rule of the shorter term]], matching Russian copyright term with those existing in the country of origin.

== Transition from Soviet law ==

When the [[Soviet Union]] was dissolved and the fifteen [[republics of the Soviet Union]] became independent states, the [[copyright law of the USSR]] also split into fifteen independent copyright laws, each with its own jurisdiction defined by the territory of the new successor state of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Elst487"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;487.&lt;/ref&gt; All these successor states initially took over the old Soviet legislation.

At the time of the disintegration of the USSR, the copyright law in force was defined by chapter IV of the union-wide 1961 Fundamentals of Civil Legislation, amended in 1973, when the USSR had joined the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC). Each of the republics implemented these Fundamentals in their own local laws.&lt;ref name="Newcity29"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Russian SFSR]], the Russian Civil Code had been adapted to the 1961 Fundamentals in 1964,&lt;ref name="Elst79"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1973 changes due to the accession to the UCC entered in force in Russia on March 1, 1974.&lt;ref name="Newcity49"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1973, the USSR had had a general copyright term of the lifetime of the author of a work plus 25 years&amp;mdash;the minimum prescribed the UCC.&lt;ref name="Newcity80"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before its demise, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] had initiated an omnibus revision of the copyright law of the USSR to adapt it to a market economy.&lt;ref name="Elst381"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;381.&lt;/ref&gt; The new legislation on copyrights in chapter IV of 1991 Fundamentals was passed as law on March 31, 1991 and scheduled to enter in force on January 1, 1992. The 1991 Fundamentals extended the copyright term to 50 years ''p.m.a.'' and introduced [[neighbouring rights]] for the first time in Soviet legislation. But the USSR ceased to exist before the new 1991 law became effective.&lt;ref name="Elst370"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation]] passed a decree that made the USSR 1991 Fundamentals effective in Russia from August 3, 1992, on insofar as these Fundamentals contradicted neither the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]] nor other legislative acts of Russia passed after June 12, 1990,&lt;ref name="Elst255"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;255.&lt;/ref&gt; and only on a temporary basis until the Russian Federation would have adopted a new, own Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Elst372"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;372.&lt;/ref&gt; The original USSR executive decree for the 1991 Fundamentals, which laid down the transitory provisions, did not enter in force in Russia, though,&lt;ref name="Elst371"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;371.&lt;/ref&gt; and the old Russian Civil Code remained in force insofar as it didn't contradict the 1991 Fundamentals. Chapter IV of the 1991 Fundamentals was thus in effect for exactly one year until on August 3, 1993, the new Copyright law of Russia entered in force.&lt;ref name="Elst372"/&gt;

== Copyright law of 1993 ==

The copyright law of 1993 was inspired by WIPO model laws and in some of its provisions heavily drew upon the formulations of the Conventions of Berne and Rome. The main innovations were much more detailed regulations on [[neighbouring rights]], the adaptation of the law to new technologies, an expansion of contractual freedom, and provisions on collecting societies.&lt;ref name="Elst394"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;394.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects of copyright ===

Under the 1993 law, copyright covers works of the sciences, literature, and the arts that are the result of creative activity and that exist in objective form. Neither the value nor the purpose of a work is a criterion for copyrightability. An "objective form" is any realization of a work such that it can be perceived by others in any way.&lt;ref name="Elst395"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;395.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere ideas are not copyrightable.&lt;ref name="Elst396"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright is vested in an author automatically upon the creation of a work (§9(1)). Both disclosed and undisclosed works are covered by copyright.&lt;ref name="Elst396"/&gt; "Disclosure" is a concept newly introduced in the copyright law of 1993 to put an end to the ambiguities surrounding the term "publication" in the old [[Soviet copyright law]]. In Soviet copyright, publication included ephemerally making available a work, such as through a performance, a speech, or a broadcast. However, for foreign works protected under Soviet law indirectly through international agreements (in particular the UCC), the definition of "publication" laid down by these agreements (typically the "making available of copies", which excluded ephemeral reproduction and required the physical fixation of a work) was used.&lt;ref name="Elst415"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;415.&lt;/ref&gt; The new law tried to resolve this confusion by using "disclosure" for the broader sense (making accessible of a work to the general public through publication, performance, broadcast, or any other means), and using "publication" generally only in the sense of distribution of copies of a work to the general public.&lt;ref name="Elst415"/&gt;

The law contains a non-exhaustive&lt;ref name="Elst394"/&gt; list of objective forms, which includes oral realizations.&lt;ref name="Elst397fn22"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;397, footnote 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Speeches and jazz improvisations are covered by copyright,&lt;ref name="Elst395fn12"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;395, footnote 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and so are interviews.&lt;ref name="Elst397fn22"/&gt; [[Derivative work]]s and collections or composite works are also eligible to copyright, regardless of whether or not the base works themselves are copyrighted. Among the examples of derivative works listed in the law are translations, abstracts, reviews, dramatizations, and arrangements. For collections, the originality in the selection and presentation of the collected works gives rise to copyright. Collections such as encyclopedias or databases are a special case of composite works, which also include newspapers, magazines, series of scientific works, or other periodicals.&lt;ref name="Elst398"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excluded from copyright are official documents such as laws, judicial decisions, and similar administrative texts, as well as the official translations of such documents. Also deemed uncopyrightable are state symbols and marks (flags, coats of arms, medals, monetary symbols, etc.).&lt;ref name="cl_art_8"&gt;Copyright law of 1993, §8.&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to the symbols of local or municipal authorities.&lt;ref name="sup_court_22"&gt;[[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]], plenum decision no. 15/2006, point 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Works of folklore are also not subject to copyright. Finally, purely informational reports on events and facts are not copyrightable, a provision corresponding to article 2(8) of the Berne Convention. If such a report goes beyond the purely factual and includes any commentary, analysis, prediction or other interpretation it is subject to copyright again.&lt;ref name="Elst400"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;400.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian copyright law of 1993 covered works first disclosed on Russian territory, as well as undisclosed works that existed in objective form within Russia, regardless of the nationality of the author. It also covered works of Russian authors that were first disclosed outside of Russia or that, if undisclosed, existed only abroad.&lt;ref name="Elst481"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;481.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign works (i.e., works not disclosed in Russia or not existing there of an author who did not have Russian citizenship) were subject to the Russian copyright law according to the provisions of the international treaties Russia was a member of. In 2004, article 5, which laid down these definitions, was amended with a new sub-paragraph 5(4) to cover also foreign works that were still copyrighted in their foreign country of origin, but had never been copyrighted in Russia. Such restored copyrights on foreign works were limited to at most the copyright term they enjoyed in the foreign country.&lt;ref name="law2004_1"&gt;Law no. 72-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subjects of copyright ===

The original copyright holder on a work is always the [[natural person]] who created the work. [[Juristic person|Legal entities]] cannot be original copyright holders.&lt;ref name="Elst401"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt; For anonymously published works, the publisher is assumed (until proof to the contrary) to be the author's legal representative who may exercise the copyrights on the work.&lt;ref name="Elst402"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;402.&lt;/ref&gt;

If an employee creates a copyrightable work in the course of his duties vis-à-vis his employer, it is the employee who initially holds the copyright. The law stipulates, however, an automatic transfer of the economic rights to the employer, unless proven otherwise. Employers are required to pay the author royalties for each and every use of the work, but the parties are free to determine this fee and may set it arbitrarily low.&lt;ref name="Elst403f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;403f.&lt;/ref&gt; If the work created is not connected with the duties of the employee, it does not fall under this special rule, even if the work was created on company time.&lt;ref name="Elst403"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;403.&lt;/ref&gt;

If several authors jointly create a work, they are all considered co-authors and initial copyright holders on the work. If their separate contributions to the work can be used independently, each author may use his part of the whole as he sees fit to do, unless there are contractual obligations to the contrary among the co-authors.&lt;ref name="Elst402"/&gt;

Movies are treated separately by the law as part of the category "audiovisual works". Russian law does not require "moving images": according to Elst, a slide show may be a "audiovisual work" if its internal consistency amongst the images is high enough.&lt;ref name="Elst406"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;406.&lt;/ref&gt; The law does, however, require that the images be recorded somehow: a live television broadcast is not an audiovisual work&lt;ref name="Elst406"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;406.&lt;/ref&gt; (but is covered by the broadcaster's [[#Neighbouring rights|neighbouring rights]]). For movies, the law exhaustively enumerates all the initial copyright holders: the director, the author of the script, and the composer of the film music, if any. The law stipulates a transfer of the economic rights relating to publishing the film (including the rights to subtitling and redubbing) to the producer, unless the contract specifies otherwise. Although not considered authors, other individuals such as the camera director or the set designer do have a copyright on their individual works.&lt;ref name="Elst407"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;407.&lt;/ref&gt; They may exploit their works independently of the film: a set designer may authorize the use of the set design for a theatre production, and a composer retains his right to remuneration if the music is performed. If the authors or other co-creators of a movie are employed by the producer, their works are subject to the rules for employee-created works. In this case, ''all'' economic rights are transferred by default to the producer.&lt;ref name="Elst408f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;408f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In collective works such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, but also newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or also databases, the compiler is granted a copyright on the selection or arrangement, if either are creative. The compiler holds the exclusive economic rights on the use of the collection as a whole. Individual contributors keep their copyright on the parts they created, unless they transfer their rights by contract to the compiler.&lt;ref name="Elst411"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;411.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extent of copyrights ===

The 1993 copyright law of Russia recognizes both [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] and [[economic rights]]. The moral rights of an author are:
*The right to paternity: the right to be recognized as an author and to attribution, including the right to have one's name withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Elst414"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;414.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The right to disclosure of the work. Disclosure again has the broad meaning of making the work accessible to the general public with the consent of the author through publication, public display, performance, broadcast, or other means. Publication is the distribution of copies of a work to the general public with the author's consent.&lt;ref name="Elst416"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;416.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The right to withdraw a work (except for employee-created works). The author must indemnify all exploiters of the (already disclosed) work if he chooses to exercise this option.&lt;ref name="Elst418"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;418.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The right to the integrity of the work protects an author's works from distortions or other modifications that would be deemed detrimental to the author's reputation or honor or outright libelous.

The exclusive economic rights, also called patrimonial rights, are:
*The right to reproduction of the work, including the rights to make three-dimensional copies of a two-dimensional work such as a [[blueprint]] (e.g., works of architecture)&lt;ref name="Elst424"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;424.&lt;/ref&gt; or to make two-dimensional copies (such as photos) from a three-dimensional work. In order to exercise this right, the copyright holder is also granted a right to access the original work, even if that physical original has passed into someone else's hands.&lt;ref name="Elst420f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;420f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The right to distribution, including sale and rental.&lt;ref name="Elst421"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;421.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The right to exhibition of a work, i.e., the right to public display.&lt;ref name="Elst423"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;423.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The rights to translation and adaptation.&lt;ref name="Elst424"/&gt;
*The right to communication of the work to the public, which includes public performances and broadcasts, including cable broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Elst425"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;425.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not recognize a general right of an author to receive a remuneration for the use of a work of his, since authors exclusively hold all the economic rights and can enforce a remuneration in the contracts they conclude with third parties. But the law does recognize two specialized remuneration rights:
*The right to remuneration for home copying of audio or audiovisual works. The royalties are levied on records and recording media such as tapes or disks and are collected and distributed by [[collecting society|collecting societies]].&lt;ref name="Elst427"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;427.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[resale right]] (''{{lang|fr|droit de suite}}''), which entitles an author to receive 5% of the new resale price for a work of art if that price is at least 20% higher than the last (re-)sale price. This applies only to works of the visual arts: paintings, sculptures, engravings, comics, and such, but not to photographs or manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Elst428"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;428.&lt;/ref&gt; This right is, like the moral rights, inalienable. It can be inherited.&lt;ref name="Elst429"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;429.&lt;/ref&gt;

These exclusive right of an author on his works are limited by a number of allowed free uses and one case of a compulsory license (home copying of records). All these free uses limit only the economic rights, the moral rights of an author remain in force. Furthermore, any such free use must not be harmful to the normal exploitation of a work and not harm the legitimate interests of authors.&lt;ref name="Elst429"/&gt;

The reproduction of a lawfully disclosed work is allowed for purely personal purposes, without paying royalties and without the consent of the author of the work. Exempted from this are reproductions of architectural works, databases, computer programs (but archive copies, ''i.e.,'' backups are allowed), and musical scores. The copying of whole books, even if done only for personal purposes, is also not a free use but is subject to the author's economic rights.&lt;ref name="Elst430f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;430f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotation is another free use. As in the [[Berne Convention]], reproducing extracts from a legally disclosed work as a quote is allowed, but the amount copied must be more than necessary for the intended purpose (news reporting, teaching, criticism, reviews, and so on).&lt;ref name="Elst432f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;432f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries benefit of two free use provisions. The first allows them to make archival copies of works, and the second permits them to make single reprographic copies for the personal use of their clients.&lt;ref name="Elst433"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;433.&lt;/ref&gt; Several free uses relate to news reporting. Besides the general quotation, the Russian copyright law also has a provision that allows articles on current issues of economy, politics, social matters, or religion that have been published in newspapers or magazines to be freely reproduced by other newspapers.&lt;ref name="Elst434"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;434.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another free use concerns the [[freedom of panorama]]: works of the visual arts, photography, or architecture that are permanently installed in publicly accessible places (which includes museums or exhibition halls)&lt;ref name="Elst432fn268"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;432, footnote 268. Also see article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code (in force as of January 1, 2008), clarifying this.&lt;/ref&gt; may be reproduced if the work is not the main subject of the reproduction and if the reproduction is used only non-commercially.&lt;ref name="Elst432_433"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;432f. See also article 21 of the 1993 Copyright law, or article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code (in force as of January 1, 2008). Article 21 of the 1993 law states that reproduction is allowed, ''"except where portrayal of the work is the basic object of such reproduction [...] or where portrayal of the work is used for commercial purposes."''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neighbouring rights ===

The neighbouring rights, introduced for the first time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law, following the provisions of the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]] and in some cases also the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]] (WPPT).&lt;ref name="Elst457"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; The law covers performances, phonograms, and broadcasts (including cable broadcasts). Neighbouring rights are, like the copyrights, automatic and not subject to [[copyright formalities|formalities]] except the observance of any rights of the authors (or performers) of the works performed, recorded, or broadcast.&lt;ref name="Elst457"/&gt;

Performers are granted the exclusive rights to their performance, including a right to remuneration for any uses of a performance or a recording thereof. Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations]], performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only.&lt;ref name="Elst459"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;459.&lt;/ref&gt; For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the phonogram producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.&lt;ref name="Elst461_465"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;461, 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonogram producers have exclusive rights on the use of their phonograms, again including a right to remuneration. Their exclusive rights cover the reproduction of the phonogram, the right to distribute the phonogram by sale or rental, and the right to import copies of the phonogram. The distribution right extends only to the [[first sale]] of a copy. The law does not recognize a non-commercial public lending right on phonograms.&lt;ref name="Elst464"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;464.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both artists and phonogram producers have a right to remuneration for secondary uses of a phonogram made for commercial purposes, such as public performance or terrestrial transmission of the recording. A collecting society shall collect the royalties for these uses and distributes them equally amongst the performers and phonogram producers.&lt;ref name="Elst465"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;465. See also §39 of the law.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duration of copyrights ===

The 1993 copyright law reaffirmed the prolonged copyright term of generally 50 years from the 1991 Fundamentals, applicable to all kinds of works. Works of known authors were copyrighted until 50 years after the author's death (50 years ''p.m.a.'').&lt;ref name="Elst436_27_1"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;436; see also §27(1) of the law.&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous or [[pseudonym]]ous works were copyrighted until fifty years after the first disclosure, unless the identity of the author became known during that time and the term of 50 years ''p.m.a.'' thus applied.&lt;ref name="Elst437_27_3"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;437; see also §27(3) of the law.&lt;/ref&gt; For works with several authors, the copyright term was calculated from the death of the longest-living of the co-authors.&lt;ref name="Elst436_27_4"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;436; see also §27(4) of the law.&lt;/ref&gt; For authors who had worked during or fought in the [[Great Patriotic War]], the duration of copyrights was extended by four years.&lt;ref name="Elst441"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;441; see also §27(5) of the law. The [https://archive.is/20120804203534/http://www.literati.ru/npa_v.php?id=21 original Russian text of the 1993 law] says "{{lang|ru|В случае, если автор работал во время Великой Отечественной войны или участвовал в ней, то срок охраны авторских прав, предусмотренный настоящей статьей, увеличивается на 4 года.}}" Although "{{lang|ru|работа}}" means "work", some English translations of the law (for instance, the one at CIPR given in the sources below) render this as "authors who were in service during..." Elst also states it applied to works of authors "who worked during or participated in" the Great Patriotic War.&lt;/ref&gt; For posthumously published works, copyrights were defined to last until fifty years after the publication,&lt;ref name="Elst438"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;438; see also §27(5) of the law.&lt;/ref&gt; and for posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] authors, the fifty-year term began running at the date of the rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Elst438ff"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;438ff; §27(5) of the law. Elst points out that for authors who were rehabilitated while still alive, the term of 50 years ''p.m.a.'' was to be applied.&lt;/ref&gt; All terms were to be calculated from January 1 following the date the fact occurred that caused the term to begin running.&lt;ref name="Elst436_27_6"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;436; see also §27(6) of the law.&lt;/ref&gt; The moral rights to authorship, name, and integrity of the work were defined to be perpetual.&lt;ref name="Elst442_27_1"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;442; see also §27(1) of the law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the neighbouring rights, the term of protection was fifty years since the original performance or broadcast. For phonograms, the term was fifty years since the first publication, or fifty years since the fixation of the phonogram if not published within that time.&lt;ref name="Elst469"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;469, mentioning that this term was longer than the 20-year minimum required by the Rome Convention and corresponded to the term applied in most Western European countries.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules as for copyright concerning posthumously published works or authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War or who were posthumously rehabilitated existed also for the neighbouring rights.&lt;ref name="Elst470"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;470.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the 50-year term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted.

=== Contractual regulations ===

The copyright law of 1993 also contained, similar to other European copyright laws, contract provisions regulating the transfer of copyrights.&lt;ref name="Elst445ff"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;445ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Contracts have to be in writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. Shrink-wrap licenses for software are allowed.&lt;ref name="Elst454fn55"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;454, citing Gavrilov to clarify that for publication in electronic media, contracts must be in written form.&lt;/ref&gt; The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the resale right, or the right to remuneration for home-copying.&lt;ref name="Elst445"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;445.&lt;/ref&gt; In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so.&lt;ref name="Elst448"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;448.&lt;/ref&gt; Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given as a percentage of the gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply.&lt;ref name="Elst449f"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;449f.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations.&lt;ref name="Elst453"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;453.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the contract explicitly includes a sub-licensing permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.&lt;ref name="Elst454"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;454.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retroactivity ===

The implementation act for the new copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, stated that the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated.&lt;ref name="impl_act1993"&gt;Law 5352-1/1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that the new copyright law applied to all works on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993.&lt;ref name="Elst526"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;526.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about the precise meaning of this.&lt;ref name="Elst525ff"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;525ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Russian scholars agreed that this provision from the implementation act made the law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights on Soviet works on which the much shorter copyright terms from Soviet times had already expired.&lt;ref name="Elst526"/&gt; This also applied to neighbouring rights on performances, phonograms, and broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Savelyeva25"&gt;Savelyeva&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; Gavrilov presented a dissenting opinion, stating that while this might have been the intention, the wording did not actually have that effect.&lt;ref name="Elst527"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;527.&lt;/ref&gt; Elst argued that the 1993 law would have been inconsistent and contain several meaningless provisions if it were not retroactive.&lt;ref name="Elst528"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;528. In particular, Elst mentions two examples: first, neighbouring rights did not exist prior to 1992 in Russia or the USSR, but the law contained (a) a term extension for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, and (b) a provision for posthumously rehabilitated authors: such provisions made only sense if the law retroactively granted neighbouring rights, even though at the time these works were created and the authors lived, no such rights existed at all. Second, Elst mentions that the provisions concerning posthumous rehabilitations would have largely been meaningless if the law were not retroactive, as most such rehabilitations occurred in the late 1950s under [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] or in the late 1980s under Gorbachev, i.e., before the 1993 law became effective.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the general consensus was that the Russian 1993 law was retroactive.&lt;ref name="Pilch2004_93"&gt;Pilch (2004),&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;93. Otherwise, the copyright on many older Soviet works would not have been restored by the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] in 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In a ruling in 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]] confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired.&lt;ref name="sup_court_34"&gt;Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, plenum decision no. 15/2006, point 34. Point 37 confirms the retroactivity also for neighbouring rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1993 copyright law, all Russian or Soviet works from the RSFSR published in 1943 or later, as well as works of authors who died in 1943 or later, became thus copyrighted in Russia in 1993. Because of the term extension of four years for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, even some earlier works became subject to copyright.&lt;ref name="Savelyeva25"/&gt; In the case of works formerly copyrighted under Soviet law, this amounted to a restoration of copyright; for the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively.&lt;ref name="Elst533"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;533.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the old Soviet legislation largely obsolete in Russia; the former laws remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.&lt;ref name="Savelyeva25"/&gt;

Examples of works that became copyrighted again in 1993 include the works of [[Boris Pilniak]] (executed in 1938, rehabilitated in 1957), [[Isaac Babel]] (executed 1940, rehabilitated 1954), or also [[Osip Mandelstam]] (died 1938, rehabilitated 1956/1987).&lt;ref name="Elst532f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;532f.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors on whose works copyright was restored were [[Anna Akhmatova]] (died 1966), [[Vera Mukhina]] (died 1953, sculptor of the statue "[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]"), [[Aleksey Shchusev]] (died 1949, architect of the [[Lenin Mausoleum]]), [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]] (died 1945), and many others.&lt;ref name="Elst532f"/&gt; An extreme example is [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'': the work was first published posthumously in 1966. At that time, the Soviet copyright term of then 15 years ''p.m.a.'' had already expired as Bulgakov had died in 1940. The new Russian copyright law from 1993 placed this work under copyright again, because the 50-year term was calculated from 1966 on.&lt;ref name="Elst533"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;533.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amendments of the 1993 Copyright law ===

On July 19, 1995, Federal Law 110-FL changed the copyright law, strengthening the measures for protecting copyrights against infringements. Law 110-FL also made corresponding amendments in the [[Criminal Code of the Russian Federation]] and in related laws.&lt;ref name="Elst385"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental decree no.&amp;nbsp;524 of May 29, 1998, which was published on June 16, 1998, clarified that for movies created before August 3, 1992, the film studios were no longer considered the authors, as had been the case under the old [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union|Soviet law]]. Instead, the authors of these cinematographic works were the natural persons identified in the 1993 law as such.&lt;ref name="Elst531"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;531. It follows that the copyright term on Soviet films must be calculated as 50 (or 70) years after the death of the last surviving author, plus four years for authors who had worked or fought during the [[Great Patriotic War]]; not as 50 or 70 years since publication, as would have been the case if the studios, as juristic persons, still had been considered the authors.&lt;/ref&gt; The decree explicitly declared that these authors were entitled to receive royalties for uses of these films (broadcast, whether by cable or wireless, reproduction, distribution (including rental), and showing to the public) and defined a remuneration schedule expressed in percentages of the income generated by the use of the works.&lt;ref name="decree524"&gt;Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation no.&amp;nbsp;524 of May 29, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The decree also clarified that the copyright on such Soviet films was subject to the rules of the 1993 law: the authors were the initial rights holders, and there was a presumption of a transfer of rights to the studios unless there existed an agreement to the contrary. (See also "[[#Subjects of copyright|Subjects of copyright]]" above.)&lt;ref name="Elst531"/&gt;&lt;ref name="decree524"/&gt;

On August 8, 2004, the copyright law of Russia was amended by federal law no. 72-FL, by which the general copyright term was extended from 50 to 70 years. This term extension applied only to works that were still copyrighted in Russia in 2004.&lt;ref name="law2004_1"/&gt;

The same law also modified the provisions on the copyright of foreign works.&lt;ref name="law2004_1"/&gt; It added an article 5(4) to the law that defined that a foreign work was eligible to copyright in Russia if its copyright had not expired in the source country and it had not fallen into the public domain in Russia through the expiry of its copyright term.&lt;ref name="law2004_1"/&gt; Previously, foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC), had not been copyrighted at all in the Soviet Union or in Russia,&lt;ref name="Elst83"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; even after Russia had joined the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in 1995. When Russia had signed the Berne Convention, it had made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention by stating that it would not consider the Berne Convention applicable to any works in the public domain in Russia.&lt;ref name="berne_decree"&gt;Russian Federation; decree no. 1224 from 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bc_reservation"&gt;WIPO: ''Berne Notification 162.''&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign pre-1973 works thus remained uncopyrighted in Russia, although they should have become subject to copyright according to article 18(2) of the Berne Convention because that article only exempted works that once ''were'' copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst493"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;493.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia faced severe criticism for this, especially from Western countries.&lt;ref name="Elst489"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;489.&lt;/ref&gt; The new article 5(4) of the Russian copyright law was supposed to resolve the situation by restoring copyright on such foreign works and making Russia's copyright law fully compliant with the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="podshibikhin"&gt;Podshibikhin &amp; Leontiev argued in 2002 that the continued application of the non-retroactivity reservation was becoming a problem in Russia's international relations and were better ended. They then explain the necessary modifications of the 1993 law to introduce the copyright restoration as it is prescribed by the Berne Convention. Their proposed modifications coincide with the changes that were indeed made in 2004 by law no. 72-FL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wto_acc_rus"&gt;WTO, ''Report of the Working Party on the Accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization''; p.&amp;nbsp;318, paragraph 1242.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the common practice in Russia did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were still commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.&lt;ref name="budylin8"&gt;Budylin &amp; Osipova,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other provisions of law 72-FL amended the 1993 copyright law of Russia in several areas, especially concerning [[neighbouring rights]], to make the legislation compliant with the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]].&lt;ref name="boikova"&gt;Boikova, ''Interim Draft Report''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008&amp;ndash;present: Part IV of the Civil Code ==
Since its foundation as an independent successor state of the former Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had been engaged in a large legislative project of developing a new [[Civil Code]]. Part I of this new [[Civil Code of the Russian Federation]] was [[Sign into law#Approval|signed into law]] on November 30, 1994, by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and became effective on January 1, 1995.&lt;ref name="Elst388"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;388.&lt;/ref&gt; In article 2, it situates the copyright law within the [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]]. Copyright legislation was originally planned to be included in part III of this new Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Elst389"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;389.&lt;/ref&gt; Several drafts for new chapters on copyrights were prepared, but the matter proved so difficult that part III of the Civil Code was delayed several times. It was finally adopted on November 26, 2001 without the chapter on [[intellectual property]], which was postponed to part IV.&lt;ref name="Elst391"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV of the Civil Code took several years to work out and was submitted to the [[State Duma]] in July 2006.&lt;ref name="budylin15"&gt;Budylin &amp; Osipova,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft of the new intellectual property legislation was heavily criticized for being too unclear and for conflicting with Russia's international obligations, and also for introducing several untested novelties.&lt;ref name="budylin15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cipr_civil_code"&gt;CIPR, ''Russia Proposes New Civil Code''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months, about 500 changes were made to the draft,&lt;ref name="budylin15"/&gt; before it passed its final reading in the Duma on November 24, 2006.&lt;ref name="rian"&gt;RIA Novosti, November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After it had also passed through the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], part IV of the new Russian Civil Code, containing articles 1225 to 1551,&lt;ref name="ecomash"&gt;Ecomash, December 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; was signed into law as Federal Law no. 230-FL&lt;ref name="law2008_230_fl"&gt;Law 230-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Vladimir Putin]] on December 18, 2006.&lt;ref name="budylin15"/&gt; The implementation act (Federal Law no. 231-FL)&lt;ref name="law2008_231_fl"&gt;Law 231-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on the same day;&lt;ref name="ecomash"/&gt; it declared part IV of the Civil Code to enter in force on January 1, 2008 with the effect of invalidating and replacing all previous intellectual property legislation.&lt;ref name="femida"&gt;Femida Audit, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV of the Civil Code was a comprehensive [[intellectual property]] legislation. It contained the copyright law proper in chapters 70 ([[authors' rights]]) and 71 (neighbouring rights); chapter 69 contained general provisions also applicable to copyright. Other chapters dealt with [[patent law]] (chapter 72), the protection of [[plant breeders' rights|breeders' rights]] (ch. 73), of integrated circuits ([[mask work]]s; ch. 74), of [[trade secrets]] (know-how; ch. 75), and also of [[trade mark]]s, [[brand]]s, and [[geographical indication]]s (ch. 76).&lt;ref name="law2008_230_fl"/&gt; Chapter 77 detailed rules for technological applications, in particular those developed on a federal budget.&lt;ref name="law2008_230_fl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="femida"/&gt; A provision for the protection of [[domain name]]s was removed from the draft before it was adopted.&lt;ref name="budylin16"&gt;Budylin &amp; Osipova,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the new intellectual property legislation was a complete rewrite from scratch and was structured quite differently than the previous 1993 Copyright Act, there were actually only minor changes in substance concerning copyright proper in the new legislation. With the exception of the Implementation Act discussed below, most changes were clarifications of omissions or of disputed points in the 1993 law. Among the true novelties introduced by the new legislation in the area of copyrights were a [[publication right]] (a copyright granted to the publisher of a previously unpublished, uncopyrighted work with a period of 25 years from the publication),&lt;ref name="editio_princeps"&gt;Law 230-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of December 18, 2006, articles 1337 to 1344.&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of two kinds of contracts: one for copyright transfers, and licenses for granting usage rights.&lt;ref name="femida"/&gt; Newly, ''gratis'' licences were explicitly allowed (article 1235).&lt;ref name="golovanov_5"&gt;Golovanov, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; A subtle change concerned the calculation of the copyright term for posthumously published works, which began newly from the ''disclosure'' instead of from the ''publication''. (See [[#Objects of copyright|above]] for the difference.) For a work that was disclosed during the author's lifetime, the copyright term of 70 years thus runs from the year the author died (or was rehabilitated, if the rehabilitation was posthumous), even if the work is published only later.&lt;ref name="alexseyevna"&gt;Alexseyevna&lt;/ref&gt; The new legislation also no longer contained a provision for a "''domaine publique payant''" as the 1993 Copyright Act did in its article 28(3).&lt;ref name="golovanov_5p"&gt;Golovanov, p.&amp;nbsp;5. ''Domaine publique payant'' is the concept that users of works that are in the public domain through expiration of the copyright term have to pay (reduced) royalties to the state. Although the 1993 Copyright Act did contain such a provision, it was never enforced in Russia. Some other countries also have such provisions in their copyright laws.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Implementation Act 231-FL made the new legislation applicable also to legal relations from before the coming in force of the new law, as far as new rights granted by the new law were concerned (retroactivity).&lt;ref name="femida"/&gt; In article 5 of the implementation act, the new law was made applicable to all new works, as well as to new rights that arose on pre-existing works. Existing rights on already existing works were henceforth governed by the rules of the new law, but initial authorship was to be determined by the laws in effect at the time a work was created.&lt;ref name="law2008_231_fl_art5"&gt;Law 231-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of December 18, 2006, article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the implementation act specified that the 70-year copyright term was applicable in all cases where the old 50-year copyright term had not yet expired by January 1, 1993, and to all cases from before August 3, 1993 where a legal entity was the copyright holder - this applies to "whole works" in the form of cinematographic, television, radio works, as well as print periodicals and compilations, which were created by a state corporation, but individual authors such as script writers, artists, composers etc. retain copyright for their respective parts of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 483-487 of the Civil Code of the Russian SFSR&lt;/ref&gt; In this latter case, the copyright was to expire 70 years after the work was first lawfully disclosed, or 70 years after the creation of the work, if the work was undisclosed.&lt;ref name="law2008_231_fl_art6"&gt;Law 231-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of December 18, 2006, article 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the 70-year copyright term had applied only to works whose 50-year term had not yet expired in 2004,&lt;ref name="law2004_1"/&gt; and thus the new Part IV of the Civil Code removed a number of works from the public domain, namely all those where the 50-year term had expired in the years 1994-2003: these became copyrighted again (with a 70-year term) under the new intellectual property legislation.&lt;ref name="alexseyevna"/&gt;

Russia had committed in a trade agreement with the U.S. in November 2006 to ensure that new legislation, including part IV of the Civil Code, would be fully [[TRIPS]] compliant, even if such legislation was passed before an eventual accession of Russia to the WTO.&lt;ref name="ustr"&gt;U.S. Trade Representative, ''Factsheet...'', November 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="golovanov_3"&gt;Golovanov, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; After part IV of the Civil Code had entered in force on January 1, 2008, the Russian Federation also acceded on November 5, 2008, to the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]]&lt;ref name="wct_rf"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=2044C WIPO Copyright Treaty, Contracting Parties, Russian Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914152813/http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=2044C |date=2012-09-14 }}''.

'''Data localization''' or '''data residency''' law requires data about a nations' citizens or residents be collected, processed, and/or stored inside the country, often before being transferred internationally, and usually transferred only after meeting local privacy or data protection laws, such as giving the user notice of how the information will be used and obtaining their consent.&lt;ref name="DataLocalizationLaws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Localization Laws: an Emerging Global Trend|publisher=[[Jurist]]|date=January 6, 2017|url=http://www.jurist.org/hotline/2017/01/Courtney-Bowman-data-localization.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data localization builds upon the concept of [[data sovereignty]] that regulates certain data types by the laws applicable to the data subject or processor. While [[data sovereignty]] may require that records about a nation's citizens or residents follow its personal or financial data processing laws, data localization goes a step further in requiring that initial collection, processing, and storage occur first within the national boundaries. In some cases, data about a nation's citizens or residents must also be deleted from foreign systems before being removed from systems in the data subject's nation.&lt;ref name="DataLocalizationLaws" /&gt;

==Motivations and concerns==
The push for data localization greatly increased after revelations by [[Edward Snowden]] regarding United States [[counter-terrorism]] surveillance programs in 2013.&lt;ref name="DataNationalism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Nationalism|publisher=[[Emory University School of Law|Emory Law]]|year=2015|url=http://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-64/issue-3/articles/data-nationalism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RussiaPrimer"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Primer on Russia's New Data Localization Law|publisher=Proskauer|date=August 27, 2015|url=http://privacylaw.proskauer.com/2015/08/articles/international/a-primer-on-russias-new-data-localization-law/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, various governments in Europe and around the world have expressed the desire to be able to control the flow of residents' data through technology. Some governments are accused of and some openly admit to using data localization laws as a way to surveil their own populaces or to boost local economic activity.&lt;ref name="DataNationalism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Risky Business: Data Localization|work=[[Forbes]]|date=February 19, 2015|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/02/19/risky-business-data-localization/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley tech execs: Surveillance threatens digital economy|publisher=[[Palo Alto Online]]|date=October 9, 2014|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2014/10/09/tech-execs-surveillance-is-harming-digital-economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology companies and multinational organizations often oppose data localization laws because they impact efficiencies gained by regional aggregation of data centers and unification of services across national boundaries.&lt;ref name="DataNationalism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google Pushes Back Against Data Localization|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 24, 2014|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/google-pushes-back-against-data-localization/?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vendors, such as Microsoft, have used data storage locale controls as a differentiating feature in their cloud services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Data Localization Kill the Internet?|publisher=eCommerce Times|date=February 10, 2014|url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/79946.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International treaties and laws==
While the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] included language that would have prohibited data localization restrictions among participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trans-Pacific Partnership will ban data localization laws|publisher=Fed Scoop|date=October 5, 2015|url=https://www.fedscoop.com/tpp-will-ban-data-localization-laws/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the treaty was abandoned and never took effect.

After Germany and France either passed or nearly passed data localization laws, the European Union was considering restrictions on data localization laws in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ansip promises EU rules on data flows by autumn|publisher=Euractiv|date=October 5, 2017|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/ansip-promises-eu-rules-on-data-flows-by-autumn/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Commission eyes an end to data localization in EU|publisher=[[International Association of Privacy Professionals|IAPP]]|date=January 12, 2017|url=https://iapp.org/news/a/european-commission-eyes-an-end-to-data-localization-in-eu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data localization laws are often seen as [[Protectionism|protectionist]] and would thus violate [[European Union competition law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">In the field of [[patent]]s, the phrase "to '''design around'''" means to invent an alternative to a patented [[invention]] that does not infringe the patent’s [[Claim (patent)|claim]]s.  The phrase can also refer to the invention itself.

Design-arounds are considered to be one of the benefits of patent law.  By providing monopoly rights to inventors in exchange for disclosing how to make and use their inventions, others are given both the information and incentive to invent competitive alternatives that design around the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://works.bepress.com/katherine_strandburg/4 |last=Strandburg |first=Katherine |year=2004 |title=What Does the Public Get?: Experimental Use and the Patent Bargain |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |volume=2004 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[vaccine]]s, for example, design-arounds are considered fairly easy.  It is often possible to use the original patent as a guide for developing an alternative that does not infringe the original patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nc33ZS5nRa0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;ots=N1uqRKKYJd&amp;sig=lJPt-TOjqdtnPvbXYN2JzQNeoCs#PPA91,M1 |last=Kremer |first=Michael |chapter=Creating Markets for New Vaccines –Part II: Design Issues |title=Innovation Policy and the Economy |volume=I |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=0-262-60041-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design-arounds can be a defense against [[patent troll]]s.

'''e-participation''' (''also written'' '''eParticipation''' ''and'' '''e-Participation''') is the term referring to "[[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]-supported participation in processes involved in government and governance".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Processes may concern administration, service delivery, decision making and policy making. E-participation is hence closely related to [[e-government]] and [[e-governance]] [[participation (decision making)|participation]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Jafarkarimi; A. T. H. Sim; R. Saadatdoost and J. M. Hee (2014). The Impact of ICT on Reinforcing Citizens’ Role in Government Decision Making, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Vol.4 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the term has emerged as citizen interests have received less attention than those of the service providers in e-government development. It also emerged as the need to distinguish between the roles of [[citizen]] and [[customer]] has become more pressing.

A more detailed definition sees e-participation as "the use of information and communication technologies to broaden and deepen political participation by enabling citizens to connect with one another and with their elected representatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintosh|first=Ann|date=2004|title=Characterizing E-Participation in Policy-Making|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.98.6150&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=In the Proceedings of the Thirty-Seventh Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition includes all stakeholders in democratic decision-making processes and not only citizen related top-down government initiatives. So e-participation can be seen as part of [[e-democracy]], the use of ICT by governments in general used by elected officials, media, political parties and interest groups, civil society organizations, international governmental organizations, or citizens/voters within any of the political processes of states/regions, nations, and local and global communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicus.net/articles/edempublicnetwork.html|title=E-Democracy, E-Governance and Public Net-Work|last=Clift|first=Steven|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of e-participation processes results from the large number of different participation areas, involved stakeholders, levels of engagement, and stages in policy making. {{Harv|Fraser|2006|p=chapter 2}}.

== History ==
The term emanated in the early 2000s and draws generally on three developments.

# The general development in [[CSCW]] (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) and [[groupware]] directed towards collaborative environments to support human ICT-mediated interaction, both work-related and social.
# Developments in [[e-democracy]] since the late 1990s, where interest rapidly evolved from e-voting to several forms of ICT supported and enabled interaction between governments and citizens, including not only direct ones such as consultations, lobbying, [[internet petition|petitioning]] and polling but also ones pursued outside of government itself, including electioneering, campaigning, and community informatics. To a large extent, the institutional framework conditions of the chosen democratic model define at which part of the democratic processes participation is permitted (such as direct or representative democracy, or any intermediate forms).&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, Martin (2007). [http://www.martinhilbert.net/democracy.html "Digital Processes and Democratic Theory: Dynamics, risks and opportunities that arise when democratic institutions meet digital information and communication technologies]." open-access online book.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The development in [[e-government]] towards increasingly complex service delivery. Complex services require considerable interaction including searching, selecting options based on multiple criteria, calculating outcomes, notifications, inquiries, complaints, and many other activities. There are several ICT tools for such tasks, ranging from FAQs to call centres, but there is a need to coordinate all these into user-friendly but powerful toolsets for client-organization encounters. Because interaction in such contexts is complex, and because goals have to be reached, the arenas where it takes places becomes social arenas for ICT-supported participation.

== On the definition ==
The term 'participation' means taking part in joint activities for the purpose of reaching a common goal. This encompasses both trivial situations in which participation mainly has a technical meaning, ”doing things together”. For example, a [[football]] team needs 11 players, and dancing often requires two or more people acting in a coordinated manner. But participation, even in trivial situations, also has a goal-oriented aspect which means decision making and control are involved. Participation in [[political science]] and theory of [[management]] refers to direct public participation in political, economical or management decisions. The two are not completely separated but belong on a spectrum of complexity and context. When participation becomes complicated, decision making becomes necessary. Hence, any participatory process is potentially important for the rule system governing the activities. In terms of points 2 and 3 above, this means that when service processes become complex, the implementation of them will not be in all details based on political decisions but also on what is found to be practical.

Instead of taking in and accepting [[knowledge]] as is disseminated by the media and government, by participating, one becomes an active citizen and further contributes to a [[democratic society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Attention, and Other 21st-Century Social Media Literacies|url = http://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/10/attention-and-other-21stcentury-social-media-literacies|website = er.educause.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such practical doings become implemented in government (e)service systems, they will affect decision making, as many changes will later be hard to make simply because existing procedures are implemented in ICT systems and government [[Institution|agencies’]] procedures. There are many theories dealing with institutionalization, for example [[structuration theory]], [[institutional theory]], and [[actor-network theory]]. These theories all, in different ways, deal with how "ways of doing things" become established or rejected, and how those that become established increasingly affect the ways we "normally" do things.

== Models and tools ==
A number of tools and models have emerged as part of [[Web 2.0]] that can be used or inspire the design of architecture for e-participation. In particular, "the emergence of online communities oriented toward the creation of useful products suggests that it may be possible to design socially mediating technology that support public-government collaborations" {{Harv|Kriplean|Beschastnikh|Borning|McDonald|Zachry|2009}}.

=== Crowdsourcing ===
To demonstrate e-participation at work, one can turn to one of its types - [[Government crowdsourcing|crowdsourcing]]. This is generally defined as the enlisting of a group of humans to solve problems via the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electronic Government and Electronic Participation: Joint Proceedings of Ongoing Research, PhD Papers, Posters and Workshops of IFIP EGOV and EPart 2016|last=Scholl|first=H.J.|last2=Glassey|first2=O.|last3=Janssen|first3=M.F.W.H.A.|publisher=IOS Press|year=2016|isbn=9781614996699|location=Amsterdam|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that this platform is able to collect human resources from the most unlikely and remotest places, contributing to the general store of [[intellectual capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business|last=Howe|first=Jeff|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780307396204|location=New York|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing can be applied in different stages of the [[Policy|policy-making]] process and these could transpire on the information, consultation, and active participation levels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citizen E-Participation in Urban Governance: Crowdsourcing and Collaborative Creativity|last=Silva|first=Carlos|publisher=IGI Global|year=2013|isbn=9781466641709|location=Hershey, PA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the information level, there is a one-way relationship, wherein the participants receive information from the government. The consultation process entails a two-way interaction where citizens already provide their inputs, feedback, and reactions. Finally, active participation can refer to the deeper participatory involvement where citizens directly contribute in the formulation of policy content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This level of e-participation is increasingly being practiced through tools such as [[online petition]], e-referendum, e-panels, citizen e-juries, and [[participatory GIS]], among others.

== European eParticipation actions ==
=== European eParticipation Preparatory Action ===
'''eParticipation''' is the Preparatory Action{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/implementation/prep_action/index_en.htm|title=eGovernment &amp; Digital Public Services|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; lasts{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} for three years (2006–2008). The EU is taking the lead in using online tools to improve the legislative process for its citizens. '''eParticipation''' which launched on January 1, 2007 will run as a series of linked projects which each contribute to a greater awareness and involvement by citizens in the legislation process from initial drafting to implementation at a regional and local level.

The individual projects will concentrate on ensuring that the legislative language and process is more transparent, understandable and accessible to citizens. In addition the projects emphasis on the communication of legislation will be used to enhance and grow citizens' involvement and contribution in the process of creating and implementing the legislation.

So far, 21 projects have been funded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu-participation.eu/ European eParticipation web]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Parliament]], national parliaments and local and regional authorities are actively involved. State-of-the-art ICT tools are being tested to facilitate the writing of legal texts, including translation into different languages, and the drafting of amendments as well as making the texts easier for non-specialists to find and understand. New digital technologies are also being used to give citizens easier access to information and more opportunity to influence decisions that affect their lives. A report {{Harv|Charalabidis|Koussouris|Kipenis|2009}}, which was published as a MOMENTUM white paper, highlights the major facts and figures of those projects while providing some initial policy recommendations for future use.

=== European eParticipation Actions ===
The [[European Commission]] has now launched a number of actions aiming at further advancing the work of supporting eParticipation.

Examples:
* [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] : ICT Challenge 7 : Objective ICT-2009.7.3 ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/challenge7-governance_en.html|title=Archives - CORDIS - European Commission|author=|date=|website=cordis.europa.eu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] has launched some call in this area to finance researches. Currently the Integrated Program Future Policy Modelling (FUPOL) is the largest project in this domain. [http://www.fupol.eu FUPOL]
* [http://ec.europa.eu/cip/index_en.htm CIP] ICT Policy Support Programme (or ICT PSP). The European project has open a call in the programme CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Framework) on the Theme 3: ICT for government and governance

'''''Edwards v. Aguillard''''', 482 U.S. 578 (1987), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the constitutionality of teaching [[creationism]]. The Court considered a [[Louisiana]] law requiring that where [[evolution|evolutionary science]] was taught in public schools, [[creation science]] must also be taught. The Court ruled that this law violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. It also held that "teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction."&lt;ref name="EdwardsOpinion"&gt;{{ussc|name=Edwards v. Aguillard|volume=482|page=578|pin=|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In support of Aguillard, 72 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html Edwards v. Aguillard: Amicus Curiae Brief of 72 Nobel Laureates]&lt;/ref&gt; 17 state academies of science, and seven other scientific organizations filed [[amicus brief]]s that described creation science as being composed of religious tenets.

==Background==
{{main|Creation-evolution controversy|Science versus religion}}
Modern American [[creationism]] arose from the [[theology|theological]] split over [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] [[higher criticism]] and its rejection by the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian movement]], which promoted [[Biblical literalism]] and, post 1920, took up the anti-evolution cause led by [[William Jennings Bryan]]. The teaching of [[evolution]] had become a common part of the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] curriculum, but his campaign was based on the idea that "[[Darwinism]]" had caused German militarism and was a threat to traditional religion and morality. Several states passed [[legislation]] to ban or restrict the teaching of evolution. The [[Tennessee]] [[Butler Act]] was tested in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and continued in effect with the result that evolution was not taught in many schools.&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ|title=Biological design in science classrooms|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|volume=104|issue=suppl_1|pages=8669–76|date=May 2007|pmid=17494747|pmc=1876445|doi=10.1073/pnas.0701505104|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17494747|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8669S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States sought to catch up in science during the 1960s with new teaching standards, which reintroduced evolution, the [[creation science]] movement arose, presenting what was claimed to be scientific evidence supporting [[young Earth creationism]]. Attempts were made to reintroduce legal bans, but the Supreme Court ruled that bans on teaching [[evolutionary biology]] are unconstitutional as they violate the [[establishment clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which forbids the government from advancing a particular religion.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt;

In the early 1980s, several states attempted to introduce creationism alongside the teaching of evolution, and the Louisiana legislature passed a law, authored by [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Bill Keith (Louisiana politician)|Bill P. Keith]] of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]], entitled the "Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act."&lt;ref&gt;Justice Brennan [http://legis.la.gov/lss/lss.asp?doc=80458 misnamed the statute] as the "Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science in Public School Instruction Act" in the majority decision.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act did not require teaching either creationism or evolution, but did require that, if evolutionary science was taught, then "creation science" must be taught as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=80462 RS 17:286.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists lobbied aggressively for the law. The stated purpose of the Act was to protect "academic freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=80459 RS 17:286.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Counsel for the state later admitted at the Supreme Court oral argument that the "legislature may not [have] used the term 'academic freedom' in the correct legal sense. They might have &lt;nowiki&gt;[had]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in mind, instead, a basic concept of fairness; teaching all the evidence." [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[David C. Treen]] signed the bill into law in 1981.

The District Court and Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Louisiana, finding that its actual purpose in enacting the statute was to promote the religious doctrine of "creation science". An Arkansas District Court previously held in a 1982 decision in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' that a similar "balanced treatment" statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Arkansas did not appeal the loss. Creationists believed the statute at issue in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' had a better chance of passing constitutional muster, and so Louisiana appealed its loss in the trial and appellate courts to the Supreme Court.

==Opinion==
On June 19, 1987 the Supreme Court, in a seven-to-two majority opinion written by Justice [[William J. Brennan]], ruled that the Act constituted an unconstitutional infringement on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, based on the three-pronged [[Lemon v. Kurtzman|''Lemon'' test]], which is:
# ''The government's action must have a legitimate secular purpose;''
# ''The government's action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion;'' and
# ''The government's action must not result in an "excessive entanglement" of the government and religion.''

The Supreme Court held that the Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose (first part of the above ''Lemon'' test), since (a) the Act does not further its stated secular purpose of "protecting academic freedom", and (b) the Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.&lt;ref name="EdwardsOpinion"/&gt;

However, it did note that alternative scientific theories could be taught:
:We do not imply that a legislature could never require that scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories be taught. . . . Teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.&lt;ref name="EdwardsOpinion"/&gt;

The Court found that, although the Louisiana legislature had stated that its purpose was to "protect academic freedom", that purpose was dubious because the Act gave Louisiana teachers no freedom they did not already possess and instead limited their ability to determine what scientific principles should be taught. Because it was unconvinced by the state's proffered secular purpose, the Court went on to find that the legislature had a "preeminent religious purpose in enacting this statute".&lt;ref name="EdwardsOpinion"/&gt;

==Dissent==
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], joined by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], dissented, accepting the Act's stated purpose of "protecting academic freedom" as a sincere and legitimate secular purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Evolution and Creation Science|title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States|edition=2nd|editor=Kermit L. Hall|first=Carol|last=Weisbrod|year=2005|isbn=9780195176612|publisher=Oxford|page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They interpreted the term "academic freedom" to refer to "students' freedom from indoctrination", in this case their freedom "to decide for themselves how life began, based upon a fair and balanced presentation of the scientific evidence". However, they also criticized the first prong of the Lemon test, noting that "to look for the sole purpose of even a single legislator is probably to look for something that does not exist".&lt;ref name="EdwardsOpinion"/&gt;

==Consequences and aftermath==
The ruling was one in a series of developments addressing issues related to the American creationist movement and the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]. The scope of the ruling affected public schools and did not include independent schools, [[homeschooling|home schools]], [[Sunday school]]s and [[Christian school]]s, which remained free to teach creationism.

During the case, creationists worked on a creationist biology textbook, with the hope of a huge market if the appeal went their way. Drafts were given various titles, including ''Biology and Creation''. After the ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' ruling, the authors changed the terms "creation" and "creationists" in the text to "[[intelligent design]]" and "design proponents", and the book was published as ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''. This supplementary textbook for school use attacked evolutionary biology without mentioning the identity of the supposed "[[intelligent designer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1am.html#day1am12|series=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|title=Trial transcript: Day 1 (September 26), AM Session, Part 1|website=talkorigins.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion of intelligent design creationism by the [[intelligent design movement]] eventually led to the textbook's use in a school district being challenged in another court case. ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' went to trial on 26 September 2005, and was decided in U.S. District Court on 20 December 2005 in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139-page opinion of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' was hailed as a landmark decision, firmly establishing that creationism and intelligent design were religious teachings and not areas of legitimate scientific research. Because the Dover school board chose not to appeal, the case never reached a circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court.

[[Wendell Bird]] served as a special assistant attorney general for [[Louisiana]] in the case and later became a staff attorney for the [[Institute for Creation Research]] and [[Association of Christian Schools International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ncse.com/news/2006/08/creationist-lawsuit-against-uc-system-to-proceed-00791| title=Creationist lawsuit against UC system to proceed|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]|date=10 August 2006|accessdate=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird later authored books promoting creationism and teaching it in public schools.

'''English land law''' is the law of [[real property]] in [[England and Wales]]. Because of its heavy historical and social significance, land is usually seen as the most important part of [[English property law]]. Ownership of land has its roots in the Anglo-Saxon system of [[Bookland (law)|Bookland]] and in the [[Anglo-Saxon multiple estate]], a [[feudal]] system transformed by [[William the Conqueror]] and his influx of many new chief [[landlord]]s after 1066. The modern law's sources derive from the old courts of [[common law]] and [[equity (legal concept)|equity]] which includes legislation such as the [[Law of Property Act 1925]], the [[Settled Land Act 1925]], the [[Land Charges Act 1972]], the [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]] and the [[Land Registration Act 2002]], and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. At its core, English land law involves the acquisition, content and priority of rights and obligations among people with interests in land. Having a property right in land, as opposed to a contractual or some other personal right, matters because it creates privileges over other people's claims, particularly if the land is sold on, the possessor goes [[United Kingdom insolvency law|insolvent]], or when claiming various remedies, like [[specific performance]], in court.  Capital taxation, the industrial revolution and reform of the established church has resulted in a shift from predominant ownership by the church and landed gentry (from [[lord of the manor|lords of the manor]] to royalty) to largely agricultural, minority aristocratic ownership.  This means today sites for development (land and buildings) belong to a complex web of owners able meet market demand-side forces for development, tempered by supply-side forces including the values enshrined in [[Planning Law|public planning policy]] to protect green spaces and promote sustainable (in terms of the economy and environment), locally diverse and socially useful development of land.

The traditional content of English land law relates to property rights that derive from common law, equity and the registration system. Ordinarily, ownership of land is acquired by a contract of sale, and to complete a purchase, the buyer must formally register their interest with [[HM Land Registry]]. Similar systems run in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Around 15 per cent of land in [[England and Wales]] remains unregistered, most of which is agricultural, has property disputes determined by the courts. Human rights, like the right to a family life and home under [[ECHR]] [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 8]] and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions, under article 1 of the First Protocol, apply for everyone. Aside from sale contracts, people may acquire interests in land through contributions to a home's purchase price, or to family life, if the courts can find evidence of a common intention or legally implied expectation, such as in marriage. The law acknowledges a "[[resulting trust|resulting]]" or "[[constructive trust]]" over the property, and in recognition of people's social interests in their homes; as with a lease under 7 years length, these do not need to be registered. Third, people can acquire land through [[proprietary estoppel]]. If someone is given an assurance that they will receive property, and they rely on this to their detriment, a court may acknowledge it. Fourth, [[adverse possession]] allows people who openly possess land, without formal objection by the owner for at least 12 years, to take registered title &amp;ndash; in registered land this can no longer affect significant pieces of inhabited land. 

Many people can share an interest in land, with up to four registered owners, and any number of underlying owners. The freehold of all land may have one owner, a "freeholder" or many. It can be used in many ways. The law closely regulates how and when joint owners may sever or sell their share. Leases, and to some degree licenses, allocate the use of land to new owners for a period of time. Mortgages and other forms of [[security interest]] are usually used to give moneylenders the right to seize property in the event that the debtor does not repay a legally related loan. Easements (such as the grant of a right of way) and covenants (such as an agreement that a freeholder will prevent certain building on the land) involve rights and duties to be applied between neighbours and may or may not bind later owners ("successors in title").

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry, scene 40.png|thumb|right|630px|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicts [[William the Conqueror]]'s knights seizing food from English peasants.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli]], [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#40|scene 40]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 recorded at least 12% of people as free, 30% as [[villeins]], 35% as [[bordars]] and [[cottar]]s, and 2% or 10% [[serfs]], (there were no [[slaves]] found anywhere in England by 1100.&lt;ref&gt;DD McGarry, ''Medieval History and Civilization'' (1976) 242&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The history of English land law can be traced into Roman times, and through the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] under Saxon monarchs where, as for most of human history, land was the dominant source of social wealth. The start of an English law of [[real property]], however, came after the [[Norman Invasion]] of 1066, when a [[common law]] was built throughout England. The new King, [[William the Conqueror]], started standardising England's feudal rules, and compiled a reference for all land and its value in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086. This was used to determine taxes. [[Feudalism]] meant that all land was held by the Monarch. [[Estates in land]] were granted to lords, who in turn parcelled out property to tenants. Tenants and lords had obligations of work, military service, and payment of taxation to those up the chain, and ultimately to the Crown. Most of the [[peasantry]] were bonded to their Lords of the Manor. Villeins often owed as little as 4 days work in the year. [[Cottar]]s or [[serfs]], who may have composed as much as 45 per cent of the population in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;DD McGarry, ''Medieval History and Civilization'' (1976) 242&lt;/ref&gt; were bound by law to work on the land. They could not leave without permission of their Lords. But also, even those who were classed as free men were factually limited in their freedom, by the limited chances to acquire property. Around 1187 [[Ranulf de Glanvill]], [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]'s [[Chief Justiciar]] composed the first major treatise of the common law, the ''[[Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Angliae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[R Glanvill]], ''[[Treatise on the Law and Customs of the Kingdom of England]]'' (1187) translated by J Beames ([https://archive.org/stream/cu31924021674399#page/n9/mode/2up 1900])&lt;/ref&gt; setting out the system of [[writs]] that people used to claim rights of property, and rights against one another. Glanvill himself died in the [[Third Crusade]], and as discontent resulting from the crusades' cost grew, English barons forced [[John, King of England|King John]] to sign the [[Magna Carta 1215]]. This guaranteed rights of representation to the barons, but contained very little for "commoners". However, a number of clauses were extracted and expanded into the [[Charter of the Forest 1217]], which did allow people access to [[common land]], where people could hunt and fish for food. Over the centuries, the law expanded on the extent of [[common ownership]]. The [[Commons Act 1236]] allowed the Lord of a Manor to enclose any manorial land that had previously been common, and the [[Statute of Westminster 1285]] formalised the system of [[entail]] so that all land could pass to the heirs of a landlord. The Statute ''[[Quia Emptores]] Terrarum'' 1290 allowed alienation of land only by substitution of the title holder, halting creation of further sub-tenants. In 1256, the second major treatise, by [[Henry de Bracton]], ''[[De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae]]'' set out the laws of property or "things", alongside laws of "persons" and "actions".&lt;ref&gt;H Bracton, ''[[De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae]]'' (1256) [http://bracton.law.harvard.edu/Unframed/calendar.htm 29], "That all law relates either to persons, things or actions." The books ''[[Fleta]]'' (ca 1290) and ''[[Britton (law)|Britton]]'' ([https://archive.org/details/brittonenglishtr00nichiala ca 1290]) are also regarded as authoritative.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medieval forest.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Charter of the Forest 1217]], a companion to the [[Magna Carta]], embodied [[social rights]] for people to use [[common land]] for hunting and farming until more and more was [[enclosed]]. Leaders of the [[Peasants' Revolt of 1381]] preached that "matters goeth not well to pass in England, nor shall not do till [[Common ownership|everything be common]], and that there be no villains nor gentlemen, but that we may be all {{sic|unied}} together, and that the lords be no greater masters than we be."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], in [[J Froissart]], ''[[Froissart's Chronicles]]'' (1385) translated by GC Macaulay (1895) [https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesfrois00macagoog#page/n290/mode/2up 251–252]. Ball went on, "What have we deserved, or why should we be kept thus in servage? We be all come from one father and one mother, [[Adam and Eve]]: whereby can they say or shew that they be greater lords than we be, saving by that they cause us to win and labour for that they dispend? They are clothed in [[velvet]] and camlet furred with grise, and we be vestured with poor cloth: they have their wines, spices and good bread, and we have the drawing out of the chaff and drink water: they dwell in fair houses, and we have the pain and travail, rain and wind in the fields; and by that that cometh of our labours they keep and maintain their estates: we be called their bondmen, and without we do readily them service, we be [[corporal punishment|beaten]]; and we have no sovereign to whom we may complain, nor that will hear us nor do us right." Depiction of the forest by Froissart's contemporary, [[Gaston III, Count of Foix]], ''Livre de chasse'' (1387)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Feudalism had not always been a part of English society, rather than being positively imposed by the monarchs prior to the Norman Invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[P Vinogradoff]], ''Villainage in England'' ([https://archive.org/stream/villainageinen00vino#page/n5/mode/2up Clarendon 1892])&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1348 everything changed as the [[Black Death]] swept through Europe, killing a third of the population. People like the poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] had seen subservience as part of a natural social order, ordained by God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Chaucer|G Chaucer]], ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (1400) [[The Parson's Tale]], [[s:The Canterbury Tales/The Parson's Prologue and Tale#Avarice|§68]] "...since sin was the initial cause of servitude, then it must be the case that, when this entire world was in sin, then this entire world was also in servitude and [[thraldom]]. But with the arrival of the Age of Grace, God ordained that some folk should be of higher degree than others and have authority over them, others should be of lower degree and obey their lord, but all of them properly served in his [[Estates of the realm|estate]] and in his degree. And therefore, in some countries, where [[slaves]] can be purchased, if they can be persuaded to become Christians they are set free. And it can certainly be said that a lord and his servants each owe something to the other."&lt;/ref&gt; But if landowners had themselves survived the plague, the peasants' labour on the land had become very scarce. Ironically, the surviving peasants were in a greater position of economic power, in claims or bargaining for wages. Feudalism began to break down.&lt;ref&gt;See EP Cheyney, 'The Disappearance of English Serfdom' (1900) 15(57) English Historical Review 20.&lt;/ref&gt; First, serfs could go undergo "commutation", where the lord simply agreed to accept money rents from tenants instead of labour services. This did not mean freedom itself, but abandoning forced labour and payments in kind to landlords meant the open evidence of servility was concealed. In disputes, royal courts were increasingly bias toward declaring a peasant was free. Second, through an act of [[manumission]] lords could voluntarily grant freedom and this was increasingly done, after the plague, if the serf or a relative made a payment of money. Third, the common law stated that if a serf lived on free soil, as in a [[City status in the United Kingdom|chartered town]] or [[Royal demesne]] land, for a year and a day, they would become free.&lt;ref&gt;HM Cassidy, 'The Emergence of the Free Labor Contract in England' (1928) 18(2) American Economic Review 201, 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility and the King reacted to the rising [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] of the peasantry by fixing wages,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ordinance of Labourers 1349]] and the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]]. See [[UK labour law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and violently suppressing any uprisings, like the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;See [[J Froissart]], ''[[The Chronicles of Froissart]]'' (1385) translated by GC Macaulay (1895) 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; Yet this combination of factors, slowly but surely, meant that by 1485 just one per cent of the population were left in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;A Abram, ''Social England in the Fifteenth Century'' (1909) 76&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1481, a judge of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]] named [[Thomas de Littleton]] produced the first treatise organised by subject rather than writs, on property law, the ''[[Treatise on Tenures]]''.&lt;ref&gt;T Littleton, ''[[Treatise on Tenures]]'' ([https://archive.org/stream/littletonstenur01littgoog#page/n10/mode/2up 1481])&lt;/ref&gt; Formal subservience was increasingly seen as a social scar. In 1523 Justice [[Anthony Fitzherbert]] wrote that the remainder of bondmen was "the greatest inconvenience that now is suffred by the lawe."&lt;ref&gt;[[A Fitzherbert]], ''Surueyenge'' ([http://cul.worldcat.org/title/surueyinge/oclc/216414019 1546]) 31, 'Howe be it in some places the bondmen continue as yette, the whiche me semeth is the greatest inconvenience that nowe is suffred by the lawe. That is to have any christen man bounden to an other, and to have the rule of his body, landes, and goodes, that his wyfe, children, and servantes have laboured for, all their life tyme, to be so taken, lyke as it were extorcion or bribery.'&lt;/ref&gt; But if more people were formally free from a landlord, people's factual freedom was still constrained because they had no property themselves. More landlords were enclosing pastures that had been open for commoners to use, and destroying people's houses, especially for [[sheep farming]]. The crown, and [[Lord Chancellor]]s like [[Sir Thomas More]],&lt;ref&gt;[[T More]], ''[[Utopia]]'' (1516) "your sheep, which are naturally mild, and easily kept in order, may be said now to devour men and unpeople, not only villages, but towns; for wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men, the abbots not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded, nor thinking it enough that they, living at their ease, do no good to the public, resolve to do it hurt instead of good. They stop the course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns, reserving only the churches, and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them."&lt;/ref&gt; had opposed this to some extent, with a series of Anti-[[Enclosure]] Acts from 1489. These required that any houses destroyed be rebuilt, but if not half the additional profits would go to the Crown. The Crown itself claimed an inherent right to any valuable metals found on land in 1568,&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Earl of Northumberland]]'' (1568), known as the ''Case of mines''&lt;/ref&gt; and people who had less than four acres of land were prohibited from building homes by the [[Erection of Cottages Act 1588]]. The final, formal end of [[feudal land tenure in England]] came only after the [[English Civil War]]. When the monarchy was [[Restoration (1660)|restored]] Parliament ensured with the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]] that landlords' obligations of service and military provision were replaced by monetary payments and an annual payment financed by taxation.

[[File:Court of Chancery.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Court of Chancery]] could mitigate the injustice of strict [[common law]] rules of property, if the [[Lord Chancellor]] deemed it [[Equity (legal concept)|equitable]]. The court systems were merged by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873–1875.]]
Over the same period, behind the momentous shifts in land's social significance, legal developments in the law of property revolved around the split between the courts of [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]]. The courts of common law (the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] and the [[Court of the King's Bench]]) took a strict approach to the rules of title to land, and how many people could have legal interests in land. However, the King had the power to hear petitions and overturn cases of common law. He delegated the hearing of petitions to his [[Lord Chancellor]], whose office grew into a court. During the [[crusades]], landowners who went to fight would transfer title to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But some who survived had returned only to find that the people they entrusted were refusing to transfer title back. They sought justice with the [[Lord Chancellor]], and his [[Court of Chancery]] determined that the true "use" or "benefit" of the land did not belong to the person on the title (or the [[feoffee]] who held [[seisin]]). Unlike the common law judges, the Chancellor held the ''[[cestui que use]]'', the owner in [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]], could be a different person, if this is what good conscience dictated.&lt;ref&gt;J Martin, ''Modern Equity'' (17th edn 2005) 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; This recognition of a split in English law, between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used, was the beginning of [[trust law]]. It was similarly useful among [[Franciscan]] friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their [[Apostolic poverty|vows of poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[FW Maitland]], ''Equity'' (1936) 25. [[WS Holdsworth]], ''A History of English Law'' (1923) vol 4, 415&lt;/ref&gt; Uses or trusts were also employed to avoid the payment of feudal dues. If a person died, the law stated a landlord was entitled to money before the land passed to heir, and the whole property under the doctrine of [[escheat]] if there were no heirs. Transferring title to a group of people for common [[Use (law)|use]] could ensure this never happened, because if one person died he could be replaced, and it was unlikely for all to die at the same time. [[King Henry VIII]] saw that this deprived the Crown of revenue, and so in the [[Statute of Uses 1535]] he attempted to prohibit them, stipulating all land belonged in fact to the ''[[cestui que use]]''. However, when Henry VIII was gone, the Court of Chancery held that it had no application where land was leased. Moreover, the primacy of equity over the common law was reasserted, supported by King James I in 1615, in the ''[[Earl of Oxford's case]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1615) 21 ER 485&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of the use continued, as new sources of revenue from the mercantile exploits in the [[New World]] decreased the Crown's reliance on feudal dues. By the early 18th century, the use had formalised into a trust:&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hopkins v Hopkins]]'' (1739) 1 Atk 581, 591 per Lord Hardwicke&lt;/ref&gt; where land was settled to be held by a trustee, for the benefit of another, the Courts of Chancery recognised the beneficiary as the true owner in [[equity (legal concept)|equity]].

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|align=left|salign=right|quote="As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land ...." 
|source=[[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) Book I, ch 6}}
Over the 18th century, the law of real property mostly came to a standstill in legislation, but principles continued to develop in the courts of equity, notably under [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Nottingham]] (from 1673–1682), [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]] (1725–1733), [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]] (1737–1756), [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington|Lord Henley]] (1757–1766), and [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]] (1801–1827).&lt;ref&gt;"[[Gee v Pritchard]]"  ''(1818) 2 Swan 402, 414, referring to a remark of [[John Selden]], 'Nothing would inflict upon me greater pain in quitting this place than the recollection that I had done anything to justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor's foot.'&lt;/ref&gt; As national and global trade expanded, the power of a new monied class of business men was growing, and the economic and political importance of land was diminishing with it. The moral philosopher and father of economics, [[Adam Smith]], reflected these changes as he argued in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that landowners position allowed them to extract [[Economic rent|rents]] from others in return for very little.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) Book I, ch 6, 'Of the Component Parts of the Price of Commodities'&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, a growing liberal movement for reform produced three major results. First, there was increasing pressure to dismantle the privileges of the landed aristocracy. The most direct reform was to gradually abolition the "[[strict settlement]]", through the [[Settled Land Acts]] of 1882–1925. An owner of land could direct that property on his death would only pass down the line of his relations, thus preventing it being sold to anyone on the market.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bruce v Ailesbury]]'' [1892] AC 356, [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]], noting the Acts' purpose being "to release the land from the fetters of the settlement'' to render it a marketable article not withstanding the settlement".&lt;/ref&gt; This also included the view that all land should be put on a register, so as to ease its ability to be marketed. The [[Land Transfer Act 1875]] introduced a voluntary system, but it was not taken up. After the [[1906 general election]] the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[David Lloyd George]], in his [[People's Budget]] of 1909 introduced a tax on land to force it onto the market.&lt;ref&gt;MR Cohen, 'Property and Sovereignty' (1927) 13 Cornell LQ 8&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a constitutional crisis, as the hereditary [[House of Lords]] vetoed it, forcing fresh elections. But the Liberal government was returned and it abolished the Lords right of veto in the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. By then, land registration reforms were a minor political issue and only really opposed by solicitors who earned sizeable conveyancing fees.&lt;ref&gt;A Offer, 'The Origins of the Law of Property Acts 1910–25' (1977) 40(5) Modern Law Review 505&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the [[Land Registration Act 1925]] required any dealing with property triggered compulsory registration.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Land Charges Act 1925]], [[Settled Land Act 1925]], [[Trustee Act 1925]] and [[Law of Property Act 1925]]&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the [[Court of Chancery]], though it may have mitigated the petty strictnesses of the common law of property, was seen as cumbersome and arcane. It was subjected to ridicule in books like [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]'' and his fictional case of ''[[Jarndyce v Jarndyce]]'', a Chancery matter that nobody understood and dragged on for years and years.&lt;ref&gt;J Martin, ''Modern Equity'' (17th edn 2005) 13–15. Cases in Lord Eldon's court had indeed lasted up to 18 years.&lt;/ref&gt; Largely this was because there were only two judges administering equitable principles, so from 1873 to 1875, the common law and equity courts were merged into one hierarchy. Under the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875]], equitable principles would prevail in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 s 25(11), 'Generally in all matters not herein-before particularly mentioned, in which there is any conflict or variance between the Rules of Equity and the Rules of the Common Law with reference to the same matter, the Rules of Equity shall prevail.'&lt;/ref&gt; Third, in most counties and boroughs, the ability to vote for members of parliament had been tied to possession of property in land. From the [[Great Reform Act 1832]], to the [[Reform Act 1867]], and the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], the connection between property and the vote was gradually reduced and then abolished. Together with the [[Parliament Act 1911]], a more democratic constitution had emerged, though it was only in 1928 that the voting age for men and women became equal and only in 1948 that the double votes and extra constituencies for graduates of English and Welsh universities were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 1928]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the First World War, the power of the old [[Landed gentry|landed aristocracy]] had largely been broken.

[[File:On the rooftops of London.jpg|thumb|right|After both World Wars, land management and housing increasingly came under social ownership and regulation, with new [[council homes]], rights for tenants, and ownership interests in land recognised through contributions to family life.]]
Over the twentieth century, land law became increasingly social in character. First, from the [[Housing Act 1919]] and the post war government's policy of building "[[homes fit for heroes]]" more and more houses were built, and maintained, by local governments. In private accommodation, new rights were enacted for tenants against their landlords, with some [[security of tenure]] and [[Rent control in England and Wales|rent regulation]], a break on unfettered "[[freedom of contract]]". The policy was halted by the [[Housing Act 1980]], which sought to privatise properties by introducing a "[[right to buy]]" one's council home. At the same time, rights for tenants, and constraints on rental increases were reduced, albeit that tenants did retain some minima of rights, for example under the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] and the [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]]. Second, property was increasingly used as a source of finance for business, and similarly became source of profit for banks, mortgage lenders and [[real estate investment trust]]s. This fact drove changes in the market for mortgage regulation, while the growing financial interest in land tended to conflict with family life. As the UK came closer to [[gender equality]], women as much as men contributed to the purchase of homes, as well as contributing to raising families and children. In 1970, in ''[[Pettitt v Pettitt]]'', [[Lord Diplock]] remarked that "the wider employment of married women in industry, commerce and the professions and the emergence of a property-owning, particularly a real-property-mortgaged-to-a-building-society-owning, democracy" had compelled courts to acknowledge contributions to the home and family life as potentially generating proprietary interests.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pettitt v Pettitt]]'' [1970] AC 777, 829&lt;/ref&gt; However, if banks sought to repossess homes from people who had defaulted on mortgage repayments, the courts were faced with a choice of whether to prefer those economic interests over social values. The membership of the United Kingdom in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] meant that article 8, on the right to a private and family life, could change the freedom of banks or landlords to evict people, particularly where children's stability and upbringing were at stake, though by the early twenty-first century the case law had remained cautious.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[National Westminster Bank plc v Malhan]]'' [2004] EWHC 847&lt;/ref&gt; Third, land use in general was subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework. The old common laws between neighbours, of easements, covenants, nuisance and trespass were largely eclipsed by locally and democratically determined planning laws,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Commons Registration Act 1965]]&lt;/ref&gt; environmental regulation, and a framework for use of agricultural resources.

English land law draws on four main sources to determine property rights: the [[common law]] and [[equitable principles]] developed by the courts, a system of land registration, a continuing system for unregistered land, and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. First of all, the courts of [[common law]] and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] gave people with "property" rights various privileges over people who acquired mere "personal" rights. To acquire [[property]] over land (as with any other object of value), as opposed to a contract, for example, to use it, a buyer and seller simply needed to [[Agreement in English law|agree]] that property would be passed. The law then recognised a "property" right with various privileges over people with purely "personal" claims. The best form of property would involve exclusive possession, and it usually bound anyone who attempted to interfere with an owner's use, particularly in cases of [[insolvency]], if other people with interests in the land sold their stake to a third party, or in getting remedies to enforce one's right. Before 1925, property rights in land (unlike, for example, a [[United Kingdom company law|company's shares]]) only had to be evidenced in paper [[title deeds]]. It was therefore believed that a system of [[land registration]] was desirable, so that people's rights over land would be certain, and [[conveyancing]] would be simpler and cheaper. So, the second system of land began with the [[Land Registration Act 1925]], and the rules were recast in the [[Land Registration Act 2002]]. Instead of paper title deeds determining people's property rights in land, the entries in the registry were the source that determine people's property rights. However, many property rights were never expected to be registered, particularly the social claims that people had on family homes, or short leases. Furthermore, not all land had to be registered. Only when formal transactions with land took place did registration become a compulsory. This meant that by 2013, 88 per cent of land or 126,000 square kilometres was registered with [[HM Land Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[HM Land Registry]], ''Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13'' ([http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/46222/Land-Registry-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2012-13.pdf 2013]) 5&lt;/ref&gt; But a third system of land regulation remained for the 12 per cent of [[Unregistered land in English law|unregistered land]]. Though somewhat amended by legislation, this system for determining property rights and disputes remained much like the old common law and equity. Fourth, and particularly important since the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allowed people to plead claims directly in the UK courts without having to wait for an appeal to [[Strasbourg]], property rights were affected by an autonomous set of human rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]]. Not simply the common law, or land registration, but also people's right to a family life, privacy in one's home, and peaceful enjoyment of possessions,&lt;ref&gt;[[ECHR]] article 8 and Protocol 1, article 1&lt;/ref&gt; could change the outcomes of property disputes.

===Real property===
{{see also|Numerus clausus (law)|Land in English law|English trusts law|Fixture (property law)}}
Land law is also known as the law of real property. It relates to the acquisition, protection and conflicts of people's rights, legal and equitable, in land.&lt;ref&gt;See [[P Birks]], 'Before we begin: five keys to land law’ in S Bright and J Dewar, ''Land Law: Themes and Perspectives'' (1998) 457, 459, describes land law as ‘providing the structure within which people and business can safely acquire and exploit land for daily use, to live and to work… the nature, creation and protection of interests in land.’&lt;/ref&gt; This means three main things. First, "property rights" (in Latin, a right ''[[in rem]]'') are generally said to bind third parties,&lt;ref&gt;nb this orthodox distinction is no longer strictly valid because of the economic torts, such as interference with a contract, e.g. ''[[Lumley v Gye]]'' [1853] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/1853/J73.html EWHC QB J73]. A theatre owner who paid a singer to work for him, therefore breaking the singer's contract with another theatre, was injuncted from the performance and had to pay damages. Hence, the contract bound third parties, in that they had an obligation to not interfere with performance of the contract.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas personal rights (a right ''[[in personam]]'') are exercisable only against the person who owes an obligation.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth]]'' [1965] AC 1175, Lord Wilberforce, 1247, 'Before a right or interest can be admitted into the category of property, or of a right affecting property, it must be definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties, and have some degree of permanence or stability.'&lt;/ref&gt; English law acknowledges a fixed number, or ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' of property rights, which create various privileges. The main situations where this distinction matters are if a debtor to two or more creditors has gone [[United Kingdom insolvency law|insolvent]] (i.e. bankrupt), or if there is a dispute over possession of a specific thing. If a person or a business has gone insolvent, and has things in their possession which are the property of others', then those people can usually take back their property free of anyone else's claims.&lt;ref&gt;nb under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] Sch B1, the administration procedure for insolvent companies places a moratorium on debt collection, including property rights, without court approval.&lt;/ref&gt; But if an insolvent person's creditors are merely owed personal debts, they cannot take back their money freely: any losses have to be divided among all creditors. Often, creditors can contract for a proprietary right (known as a [[security interest]]) to secure repayment of debts. This gives the same result as having another proprietary right, so the secured creditor takes priority in the insolvency queue.&lt;ref&gt;However, the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] ss 175, 176A and Sch 6 adjusts the priority rules to prevent the power of contract being used to the disadvantage of weaker creditors.&lt;/ref&gt; Secured creditors, most usually, are banks and for most people the most familiar kind of security interest is a mortgage. In this way, property rights area always "stronger" than personal rights, even though they may be acquired by the same means: a contract. Most of the time, property rights are also stronger than personal because English courts have been historically more willing to order [[specific performance]] as a remedy for interference with property rights. People with personal rights, such as to the performance of a [[English contract law|contract]], are presumptively entitled to money in compensation, unless damages would be an inadequate remedy.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Cooperative Insurance Ltd v Argyll Ltd]]'' [1997] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/17.html UKHL 17]&lt;/ref&gt; In its second main feature, English land law differs from [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems in the [[European Union]], because it allows the separation of the "beneficial" ownership of property from legal title to property. If there is a "trust" of land, then trustees hold legal title, while the benefit, use and "equitable" title might belong to many other people. Legal title to real property can only be acquired in a limited number of formal ways, while equitable title can be recognised because of a person's contribution, or the parties' true intentions, or some other reason, if the law deems that it is fair and just (i.e. equitable) to recognise that someone else has a stake in the land.

{{Clist land definition}}
[[File:Beachy Head and Lighthouse, East Sussex, England - April 2010 edit.jpg|thumb|left|Land in English law is said to have "[[Spacetime|four dimensions]]", of area, into the sky and below the surface, and through time.]]
The third main feature of the English law of real property is that "real" property (or "realty") means land, and the things that goes with it, alone. This is classified as different from movables or other types of "personal" property (or "personalty"). The distinction matters mainly to define the scope of the subject matter, because there are different registration requirements, taxes, and other regulations for land's use. The technical definition of "land" encompasses slightly more than in the word's common use. Under the [[Law of Property Act 1925]], section 205(1)(ix) says land means "land of any [[tenure]], mines and minerals, whether or not held apart from the surface, buildings or parts of buildings (whether the division is horizontal, vertical or made in any other way) and other [[hereditament]]s; also a manor, [[advowson]], and a rent and other incorporeal hereditaments, and an [[easement]], right, privilege or benefit in, over, or derived from land..." This cumbersome definition indicates two general ideas. First, land includes physical things attached to it (e.g. buildings and "hereditaments") and, second, intangible rights (like an [[easement]], a right of way). Perhaps in tribute to science, legal academics describe property in land as "[[four dimensional]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Newlon Housing Trust v Alsulaimen]]'' [1999] 1 AC 313, per Lord Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; The two dimensional area of land surface, preferably bounded by a fence, railing, wire or hedge-and-ditch or marked by a different permanent surface, is complemented by rights over all buildings and "fixtures". This becomes most relevant in disputes after a contract to sell land, when a buyer alleges a thing was included in a sale, but a contract was silent on the specifics. In ''[[Holland v Hodgson]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1872] LR 7 CP 328&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn J held that looms installed in a factory formed part of the land. Objects resting on the ground, "attached" only by gravity, will not normally be part of the land, unless case law and the parties' conduct supports the contention of a different "intention". Easily removable things, like carpets and curtains, or houseboats, will not be implied into a sale of land by default.  Less easily removed things, like taps and plugs, are.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Botham v TSB Plc]]'' [1997] 73 P &amp; CR D 1 and ''[[Chelsea Yacht and Boat Club v Pope]]'' [2001] 2 All ER 409&lt;/ref&gt; In the third dimension, mines and sub-surface things, belong to the surface owner, generally, down to 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Air Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/734)&lt;/ref&gt; the landowner has a right to the atmosphere above his land as well. Public policy sets the limit.  Since the 16th century's ''[[Case of Mines]]'' the Crown has a claim to valuable minerals or natural resources that are discovered, as well as valuable treasure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Case of Mines]]'' (1568) 1 Plowd 210, the [[Coal Industry Act 1994]], [[Petroleum Act 1998]]) and [[Treasure Act 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; And in the other direction, aircraft or satellites that are sufficiently high are not considered to [[trespass]], or infringe an owner's right to peaceful enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews &amp; General Ltd]]'' [1978] QB 479, the right of aircraft to fly over a property.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth dimension is time. Since 1925 English law recognises two "[[estate in land|estates]]" in land, or kinds of ownership interest: the ''freehold'' (''[[fee simple]]''), which is a right to use for an unlimited time; and the ''lease'' (''tenancy''), which is an interest for a fixed period of time. In all situations use of the land is constrained by agreements and/or binding rights with neighbours, and the requirements of the local council and government.

===Land registration and priority===
{{main article|Land registration|Torrens title}}
{{Clist land registration}}
Because land can serve multiple uses, for many people, and because its fixed nature means that its owner may not always be visible, a system of registration came to be seen as essential at the start of the 20th Century. From the [[Land Registry Act 1862]] which created a body where people could voluntarily register,&lt;ref&gt;SR Simpson, ''Land Law and Registration'' (1976) 44, there had been just 118 titles registered by 1885&lt;/ref&gt; a succession of government reports and piecemeal reform finally culminated in a unified, compulsory registration system with the [[Land Registration Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;See variously the ''Report of the Commission on Registration of Title'' (1857) HCP xxi 245; the ''Royal Commission on the Operation of the Land Transfer Act'' (1870) HCP xviii 595; the [[Land Transfer Act 1875]]; the [[Land Transfer Act 1897]]; the ''Royal Commission on the Land Transfer Acts, Second and Final Report'' (1911) 553–554, and the ''Report of Sir Leslie Scott's Committee'' (1919) Cmd 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents argued that a registration system would increase land's marketability, and make its transfer as fluid as the registration system of company shares. Theodore Ruoff, Chief Registrar from 1963, said the main three functions the register served was (1) to mirror ownership interests in land (2) to curtain off minor, or equitable interests that could be bypassed (or "overreached") in the land conveyance business, and (3) to provide insurance through Registrar funds to anyone who lost property as a result of register defects.&lt;ref&gt;TBF Ruoff, ''An Englishman Looks at the Torrens System'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal goal was thus to ensure that a comprehensive set of people whose interests had priority in a given real estate would be reflected on the register. With the [[Land Registration Act 2002]], which recast the old law, the Registry has focused on "e-conveyancing". Under sections 91 to 95, electronic registration counts as deeds, and aims to replace the paper filing for the 21st century.

[[File:HM Land Registry.png|thumb|left|[[HM Land Registry]] does not require interests acquired through informal methods to be recorded, which usually reflect social and family interests in property.]]
However, reflecting the social use of land, the priority system of land registration and the Register's record of all interests in land has made significant exceptions for informal methods of acquiring rights, and especially equitable interests, in land. Under the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] sections 27 to 30, an interest in land that is registered (for instance, [[freehold (law)|freehold]] ownership, a long [[lease]], or a mortgage) will take priority to all other interests that come later, or are not entered on the register. The first registered interest in time prevails. Yet under [[LRA 2002]] Schedule 3, a series of exceptions, or "overriding interests" are listed. Under Schedule 3, paragraph 1, any lease that is less than seven years need not be registered, and will still bind other parties. The reason is to strike a balance between an owner who may well keep hold of land for a long period, and a person who may be renting as a home. Most socially significant, under Schedule 3, paragraph 2 (formerly [[Land Registration Act 1925]] s 70(1)(g)), the interest of a person who is in "actual occupation" need not be entered on the register, but will still bind later registered interests. This rule was said to be necessary to prevent the social right to a home being "lost in the welter of registration".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strand Securities v Caswell]]'' [1965] Ch 958, 979, [[Lord Denning MR]], 'Fundamentally its object is to protect the person in actual occupation of land from having his rights lost in the welter of registration. He can stay there and do nothing. Yet he will be protected. No one can buy the land over his head and thereby take away or diminish his rights. It is up to every purchaser before he buys to make inquiry on the premises. If he fails to do so, it is at his own risk. He must take subject to whatever rights the occupier may have.'&lt;/ref&gt; It is most used in favour of people, typically a spouse in a family home whose name is not on the title deeds, who have not registered an interest because the law has recognised they have acquired a right, not through a formal, or express contract, or gift – but by their contributions, or their reliance on another person's assurances. If such a person is in "actual occupation", then their informally acquired interest (usually through "[[constructive trust]]", which recognises their contributions of money or work toward family life) will bind parties who acquire interests later on.

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|align=right|salign=right|quote="Anyone who lends money on the security of a [[matrimonial home]] nowadays ought to realise that the wife may have a share in it. He ought to make sure that the wife agrees to it, or to go to the house and make inquiries of her. It seems to me utterly wrong that a lender should turn a blind eye to the wife's interest or the possibility of it – and afterwards seek to turn her and the family out – on the plea that he did not know she was in actual occupation. If a bank is to do its duty, in the society in which we live, it should recognise the integrity of the matrimonial home. It should not destroy it by disregarding the wife's interest in it – simply to ensure that it is paid the husband's debt in full – with the high [[interest rate]] now prevailing. We should not give monied might priority over [[social justice]]."
|source=[[Lord Denning MR]] in ''[[Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank v Boland]]'' [1979] Ch 312}}
In a leading case, ''[[Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank v Boland]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1980] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1980/4.html UKHL 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Boland had had trouble repaying his bank for a loan he used on his building company. The loan was secured on his [[Beddington]] house, where he lived with Mrs Boland. However, Mrs Boland had not consented to the mortgage agreement. She was not registered on the home's title deeds, but she had made significant financial contributions to the home. Despite Templeman J at first instance saying Mrs Boland only occupied the house through her husband, the Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords both agreed that Mrs Boland actually did occupy her home, and that her interest bound the bank. Later cases have shown the test for actual occupation must be purposively, and liberally determined, according to the claimant's social circumstance. So in ''[[Chhokar v Chhokar]]'' a lady who had been beaten and attacked by her estranged husband's friends to scare her from her [[Southall]] home, and who was at the time of her home being registered in hospital having Mr Chhokar's child, was still in actual occupation. This meant that because she had contributed to the home's purchase price, she was entitled to stay. Her interest bound, and took priority to, later registered interests. Under [[LRA 2002]] Schedule 3, paragraph 2, only if a person is asked about their interest, and they say nothing, or if it is not obvious on a reasonably careful inspection, would a person in actual occupation lose to a registered party. It has also been held that someone who occupies a house and has an interest in the home might have impliedly consented to taking subject to another party's later interest. In both ''[[Bristol &amp; West Building Society v Henning]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1985] EWCA Civ 6, [1985] 1 WLR 778&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Abbey National Building Society v Cann]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1990] UKHL 3, [1991] 1 AC 56&lt;/ref&gt; a couple purchased a home with the assistance of a loan from a building society, which was secured by mortgage on the property. In both cases the court held that because the buyers could not have got the house without the loan, there had been tacit consent by all to the bank taking priority, and no gap in time before registration when the spouse could have been said to be in prior actual occupancy.

Originally to facilitate transfers of land, the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] sections 2 and 27 make provision so that people with equitable interests in land may not assert them against purchasers of the land if there are two trustees. If a person has an equitable interest in a property, the law allows this interest to be detached from the property, or "overreached" and reattached to money given in exchange for land, so long as the exchange took place by at least two trustees. This was, however, applied not for the purpose of trading property by professional trustees, but against homeowners in ''[[City of London Building Society v Flegg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1987] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1987/6.html UKHL 6]&lt;/ref&gt; Here two parents, Mr and Mrs Flegg, had given their home to their children, who in turn mortgaged the property and defaulted on the loan. The House of Lords held that because the words of the statute were fulfilled, and the purchase money for the interest in the property (i.e. the loan that the children squandered) had been paid to two trustees, the Fleggs had to give up possession. Lastly, it is possible to lose an interest in land, even if registered, through adverse possession by another person after 12 years under the [[Limitation Act 1980]] sections 15 to 17.

===Unregistered land===
{{Clist unreg land}}
{{main article|Unregistered land in English law}}
In 2013, because registration of title was never made compulsory ''per se'', 18 per cent of land in England and Wales remained unregistered.&lt;ref&gt;[[HM Land Registry]], ''Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13'' ([http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/46222/Land-Registry-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2012-13.pdf 2013]) 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of compulsion was probably a result of political compromise, while a powerful landed aristocracy remained heavily opposed to any transparency over the extent of their wealth. Only if a transaction identified in the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] section 4 took place, as under the [[LRA 1925]], would the land be compulsorily entered on the register. This included any sale, mortgage, or lease over seven years. However it still does not include a transfer by operation of law, and that means land can be inherited, or kept within the family, and never need be registered unless the Lord Chancellor amends section 4 by order.&lt;ref&gt;[[LRA 2002]] ss 4(3) and see also 27(5). The Lord Chancellor's power to amend, is in section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that to find the "root of title" to unregistered property, and the various rights that others might have such as easements or covenants, it is necessary to seek out the relevant bundle of deeds, going back at least 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law of Property Act 1969]] s 23, formerly 30 years.&lt;/ref&gt; If unregistered property is being sold on, registration would be triggered, but a final search of title deeds would still be necessary. The first basic principle was that all legal property rights bound everyone, whether or not anybody knew about them. These would usually be in the deeds that were kept, though small interests like a lease of under three years would not because of its exemption from formality, as with registered land.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law of Property Act 1925]] s 54(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The second principle was that equitable proprietary rights bound everyone except a [[bona fide purchaser|''bona fide'' purchaser]] of the legal estate without any notice of the equitable interest (also known as Equity's Darling). Being a ''bona fide'' purchaser was an "absolute, unqualified, unanswerable defence",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pitcher v Rawlins]]'' (1871–1872) LR 7 Ch App 259, 269, James LJ&lt;/ref&gt; so that the person with an equitable interest would only have an enforceable right against the [[Tracing in English law|traceable assets]] received in return for the land. Being a purchaser for value meant not receiving the property as a gift,&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Basset v Nosworthy]]'' (1673) 23 ER 55, 56, 'in Purchases the Question is not, whether the Consideration be adequate, but whether 'tis valuable'.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bona fide'' meant acting in [[good faith]]. In turn, good faith largely meant the same thing as buying the land without having any actual notice,&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Lloyd v Banks]]'' (1868) LR 3 Ch App 488, per Lord Cairns LC, 490-1, 'evidence of casual conversations' could be 'proof that the mind of the trustee has in some way been brought to an intelligent apprehension... so that a reasonable man, or an ordinary man of business, would act upon the information'.&lt;/ref&gt; and it not being reasonable to have known, about another person's equitable interest.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Green]]'' [1981] AC 513, 528, Lord Wilberforce, suggests that someone could still act without ''bona fide'' in absence of any notice, actual or constructive. One example could relate to the equitable doctrine of having "clean hands". See ''[[Re London School of Electronics Ltd]]'' [1986] Ch 211.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 199, and cases through the courts, buyers of land would be bound by prior equitable interests if the interest "would have come to his knowledge if such inquiries and inspections had been made as ought reasonably to have been made".&lt;ref&gt;The case of ''[[Caunce v Caunce]]'' [1969] 1 WLR 286, where High Court judge, Stamp J held that a husband's ability to sell title would not be changed by his wife living with him, was cast under heavy doubt by the Court of Appeal in ''[[Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank Ltd v Boland]]'' [1979] Ch 312.&lt;/ref&gt; So for example, in ''[[Kingsnorth Finance Co Ltd v Tizard]]'', it was held that clothes of a divorcee being present in a home bound a bank's agent who inspected a property with notice of her equitable interest.&lt;ref&gt;[1986] 1 WLR 783. cf ''[[Hunt v Luck]]'' [1901] 1 Ch 45&lt;/ref&gt; The general scheme of the law was to do everything possible to ensure that people were not be deprived of their stakes in their homes without their fully informed and true consent, yet it stopped short of simply determining that equitable rights were always binding.

On top of these basic rules, the [[Land Charges Act 1972]], following its [[Land Charges Act 1925|1925]] predecessor, required that some kinds of charges had to be entered on another special register of charges for unregistered land. According to section 2, a [[puisne mortgage]] (a second or third mortgage created after a property is already mortgaged) had to be registered before it would be binding, even though it had previously counted as a legal property right.&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 2(4)(i), Class C(i)&lt;/ref&gt; The other important kinds of charge that had to be registered are restrictive covenants and equitable easements,&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 2(5), Class D&lt;/ref&gt; a right from the [[Family Law Act 1996]] Part IV,&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 2(7), Class F&lt;/ref&gt; and an "estate contract" (i.e. either a future right to buy a property, or an [[option (finance)|option]] to buy).&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 2(4)(iv), Class C(iv)&lt;/ref&gt; Without registration, those charges would be void, but once registered those charges would bind everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 4 and [[Law of Property Act 1925]] s 198&lt;/ref&gt; The registration would go against the name of the title holder, although this was sometimes prone to confusing if people occasionally used different names (e.g. Francis or Frank).&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 3 and ''[[Oak Co-operative Building Society v Blackburn]]'' [1968] Ch 730&lt;/ref&gt; If an official search of the register did not reveal any titles, then the purchaser would gain good legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[LCA 1972]] s 10&lt;/ref&gt; One glaring injustice, however, was that the House of Lords held the registration rules to be strict. In ''[[Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Green]]'', Walter Green gave his son, Geoffrey an option to buy the property, but did not register it. Then Walter changed his mind, and knowing that Geoffrey had not registered this estate contract, he transferred the property to his wife, Evelyne, for £500 to defeat the agreement. Although the purchaser had actual notice of Geoffrey's equitable interest, it did not matter because it was not registered. In another example, it was held in ''[[Lloyds Bank v Carrick]]'' that a person in actual occupation of a home, who had an unregistered right to buy the home, could not claim an over-riding interest (as would have been possible in registered land) because the only source of the interest was the estate contract, and without registration this was void.&lt;ref&gt;[1996] 4 All ER 630. cf ''[[ER Ives Investment Ltd v High]]'' [1967] 2 QB 379, where a right of way was not registered, but it still bound purchasers because it was given in return for foundations of the neighbours that encroached upon the property.&lt;/ref&gt; The anomalies of the system were always acknowledged, and so it was simply hoped that unregistered land would dwindle away.&lt;ref&gt;See H Wade, 'Land Charges Registration Reviewed' [1956] Cambridge Law Journal 216&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, perhaps simpler, of passing legislation requiring everything was compulsorily registered was not yet taken.

===Human rights===
{{Clist land human rights}}
{{See also|Human rights in United Kingdom law|English civil liberties|Right to property}}
Although the [[UK constitutional law]] formally follows the idea of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], following the Second World War the UK joined the United Nations, it subscribed to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which was largely written by UK civil servants), and in 1972 it joined the [[European Union]]. In all three international organisations, the constitutional traditions of other member states gave courts a greater role in adjudicating on whether legislation complied with human rights. With the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the UK resolved to give its courts power to review legislation's compliance with the [[ECHR]] jurisprudence, primarily as a way of saving litigants the cost of exhausting the domestic court system and then appealing to [[Strasbourg]]. The ECHR was relevant for land law mostly because of the right to a privacy and family life under [[ECHR article 8]], and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions under [[ECHR Protocol 1, article 1]] are concerned. In the first cases under ECHR article 8, challenges were brought by tenants who had been evicted from their homes by local authorities. Against the arguments of claimants that their evictions were disproportionate responses and infringed their rights to a family or home life, the UK courts initially denied that UK property legislation would ever be incompatible with the Convention. However, in ''[[Manchester CC v Pinnock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2010] UKSC 45&lt;/ref&gt; after a number of cases in the European Court of Human Rights suggested otherwise, the UK Supreme Court accepted that courts must have the inherent jurisdiction to assess whether an infringement of one's right to a home life if someone is evicted is proportionate and justifiable. On the case's facts, it was held that Mr Pinnock's eviction for the anti-social behaviour of his sons was proportionate. Although he was a pensioner, the complaints had been serious and long lasting. The cases under Protocol 1, article 1, primarily turn on the question of compulsory acquisition of property by the government. The Strasbourg courts distinguish between deprivation of property by actual acquisition, and limitation of the use of land by an owner through regulation, for instance of the environment.

==Acquiring land==
[[File:London MMB J7 Tower of London.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Titles to large amount of England descend from people who acquired land through the monarchy after the [[Norman Invasion]],&lt;ref&gt;See T Cohen, 'Look who owns Britain: A third of the country STILL belongs to the aristocracy' (10 November 2010) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1328270/A-Britain-STILL-belongs-aristocracy.html Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt; and were protected by the Crown's military establishments like the [[Tower of London]].]]
While the establishment of the land law in England happened by [[Roman invasion|invasion]], [[Norman Conquest|conquest]], enclosure and [[Dissolution of the monasteries|force]], over the 20th century as a whole there was an increasing distribution of property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;J Hicks and G Allen, ''A Century of Change: Trends in UK statistics since 1900'' (21 December 1999) [http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf House of Commons Research Paper 99/111], 11–12, showing increases in owner-occupiers accompanying changes in rent price regulation and booms in housing construction.&lt;/ref&gt; The great driver for increasing distribution of land, and the British realisation of the [[right to housing]], was public regulation of rental prices (so being a landlord was less profitable than selling) and publicly financed construction of housing.&lt;ref&gt;See [[English land law#Housing and tenant rights|Housing and tenant rights]] below, and [[Affordability of housing in the United Kingdom]].&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise there have been four other methods for acquiring rights in land, which operate within the paradigm of [[markets]] and [[private property]]. The first is through a [[consent]] based obligation. This could be through a gift, or similarly the settlement of a [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], so that a trustee holds property for the benefit of another. Most normally land will be transferred through an agreement by [[English contract law|contract]]. In all cases, to complete a transfer, a person's interest should be [[land registration|registered]] to be fully protected. However, the law recognises people's interests in land even though they have not been acquired in a formal way. The second main way to acquire rights in land is through resulting or constructive trust, recognised by the court. In the context of land, and particularly family homes, this will usually be to acknowledge the contribution someone has made to a home, financial or otherwise. Third, the courts acknowledge people have acquired land when they have been given an assurance, on which they have reasonably placed reliance, and the result would be detrimental if their interests were not recognised. This [[proprietary estoppel]] claim is a way for people's interests to gain recognition although their dealing's with a land owner have fallen short of contract. Fourth, and the furthest departure from land acquired by a contract, English law has always recognised a claim by people who have inhabited land for long enough to have legally acquired their rights. The fact of possession, even if adverse to a previous owner, matures after 12 years into a sound legal right.

===Consent, form and registration===
{{Clist land registration}}
[[File:HM Land Registry 1.jpg|thumb|left|Headquarters of [[HM Land Registry]], 32 [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] from 1913 to 2011, now the [[London School of Economics|LSE]]'s Department of Economics.]]
Four main ways of acquiring land are through a gift, trust, succession and by contract, all of which involve express or at least presumed consent. In the case of an ordinary gift during a person's life, the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 52(1) requires a deed (itself defined in the [[Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989]] section 1) before any transfer is effective. Subsequently, a transfer must be registered. The [[Land Registration Act 2002]] section 27(2) makes registration compulsory for all transfers of land, leases over seven years and any charges.&lt;ref&gt;[[LRA 2002]] s 118, allows the Secretary of State to reduce this period by Order. Section 4 lists similar events as triggering a duty to register hitherto unregistered land.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[LRA 2002]] section 27, the consequence of a failure to register one's interest is that it will not bind another person in law who is transferred the property and does register. If the transfer of land takes place through a will, the [[Wills Act 1837]] section 9 requires in similar terms that the will be signed in writing and have two witnesses. The beneficiary under the will must then take steps to register the interest in land in her name. In the case of a person who dies without leaving a will, their property, including land will succeed in passing by operation of law to the next of kin, or in the case of jointly owned property in a joint tenancy, to the co-owner/s.

In all situations, the requirement of formality is thought to improve the quality of people's consent. It has been reasoned, most notably by [[Lon Fuller]], that going through the laborious motions of formality induces people to truly consider whether they wish to make a transfer. It also provides evidence of the transaction, and makes the threshold of a transaction's enforceability simple to determine.&lt;ref&gt;L Fuller, 'Consideration and Form' (1941) 41 CLR 799&lt;/ref&gt; This is most seen in the case of a [[English contract law|contract]]. If an interest in land is the subject of a contract, the law isolates three steps. First, the sale will take place, which according to [[LPMPA 1989]] section 2 may only occur with signed writing (though by section 2(5) and Law of Property Act 1925 section 54(2) leases under 3 years can be made without). Second, technically the transfer must take place under Law of Property Act 1925 section 52(1) by a deed (though there is no reason why this cannot be combined with step 1, by using a deed for the sale!). Third, the land must be registered for the legal interest to take effect under [[LRA 2002]] sections 27 to 30.

===Resulting and constructive trusts===
{{see also|Resulting trust|Constructive trust}}
{{Clist resulting trusts}}
Although the formal steps of a contract, conveyance and registration will allow people to acquire legal interests in land, over the course of the twentieth century Parliament, and the courts, slowly recognised that many people have legitimate claims to property, even without following formalities, and even without gaining the [[consent]] of a property owner. The institution of a trust has come to play a major role, particularly in family homes, because according to the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 53, while declarations of express trusts require signed writing to take effect, [[Resulting trust|resulting]] and [[constructive trusts]] do not. A "resulting" trust is typically recognised when a person has given property to a person without the intention to benefit that person, so the property jumps back to the person it came from. "Constructive" trusts have been recognised by English courts in about eight unrelated circumstances, whenever it is said it would be "unconscionable" that the courts did not recognise properly belonged to the claimant. In the context of family homes, these two types of trust allowed judges to recognise, from around 1970, a spouse's proprietary right in a home because of the contribution (broadly speaking) to home life. Parliament had enacted the same reform already as a part of family law. In the [[Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970]] section 37, "where a husband or wife contributes in money or money's worth" to improve property, a court could recognise an equitable right in it, but also vary the amount to the extent it was deemed just. And under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] section 24, a court was empowered in divorce proceedings to vary the property rights of the parties, especially for the benefit of children, to the extent that was just. In the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]] sections 65 to 72 and Schedules 5–7 achieved the same for civil partners.

[[File:Richard Gerstl Familie Schönberg 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Among British [[English family law|families]] in 2001 there were 10m married couples with 7.5m children, and 2m unmarried cohabiting couples with 1.25m children.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Stack v Dowden]]'' [2007] UKHL 17, [44]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
However, for cohabiting couples, with or without children, who are not married or civil partners, only the common law was available to make a claim, and it has been slow to reach a position achieved for married couples under statute. In ''[[Gissing v Gissing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1970] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/3.html UKHL 3]&lt;/ref&gt; a case before the passage of the [[family law]] statutes, a married couple had lived, worked and had a child together from 1935 to 1961 when the relationship broke down on his [[adultery]]. Mr Gissing had paid mortgage instalments and the property was in his name, although Mrs Gissing had made some home improvements. [[Lord Denning MR]] in the Court of Appeal held that because they had continued life as a joint venture, even though she had made no quantifiable money contribution, nevertheless Mrs Gissing would have a half share in the property under a constructive trust. The House of Lords reversed this decision, arguing that no "common intention" could be found, as was said to be needed, for her to share in the home's equity. Despite this, some cases creatively allowed for a constructive trust on the basis of "common intention" if unusual conduct was arguably evidence of wanting to share the home. In ''[[Eves v Eves]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1975] EWCA Civ 3&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal (with Lord Denning MR) held that a lady who broke up a patio with a 14&amp;nbsp;lb sledgehammer must have been intended to share in the home's equity. In ''[[Grant v Edwards]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1986] EWCA Civ 4&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal allowed a claim by Ms Grant who was explicitly told by her partner, Mr Edwards, that she could not be included on the house title deeds because it could affect her chances of a divorce proceedings. This was, said the court, apparently evidence that (if Ms Grant had had no divorce proceedings) the couple must have intended to share the house together. However, then in ''[[Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1990] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1990/14.html UKHL 14]&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords halted development again. Lord Bridge held that only if (1) a spouse made direct contributions to a home's purchase price, or (2) a spouse had actually reached some agreement, however uncertain, that a claim for an equitable interest would succeed. This meant that Mrs Rosset, who was not on the title deeds, had made no financial contributions, but who had done much decorating work, could not claim an equitable interest in the home where she lived. This meant that the bank was entitled to repossess the home, following a default on Mr Rosset's mortgage loan, free from her interest in actual occupation. Nevertheless, if a court did acknowledge a spouse's contribution to the home, it could "inflate" the interest to whatever size possible (as under the 1970 and 1973 Acts). So in ''[[Midland Bank plc v Cooke]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1995] 4 All ER 562&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that although a joint gift of £1100 to Mr and Mrs Cooke only represented 6% of the home's value, Mrs Cooke's interest could be raised to one half. This meant that Midland Bank was entitled only to half the equity value of the home after Mr Cooke defaulted on a loan with them.

{{Clist constructive trusts}}
The most recent set of cases appear, however, to have moved further. In ''[[Stack v Dowden]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2007] UKHL 17&lt;/ref&gt; a couple with four children who lived together for 18 years had registered a house in both their names. However, Ms Dowden had contributed more money. She claimed that the presumption of equal ownership should be displaced and that she should therefore have a share that was greater than half, and the House of Lords agreed that she owned 65% of the beneficial interest. Although not concerning the same point, Lord Walker noted that the law since Lord Bridge's decision in ''[[Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset]]'' "has moved on", regarding the question of what matters in quantifying people's shares in a home. The majority also remarked that in family situations, constructive trusts provided more utility where the court had greater flexibility to quantify people's interests free from tangible financial contributions, and that resulting trusts were more appropriate to commercial relationships, where the quantification of a person's interest would more match financial contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[2007] UKHL 17, [32] and [69], per Baroness Hale, 'the domestic context is very different from the commercial world.'&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in ''[[Kernott v Jones]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2010] EWCA Civ 578, [2011] UKSC 53&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Jones and Mr Kernott had had two children and were both on the registered title. However, from 1993 to 2008, Mr Kernott had moved out, and Ms Jones was raising the children, paying the mortgage and the house expenses. In [[TLATA 1996]] section 14 proceedings, Court of Appeal upheld his claim for 50% of the property, arguing that with absolutely no evidence of any intention otherwise, it could not be the courts' role to "impute" the intentions of the parties. The Supreme Court reversed this, finding that Ms Jones did indeed own 90% of the home's equity, and this could readily be inferred from all the circumstances. In the Privy Council, in ''[[Abbott v Abbott]]'' Baroness Hale more squarely affirmed that the "parties' whole course of conduct in relation to the property must be taken into account in determining their shared intentions as to its ownership."&lt;ref&gt;[2007] UKPC 53, [20]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it still remains unclear to what extent (and why) the law on cohabiting couples, after four decades, remains different from that for married couples under the 1970 and 1973 Acts.

===Proprietary estoppel===
{{Clist proprietary estoppel}}
{{main article|Proprietary estoppel|Unconscionability|Promissory estoppel}}
Proprietary estoppel is the third principal mechanism to acquire rights over property, seen particularly in the case of land. Unlike a contract or gift, which depend on consent, or resulting and constructive trusts that depend primarily on the fact of contribution, a proprietary estoppel arises when a person has been given a clear assurance, it was reasonable of them to rely on the assurance, and they have acted to their detriment. This threefold pattern of proprietary estoppel (clear assurance, reasonable reliance and substantial detriment) makes it consistent with its partner in the law of obligations, "[[promissory estoppel]]". Although English law has not yet recognised promissory estoppel as giving rise to a cause of action, (as has been done under the American [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] §90) in ''[[Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd]]'' Lord Scott remarked that proprietary estoppel should be seen as a sub-species of promissory estoppel. In all cases it allows people who act on others' assurances about legal rights, even without them attaining express agreement. For example, in ''[[Dillwyn v Llwellyn]]'', a son was held to have acquired a house from his father because he was given a written notice that he would, despite never having completed a deed for conveyance, after the son spent time and money improving the property.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dillwyn v Llwellyn]]'' (1862) 4 De GF&amp;J 517&lt;/ref&gt; And in ''[[Crabb v Arun DC]]'' a farmer acquired the right to a path over the council's land, because they had assured him that if he sold off one portion an access point would remain.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Crabb v Arun District Council]]'' [1975] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1975/7.html EWCA Civ 7]&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, the minimum pattern of an assurance, reliance and some form of detriment is present.

[[File:Park Mews, Church Street, Riddings - 594693.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Greasley v Cooke]]'', over a house in [[Riddings]], the Court of Appeal affirmed that once an assurance is found, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that it was not relied up to the claimant's detriment.]]
Proprietary estoppel case law has, however, divided on the question of what kind of assurance and what kind of reliance must be present. In  ''[[Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd]]'', a property developer claimed an interest in a group of [[Knightsbridge]] flats after his expense in obtaining council planning permission.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cobbe v Yeoman's Row]]'' [2008] UKHL 55&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Cobbe had made an oral agreement with the flat owner, Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, to get the flats at £12m, but once permission was obtained, the owner broke her oral promise. Even so, in the House of Lords Mr Cobbe failed in his claim for anything more than the expense (£150,000) of getting the planning, because in this commercial context it was clear that formal deeds were needed for completion of any deal. By contrast, in ''[[Thorner v Majors]]'', David (a second cousin) worked on Peter's farm for 30 years and believed he would inherit it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thorner v Majors]]'' [2009] UKHL 18&lt;/ref&gt; This probably was intended but after Peter fell out with other relatives, he destroyed his will, leaving David with nothing. Even though no specific assurance, and only some vague conduct indicating an assurance, was present, the House of Lords held that David had a good proprietary estoppel claim. [[Lord Hoffmann]] remarked that if a reasonable person could understand, however oblique and allusive, that an assurance was given, a legal right would accrue. The tendency of the cases is therefore to recognise claims more in the domestic context, which less formal assurances are common, and less so in the commercial context, where formality is normal.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Taylor Fashions and Old &amp; Campbell v Liverpool Victoria Trustees]]'' [1982] QB 133, where one business (Taylor) lost against a department store for a lease renewal because it would have improved premises anyway, but another (Old's) succeeded because it was specifically encouraged to make improvements.&lt;/ref&gt;

A difficult issue, however, in awarding a remedy for estoppel is that unlike a [[English contract law|contract]] it is not always apparent that a claimant should receive the full measure of what they had expected. By contrast, the factual pattern of estoppels, which often appear something very close to a contract, often seem to warrant more than an award for damages to compensate claimants for the amount of detriment, or loss, as in a [[English tort law|tort]] case. In ''[[Jennings v Rice]]'', [[Robert Walker LJ]] tackled the issue by emphasising that the [[purpose]] of the court's jurisdiction was to avoid an unconscionable result, and to ensure that a remedy was based on proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Henry v Henry]]'' [2010] UKPC 3, [2010] 1 All ER 988&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Mr Jennings had worked as a gardener for a Mrs Royle since the 1970s, but the administrator of her estate had no will. Mr Jennings had been told he "would be alright" and more so that "this will all be yours one day". The Court of Appeal resolved, however, that not the full estate, worth £1.285m, but only £200,000 would be awarded in view of the actual detriment incurred by Mr Jennings and the uncertainty of what his assurances really meant. In relation to third parties, the remedy for proprietary estoppel has been confirmed to bind others by the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] section 116.

Courts since have fought over the extent to which [[eminent domain]] is used for the public good.]]
Although land may be acquired by consent, and conduct which raises another party's reasonable expectations, these private methods of acquiring land are often insufficient for adequate public regulation.&lt;ref&gt;See K Gray and SF Gray, ''Land Law'' (7th edn 2011) Ch 11, 563–569&lt;/ref&gt; Building national infrastructure, such as railways, housing, and sewerage, as well as democratically determined planning rules, either by national or local government, typically requires [[compulsory purchase]], because private owners might not give up land required for public works except at an extortionate price. Historically, compulsory purchases were carried out under the [[Inclosure Acts]] and their predecessors, where enclosure of common land was frequently a method of expropriating people from [[common land]] for the benefit of barons and landlords. In the [[industrial revolution]], most railways were built by private companies procuring compulsory purchase rights from private Acts of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;Procedures were consolidated by the [[Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]] and the [[Inclosure Act 1845]].&lt;/ref&gt; though by the late 19th century, powers of compulsory purchase slowly became more transparent and used for general social welfare, as with the [[Public Health Act 1875]], or the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Public Health Act 1875]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/38-39/55/part/V/crossheading/purchase-of-lands/enacted ss 175–178] and [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/48-49/72/crossheading/labouring-glasses-lodging-houses/enacted s 2(2)] for compulsory purchase provisions.&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory purchase legislation was significantly extended during World War I for military use,&lt;ref&gt;[[Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act 1916]]&lt;/ref&gt; and after the war for housing, as certain principles became standardised.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919]]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[Land Compensation Act 1961]] section 5 generally requires that the owner of an interest in land (e.g. a freehold, leasehold or easement as in ''[[Re Ellenborough Park]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1955] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1955/4.html EWCA Civ 4], [1956] Ch 131&lt;/ref&gt;) receives payment for the "value of the land... if sold on an open market by a willing seller".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Director of Buildings and Lands v Shun Fung Ironworks Ltd]]'' [1995] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1995/1995_7.html UKPC 7], on the assessments for compensation.&lt;/ref&gt; Compensation is often also available for losses to a home, or if one's business has to move.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]]'' [1976] 1 WLR 852&lt;/ref&gt; In turn the [[Compulsory Purchase Act 1965]] set conditions for a purchase to be made, and the [[Acquisition of Land Act 1981]] regulates the conditions for granting a "[[Compulsory Purchase Order]]". Typically, either central government represented by a Secretary of State, or a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]] will be interested in making a compulsory purchase. The authority of local councils for make purchases for specific reasons can be set out in specific legislation, such as the [[Highways Act 1980]] to build roads when strictly necessary. However the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] section 226,&lt;ref&gt;Inserted by the [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]] s 99&lt;/ref&gt; which allows compulsory purchase to "facilitate the carrying out of development, re-development or improvement" for the area's economic, social, or environmental well being, must be confirmed by the Secretary of State, and similarly the [[Local Government Act 1972]] section 121 requires the council seek approval from the government Minister, a time-consuming process which prevents compulsory purchase being carried out without co-ordination in central government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Local Government Act 1972]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/part/VII/crossheading/land-transactions-principal-councils s 121]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Walker]] stressed that "powers of compulsory acquisition, especially in a "private to private" acquisition, amounts to a serious invasion of the current owner's proprietary rights."&lt;ref&gt;[2010] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/20.html UKSC 20], [84]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless compulsory purchase orders have frequently been used to acquire land that is passed back to a private owner, including in ''[[Alliance Spring Ltd v First Secretary]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2005] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/18.html EWHC 18 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt; where homes in [[Islington]] were purchased to build the [[Emirates stadium]] for [[Arsenal Football Club]]. By contrast, in ''[[James v United Kingdom]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1986] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1986/2.html ECHR 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]], the inherited owner of most of [[Mayfair]] and [[Belgravia]], contended that leaseholders' right to buy had violated their [[right to property]] in [[ECHR Protocol 1, article 1]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]], which allowed tenants to purchase properties from their private landlords, was within a member state's margin of appreciation. It was competent for a member state to regulate property rights in the public interest.

Another issue of whether regulatory or planning decisions in general might breach property rights has not been important for the United Kingdom. In a divided case by the [[US Supreme Court]] called ''[[Lucas v South Carolina Coastal Council]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|505|1003|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; a majority held that if a regulation prevented a property owner developing land (in this case to preserve coastline beaches) compensation would have to be paid. This has not been followed in most of the rest of the Commonwealth,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Canada, ''[[Mariner Real Estate Ltd v Nova Scotia]]'' (1999) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/1999/1999canlii7241/1999canlii7241.html 177 DLR (4th) 696]&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Grape Bay Ltd v Attorney General of Bermuda]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1999/43.html UKPC 43]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Privy Council]] advised that a decision by a democratic legislature is better than a court to determine issues of social and economic policy in relation to property. Here, [[McDonald's]] attempted to sue [[Bermuda]] for passing legislation to prevent it opening a restaurant as a breach of "property rights" under the Bermudan constitution, which it said consisted in the expectation of being able to run a business and various contractual arrangements to that end. [[Lord Hoffmann]] held that there was no such violation of property, noting that the "give and take of civil society frequently requires that the exercise of private rights should be restricted in the general public interest." The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, though not fully clear, indicates a similar approach.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Matos e Silva, LDA v Portugal]]'' [1996] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/37.html ECHR 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse possession===
{{Clist adverse possession}}
{{main article|Adverse possession}}
The most contentious method of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land, is [[adverse possession]]. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the [[middle ages]], those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned. A more modern function has been that land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another's property if continual use is made. [[Squatting in England]] has been a way for land to be efficiently [[utility|used]], particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the [[Land Registration Act 2002]], if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner's right of action to eject the "adverse possessor" would expire. The common legal justification was that under the [[Limitation Act 1980]], just like a cause of action in [[English contract law|contract]] or [[English tort law|tort]] had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reform Committee, 21st Report, ''Final Report on Limitation of Actions'' (1977) Cmnd 6923, para 1.7&lt;/ref&gt; Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely to the interests of the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of "possession" that was "adverse" were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim. However, in the [[LRA 2002]] adverse possession of registered land became much harder. The rules for unregistered land remained as before. But under the [[LRA 2002]] Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor was entitled to apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar would then contact the registered title holder and notify them of the application. If no proceedings were launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Before, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;See generally JE Stake, 'The Uneasy Case for Adverse Possession' (2000–2001) 89 Georgetown Law Journal 2419&lt;/ref&gt; The darker side, was that this idea was also very convenient for an age when land was often taken by force, and when doctrines like ''[[terra nullius]]'' were espoused by imperialists as justifications for colonisation in [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]]'' [1992] [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1992/23.html HCA 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chester Square Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 268158.jpg|thumb|left|[[Squatting in England and Wales|Squatters]] who remain long enough acquire good title to the land, but the [[LRA 2002]] changes made acquiring title by squatting far harder.]]
Before the considerable hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the [[Limitation Act 1980]], the time when adverse possession began was when "possession" was taken. This had to be more than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Leigh v Jack]]'' (1879) 5 Ex D 264&lt;/ref&gt; But "possession" did not require actual occupation. So in ''[[Powell v McFarlane]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1979) 38 P&amp;CR 352&lt;/ref&gt; it was held to be "possession" when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an [[intention]] to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered "adverse" if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in ''[[BP Properties Ltd v Buckler]]'', Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life.&lt;ref&gt;(1988) 55 P&amp;CR 337&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, under the [[Limitation Act 1980]] sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly. In ''[[JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham]]'', Mr and Mrs Graham had been let a part of Mr Pye's land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, on the basis that this might disturb getting [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|planning permission]].&lt;ref&gt;[2002] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/30.html UKHL 30]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], arguing that his business should receive £10&amp;nbsp;million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under [[ECHR Protocol 1, article 1]] to "peaceful enjoyment of possessions".&lt;ref&gt;The point has been made by O Jones, 'Out with the Owners: The Eurasian Sequels to J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. United Kingdom' (2008) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1688188 27 Civil Justice Quarterly 260–276], that adverse possession should be incapable of infringing the ECHR's concept of the right to property precisely because the person deprived has given up "possession".&lt;/ref&gt; The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules.&lt;ref&gt;[2008] 1 EHRLR 132&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fairweather v St Marylebone Property Co Ltd]]'' [1963] AC 510&lt;/ref&gt; However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to stop adverse possession in its tracks.

==Priority among owners==
[[File:Bodiam-castle-10My8-1197.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The metaphor that a "person's home is their castle" is recognised as a principle of [[English law]], giving owners the right through crime, tort or judicial review against interference with their possessions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Southam v Smout]]'' [1963] 1 QB 308, 320, per Lord Denning MR. The first use of the phrase comes from a 1505 opinion of Chief Justice John Fineux in a King's Bench, reported in the Year Books (the records of litigation from about 1300 to 1535). In ''[[Semayne's case]]'' (1604) 77 ER 194, [[Sir Edward Coke]] used the same phrase. Pitt the Elder put England's priority for landed interests most eloquently in 1763, opposing an excise tax on perry and cider. 'The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail – its roof may shake – the wind may blow through it – the storm may enter – the rain may enter – but the King of England cannot enter – all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.' [[Francis Thackeray]], ''A History of the Right Honorable William Pitt'' (1827) vol. 2, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Because land and the things on it can be enjoyed by a number of people at once, the law must accommodate multiple interests in its ownership rules, and often determine whose interests have priority. When the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] of land is owned by one person, no conflict will arise in who has priority of its use. In the Latin phrase, ''[[Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas]]'', one may, in general, use property in any way so long as it harms nobody else.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vaughan v Menlove]]'' (1837) 132 ER 490 (CP) where the claimant, whose cottages were burnt down, successfully sued a neighbour whose poorly built haystacks ignited and spread fire.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the owner the sole right to bring claims in [[English criminal law|crime]] or [[English tort law|tort]], particularly for others causing a [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]], or committing a [[Trespass in English law|trespass]], against the owner's peaceful enjoyment of property. Depending on the nature of interference, an owner may also have claims for compensation against state authorities who seek to [[compulsorily purchase]] property, or state officials who wish to enter or search property. However, when more than one person is interested in real estate, rules of ownership priority are needed to determine who may bring claims. Rules must also determine the content of rights that the interested parties have among one another. First of all, land may be co-owned in two main ways. In a "[[joint tenancy]]", the law presumes owners agree that if one owner dies, his or her whole share will pass to the other owners. The case law primarily deals with the conditions under which a tenant's share will be severed to create a "tenancy in common", where there is no right to survivorship, and then under what conditions a tenant in common may require the property be sold to realise its value. Second, owners may [[lease]] their property to tenants for a defined period of time. The law also recognises that owners may simply [[licence]] their property for use by others, which in theory creates only personal rights. Largely because more statutory and common law privileges attach to leases, the courts have been careful to police the boundary between the two. Third, English property law recognises the ability to charge or mortgage assets to a lender with a loan contract. This means that if the owner defaults on repayments, the lender has the security of being permitted to take possession of and to sell the property. And fourth, neighbouring property owners may create rights to use or restrict each other's use of their land through [[easement]]s and [[covenant (law)|covenants]]. Although such things may arise by agreement, English law acknowledges their proprietary character, and so they bind successors in title.

===Co-ownership and termination===
{{Clist coownership}}
{{See also|Concurrent estate|Jus accrescendi|Four unities}}
While a sole owner will generally be free to use and dispose of his interest in the way he sees fit, the rules differ when land is under co-ownership. The [[Law of Property Acts]], which aimed to improve land's transferability on the market, required that land could have a maximum of four co-owners, who must all have the same title. This means that a purchaser need only deal with a maximum of four people to buy an interest (e.g. an outright purchase, or a mortgage) in it. The [[Law of Property Act 1925]] sections 1(6) and 36(2) prohibits a divided legal title, known as a "tenancy in common". If there are more people with a co-ownership interest, then by the Law of Property Act 1925 section 34(2) the first four people named on a conveyance will be deemed by law to be trustees for the further co-owners.&lt;ref&gt;Under [[Trustee Act 1925]] s 34(2) the same goes for the creation of trusts purporting to have more than four trustees.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect these first four people become legal representatives for the other owners in equity. Although to simplify conveyancing the law does not, [[Equity (finance)|equity]] does recognise unlimited numbers of co-owners, and owners with unequal interests (i.e. "tenants in common"). If land is traded, their interests will be considered "overreached", or effectively bought out over their heads with their interest detached from the land and reattached to purchase money, if money is paid to at least two trustees. The requirement for two trustees to receive the money is intended to reduce danger of one trustee running off with money to the detriment of the equitable owners. In the first main form of co-ownership, known as "[[joint tenancy]]", the joint tenants are deemed to share equally in the value of the property if it is sold, and if one joint tenant dies, the others will (by the "right of survivorship" or ''[[jus accrescendi]]'' in Latin) take the whole of his share. This is a legal presumption, and owners are free to stipulate that they wish their share to be apportioned differently (e.g. depending on financial contribution to the property), and that they wish someone else to inherit their share. When making a transfer of property on HM Land Registry's "TR1" form, owners may indicate which relation they choose,&lt;ref&gt;See HM Land Registry's [http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/_media/downloads/forms/TR1.pdf TR1 form].&lt;/ref&gt; however in ''[[Stack v Dowden]]'' the Supreme Court observed that this will not always be decisive, particularly where people do not have full understanding of the survivorship rule and have made very unequal financial contributions to the property. But otherwise, co-owners will remain as joint tenants in equity until they take action to sever their share.

[[File:008-Josiah Leavitt (d. Dec 19th, 1717) grave, Hingham Center Cemetery, Hingham, Plymouth Co., MA.jpg|thumb|left|Severance of a joint tenancy into a "tenancy in common" must be effected before death, unless it is desired that the share in the property will pass to co-owners.]]
Severance in [[Equity (finance)|equity]] can be achieved in five main ways. Firstly, the most certain way to sever is to serve a statutory notice under Law of Property Act 1925 section 36 on the other joint tenants "a notice in writing of such desire" to sever one's share. Some courts have construed this provision restrictively, so in ''[[Harris v Goddard]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1983] 3 All ER 242, [1983] 1 WLR 1203&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that because Mrs Harris in her divorce petition requested merely that "such order be made... in respect of the former matrimonial home", and did not request that an order be made immediately, she had not yet severed her share. This meant that when Mr Harris unexpectedly died after a car crash, she was able to remain a joint tenant and inherit the whole home, and the children of Mr Harris' first marriage did not. A notice will be considered effective, or "served" under Law of Property Act 1925 section 196 when it is left at a person's home or office, or if posted and so long as it does not go undelivered (in contrast to the [[postal rule]]) when it would ordinarily arrive. In ''[[Kinch v Bullard]]'' Mrs Johnson was terminally ill, and wished to sever her share of the home and sent a letter, but when she realised that Mr Johnson was ill too and would die first, she wanted to cancel her severance notice. Neuberger J held that because the letter was already delivered to Mr Johnson's house, it could not be withdrawn, even though Mr Johnson had not yet read it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kinch v Bullard]]'' [1998] 4 All ER 650, [1999] 1 WLR 423&lt;/ref&gt; Second, and in contrast to the formalistic approach for section 36, it was held in ''[[Burgess v Rawnsley]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1975] Ch 429&lt;/ref&gt; that a course of dealings between two people can manifest the intention to sever. Mr Burgess had discussed with Ms Rawnsley selling her share in a property for £750 but negotiations stalled when she asked for more, and then he unexpectedly died. "'Even if there was not any firm agreement but only a course of dealing", said [[Lord Denning MR]], "it clearly evinced an intention by both parties that the property should henceforth be held in common and not jointly." Third, simply making an agreement to sell one's share will be counted by the courts as severing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brown v Raindle]]'' (1796) 3 Ves 296, 30 ER 998&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, the declaration of bankruptcy effects severance, as under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] section 306, a bankrupt's estate will vest immediately in the [[trustee in bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Re Palmer]]'' [1994] Ch 316, where the declaration of a man's bankruptcy after his death meant that his wife could inherit the home free from his creditors' claims. However the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] s 421A, mysteriously added by [[Insolvency Act 2000]], now states creditors can ask a court to backdate claims unless "circumstances are exceptional".&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth, killing a joint tenant will sever a share, because the [[Forfeiture Act 1982]] generally prevents a killer to benefit from his wrong. However, in ''[[Re K]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1985] Ch 85; [1985] Ch 180&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal upheld a claim by a lady to be relieved from forfeiture using a discretion in section 2. Mrs K had shot and killed her husband, but only after prolonged [[domestic violence]], and she had been cleared of murder because it did not count as intentional. Lastly, if practical, beneficial owners may request trustees to physically partition property under [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]] section 7, and compensate the different owners in money as is appropriate.

When co-owners fall into disagreement over how land is to be used, the [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]] guides who can live in the property or when it can be sold. One of the primary purposes of [[TLATA 1996]], given the massive growth of co-ownership and people acquiring interests in land through trusts, was to reduce the occasions on which land would be sold if that meant people would lose their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission]], ''Transfer for Land: Trusts of Land'' (1989) paras 3.1–3.5&lt;/ref&gt; At the highest level of generality, [[TLATA 1996]] section 6 says the legal trustees of a property (i.e. the legal owners on the title, rather than the owners in equity) generally have all the powers of an absolute owner, but should pay regard to beneficiaries and owe them a duty of care. More importantly, sections 11 to 13 give beneficiaries a limited right to occupy a property if this accords with the interest and purpose of the trust, if land is suitable for occupation, although trustees may restrict this right if reasonable. If disagreements are insoluble, section 14 allows a beneficial owner to apply to court for sale. Section 15 requires that the court pays regard (i) to the intentions of the settlor (ii) to the purpose of the trust (iii) the interests of any children living there, and (iv) the interests of secured creditors. This means that in a common case where a bank is pressing for sale of a family home, its interests do not override all others. So in ''[[Mortgage Corporation v Shaire]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2000/452.html EWHC Ch 452], [2001] Ch 743&lt;/ref&gt; where Mr Shaire had forged his wife's signature to get a mortgage on their home and died, and the bank sought possession and a sale under [[TLATA 1996]] section 15, Neuberger J held that he would postpone the sale, because it was still her home. However [[TLATA 1996]] went further when a creditor has become insolvent. It inserted in the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] new sections 283A and 335A, which say that at the point of bankruptcy, the decision to order a sale should be guided by (a) the interests of the bankrupt's creditors, (b) the spouse's conduct, their resources, the children's needs, and any other need, except for the bankrupt's own. However under section 335A(3) after one year expires, a court must order sale of property to realise its value for creditors "unless the circumstances of the case are exceptional". So only in extreme situations, as where losing a home might worsen the occupant's schizophrenia,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Raval]]'' [1998] 2 FLR 718&lt;/ref&gt; have courts postponed sales. Because the legislation is so heavily pro-bank, the suggestion was made in ''[[Nicholls v Lan]]'' that it may well violate the right to a family life in [[ECHR article 8]].&lt;ref&gt;[2006] EWHC 1255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leases and licences===

[[File:Portobello Road, W11 - geograph.org.uk - 237808.jpg|thumb|left|[[Affordability of housing in the United Kingdom|Affordable]] accommodation has steadily declined since the 1970s, with prices trebling between 1980 and 2010 UK wide, and rental prices escalating further.&lt;ref&gt;See Office for National Statistics, [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/people-places/housing-and-households/housing-market Housing Market Publications].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As opposed to sharing full ownership, and without dividing land physically, the use and enjoyment of land can be shared when owners grant licences or leases. The difference between the two matters because a lease counts as a property right that binds third parties even if a freehold changes hands, and because more statutory protection for tenants attaches only to leases, albeit that many cases have increased protection for license holders too. A licence is said to be a personal obligation, which in traditional theory was said to create rights enforceable only between the people privy to the licence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thomas v Sorrell]]'' (1673) Vaugh 330, 351, Vaughan CJ, 'A dispensation or licence properly passeth no interest, nor alters or transfers property in any thing, but only makes an action lawful which, without it, had been unlawful.'&lt;/ref&gt; First, licences may arise by implication of the law, such as when a customer walks through an open shop door. The customer is recognised as having a "bare licence" which makes him immune from an action for trespass, and can only be asked to leave over within a reasonable time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Winter Garden Theatre (London) Ltd v Millennium Productions Ltd]]'' [1948] AC 173, 204, Lord Macdermott, 'one who remains on the land of another after his licence to use it has terminated will not be considered a trespasser before he has had a reasonable time in which to vacate the premises… This period of grace can, of course, be the subject of agreement… ascribed to a rule of law rather than to an implied stipulation.'&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they may arise by statute, as with the [[Family Law Act 1996]] sections 30–31. Third, they may arise by estoppel. And practically most important, licences can arise through a contract. This will set the terms of the land's use by the licensee. For example, in ''[[Hurst v Picture Theatres Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1915] 1 KB 1&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Hurst was removed from a [[Kensington High Street|High Street Kensington]] theatre by a manager who honestly believed that he had not paid for his ticket. Buckley LJ held the theatre was not entitled to remove him, even if it revoked the ticket, because with, and in addition to [[breach of contract]] they committed assault on him, for which he could claim additional damages. However, breach of contractual licence will not entitle the victim to force his way back, so in ''[[Thompson v Park]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1944] KB 408&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher who tried to force his way back into a school was told he had no remedy because he should have sought a court declaration first. If possible, and as damages will often be inadequate, the courts show preference for awarding specific performance. This was so even when the claimant was the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], who had licensed a Pavilion for its annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Verrall v Great Yarmouth BC]]'' [1981] QB 202&lt;/ref&gt;

This preference for specific performance has been manifested generally in providing more "property-like" rights for licensees. In ''[[Manchester Airport plc v Dutton]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2000] QB 133&lt;/ref&gt; an airport company, with a licence on National Trust land, was held entitled to claim that trespassing protesters could be removed. Its contractual right was held to be better than the trespassers' right to remain. Then, in ''[[Errington v Wood]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1952] 1 KB 290&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that when a father gave contractual licence to his son and daughter in law to remain in a [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] home till they paid the mortgage, and that the house would become theirs when they did, this became irrevocable. It was also held in ''[[Binions v Evans]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1972] EWCA Civ 6, [1972] Ch 359&lt;/ref&gt; that a [[constructive trust]] arose out of Mr and Mrs Binion promising the former owners of the Tredegar Estate that Mrs Evans could remain for life in her cottage. The Binions were bound by their promise, even though the promise was not to Mrs Evans. However, a later Court of Appeal in ''[[Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1988] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1988/14.html EWCA Civ 14], [1989] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; denied that constructive trusts should easily be created or that promises to could become binding on successors in title.

{{Clist leases}}
[[File:UK house prices. Nominal, real, and exponential trend, 1975 to 2017.png||thumb|400px|left|Since abolition of [[Rent regulation in England and Wales|fair rent regulation]] by the [[Housing Act 1980]], UK house prices periodically surged, taking an [[Affordability of housing in the United Kingdom|unaffordably]] high share of people's income. [[Real estate investment trust]]s, which get tax breaks for buying up residential property,&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Corporation Tax Act 2010]] ss 518-609.&lt;/ref&gt; fuel the surge.]]
However, of more contemporary social significance is the lease. Leases are most usually created by a contract. For short leases, under three years, there is no requirement for writing, and under seven years, there is no requirement for registration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law of Property Act 1925]] s 52(2) and [[LPMPA 1989]] s 2(5)&lt;/ref&gt; Longer leases, even if they do not fulfil formality and registration requirements will also arise in equity under the doctrine of anticipation, formulated in ''[[Walsh v Lonsdale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1882) 21 Ch D 9, a lease was created despite absence of formality, for the purpose of a mill owner having a right to [[distrain]] goods in satisfaction of a debt. Equity regards as done that which ought to be done.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the interest takes effect under a [[constructive trust]], in turn leading to protection for actual occupants.&lt;ref&gt;[[LRA 2002]] Sch 3, para 2&lt;/ref&gt; Formally known under the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 205(1)(xxvii) as a "term of years absolute", a lease divides property by time, and with a lease comes a measure of statutory protections for tenants. Under the old [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]], these were much more significant, in particular providing controls on escalating rental prices and granting a right to not have a tenancy ended without a good justification (an equivalent to the right to [[unfair dismissal]] in [[UK labour law]]). This protection was seen as necessary because of the [[inequality of bargaining power]] that tenants have.&lt;ref&gt;See, in relation to the [[Agricultural Holdings Act 1948]], ''[[Rugby Joint Water Board v Foottit]]'' [1973] AC 202, 234, Lord Simon, the Act was "'rendered necessary by [[inequality of bargaining power]] between landlord and tenant, so that reliance on the common law and the terms of the contract of tenancy was liable to cause injustice to the tenant. The inequality of bargaining power particularly affected the tenant after his rights ceased at common law..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clist tenant rights}}
However, during the 1980s, these rights were removed, along with most [[rent regulation]]. Under the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]], the most significant remaining protection is the section 11 obligation on landlords to repair properties' structures, water and heating facilities for short leases. The division, both historical and contemporary, has led to significant litigation over the meaning of a "lease". In the leading case, ''[[Street v Mountford]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1985] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1985/4.html UKHL 4], [1985] AC 809&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords identified the factual grant of exclusive possession of a property as being the distinguishing feature between a lease and a licence. Mrs Mountford paid a "licence fee" for her home, and had signed a form agreeing that the statute protecting leases from unfair rent rises (the [[Rent Act 1977]]) did not apply. She nevertheless argued that she had a lease, and the House of Lords agreed because despite the form of her agreements, the substance of the arrangement was to give her exclusive possession of her living space. According to Lord Templeman in ''[[AG Securities v Vaughan]]'', if people could contract out of them, any statutory protections "would be a dead letter because in a state of housing shortage a person seeking residential accommodation may agree to anything to obtain shelter."&lt;ref&gt;Also joined with ''[[Antoniades v Villiers]]'' [1988] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1988/3.html EWCA Civ 3], [1990] 1 AC 417, 458&lt;/ref&gt; For the question of whether a person has the benefit of statutory protection, it was held to be irrelevant (counter-intuitively among property lawyers) that the defendant itself has a proprietary interest. So in ''[[Bruton v London &amp; Quadrant Housing Trust]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1999] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/26.html UKHL 26]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Bruton's housing association only had a licence for the property from the council, and it was not doing repairs. Although Mr Bruton needed a lease to claim, and as a matter of property law he could not be granted a lease from a trust that only had a licence, for the purpose of statutory protection, the House of Lords agreed he was granted a lease, and so could request repairs.

===Mortgages and security===
{{Clist mortgages}}
{{See also|Mortgage industry of the United Kingdom|Mortgages in English law|Mortgage law|Security interest}}
While real property may be divided among co-owners and tenants for the purpose of the land's use and enjoyment, taking a mortgage of property primarily serves the purpose of ensuring loans are repaid. Because of the nature of money lending, and frequently [[unequal bargaining power]] between banks and borrowers, the law gives significant legal protection to borrowers against the enforcement of unfair bargains. Along with pledges, liens and equitable charges, English law counts a mortgage as one of four main kinds of [[security interest]], whereby a [[proprietary right]] that binds third parties is said to arise on conclusion of a [[freedom of contract|contract]]. It must simply be the contract's intention to make property available to secure repayment. The [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 85 say that a mortgage requires a deed (under [[LPMPA 1989]] section 1, a document that is signed, witnessed and states it is a deed). Under the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] sections 23 and 27, a notice of a mortgage must be filed with [[HM Land Registry]] for the mortgage to be effective. Then, [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 87 says mortgages confer upon the mortgagee (i.e. the secured lender) the same rights as a 3000-year lease holder. The reason for this reference to "3000 years" is that in a primitive protective measure, the common law said mortgage terms must always allow for the property to be redeemed in the end, when the debt is repaid. In the 18th century decision of ''[[Vernon v Bethell]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1762) [http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1762/18.html 28 ER 838]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Henley LC]] refused to enforce the conveyance of Vernon's sugar plantation in [[Antigua]] to a deceased London lender, Bethell, when Vernon had trouble repaying, even though some exchanges between the two had raised the possibility of giving up the land to satisfy the debt. Given the considerable interest paid already, Lord Henley LC held it would frustrate (or "clog") Vernon's right to redeem property. As he put it protection for the borrower was warranted because "necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men, but, to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may impose upon them". Accordingly, the rule developed that "once a mortgage, always a mortgage",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seton v Slade]]'' (1802) 7 Ves 265, 273&lt;/ref&gt; meaning a mortgage cannot be turned into a conveyance of the property by the operation of terms in an agreement. It means that a lender may at most sell a property to realise its value, but may not take ownership, and the borrower must always practically be able to get back the property. The rule was suspended for companies by the [[Companies Act 2006]] section 739, and was criticised in ''[[Jones v Morgan]]'' for being inappropriate in commerce,&lt;ref&gt;[2001] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/995.html EWCA Civ 995]&lt;/ref&gt; but it still survives as a rudimentary common law method to protecting vulnerable borrowers.

[[File:Slaves cutting the sugar cane - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate IV - BL.jpg|left|thumb|In 1762, in ''[[Vernon v Bethell]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1762) [http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1762/18.html 28 ER 838]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Henley LC]] held that "[[necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men]]", so a mortgage lender was barred from acquiring his debtor's [[Antigua]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]]. The principle inspired the [[Second Bill of Rights]] in 1944, for social and economic rights in US legislation.]]
The most relevant protective measure at common law today is the right of borrowers to cancel mortgages if they were [[Misrepresentation in English law|misrepresented]] about the mortgage's terms, or if they entered agreements because of [[undue influence]]. In the leading case, ''[[Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2)|Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge]]'', a group of appeals all involved a husband allegedly pressuring his wife into signing a mortgage agreement with a bank, where security was over the family home.&lt;ref&gt;[2002] 2 AC 773&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Lords agreed that undue influence would make a contract voidable, and if a bank should have realised this possibility, it could not enforce the mortgage agreement against the spouse's share of the home. Accordingly, if banks wished to ensure valid mortgages they would need to have confirmation from an independent solicitor that the spouse fully understood the transaction. This ruling was intended to eliminate cases where people do not understand the consequences of mortgages. Alternatively, if despite independent advice, a spouse is still unduly influenced or is misrepresented the facts, he or she will have no recourse against a bank selling the home, but may have a claim against the solicitor for [[Professional negligence in English law|professional negligence]]. Beyond common law, there are three main kinds of statutory protection. First, the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]] codified a system of licensing for mortgage lenders. The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] maintains a Code of Practice and enforces compliance with the threat of license withdrawal. Second, the [[Consumer Credit Act 1974]] empowers the [[Office of Fair Trading]] to engage in similar regulation of the [[second mortgage]] market. Third, the content of mortgage is regulated by ordinary consumer contract protection in the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]. The general thrust of the law is to ensure complete transparency, and to cancel extortionate credit agreements, so that consumers know what they are getting, and do not get an [[Distributive justice|unfair]] bargain.

Money lenders have extensive rights from common law and statute. A mortgagee's first right is to repayment of the debt, but if the borrower's circumstances mean this is impossible, a process of taking possession of the mortgaged property and selling it usually begins. Almost every step, however, is mediated through court. The [[Administration of Justice Act 1970]] section 36 says that the court may adjourn proceedings if the "mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due&lt;ref&gt;[[Administration of Justice Act 1973]] s 8 was enacted to prevent banks using "acceleration" provisions, saying all sums would be due at the date of default.&lt;/ref&gt; under the mortgage", and the [[Consumer Credit Act 1974]] sections 129–130 does the same for second mortgages. In an anomalous case, ''[[Ropaigealach v Barclays Bank plc]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] QB 263&lt;/ref&gt; a bank had auctioned off a (second) house the owning a family was away. Clarke LJ felt unable to apply the AJA 1970, because properly construed, it was only able to halt proceedings when legal proceedings had in fact been launched, and here there were none. In a more borrower-friendly decision, ''[[Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society v Norgan]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1996] 1 WLR 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Douglas Waite|Waite LJ]] gave guidance that in ordering a plan for repayment, a judge should give "the period most favourable to the mortgagor at the outset", so that repeated applications to court on continuing defaults could be avoided, and so that "the mortgagee can be heard with justice to say that the mortgagor has had his chance". When it comes to a sale, Law of Property Act 1925 sections 101 and 103 require that the provision for sale must have been in the mortgage deed, that three months notice and space must be given. Section 88 confirms that a buyer after a sale receives an unencumbered title. In the sale process itself, there is a duty of care. In ''[[Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1971] Ch 949&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual Finance auctioned Cuckmere Brick Co's property after it had defaulted on a loan, but failed to advertise that the property had secured planning permission for building more flats. Salmon LJ emphasised that because the borrower will still be liable for sums on a loan if a house is undersold, because the "mortgagor is vitally affected by the result of the sale", an obligation is owed to get "the true market value." Moreover, a higher duty of scrutiny will be imposed if a mortgagee sells to a related party. In ''[[Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit Sen]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1983] 3 All ER 54&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Wong sold property taken from Mr Tse to his wife, after not advertising the auction. The Privy Council advised that while delay in the claim meant the sale should not be set aside, damages could be awarded because of the significant [[conflict of interest]]. [[Lord Templeman]] emphasised that "a heavy onus lies on the mortgagee to show that in all respects he acted fairly" so the transaction is perfectly fair and equal.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[York Buildings Co v MacKenzie]]'' (1795) 3 Paton 378&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easements===
{{Clist easements}}
{{Main article|Easements in English law|Profit a prendre|Wayleave}}
[[File:Ellenborough Park, Weston-super-mare.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ellenborough Park, Weston-super-Mare]].]]
Easements and covenants, although treated separately by law, both functioned as primitive forms of planning device. Before the development of local government and planning, people living in neighbouring property could only regulate how each used their land through agreements. An agreement for a first neighbour to use the land of a second is an easement, usually involving a right of way, or a ''[[profit a prendre]]'', if it allows the first to take something from the land (e.g. hunting ducks, fishing, or grazing sheep). An agreement for a first neighbour to refrain using his own land for the benefit of a second would be a [[restrictive covenant]]. Naturally people could contract to use land in any way conceivable. However the courts viewed it as a different matter whether a successor in title to the original contracting party was bound. Courts were particularly chary with "[[positive covenants]]" (which might require a landowner's expenditure and could not be fulfilled by doing nothing) and "[[negative easements]]" (which unlike covenants might be acquired without agreement). As a result, modern planning decisions by councils, primarily through the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], largely displaced the common law and equity to regulate relations in neighbourhoods. Yet many easements and covenants remain.

The range of easements is primarily restricted by a fourfold test laid out in ''[[Re Ellenborough Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1955] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1955/4.html EWCA Civ 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The homeowners around [[Ellenborough Park, Weston-super-Mare|Ellenborough Park]] wished to show they had an easement over the communal gardens to claim compensation for its requisition in World War II. [[Lord Evershed MR]] agreed because (1) they owned the dominant tenements, (2) their rights to the "servient" tenement (i.e. the park) benefited their land (3) they did not own the servient tenement, and, despite some prior authority suggesting easements could not be for pure pleasure,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Aldred's case]]'' (1610) 9 Co Rep 57b, it was said that 'The law does not give action for such things of delights', in relation a right to light, but this was only contrasted for a method of acquisition by necessity.&lt;/ref&gt; (4) it was within a recognised class of easements. Most often, easements are rights of way. Many recent cases have also involved car parking, including ''[[Moncrieff v Jamieson]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2007] UKHL 42&lt;/ref&gt; where the owner of land between the shoreline and a steep escarpment only had access through his neighbour's, and he had, from 1973 become used to parking there. The servient tenement owner claimed the car parking took away his use of the land, and so could not be an easement. But the House of Lords held that in the nature of parking (which was not permanent) to which the dominant owner had become accustomed, the right could count as an easement.

To create an easement, first, under [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 65(1) a landowner may expressly grant a neighbour a right over his land, or may reserve a right when selling a portion of land to someone else. Second, an easement may also come about through an express assurance, triggering [[proprietary estoppel]]. This was the case in ''[[Crabb v Arun District Council]]'', where a landowner acquired an easement after the council assured him they would leave him access to his land over theirs, when he sold another portion that gave the route in from the main road. Third, the law may find easements by a process of construction, in general, if they are necessary for property's reasonable enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wheeldon v Burrows]]'' (1879) 12 LR Ch D 31, 49, per [[Thesiger LJ]], though here an easement for light into a building was not implied, it being held unnecessary.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are analogous to incorporation and implication terms in contracts, so for instance in ''[[Green v Lord Somerleyton]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2003] EWCA Civ 198&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Parker LJ approved an easement for drainage of water from Lord Somerleyton's land into Green's dykes, because when land was sold on in 1921 its proper construction incorporated a drainage deed. In ''[[Kent v Kavanagh]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2006] EWCA Civ 162, [2007] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; it was clarified, however, that because reasonable enjoyment was the aim of implication, an easement was only to be implied in situations where land was in common ownership and occupation. This test was satisfied on those facts, where two semi-detached houses had a small path between them to access the back gardens, and a subsequent buyer wished to build into its half of the path. Chadwick LJ held the easement was necessary for enjoyment of the back garden. Fourth, under Law of Property Act 1925 section 62, easements that are "appertaining or reputed to appertain to the land" at the time of a conveyance will bind the purchaser. So in ''[[Hair v Gillman]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2000) 80 P&amp;CR 108&lt;/ref&gt; a lady who parked her car in a neighbour's forecourt while she had a seven-year lease acquired a crystallised lease when she subsequently bought the house. If easements are used for twenty years, however, a fifth method of acquiring a crystallised legal right is through the [[Prescription Act 1832]]. This method comes from simple period of extended use, and does not require showing any need for the easement. There are also a range of statutory easements, including, notably, "[[wayleaves]]" reserved by public authorities to install pipes or cables,&lt;ref&gt;''[[West Midlands Joint Electricity Authority v Pitt]]'' [1932] KB 1, regarding compensation for owners where wayleaves are installed.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] which extended the registered number of private and common lands where people have the "[[right to roam]]" for recreation. However created, an easement ought to be registered to ensure protection. An easement that is not registered will be recognised as an over-riding interest according to [[LRA 2002]] Schedule 3, paragraph 3, if known to a person to whom land is sold and if the easement is obvious on a reasonably careful inspection, but only if the easement is acquired at law (not equity) since 13 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Celsteel Ltd v Alton House Holdings Ltd]]'' [1985] 1 WLR 204 held that equitable easements would be treated as overriding interests under the old [[LRA 1925]] s 70(1) if obvious on an inspection, but this has been reversed from the [[LRA 2002]] Sch 3, para 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covenants===
{{Clist covenants}}
{{main article|Restrictive covenant}}
[[File:LS night time.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leicester Square]] in [[central London]] exists because a [[restrictive covenant]] was held to effectively bind successors in title in ''[[Tulk v Moxhay]]''.]]
Unlike an easement, a covenant can only be acquired through agreement or possibly by an assurance, but not by prescription. In the most famous case, ''[[Tulk v Moxhay]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1848) 2 Ph 774&lt;/ref&gt; the owner of what is now [[Leicester Square]] promised a neighbour he would not erect buildings, but the subsequent purchaser (who knew of this deal) tried to build. Lord Cottenham LC held that a prior covenant may bind future owners if the covenant touched and concerned the land, the original covenantees intended the covenant to bind future owners, and the future owners with the same land had notice of the covenant. Under [[Law of Property Act 1925]] section 78, successors in title to the person named to benefit from the covenant are deemed to have standing to enforce the covenant and Law of Property Act 1925 section 79 codified the presumption that a covenant is to be not personal, but proprietary, and binding on successors in title. That presumption, however, can be rebutted by construction of agreements between the neighbours. This happened in ''[[Morrells of Oxford Ltd v Oxford United Football Club]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2001] Ch 459&lt;/ref&gt; where Robert Walker LJ held that Morrell's pub could not get an injunction against the Oxford UFC building a pub, because although Oxford UFC's predecessor had promised not to in 1962, the document failed to use language indicating successors would be bound in the pub clause, when it did in other clauses. A controversial aspect of covenants is that courts only enforce ones which restrict land's use, and thus far have refused to enforce covenants that require positive expenditure. In ''[[Rhone v Stephens]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 2 AC 310&lt;/ref&gt; this meant that a house owner could not be required to repair his roof, which protected a cottage underneath from water. Lord Templeman viewed this would contradict the rule that someone should not be made liable to a contract when they have not been privy to it. This has been mitigated slightly when all neighbours have reciprocal benefits and burdens. ''[[Halsall v Brizell]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1957] Ch 169&lt;/ref&gt; held that if some Liverpool estate dwellers had the benefit of using the estate roads, drains, promenade, and sea walls, they could be required to pay for its upkeep. Covenants are enforceable, generally, through injunctions, but may also (if an injunction would be oppressive) enforceable through a payment of damages reflecting the loss of the right. For instance in ''[[Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1974] 1 WLR 798&lt;/ref&gt; a developer who built homes in breach of a restrictive covenant was ordered by Brightman J to pay 5% of his anticipated profits in compensation. Finally, applications to the Land Tribunal may be made for declarations to extinguish covenants under Law of Property Act 1925 section 84 if it is obsolete, the beneficiary would lose little, or has implicitly agreed, or it impedes a reasonable user of land and the beneficiary can be compensated.

While the typical content of "[[land law]]" texts in England or the United Kingdom concerns the content, creation and protection of interests in property in land,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. B McFarlane, N Hopkins and S Nield, ''Land Law: Text, Cases and Materials'' (OUP 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; the practical and social significance of land extends to the way it is used. Historically, land was the most important source of social wealth. Over the 19th century its role in preserving wealth was to a large extent eclipsed by [[United Kingdom company law|corporations]] and the [[English trust law|managed fund]], however land remains vital for housing, economic development, for agriculture and extraction of natural resources, and as its part of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;See [[P Birks]], 'Before we begin: five keys to land law’ in S Bright and Dewar (eds), ''Land Law: Themes and Perspectives'' (1998) 457, law relating to land ‘is a contextual subset of a legal-conceptual category’, but land touches (i) environment (ii) housing (iii) nuisance, trespass, etc (iv) trusts, where land can be an asset (v) content, creation and protection of interests of property in land.&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of private rights aside, public regulation of land use has sought to mediate the competing interests among competing stakeholders. In housing, the need of people to have a home is balanced between the interests of landlords in [[Rent seeking|seeking rents]] for profit, and governments in building and maintaining homes. Housing has remained a residual source of private investment income, which grew in the run up to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and after, while taxation of property remains a significant source of income for [[HM Treasury]]. Particularly since 1909, new national planning strategies were used to improve the quality of building, and distribute urban development in a way that reflected local priorities. Environmental protection policies limit the ways that land can be use, and the effects its use can have upon local communities. Finally, agriculture and resource extraction played a smaller part in the UK's economy than before but, along with a common strategy around the [[European Union]], these industries benefit from a system of subsidies and market regulations intended to make land use sustainable.

===Planning and infrastructure===

{{Clist planning}}
[[File:1744 Wren Map of London, England - Geographicus - London-wren-1744.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christopher Wren]]'s plan for redevelopment after the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 was never put into effect because people were unwilling to give up their pre-fire property boundaries, even despite the quick settlement procedure under the [[Fire of London Disputes Act 1666]].]]
In the centuries before 1909, the law of planning how land would be used was largely confined to the law of [[nuisance]], and agreements to between neighbours for [[easement]]s and [[Covenant (law)|covenants]]. This was not always true, because from the [[Magna Carta 1215]], and the subsequent development of the [[Charter of the Forest]] ("forest" being an old term for crown land) there was a significant body of law regarding the use of the [[Common land|commons]]: the public land that common folk could use for gathering food, wood, hunting, or herding. Statutes and case law regulated the types of activity the people could perform, and the extent to which they could use common property. But gradually over the 15th century and 16th century, the aristocracy began the enclosure movement, in effect privatising almost all property that had been common. The public law of land had passed into insignificance, it was common to hear the 19th century judiciary proclaim the importance of private rights, with barely detectable minimum of responsibility. For example, in 1865 in ''[[Taplin v Jones]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1865) 11 HLC 290&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Cranworth]] proclaimed that every "man... [has] a right to use his own land by building on it as he thinks most to his interest". Claimants could sue for a public or private [[nuisance]] from neighbours, but the case based definition of what counted as a nuisance was usually unfavourable to ordinary people. For example, there could be no objection for loss of amenity if a loud railway was run past one's house.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Penny and the South Eastern Railway Co]]'' (1857) and ''[[Duke of Buccleuch v Metropolitan Board of Works]]'' (1870)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' the Court of Appeal held that what counted as a nuisance would depend on the character of the locality, and this meant that 'what would be a nuisance in [[Belgrave Square]] would not necessarily be so in [[Bermondsey]]'.&lt;ref&gt;per (1879) 11 ChD 852 [[Thesiger LJ]]&lt;/ref&gt; Inadvertently this meant that the rich, like those in Belgrave Square might be protected, while the poor, in places like Bermondsey, had little control over their local environments. For this reason it was thought that democratically elected local councils ought to be given the power to determine how the land around them would be used. In modern jurisprudence, it has become a basic principle that property does carry social responsibility,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[South Bucks DC v Porter]]'' [2003] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/26.html UKHL 26], [10] per Lord Bingham&lt;/ref&gt; and that the extent of property rights that are recognised in law must be 'considered in relation to their social function'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wachauf v Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (1989) ECJ. See also ''[[O'Dwyer v Council of the European Union]]'' (1995) ECJ, the right to property is not 'an absolute prerogative in Community law'. [[Treaty of Rome]] art 222, EU law is in no way to 'prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership.'&lt;/ref&gt; The first major Act in the UK, the [[Housing, Town Planning etc Act 1909]], recognised this by giving local governments the authority to develop planning schemes, and employ inspectors, with appeal to a Local Government Board, initially regarding sanitary conditions. The [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]], however, made the most critical change, requiring that any development of land required permission from the local government, unless there was a relevant exception. Since then modern legislation has grown into a local, regional and national system of planning law. Together with rules on [[compulsory purchase]], it is designed to ensure the use of property is determined by the people in society who are most affected.

[[File:Milton-Keynes-OpenStreetMap.png|thumb|right|"[[New towns in the United Kingdom|New towns]]" are major examples of national infrastructure planning. Towns like [[Milton Keynes]] (est. 1967) can be designated by central government under the [[New Towns Act 1981]], though the powers have barely been used since the 1970s.]]
Today, the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] contains the basic planning rules.&lt;ref&gt;See E Fisher, B Lange and E Scotford, ''Environmental Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (2013) chs 18 (Planning law) and 19 (Environmental impact assessment)&lt;/ref&gt; Section 57 requires permission be granted for ‘development’ of land. Section 55 defines ‘development’ as building, engineering, mining, or making any material change to building, including demolition, or splitting a home into two. However, subsection 2 exempts changes to dwelling houses for something incidental to enjoyment, for agriculture or forestry, or changes of a property's use within a set of property ‘classes’.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; For many people making changes to business property, the [[Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987]] then becomes relevant. Each property use has a class. Class A1 includes shops like bookstores or hairdressers, class A3 includes cafes, class C1 is hotels, and class C3 is homes. If a change to a property's use is made within a class, no permission for alterations is needed. If permission is granted, it may be unconditional, or under section 106 the local authority can attach conditions that the landowner must follow. Sections 171A to 196C contain the enforcement rules, which include allowing local authorities to charge people with offences for breach of planning rules, and to have a right of entry to property. However, under section 171B, if someone has breached a planning rule, but no enforcement proceedings are brought within four years, there can be no charge: the landowner becomes immune. Sections 197 to 261 contain detailed rules about matters such as trees, advertisements, highways. For establishments that will be used for specific purposes, such as restaurants, pubs or clubs, the [[Licensing Act 2003]] sets out the procedures by which businesses can acquire a licence from their local authority, and the conditions (including time of trading, alcohol provision, and noise levels&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Scotland, the maximum noise level that can be heard by a neighbour is 31 [[decibels]] after 11&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;/ref&gt;) under which the establishment must be maintained.

==Theory==
{{see also|Property|English property law}}
*[[Aristotle]], ''[[Politics (Book)|Politics]]'' (350 BCE) Book II, Part V, "Property should be in a certain sense common, but, as a general rule, private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest, men will not complain of one another, and they will make more progress, because every one will be attending to his own business... And further, there is the greatest pleasure in doing a kindness or service to friends or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a man has private property. These advantages are lost by excessive unification of the state."
*[[J Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' (1690)
*[[JJ Rousseau]], ''[[Discourse on the Origin of Inequality]]'' (1754) "The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said "This is mine", and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody."
*[[FC Savigny]], ''Recht des Besitzes'' (1803)
*[[G Hegel]], ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'' (1820)
*[[P Proudhon]], ''What is property?'' (1840) 'I disclose a truth whose development we may try in vain to arrest; I write the preamble of our future constitution. This proposition which seems to you blasphemous – PROPERTY IS THEFT – would, if our prejudices allowed us to consider it, be recognised as the lightning-rod to shield us from the coming thunderbolt; but too many interests stand in the way! … must not justice be done and our education be finished? PROPERTY IS THEFT! … What a revolution in human ideas!’
*[[K Marx]], ''Letter to KB Schweizer'' (1 February 1865) '… since "theft" as a forcible violation of property presupposes the existence of property, Proudhon entangled himself in all sorts of fantasies, obscure even to himself, about true bourgeois property. During my stay in Paris in 1844 I came into personal contact with Proudhon. I mention this here because to a certain extent I am also to blame... In the course of lengthy debates often lasting all night, I infected him very much to his detriment with Hegelianism, which, owing to his lack of German, he could not study properly.’

The '''Federal Court of Canada''', which succeeded the '''Exchequer Court of Canada''' in 1971, was a national court of Canada that had limited jurisdiction to hear certain types of disputes arising under the [[Parliament of Canada|federal government]]'s [[Canadian federalism|legislative jurisdiction]]. The Court was split in 2003 into two separate Courts, the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] and the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], although the jurisdiction and powers of the Courts remained largely unchanged.

The court used facilites as the [[Supreme Court of Canada Building]] as well as [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee Building]] and registry office at 90 Elgin Street.

==History==

===Pre-Confederation to Confederation===
Prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the predominantly English-speaking [[Canada West]] (which succeeded [[Upper Canada]]) and the predominantly French-speaking [[Canada East]] (which succeeded [[Lower Canada]]) each had a separate system of courts. During pre-Confederation negotiations, the creation of a national court had been contemplated to deal with matters relating to federal law.&lt;ref name=Bushnell&gt;{{cite book |author=Ian Bushnell|authorlink=|title=The Federal Court of Canada: A History, 1875-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5nYZTnI5MwC|accessdate=2013-01-06|year=1997|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|isbn=0-8020-4207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' thus provided under s. 101 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution Act, 1867'', s 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the language in the constitution, a national court was not established until 1875.&lt;ref name=Bushnell/&gt; [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald]] made several attempts between 1869 and 1873 to create a national court under the powers granted to Parliament under s. 101 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.&lt;ref name=Bushnell/&gt; However, these early attempts were rebuffed due to concerns over jurisdiction, particularly because the early proposals would have established a federal Supreme Court exercising both [[original jurisdiction|original (trial) jurisdiction]] and concurrent [[appellate jurisdiction]] potentially in conflict with existing courts administered by [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=Bushnell/&gt;

While no court ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' was created, provision was made for the appointment of Official Arbitrators,&lt;ref&gt;''An Act respecting the Public Works of Canada'', SC 1867, c 12&lt;/ref&gt; whose decisions soon became subject to a final appeal to a Board of Arbitrators,&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to extend the powers of the Official Arbitrators'', SC 1870, c 23&lt;/ref&gt; until a further right of appeal to the new Exchequer Court was created in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act respecting the Official Arbitrators'', SC 1879, c 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchequer Court===
In 1875, the Liberal government of Prime Minister [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] passed ''The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act''&lt;ref name=1875Act&gt;''The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act'', SC 1875, c 11.&lt;/ref&gt; (introduced by Minister of Justice [[Telesphore Fournier]]), which was based on Macdonald's earlier unsuccessful bill of 1870. This act created both the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and the Exchequer Court. The jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court was provided under sections 58 and 59 of the Act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;58. The Exchequer Court shall have and possess concurrent original jurisdiction in the Dominion of Canada, in all cases in which it shall be sought to enforce any law of the Dominion of Canada relating to the revenue, including actions, suits, and proceedings, by way of information, to enforce penalties and proceedings by way of information ''in rem'', and as well in ''qui tam'' suits for penalties or forfeitures as where the suit is on behalf of the Crown alone; and the said Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand shall be made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might in England by the subject of a suit or action in the Court of Exchequer on its revenue side against the Crown, or any officer of the Crown.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;59. The Exchequer Court shall also have concurrent original jurisdiction with the Courts of the several Provinces in all other suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the Crown in the interest of the Dominion of Canada is plaintiff or petitioner.&lt;ref name=1875Act/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act'' made it clear that the Exchequer Court of Canada was inspired by the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Court of Exchequer]] in England, both in name and in jurisdiction, focusing as it did on matters of revenue.&lt;ref name=Iacobucci&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frank Iacobucci|authorlink=Frank Iacobucci|year= 1990|title= The Federal Court of Canada: Some Comments on its Origin, Traditions and Evolution|journal=Advocates Quarterly|volume=11|issue=|page=318|doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aqrty11&amp;div=26}}{{Subscription needed|via=[[HeinOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, however, England abolished the Court of Exchequer, merging its jurisdiction into the High Court of Justice.&lt;ref name=Bushnell/&gt; Nonetheless, the jurisdiction provided to the Exchequer Court of Canada initially consisted of:

:* concurrent original jurisdiction over all cases relating to the enforcement of the revenue laws;
:* exclusive original jurisdiction over any demand or relief sought in like manner as the English Court of Exchequer in its revenue side; and
:* concurrent original jurisdiction over all civil cases where the Crown is the plaintiff or petitioner.

The independence of the Exchequer Court was not immediately established. Indeed, justices of the Supreme Court also sat as justices of the Exchequer Court in the early years.&lt;ref name=Iacobucci/&gt; The two Courts were not separated until 1887, when the ''Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act'' was amended.&lt;ref&gt;''The Exchequer Court Act'', SC 1887, c 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Burbidge|George W. Burbidge]], a [[lawyer]] from [[New Brunswick]], was the first Exchequer Court judge appointed under this new arrangement.&lt;ref name=Iacobucci/&gt; At the same time, the Court's jurisdiction was expanded to include exclusive original jurisdiction over all claims against the Crown. It subsequently was conferred admiralty jurisdiction in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Admiralty Act, 1891'', SC 1891, c 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Court of Canada===
In 1971, the '''Federal Court of Canada''' was established, inheriting much of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court.  The Federal Court of Canada gained the jurisdiction to hear judicial reviews from federal agencies and tribunals.  The Federal Court of Canada had two divisions, the ''Federal Court &amp;ndash; Trial Division'' and ''Federal Court &amp;ndash; Appeal Division''.

On July 2, 2003 the court was again restructured.  The Court was split into two separate Courts, with the '''Trial Division''' continued as the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] and the '''Appeal Division''' continued as the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]].

Until 1976, there was substantial judicial support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Stephen A. Scott|year= 1982|title= Canadian Federal Courts and the Constitutional Limits of Their Jurisdiction|journal= [[McGill Law Journal]]|volume= 27|issue= 2|pages= 137{{endash}}195|publisher= [[McGill Law School]]|doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcgil27&amp;div=17|accessdate=22 July 2013}}{{Subscription needed|via=[[HeinOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Consolidated Distilleries, Limited, and another v The King|link=|court=UKPC|year=1933|num=34|para=|format=1|parallelcite=[1933] AC 508|date=10 April 1933|courtname=[[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|P.C.]]|juris=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the view that Parliament could give a federal court jurisdiction over any matter (even a matter not regulated by federal statute law), on the basis that "the Laws of Canada" meant not only federal statutes, but provincial ones as well. However, in ''Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Quebec North Shore Paper v. C.P. Ltd.|link=|year=1976|court=scc|num=10|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1977] 2 SCR 1054|date=1976-06-29|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court of Canada rejected this notion, as:

:* provincial law is not ''[[pro tanto]]'' federal law, nor can it be transposed into federal law for the purposes of giving jurisdiction to the Federal Court.
:* judicial jurisdiction of the Federal Court is not co-extensive with legislative jurisdiction of Parliament, as "the Laws of Canada" carries the requirement that there be applicable and existing federal law

==Organization==
The Court consisted of a first-level trial court, known as the '''Federal Court of Canada &amp;ndash; Trial Division''', and an appellate Court, known as the '''Federal Court of Canada &amp;ndash; Appeal Division''' (more commonly referred to as the '''Federal Court of Appeal''').

The '''Trial Division''' had jurisdiction to hear judicial review of decisions of federal boards and tribunals, including most immigration matters, as well as jurisdiction in [[admiralty]], [[intellectual property]], and disputes involving the federal government.

The '''Appeal Division''' had jurisdiction to hear appeals of decisions of the '''Trial Division''', as well as to determine applications for judicial review of decisions made by specific boards and tribunals, set out in section 28 of the [[Federal Court Act]].  Decisions of the '''Appeal Division''' could be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but only if leave (permission) was granted by either court.

The court did not use [[jury|juries]] so all matters were decided by [[judge]] alone: a single judge in the '''Trial Division''' and a panel of three judges at the appeal level.  Some pre-trial steps such as [[motion (legal)|motions]] were decided by [[prothonotary|prothonotaries]], a role similar to a master in other courts.  The judges and prothonotaries were appointed by the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] of the federal government.

==Jurisdiction==
Unlike the general courts set up by each province, matters could not be brought before the Federal Court of Canada unless a law explicitly allowed the proceeding.  The docket of the court primarily consisted of [[judicial review]]s of [[immigration]], [[intellectual property]], and federal employment disputes. The court could also deal with incidental aspects of a dispute that fell outside its jurisdiction if the primary dispute was within its jurisdiction.

The court was a national court so trials and hearings occurred throughout Canada.  Any orders rendered by the court were enforceable in all the provinces and territories.  This contrasts with the provincial superior courts which are organized by each province and require additional steps to enforce decisions in other provinces.

===Presidents of the Exchequer Court of Canada===

The position of President of the Court was not created until 1923. Before that time, justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] sat as judges of the Exchequer Court from 1875 to 1887, at which time [[George Burbidge|George Wheelock Burbidge]] was appointed as the first full-time judge of the Court. He served until 1908. when [[Walter Gibson Pringle Cassels]] was appointed. In 1912, authority was given to appoint an associate judge to the Court, and [[Louis Arthur Audette]] was appointed to that position. In 1945, authority was given to appoint more judges to the Court.

From 1923, the Presidents of the Court were:

* [[Walter Gibson Pringle Cassels]], 1920{{endash}}1923
* [[Alexander Kenneth Maclean]], 1923{{endash}}1942
* [[Joseph Thorarinn Thorson]], 1942{{endash}}1964
* [[Wilbur Jackett|Wilbur Roy Jackett]], 1964{{endash}}1971 (subsequently Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Canada)

'''''Goesaert v. Cleary''''', 335 U.S. 464 (1948),&lt;ref name=GoesaertSCOTUS&gt;{{ussc|name=Goesaert v. Cleary|link=|volume=335|page=464|pin=|year=1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld a [[Michigan]] law, which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more unless their father or husband owned the establishment. Valentine Goesaert, the plaintiff in the case, challenged the law on the ground that it infringed on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Speaking for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter affirmed the judgment of the Detroit district court and upheld the constitutionality of the state law. The state argued that since the profession of bartending could potentially lead to moral and social problems for women, it was within the state's power to bar them from working as bartenders. Only when the owner of the bar was a sufficiently close relative to the women bartender could it be guaranteed that such immorality would not be present. 

The decision was subsequently overruled by ''[[Craig v. Boren]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Craig v. Boren|link=|volume=429|page=190|pin=|year=1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
As part of the Michigan system for controlling the sale of liquor, bartenders were required in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more, but no female would be so licensed unless "the wife or daughter of the male owner" of a licensed liquor establishment, under Section 19a of Act 133 of the Public Acts of Michigan 1945, Mich.Stat.Ann. 18,990(1).

Valentine Goesaert was the owner of a bar in the city of [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. According to Michigan law, she was not allowed to be the owner of a bar since the population in Dearborn exceeded 50,000. On November 20, 1947, Goesaert and her daughter challenged the Michigan law at the district court of Detroit before Circuit Judge Simons and District Judges Levin and Picard. The women were represented by attorney Anne R. Davidow. They argued that the law denied them equal protection of the laws and deprived them of their property without due process of law. The main arguments brought forth by Goesaert were as follows:

# An arbitrary standard of 50,000 was set as the population of any city to come under the act.
# Women owners of bars were discriminated against.
# Women bartenders were discriminated against.
# There was a discrimination between daughters of male and female owners.
# There was a discrimination between waitresses and female bartenders.

Judges Levin and Simons ruled in favor of Cleary et al., denying all of the plaintiffs' claims: "the power of the Legislature to make special provisions for the protection of women is not denied."&lt;ref name=DistrictCourt&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Goesaert v. Cleary |vol=74 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=735 |pinpoint= |court=E.D. Mich. |date=1947 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/74/735/1410271/ |accessdate=2017-11-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Picard dissented, citing two reasons. Firstly, he thought that the law violated Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminated between persons similarly situated, denied plaintiffs equal protection of the laws, and was "palpably arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, and not based on facts that can reasonably be conceived."&lt;ref name=DistrictCourt/&gt; Secondly, the plaintiffs should be permitted to present evidence before the court acted on the interlocutory injunction.&lt;ref name=DistrictCourt/&gt;

== Decision ==
After losing in the District Court, Goesaert appealed to the Supreme Court. The women were once again represented by Anne R. Davidow. Edmund E. Shepherd represented the appellees, Cleary et al. Goesaert et al. once again presented their arguments against the law by focusing on the claim that Michigan could not restrict females from being barmaids and at the same time make an exception, in favor of the wives and daughters of the owners of liquor establishments.&lt;ref name=GoesaertSCOTUS/&gt;

Justice Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court, which upheld the Michigan law. He first cited the historic tradition of the regulation of liquor traffic, which forbid all women from working behind a bar. Although he pointed out that women had begun to "achieve the virtues that men have long claimed as their prerogatives," the Constitution "does not require legislatures to reflect sociological insight, or shifting social standards."&lt;ref&gt;''Goesaert'', 335 U.S. at 466.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to explain that the Constitution does not require situations which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as if they were the same by citing ''Tigner v. State of Texas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Tigner v. Texas|link=|volume=310|page=141|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ownership of a bar by a barmaid's husband or father minimized hazards of social and moral problems that would otherwise be present for women, the legislature needed not go to the full length of prohibition with the appearance of two distinct groups of women. In the name of protecting women from moral and social dangers in the bar, the law was upheld by the majority.&lt;ref name=GoesaertSCOTUS/&gt;

Justice Rutledge authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Douglas and Murphy. They argued that the law arbitrarily discriminated between male and female owners of liquor establishments. Justice Rutledge presented the opinion by saying, "This inevitable result of the classification belies the assumption that the statute was motivated by a legislative solicitude for the moral and physical well-being of women who, but for the law, would be employed as barmaids. Since there could be no other conceivable justification for such discrimination against women owners of liquor establishments, the statute should be held invalid as a denial of equal protection."&lt;ref&gt;''Goesaert'', 335 U.S. at 468 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Although the Michigan law was deemed discriminatory towards women, the case made a precedent for the Supreme Court to look more closely at legislature with discrimination based on gender. In his argument, Frankfurter relied on the rational basis test for equal protection legislation. With the test, the court asked "whether it is reasonable for state purposes to treat two classes of people differently."

The key was that as long as the court declared that the state had a justifiable reason to enact a law, the law would be held. By applying the rational basis test to the question of equality in gender-based legislation, Frankfurter opened the door to further state legislation that distinguished between the genders. Afterward, there were many cases that used his criteria to uphold laws that made distinctions between gender.

By the 1970s, however, attitudes began to shift. The Supreme Court found an Idaho law to be unconstitutional for on its discrimination against women in ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'', when the court struck down a law that preferred men over women for appointments as administrators of estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Reed v. Reed|link=|volume=404|page=71|pin=|year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That was a dramatic change to the Supreme Court's approach to the application of equality for men and women.

A '''guaranteed rental''' is a transaction whereby a party looking to acquire a property in order to rent it out on a retail basis (i.e., nightly or weekly), typically a [[property manager]] or [[vacation rental]] manager, rents from the owner of the property a large block of time, typically several months or even years. Through the transaction the acquirer provides the owner of the property with a guaranteed sum over the term of the contract.  
The acquirer then has the right to rent the property in question out on a retail basis, keeping all related revenues. This transaction is popular with parties seeking to shift the risk and/or management burden associated with renting property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/buy-to-let/10718950/Landlords-warned-of-rental-guarantee-pitfalls.html Landlords warned of 'rental guarantee' pitfalls], "The Telegraph". Web. 02 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/can-guaranteed-rental-schemes-save-struggling-landlords-1776031.html Can guaranteed rental schemes save struggling landlords?], "The Independent UK". Web. 02 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a transaction is similar to [[leaseback]] arrangements more frequently used by [[property developers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E9Amkpj-AIQC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=developer+lease+back+property+after+sale+guarantee+rental+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7RWedACvt&amp;sig=1dN0qpu3jaAenAIavphxvR1BBZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pCKOU9qVL5ffsAScmILABw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=developer%20lease%20back%20property%20after%20sale%20guarantee%20rental%20income&amp;f=false], Ratcliffe, John, Michael Stubbs, and Miles Keeping.

== Benefits and risks of wholesale rentals ==

=== Property owners ===

Through a wholesale contract a property owner is able to receive a guaranteed sum over the term of the contract. This takes the risk out of trying to rent the property him or herself, often with financial discount. Depending on how the contract is structured, the property owner may also shift more or less of the costs, maintenance, repairs, and other property owner responsibilities to the acquirer during the term of the contract. One potential downside is that by selling the right to rent to a third party, the homeowner loses some control over how that property is managed during the term, though this can also be negotiated and agreed within the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/75053/property_tips/free_advice_on_guaranteed_property_rental_schemes.html], "Street Directory". Web. 03 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property managers ===

Through a wholesale contract a property manager is able to acquire new inventory to manage on a retail basis, increasing revenues. When acquired at the right price, such contracts can also increase profit margins. By purchasing the weeks during the term, the manager has increased control over how the property is managed. One potential downside is the increased risk of providing a guarantee - if the property does not rent as well as predicted in the retail market, the manager still is obligated to pay the property owner the agreed upon sum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.propertyangel.in/blog/types-of-property-management-companies], "PropertyAngel.in". Web. 03 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Types of guaranteed rental contracts ==

=== Bilateral contracts ===

Wholesale rentals can be negotiated directly between homeowners and property managers. Such contracts can be good where the parties trust one another, and the numbers are easily agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E9Amkpj-AIQC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;lpg=PA441&amp;dq=developer+lease+back+property+after+sale+guarantee+rental+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7RWedACvt&amp;sig=1dN0qpu3jaAenAIavphxvR1BBZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pCKOU9qVL5ffsAScmILABw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=developer%20lease%20back%20property%20after%20sale%20guarantee%20rental%20income&amp;f=false], Ratcliffe, John, Michael Stubbs, and Miles Keeping. Urban Planning and Real Estate Development. Routledge, Jan 19, 2009, p. 440-441.&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Marketplaces ===

Property owners and property managers can also come to terms through wholesale rental marketplaces. Through such marketplaces property managers compete against one another, bidding up the price offered and ultimately paid to property owners. By creating a market-derived price for properties’ rental weeks, such marketplaces often make it quick and easy for property owners and property managers to come to agreement and sign wholesale rental contracts.&lt;ref name=tnooz&gt;[http://www.tnooz.com/article/Vacation-Futures-wholesale-vacation-rental-marketplace# Startup pitch: Vacation Futures creates the wholesale vacation rental marketplace], "tnooz".

The inquiry was announced in 2009 by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] and published in 2016 with a public statement by Chilcot.

==Build-up==
It was initially announced by Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] that the Iraq Inquiry would be held [[in camera]], excluding the public and press. However, the decision was later deferred to Sir [[John Chilcot]], the inquiry chairman, who said that it was "essential to hold as much of the proceedings of the inquiry as possible in public".&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/06/hold-public-inquiry-iraq|title=Chilcot calls for public Iraq inquiry|date=23 June 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/5604841/Large-parts-of-Iraq-inquiry-to-be-heard-in-public.html|title=Large parts of Iraq inquiry to be heard in public|last=Whitehead|first=Tom|date=23 June 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=15 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, when the inquiry commenced, it was announced that the committee would be able to request any British document and call any British citizen to give evidence.&lt;ref name="BBC 30/7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8176698.stm|title=Will Iraq probe worry ministers?|last=Chakrabarti |first=Reeta|date=30 July 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the week before the inquiry began hearing witnesses, a series of documents including military reports were leaked to a newspaper which appeared to show poor post-war planning and lack of provisions.&lt;ref name="Tele 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/6625415/Iraq-report-Secret-papers-reveal-blunders-and-concealment.html|title=Iraq report: Secret papers reveal blunders and concealment|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew |date=21 November 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]|accessdate=15 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The inquiry was pursued by a committee of [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]] with broad [[terms of reference]] to consider Britain's involvement in Iraq between 2001 and 2009. It covered [[Lead-up to the Iraq War|the run-up to the conflict]], [[Operation Telic|the subsequent military action]] and [[Aftermath of the Iraq War|its aftermath]] to establish how decisions were made, to determine what happened and to identify lessons to ensure that, in a similar situation in future, the British government is equipped to respond in the most effective manner in the best interests of the country.&lt;ref name=BBC6&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7312757.stm |title=The key points of the Iraq war inquiry explained |publisher=BBC News |date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open sessions of the inquiry commenced on 24 November 2009 and concluded on 2 February 2011.

In 2012, the government vetoed the release to the inquiry of documents detailing minutes of Cabinet meetings in the days leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. Concurrently, the [[Foreign Office]] successfully appealed against a judge's ruling and blocked the disclosure of extracts of a conversation between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] days before the invasion. The government stated that revealing this conversation would present a "significant danger" to [[United Kingdom–United States relations|British–American relations]].&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;John Kampfner, ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 3 August 2012, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2182924/Chilcot-inquiry-Hypocrisy-insidious-culture-secrecy.html Hypocrisy and this insidious culture of secrecy]&lt;/ref&gt; The million-word report of the inquiry was due to be released to the public by 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10191047/Foreign-Office-braced-for-criticism-in-Chilcot-report-over-its-record-keeping-around-Iraq-War.html|title=Foreign Office braced for criticism in Chilcot report over its record-keeping around Iraq War|date=27 July 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=27 January 2013|location=London|first=Christopher|last=Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt; but difficult negotiations were continuing with the United States over the publication of documents.&lt;ref&gt;James Cusick, ''[[The Independent]]'', 13 November 2011, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-us-blocks-publication-of-chilcots-report-on-how-britain-went-to-war-with-iraq-8937772.html Exclusive: US blocks publication of Chilcot's report on how Britain went to war with Iraq ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lord-in-waiting]] [[William Wallace, Baron Wallace of Saltaire|Lord Wallace of Saltaire]] said on behalf of the government that it would be "inappropriate" to publish the report in the months leading up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|next general election]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=BBCNov314&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29884094|title=Iraq Inquiry set to cost taxpayers £10m|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=3 November 2014|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, it transpired that the Report would in any event be further delayed, possibly into 2016, due to the legal requirement of "[[Maxwellisation]]", allowing any person who is to be criticised a fair opportunity to comment on a draft prior to finalisation and publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/iraq-war-chilcot-inquiry-sir-john-chilcot-a6969046.html|title=Iraq War: MPs launch investigation into legislation which delayed Chilcot Inquiry|author=Matt Broomfield|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilcot wrote a letter to [[David Cameron]] in October 2015, announcing that the text could be complete by April 2016, and furthermore proposed a release date of June or July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/55941/2015-10-28%20Chilcot%20to%20Cameron.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119144405/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/55941/2015-10-28%20Chilcot%20to%20Cameron.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
When the inquiry was announced on 15 June 2009 by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], it was initially announced that proceedings would take place in private, a decision which was subsequently reversed after receiving criticism in the media and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8100432.stm Iraq war inquiry to be in private] BBC News, 15 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlJ1&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/06/200961514301331360.html UK PM announces Iraq war inquiry] [[Al Jazeera]], 15 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/22/iraq-war-inquiry |title=Public Iraq war inquiry 'essential', says chairman |publisher=The Guardian |date= 22 June 2009|accessdate=24 November 2009| first=Haroon | last=Siddique |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry commenced in July 2009, with public hearings commencing on 24 November 2009 with [[Peter Ricketts]], chairman of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] at the time of the invasion of Iraq, as the first witness. Opening the proceedings, Sir John Chilcot announced that the inquiry was not seeking to apportion blame but that it would "get to the heart of what happened" and would not "shy away" from making criticism where it was justified.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 25/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/6645689/Iraq-Inquiry-British-officials-discussed-regime-change-two-years-before-war.html|title=Iraq Inquiry: British officials discussed regime change two years before war|date=25 November 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission resumed its hearings in January 2011 with the former prime minister, [[Tony Blair]] as its prime witness.

===29 October Protocol===
On 29 October 2009, HM Government published a Protocol in agreement with the Iraq Inquiry on the treatment of sensitive written and electronic information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/306669/protocol.pdf Iraq Inquiry Protocol]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cabinet Office&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence which will not be made available to the public includes anything likely to:

==Witnesses==
{{main|List of witnesses of the Iraq Inquiry}}
The inquiry heard evidence from a variety of witnesses, such as politicians, including several cabinet ministers at the time of the invasion; senior civil servants, including lawyers and intelligence chiefs; diplomats, mostly composed of British ambassadors to Iraq and the United States; and high-ranking military officers including former Chiefs of the General Staff and Chiefs of the Defence Staff as well as senior operational commanders.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 25/11"/&gt;

The inquiry heard mostly from civil servants, intelligence and security officials, diplomats and military officers from the first public hearings up until it recessed for Christmas. Key witnesses included [[Christopher Meyer|Sir Christopher Meyer]], former ambassador to the United States; [[Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce|Admiral Lord Boyce]], former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]; [[John Scarlett|Sir John Scarlett]], Chief of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]; [[Tim Cross|Major-General Tim Cross]], the most senior British officer on the ground in the aftermath of the invasion; and [[Brian Burridge|Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burridge]], overall commander of British forces in the invasion.

Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was publicly questioned by the enquiry on 29 January 2010, and again on 21 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/hearings/timetable.aspx |title=Iraq Inquiry - Hearings - Timetable |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002113/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/hearings/timetable.aspx |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On both of these occasions protests took place outside the conference centre.&lt;ref name="Tele 3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8274202/Chilcot-Inquiry-Tony-Blair-heckled-as-he-expresses-regret-for-this-loss-of-life-in-the-Iraq-war.html|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=19 June 2011|location=London|first=Rosa|last=Prince|title=Chilcot Inquiry: Tony Blair heckled as he expresses regret for this loss of life in the Iraq war|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of widespread public interest in Blair's evidence, public access to the hearings had to be allocated by lottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/news/20101208-ballot.aspx |title=Public Ballot: Application to Attend the Public Hearing of Rt Hon Tony Blair |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506235431/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/news/20101208-ballot.aspx |archivedate=6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special dispensations to attend were allocated to those whose close family were casualties of the war, some of whom shouted angry accusations at Blair during his second appearance.&lt;ref name="Tele 3"/&gt;

From the inquiry's resumption in January 2010, it heard predominantly from politicians and former government officials, including [[Alastair Campbell]], Tony Blair's director of communications and on 2 February 2010, then-[[Secretary of State for International Development]] [[Clare Short]], when she repeatedly criticised Blair, Attorney General [[Peter Goldsmith]] and others in the UK Government for what she maintained was deceiving her and other MPs in an attempt to obtain consent for the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/02/clare-short-warned-tony-blair Clare Short: Tony Blair lied and misled parliament in build-up to Iraq war], ''[[The Guardian]], James Sturcke,2 February 2010. Retrieved 7 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Brown]] had to retract his claim that spending on defence rose every year during the Iraq war, as this was found not to have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8573664.stm Brown misled Iraq inquiry over defence budget - Cameron] BBC News, 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a recess to avoid influencing the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]], the inquiry resumed public hearings on 29 June 2010. The first witness was [[Douglas Brand]], chief police adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref name="BBC IV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10437254.stm|title=Iraq inquiry told of post-war police training errors|date=29 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final witness in the public hearings, heard on 2 February 2011, was [[Jack Straw]], Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006.&lt;ref name="BBC-evidencetimeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12224606|title=Iraq inquiry - day by day timeline of evidence given|date=2 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

The Inquiry's final report was published on 6 July 2016. Comprising 2.6 million words in 12 volumes, plus an [[executive summary]], a physical copy was priced at [[Pound sterling|£]]767. Bereaved families received a free copy.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36442521 | title=Chilcot Inquiry: Hard copy of Iraq inquiry report provided free to bereaved families | accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also published online. It was longer than the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], the Complete Works of [[William Shakespeare]], and Tolstoy's [[War and Peace]] put together.

The report was made available under the [[Open Government Licence]] v3.0, although this excluded material supplied by third parties.

==Findings==
The report – described by [[BBC News]] as "damning",&lt;ref name="BBCCrystal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36724704|title=Crystal clear, polite - but damning|author=Laura Kuenssberg |date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "crushing verdict",&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt; and by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' as "scathing"&lt;ref name="TelegraphReport"/&gt; – was broadly critical of the actions of the British government and military in making the case for the war, in tactics and in planning for the [[aftermath of the Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TelegraphReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645|title=Chilcot report: Findings at a glance|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Norton-Taylor]] of ''The Guardian'' wrote that the report "could hardly be more damning" of [[Tony Blair]] and "was an unprecedented, devastating indictment of how a prime minister was allowed to make decisions by discarding all pretence at cabinet government, subverting the intelligence agencies, and making exaggerated claims about threats to Britain's national security".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-indictment-of-tony-blair-could-hardly-have-been-more-serious Chilcot's indictment of Tony Blair could hardly be more damning], ''Guardian'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case for war was deficient===
The report found that in the [[lead-up to the Iraq War|run-up to the war]], peaceful diplomatic options to avoid instability and [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] proliferation had not been exhausted, and that the war was therefore "not a last resort".&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; Intervention might have become necessary later, but at the time of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, [[Saddam Hussein]] did not pose an immediate threat and the majority of the [[UN Security Council]] supported the continuation of UN weapons inspections and monitoring.&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt;

The report does not question Blair's personal belief that there was a case for war, only the way he presented the evidence that he had.&lt;ref name="IndependentReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-inquiry-tony-blair-iraq-war-weapons-of-mass-destruction-evidence-verdict-a7122361.html|title=Chilcot report: Blair didn't tell truth about WMDs, the deal with Bush or the warnings of fallout – how Britain went to war in Iraq|author=Andy McSmith, Charlie Cooper|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report cleared the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister.27s Office|Prime Minister's Office]] of influencing the [[Iraq Dossier]] (the "Dodgy Dossier"), which contained the claim that Iraq possessed the ability to launch WMD within 45 minutes, and instead laid the blame for the weaknesses in its evidence on the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-intelligence-was-exaggerated-and-omitted-to-justify-iraq-war-inquiry-finds-a7122481.html|title=Chilcot report: Intelligence on WMDs exaggerated to justify going to war, inquiry finds|author=Kim Sengupta|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehall had early sight of the report and sources say that some lessons are already being applied.

More specifically, the report blamed [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (better known as MI6) head [[Sir Richard Dearlove]] who presented so-called "hot" intelligence about alleged weapons of mass destruction provided by an Iraqi with "phenomenal access" to high levels in the Iraqi government directly to Blair, without first confirming its accuracy.&lt;ref name="Rawnsley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |date=10 July 2016 |title=Ten things that Chilcot's verdict reveals about Tony Blair and the Iraq war  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/09/ten-things-chilcot-reveals-about-tony-blair-and-iraq |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators found that references to this intelligence in government reports were over-certain and did not adequately stress uncertainties and nuance. The informant was later found to have been lying. The Chilcot report states that "personal intervention [by Dearlove] and its urgency gave added weight to a report that had not been properly evaluated and would have coloured the perception of ministers and senior officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36737922 |title=Chilcot report: The flawed chain of intelligence that led to war |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=7 July 2016 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the report was published, Blair conceded that he should have challenged such intelligence reports before relying on them to justify military action in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Rawnsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tony-blair-chilcot-report-iraq-war-intelligence-wmds-inquiry-finds-bbc-radio-4-today-a7124506.html |title=Tony Blair admits he should have challenged intelligence that led to Iraq War |last=Cooper |first=Charlie |date=7 July 2016 |website=The Independent |publisher=The Independent |access-date=10 July 2016 |quote=Former Prime Minister again defends decision and insists it was taken 'out of good motives'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some MI6 staff had also expressed concerns about the quality of its source – in particular, noting that an inaccurate detail about storing chemical weapons in glass containers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kim |first=Sengupta |date=7 July 2016 |title=Chilcot report: MI6 may have got crucial intelligence on Iraq WMDs from a Nicolas Cage film |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-wmds-mi6-evidence-tony-blair-richard-dearlove-a7124426.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London, UK |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared to have been taken from [[Michael Bay]]'s film ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' – and expressed doubts about its reliability. Nonetheless, Foreign Secretary [[Jack Straw]] asked MI6 to use the source to provide "silver bullet intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/movie-plot-the-rock-inspired-mi6-sources-iraqi-weapons-claim-chilcot-report|title=The Rock movie plot 'may have inspired MI6 source's Iraqi weapons claim'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|author=Peter Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal basis for war was far from satisfactory===
The inquiry was not about the legality of military action and could not rule on this as it was not an internationally recognised court. However, the report did criticise the process by which the government investigated the legal basis for the war, finding it "far from satisfactory".&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], should have provided a detailed written report to Cabinet, but was instead asked to provide oral evidence without extensive questioning, and he did not explain what the basis would be for deciding whether Iraq had violated [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]].&lt;ref name="prosecuted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-tony-blair-prosecute|title=The Iraq war inquiry has left the door open for Tony Blair to be prosecuted|author=Joshua Rozenberg|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith's advice changed between January 2003 – when he said that a second resolution was necessary – and March 2003 – when he said that Resolution 1441 was sufficient – and the report describes pressure being applied by the Prime Minister's Office to get Goldsmith to revise his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b1d19340-439b-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html#axzz4Dil94DE7|title=Chilcot report: The government hid the legal case from view|author=[[David Allen Green]]|newspaper=Financial Times|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/07/06/lord-goldsmith-qc-named-as-chilcot-report-finds-legal-basis-for-iraq-invasion-far-from-satisfactory/?slreturn=20160607072043|title=Lord Goldsmith QC named as Chilcot report finds legal basis for Iraq invasion 'far from satisfactory'|author=Francis Ivens|newspaper=Legal Week|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ultimately going to war without a [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolution]], the UK was "undermining the Security Council's authority".&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt;

===UK overestimated ability to influence US decisions on Iraq===
The report found that Blair had attempted to persuade Bush of the need to seek support from the UN, European allies and Arab states, but that he "overestimated his ability to influence US decisions on Iraq".&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; The report accused Blair personally of being too conciliatory towards the US, saying: "Despite concerns about the state of US planning, he did not make an agreement on a satisfactory post-conflict plan a condition of UK participation in military action",&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt; and drew attention to a sentence from a private memo from Blair to Bush which read "I will be with you whatever".&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; Contrary to Tony Blair's claims, Chilcot found that the [[Special Relationship]] did not require unquestioning agreement between the UK and the US, and the report identified several previous occasions where one country had gone to war without the other without long-term damage to diplomatic relations, including the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;

===War preparation and planning was "wholly inadequate"===
The report found that British planning for a post-[[Ba'athist Iraq]] was "wholly inadequate" and that the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) left UK forces in Iraq without any adequate equipment or a plan.&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equipment"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mod-left-uk-forces-in-iraq-ill-equipped-amid-lack-of-plan-chilcot-report-says|title=MoD left UK forces in Iraq lacking equipment and a plan, Chilcot says |author=Nick Hopkins|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that there was no ministerial oversight of post-conflict strategy.&lt;ref name="prosecuted"/&gt;

Initial planning for the war assumed an invasion from the north, but Turkey refused permission for UK troops to cross its border.&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt; Plans were therefore completely rewritten two months before the war began with insufficient time to assess the dangers or prepare the brigades.&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt;

Soldiers were not issued with key equipment, and there were shortfalls in the provision of helicopters, armoured vehicles and in reconnaissance and intelligence assets.&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; In addition, the MoD was slow to respond to the threat of [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs).&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/world/europe/chilcot-report.html|title=Chilcot Report on Iraq War Offers Devastating Critique of Tony Blair|author=Steven Erlanger and Stephen Castle|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although military officials presented several concerns about the risks of the war, the report found that this was not taken into account in planning. "The risks of internal strife in Iraq, active Iranian pursuit of its interests, regional instability and Al Qaeda activity in Iraq were each explicitly identified before the invasion".&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt; A "can-do" attitude among military officials also led them to downplay dangers and setbacks during briefings.&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt;

The report also described the situation in the city of [[Basra]], where British forces were forced to make a deal with insurgents to end attacks on British troops, as "humiliating".&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt;

===Military action did not achieve its goals===
According to the report, British military action did not achieve its goals,&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; and [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Baghdad and south-east Iraq destabilised rapidly in the wake of the invasion]].&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;

At the time, the UK was also involved in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]] and military commanders felt that there was more potential for success there, which meant that equipment, manpower and the attention of commanders were diverted from Iraq in the later stages of the war, exacerbating difficulties.&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt;

==Reactions and analysis==
In a statement to the House of Commons the afternoon after the inquiry's report was released, the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] refused to say whether the Iraq War was "a mistake" or "wrong" and rejected calls for an apology to be issued on behalf of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for its role in the lead-up to the war. Cameron said that he did not see "a huge amount of point" in "replaying all the arguments of the day" and said that focus should instead be on learning "the lessons of what happened and what needs to be put in place to make sure that mistakes cannot be made in future".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Stone, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-iraq-war-chilcot-report-response-apology-refuses-live-latest-updates-a7122886.html David Cameron refuses to say the Iraq War was 'wrong' or 'a mistake' following damning Chilcot Report], ''The Independent'' (7 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, [[Spokesperson for the United States Department of State|US State Department spokesperson]] [[John Kirby (admiral)|John Kirby]] stated in the daily [[White House]] press briefing that the US would not respond to the report and that reporters should direct their questions to British officials instead, explaining that their focus was now on Syria rather than a decision made 13 years prior: "... we're not going to make a judgment one way or the other about this report, and I'll let British officials speak to the degree to which they intend to derive lessons learned from it. That's really, again, for them to talk to. We're not going to go through it, we're not going to examine it, we're not going to try to do an analysis of it or make a judgment of the findings one way or the other. Our focus, again, is on the challenges we have in Iraq and Syria right now, and that's where our focus is".&lt;ref&gt;[http://state.gov/md259402.htm#UK Daily Press Briefing - July 6 2016], ''[[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/chilcot-report-how-the-world-reacted/ Chilcot report - how the world reacted: 'A very British masterclass in quiet, restrained but devastating critique'], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the report was issued, [[Jeremy Corbyn]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the opposition]] and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|leader of the Labour Party]] - who had voted against military action - gave a speech in Westminster stating: "I now apologise sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision to go to war in Iraq in March 2003" which he called an "act of military aggression launched on a false pretext" something that has "long been regarded as illegal by the overwhelming weight of international opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36733979 |title=Tony Blair says world is better as a result of Iraq War |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 July 2016 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |access-date=7 July 2016 |quote=He said the report proved the Iraq War had been an "act of military aggression launched on a false pretext", something he said which has "long been regarded as illegal by the overwhelming weight of international opinion"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbyn specifically apologised to "the people of Iraq"; to the families of British soldiers who died in Iraq or returned injured; and to "the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on".&lt;ref name="Corbyn"&gt;Andrew Grice, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-apology-tony-blair-labour-party-a7123461.html Jeremy Corbyn apologises on behalf of Labour for 'disastrous decision' to join Iraq War], ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement by [[Alex Salmond]] released after the inquiry's report was issued, the [[Scottish National Party]] said: "After such carnage, people will ask inevitable questions of was conflict inevitable and worthwhile? The answer from Chilcot is undoubtedly no. And who is responsible? The answer is undoubtedly Tony Blair. There must now be a consideration of what political or legal consequences are appropriate for those responsible".&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Fenton, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-alex-salmond-tony-blair-legal-action-iraq-war-inquiry-a7122626.html Chilcot report: Alex Salmond calls for legal action against Tony Blair], ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Salmond, [http://www.snp.org/snp_statement_on_the_chilcot_report SNP statement on the Chilcot Report], Scottish National Party (July 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the inquiry's report was issued, [[Tony Blair]] acknowledged that the report made "real and material criticisms of preparation, planning, process and of the relationship with the United States" but cited sections of the report that he said "should lay to rest allegations of bad faith, lies or deceit". He stated: "whether people agree or disagree with my decision to take military action against Saddam Hussein, I took it in good faith and in what I believed to be the best interests of the country. ... I will take full responsibility for any mistakes without exception or excuse. I will at the same time say why, nonetheless, I believe that it was better to remove Saddam Hussein and why I do not believe this is the cause of the terrorism we see today whether in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-tony-blair-findings-lie-iraq-war-saddam-hussein-dodgy-dossier-inquiry-latest-a7122611.html Chilcot report: Tony Blair claims findings show he did not lie over Iraq War], ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/statement-from-tony-blair-on-chilcot-report/ Statement from Tony Blair on Chilcot Report], Office of Tony Blair (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of the report, [[John Prescott]], who was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] at the time of the Iraq War, said that the war was illegal.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36756878 |title=John Prescott: Ex-deputy PM says Iraq War was illegal |accessdate=10 July 2016| work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported, 'Every previous inquiry into Britain's decision to invade Iraq has swiftly been condemned by the public as a "whitewash".  Such a description hardly applies to the monumental inquest that has been published by Sir John Chilcot. ... After [[Hutton inquiry|Lord Hutton's report in 2003]] and the [[Butler Review|Butler report]] the following year, the one thing Sir John could not have afforded to produce was another report that was dismissed as a whitewash.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blitz|first1=James|title=Chilcot has ended 'whitewash' reports on Iraq war|url=https://www.ft.com/content/42987ccc-4374-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1|accessdate=2016-11-17|publisher=Financial Times|date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of deceit===

Political commentators were split as to what extent the report showed that Tony Blair had lied or deliberately misled Parliament and the public. [[NBC News]] said that the report "stops short of saying Blair lied",&lt;ref name="NBCReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chilcot-report-iraq-war-released-stops-short-saying-blair-lied-n604461|title=Chilcot Report on Iraq War Is Released, Stops Short of Saying Blair Lied|authors=Alexander Smith, Bill Neely|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the chief political commentator for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Philip Stephens (journalist)|Philip Stephens]], said that Blair's "sin was one of certitude rather than deceit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8da14dcc-438b-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1.html#axzz4DiJF24oF|title=Chilcot report exposes Tony Blair's sin of certitude|author=Philip Stephens|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing for [[Bloomberg View]], [[Eli Lake]] said that the report proved Blair "didn't lie his way into Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-06/blair-didn-t-lie-his-way-into-iraq-neither-did-bush|title=Blair Didn't Lie His Way Into Iraq. Neither Did Bush.|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Parliament, Corbyn said that MPs who voted for the war were "misled by a small number of leading figures in the Government" who "were none too scrupulous about how they made their case for war",&lt;ref name="Corbyn"/&gt; and [[Caroline Lucas]], MP for the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], claimed that contradictions between public statements and private memos to Bush proved that Blair was "lying" about whether war could have been averted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.de/caroline-lucas-on-the-chilcot-report-iraq-inquiry-tony-blair-david-cameron-2016-7?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=CAROLINE LUCAS: The Iraq War was illegal, Tony Blair was lying, and David Cameron should apologise too|author=Lara O'Reilly|publisher=Business Insider|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Sands said the report pulled its punches but marshalled the factual evidence in such a way that an inference of lying, deceit or manipulation was possible.&lt;ref name="Sands" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The timing and nature of the inquiry&amp;mdash;and particularly the fact that it would not issue its report until after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]&amp;mdash;generated political controversy.&lt;ref name="Tele 1"/&gt; [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]] dismissed the inquiry as "an [[The Establishment|establishment]] stitch-up", and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] threatened a boycott.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8102203.stm Anger over 'secret Iraq inquiry'] BBC News, 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In a parliamentary debate over the establishment of the inquiry, [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from all the major parties criticised the government's selection of its members. MPs drew attention to the absence of anyone with first-hand military expertise, the absence of members with acknowledged or proven inquisitorial skills, and the absence of any elected representatives. Several MPs drew attention to the fact that Chilcot would be unable to receive evidence under oath.&lt;ref name=TWFY1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2009-06-24c.800.1#g808.1|date=24 June 2009|title=Iraq Inquiry|publisher=They Work For You}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert's appointment to the enquiry was criticised on the basis that he had once compared Bush and Blair to Roosevelt and Churchill.&lt;ref name=Observer1/&gt;

The criticism by the Liberal Democrats continued with the start of public hearings, with party leader [[Nick Clegg]] accusing the government of "suffocating" the inquiry, referring to the power given to government departments to veto sections of the final report. Meanwhile, a group of anti-war protestors staged a demonstration outside the conference centre.&lt;ref name="Times 25/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6931594.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000|title=Gordon Brown accused of suffocating the Chilcot Iraq Inquiry|date=25 November 2009|work=Times Online|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]]|accessdate=12 February 2010|location=London|first1=Anushka|last1=Asthana|author-link1=Anushka Asthana|first2=Jill|last2=Sherman|last3=Hines|first3=Nico|last4=Brown|first4=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 25/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk_politics/8375439.stm|title=Iraq inquiry being 'suffocated' - Lib Dem leader Clegg|date=25 November 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the expertise of the panel, particularly with regard to issues of legality by senior judges.&lt;ref name="Telegraph II"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/6637328/Iraq-inquiry-civil-servant-Sir-John-Chilcot-incapable-of-addressing-legal-issues.html|title=Iraq inquiry: civil servant Sir John Chilcot 'incapable of addressing legal issues'|last=Laing |first=Aislinn|date=24 November 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 22 November 2009, former British Ambassador [[Oliver Miles]] published an article in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/oliver-miles-the-key-question-ndash-is-blair-a-war-criminal-1825374.html |title=The key question – is Blair a war criminal? | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he questioned the appointment to the inquiry panel of two British historians on the basis of their previous support for [[Israel]]. In a diplomatic cable from the US embassy in London, released as part of [[Cablegate]], Jon Day, director general for security policy at the British Ministry of Defence is cited having promised the US to have "put measures in place to protect your interests" regarding the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=09LONDON2198, U/S TAUSCHER'S MEETINGS WITH FS MILIBAND AND OTHER| url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09LONDON2198&amp;version=1291138620  | accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as an indication that the inquiry is restricted "to minimize embarrassment for the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=WikiLeaks cable reveals secret pledge to protect US at Iraq inquiry | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/30/wikileaks-chilcot-iraq-war-inquiry | work=The Guardian | first=Robert | last=Booth| accessdate=30 November 2010 | location=London | date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/news/wikileaks/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2010/11/30/wikileaks_uk_iraq_inquiry | title=Is Britain's Iraq war inquiry compromised? | work=www.salon.com | first=Justin | last=Elliott | accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Dominic Grieve]] was criticised when he vetoed the release of documents to the inquiry detailing minutes of Cabinet meetings in the days leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. Concurrently, the Foreign Office successfully appealed against a judge's ruling and blocked the disclosure of extracts of a conversation between Bush and Blair moments before the invasion. The British government stated that revealing the content of a phone call between Bush and Blair moments before the invasion would later present a "significant danger" to [[United Kingdom–United States relations|British–American relations]].&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; In his submission to the inquiry, [[Philippe Sands]] observed that:

{{Quote|an independent Dutch Inquiry has recently concluded – unanimously and without ambiguity – that the war was not justified under international law. The Dutch inquiry Committee was presided by W.J.M. Davids, a distinguished former President of the Dutch Supreme Court, and four of its seven members were lawyers. The Dutch Committee was well-placed to address the substantive legal issues. I note, however, that the composition of this Inquiry includes no members with any legal background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Sands |first= Philippe |authorlink= Philippe Sands |date=  4 October 2010 |title= Submission to Iraq inquiry |url= https://www.theguardian.com/law/interactive/2010/oct/04/iraq-inquiry-submissions-philippe-sands |publisher= [[The Guardian|theguardian.com]] |accessdate= 15 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2011, the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' published an article with 15 charges that have yet to be answered by the inquiry.&lt;ref name="Independent 1/11"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Michael Savage|date=21 January 2011|title=The case against Blair: 15 charges that have yet to be answered|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-case-against-blair-15-charges-that-have-yet-to-be-answered-2190375.html|publisher=[[The Independent|independent.co.uk]]|accessdate=29 August 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a public meeting in 2013, [[David Owen]] said that the inquiry "is being prevented from revealing extracts that they believe relevant from exchanges between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair". He blamed Blair and Cameron for this state of affairs, who he believed have entered into a private deal to prevent the publication of important documents out of mutual self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Oborne | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Oborne | date = 29 May 2013 | title = The whiff of suspicion over the Chilcot Inquiry grows stronger | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10086837/The-whiff-of-suspicion-over-the-Chilcot-Inquiry-grows-stronger.html | publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph|telegraph.co.uk]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged that the Cabinet Office was resisting the release of "more than 130 records of conversations" between Bush and Blair, as well as "25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush" and "some 200 cabinet-level discussions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Doward | first = Jamie | date = 10 November 2013 | title = Iraq war inquiry blocked in bid to make Bush-Blair 'kick ass' memo public | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/10/iraq-war-tony-blair-george-bush | accessdate = 10 November 2013 | publisher = ''[[The Observer]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time taken for the inquiry to complete its report is seen by many as excessive, and has been widely criticised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33163916 "Cameron 'losing patience' with Chilcot Iraq Inquiry delay"], ''BBC News'', 17 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11808788/Retired-High-Court-judge-questions-inordinate-Chilcot-delay.html "Retired High Court judge questions 'inordinate' Chilcot delay as Defence Secretary intervenes"], ''The Telegraph'', 18 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34072126 "Sir John Chilcot facing legal action over report delays"], ''BBC News'', 27 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also criticisms that the inquiry's final report had been published electronically only as [[Portable Document Format]] files, including images of scans of photocopies of printouts of electronic documents, and not in an [[open format]].&lt;ref name="Styles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.newstatesman.com/big-data/tried-searching-chilcot-report-good-luck|title=What do you mean Chilcot isn't a technology story?|last=Styles|first=Kirsty|date=7 July 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Italian Competition Authority''' ({{lang-it|Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato}}, '''AGCM''') is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Quango|quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization]] established on the basis of Law no 287 of 10 October 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agcm.it/AGCM_ENG/NORMATIV/E_NORMNA.NSF/b50758bf27025fecc125653d00467db4?OpenView Law no. 287 of October 10th, 1990 (The Competition and Fair Trading Act)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001210035400/http://www.agcm.it/AGCM_ENG/NORMATIV/E_NORMNA.NSF/b50758bf27025fecc125653d00467db4?OpenView |date=December 10, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 years after the ''[[Sherman Antitrust Act]]''. As of 2004, the Italian Competition Authority has also been in charge of enforcing laws against conflicts of interest for Holders of Public Office.

As the Italian [[competition regulator]], the Authority has the task of enforcing both Italian and European consumer protection laws.

It is financed by annual allocations through a special chapter of the Ministry of Economic Development's budget. The Financial Law of 2006 introduced partial self-financing:&lt;ref&gt;Article 10(7-bis) of Law 287/90 as amended by article 1(69) of Law no. 266 of 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ''AGCM'' has full control over the management of these funds for its own operations.

An annual report is presented to the [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy]].

==Duties==
The main duties of the authority are:
* Vigilance against abuses from [[Dominance (economics)|market dominance]].
* Vigilance against [[cartel]]s that may prejudice or restrict fair [[Competition (economics)|competition]] ([[Anti-competitive practices]]).
* Vigilance on [[takeover]]s to check [[concentration ratio]] and verify [[market impact]].
* [[Consumer protection]], against unfair trade practices and [[false advertising]].
* Supervise and penalize the cases of [[conflict of interest]] regarding members of [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Government of Italy]].

==Powers==
The Authority in such cases may conduct investigations or hearings, even with the [[Guardia di Finanza]] at his disposal, which may result in a warning or an administrative penalty.

{{Conservatism sidebar}}
[[Liberalism]] and [[conservatism]] in [[Latin America]] have unique historical roots as Latin American independence began to occur in 1808 after the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] that eventually engulfed all of [[Europe]]. [[France|French]] revolutionaries in the 1790s began an intellectual awakening called the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which opened the door for ideas of positivism in Latin American society and people in Latin America turned to liberal ideologies as liberalism means the idea of liberty, equality and popular sovereignty.

During the early 19th century in Latin America, liberalism clashed with conservative views as liberals wanted to end the dominance of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Social class|class]] stratification and [[slavery]]. These issues for many years strongly affected the way that Latin American society was organized. The majority of liberals believed in a [[Democracy|democratic]] system of [[government]], but this system would create many changes and much confusion in Latin American communities in the early 19th century. On the other hand, conservatism favored existing systems and hierarchies. Conservatives believed [[Civil disorder|chaos]] and social [[Anomie|disorder]] would break out if the political system were liberalized. Latin American conservatives generally believed in class stratification and opposed radical change in government in Latin America.

The contest between liberals and conservatives in Latin America, while sweeping in effect, was largely fought between members of the landed, white or creole elite. Systems in place from the colonial period—such as slavery, patronage by the elite and debt peonage—meant that the great mass of Indians, Africans and people of mixed race had little, if any power compared to the very small creole ruling class. Thus the concern that liberalization would lead to "disorder" that the conservatives spoke about was often a veiled or transparent fear of race war.

''[[Caudillo]]s'' soon came to power in some Latin American societies, such as [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]]. ''Caudillos'' were conservatives who promised protection and restoration of traditional ways to the people. They were generally pragmatic, believing in a ruling system of what works best. ''Caudillos'' used [[military]] force to hold society together.

The '''Maroua Declaration''' is a 1975 [[maritime boundary]] [[treaty|agreement]] between [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]]. A question regarding the validity of the agreement arose during an [[International Court of Justice]] case that decided a [[Bakassi#The Loss of Southwestern Cameroon and Bakassi|boundary dispute]] between the two countries.

The Maroua Declaration was signed on 1 June 1975 by [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]], [[President of Cameroon]], and [[Yakubu Gowon]], the [[List of heads of state of Nigeria|head of state of Nigeria]] in [[Maroua]], Cameroon. The agreement extends a maritime boundary that previously existed between the two countries further into the Gulf of Guinea from the mouth of the [[Akwayafe River]].

In 2002, the [[International Court of Justice]] issued a judgment in a case between Cameroon and Nigeria on their [[Bakassi#The Loss of Southwestern Cameroon and Bakassi|longstanding boundary dispute]]. Nigeria argued that the Maroua Declaration was invalid and nonbinding because although the Nigerian head of state had signed it, the agreement had not been ratified either by Parliament or any other governmental process. The ICJ held that under international law the declaration was valid and came into effect upon signing by the head of state.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/94/7453.pdf Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria)]'', [2002] ICJ Reports,  paras. 265–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Massachusetts v. Mellon''''', 262 U.S. 447 (1923),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Massachusetts v. Mellon|262|447|1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court rejected the concept of [[taxpayer standing]]. The case was consolidated with ''Frothingham v. Mellon''. The plaintiffs in the cases, Frothingham and Massachusetts, sought to prevent certain federal government expenditures which they considered to violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].  The court rejected the suits on the basis that neither plaintiff suffered particularized harm, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have no power ''per se'' to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional. The question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act…. The party who invokes the power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This case is considered the beginning of the doctrine of [[Standing (law)|standing]]. Prior to it the doctrine was that all persons had a right to pursue a private prosecution of a [[Public rights|public right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of Self-Governance |first=Steven L. |last=Winter |volume=40 |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |issue=6 |pages=1371–1516 |year=1988 |jstor=1228780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Warren Court]] would later carve out an exception to this rule in ''[[Flast v. Cohen]]'', but later cases have confirmed that ''Flast'' is an exceedingly limited exception to ''Frothingham'''s general rule (see ''[[Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State]]'' and ''[[Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation]]'').

The Ministry of Justice, Islamic Affairs, Public Administration and Human Rights of Comoros handles any legal reforms that might improve the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.habarizacomores.com/2016/12/lincompetence-totale-de-fahmi-said.html|title=L’incompétence totale de Fahmi Said Ibrahim, ministre de la justice|work=HabarizaComores.com {{!}} Toute l'actualité des Comores|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union government forces include the Army of National Development and the gendarmerie. When the latter force serves as the judicial police, it reports to the Minister of Justice. Although National Commission for Preventing and Fighting Corruption (CNPLC) exists to prevent corruption, the Ministry of Justice seldom prosecutes corruption cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/252879.pdf|title=COMOROS 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
The '''''National Resources Mobilization Act, 1940''''' (4 George VI, Chap. 13) was a [[statute]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] passed to provide for better planning of a much greater Canadian war effort, both overseas and in military production at home.

==Scope==

Modelled on the British ''[[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939]]'', as amended in 1940, it gave the Canadian government the power to

{{quote|
''do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, requiring persons to place themselves, their services and their property at the disposal of His Majesty in right of Canada, as may be deemed necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance of public order, or the efficient prosecution of the war, or for maintaining supplies or services essential to the life of the community.''{{sfn|Byers|1996|pp=177{{endash}}178}}
}}

This was the basis of all organization for Canada's war production.

===Preparation for military readiness===

In order to prepare the population for military service, provision was made under the Act for:

:* compulsory national registration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Resources Mobilization Act (1940) - Canadian records for Genealogists|url = http://www.family-historian.com/sources/nrma1940.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1940 National Registration|url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/022/022-911.007-e.html|publisher = Collections Canada|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120413044932/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/022/022-911.007-e.html|archivedate = 2012-04-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* restricting men eligible for military service from obtaining civilian employment in positions considered not to be essential to the war effort, so that women, and men who had been discharged from service or who were ineligible for service, could be hired instead&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?image_id_nbr=335256&amp;document_id_nbr=9010&amp;f=g&amp;PHPSESSID=89ane1d97p9qn8mbh3oi6gvoj1 ''Restricted Occupations Order''], March 21, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;
:* requiring men to submit to medical treatment in order to be called up for military service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?image_id_nbr=335275&amp;document_id_nbr=9015&amp;f=g&amp;PHPSESSID=89ane1d97p9qn8mbh3oi6gvoj1 Order in Council], March 23, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[conscription]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=8502&amp;image_id_nbr=323929&amp;f=g&amp;PHPSESSID=3hl49f56brck64pp06h9qsel25 Proclamation calling up for military training], September 11, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment control===

The Act was also used to ensure greater efficiency that was required in a wartime economy by:

:* requiring employers to report who their employees were&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?image_id_nbr=335278&amp;document_id_nbr=9016&amp;f=g&amp;PHPSESSID=89ane1d97p9qn8mbh3oi6gvoj1 Order in Council], March 2, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

:* From September 1, 1943, employers in high-priority industries were prohibited from releasing any of their employees, and such employees were barred from giving notice of separation, without the written permission of a National Selective Service officer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workers in Essential Industry "Frozen" in Employment|url = https://archive.org/stream/labourgazette1943cana#page/1332/mode/2up|journal = Labour Gazette|date=October 1943|volume=XLIII|issue=10|pages=1333{{endash}}1335}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such controls continued until September 17, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Further Relaxation of Manpower Controls|url = https://archive.org/stream/labourgazette1945p2cana#page/1276/mode/2up|journal = Labour Gazette|date=September 1945|volume=XLV|issue=9|pages=1276{{endash}}1278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of conscription===
The Act permitted conscripts (known as "R men"{{sfn|Byers|1996|p=182}} or "[[zombie]]s"{{sfn|Byers|1996|p=186}}) to be used for home defence only and not to be deployed overseas. The "Zombies" were so-called because they were soldiers who could not fight overseas in the war, making them like the zombies of Haitian mythology who were neither dead nor alive, but rather somewhere in-between. In 1942, the Act was amended to remove the prohibition on conscripts serving outside Canada, and the first overseas campaign that NRMA recruits were subsequently involved in was the [[Operation Cottage|recapture of the island of Kiska]] in August 1943.{{sfn|Byers|1996|p=193}} Until November 1944, only those Canadians who had volunteered were sent elsewhere overseas.

The rule prohibiting "Zombies" from being sent to fight overseas was modified after a [[Referendums in Canada#Plebiscite on conscription|plebiscite]] was held on the matter on 27 April 1942 where the majority of people in the 8 English-speaking provinces voted to release Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] from his promise not to send the Zombies overseas. By contrast, Quebec voted by a large majority against oversees conscription in the referendum. As Quebec was the one province that Mackenzie King really wanted to vote yes in the plebiscite, Quebec's ''non'' vote placed the prime minister in the dilemma of honoring the wishes of the majority of English Canada vs. alienating the wishes of majority in French Canada. Such an order, authorizing the transfer of 16,000 conscripts to England, was not made until November 1944.{{sfn|Byers|1996|p=202}} This precipitated the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]], and resulted in several Quebec [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] MPs leaving the party in protest. 9,667 NRMA recruits were sent to England, of which two-thirds only arrived after [[V-E Day]].{{sfn|Byers|1996|p=202}}

The Zombies were widely disliked and regarded as cowards by the men who had volunteered for overseas service.&lt;ref name="Chartrand2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Chartrand|first= René|date= 2001|title= Canadian Forces In World War II|url= |location= London|publisher= Osprey|page= 15|isbn= 978-1-84176-302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zombies wore a black tie and collared shirt as part of their uniform while volunteers for overseas duties did not.&lt;ref name="Chartrand2001"/&gt; In April 1945 when the men of the [[First Canadian Army]] were informed that henceforth they would now wear the Zombie black tie and collared shirt, the writer [[Farley Mowat]] serving with the [[Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]] wrote: "the black tie itself was known as the Zombie tie, and the resentment of the volunteers, who were now ordered to wear this symbol of shame, was most outspoken."&lt;ref name="Chartrand2001"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12652">'''OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals''' are a set of internationally accepted specifications for the testing of chemicals decided on by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).  They were first published in 1981. They are split into five sections:

* Section 1: Physical Chemical Properties
* Section 2: Effects on Biotic Systems
* Section 3: Degradation and Accumulation
* Section 4: Health Effects
* Section 5: Other Test Guidelines

Guidelines are numbered with three digit numbers, the section number being the first number.  Sometimes guidelines are suffixed with a letter.

Guidelines are under constant review, with guidelines being periodically updated, new guidelines being adopted, and guidelines being withdrawn.  Previous guidelines are maintained on the website for reference purposes.  [[Animal welfare]] concerns are dealt with by ensuring that animal tests are only permitted where necessary.

The guidelines are available in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

'''One Angel Square'''&lt;ref name="angelsquare"/&gt; is an office building in [[Manchester]], England. Construction work began in 2010 and was completed in February 2013. The landmark building is the [[Headquarters|head office]] of [[the Co-operative Group]]. Standing 72.5 metres (237.8 feet) tall, the building forms the centrepiece of the new £800 million [[NOMA, Manchester|NOMA]] development in the Angel Meadows area of [[Manchester city centre]]. The building cost at least £105 million to construct and was sold on [[Leaseback|leaseback terms]] in 2013 for £142 million.

One Angel Square is one of the most [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] large buildings in Europe and is built to a [[BREEAM]] 'Outstanding' rating.&lt;ref name="bam"/&gt; It is powered by a [[biodiesel]] [[cogeneration]] plant using [[rapeseed oil]] to provide electricity and heat.&lt;ref name="buro"/&gt; The structure makes use of natural resources, maximising [[passive solar gain]] for heat and using [[natural ventilation]] through its [[double-skin facade]], [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic cooling]], [[rainwater harvesting]], [[Greywater#Recycling|greywater recycling]] and [[waste heat]] recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Low Carbon Office design |url=http://www.forty4consulting.co.uk/portfolio/offices.asp |work=forty4consulting |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's distinctive form has been compared to a sliced [[Egg (food)|egg]] and a [[ship]].&lt;ref name="slicedegg"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Work Starts On Co-operative Groups Sliced Egg |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=2616 |work=skyscrapernews.com |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its design was announced by architects 3DReid in May 2009 and construction began in July 2010 with a projected completion date in March 2013. In December 2012, the scheme surpassed its pan-European sustainability aims and achieved a world-record BREEAM score of 95.32%.&lt;ref name="outstanding"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The UK's Most 'Outstanding' Green Building |url=http://designbuildsource.com.au/the-uks-most-outstanding-green-building |work=designbuildsource.com.au |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus building]], producing surplus energy and [[Zero-energy building|zero carbon emissions]]. The building has received numerous awards for its striking aesthetic and sustainability aims.

==History==
[[File:Exterior view of The Co-operative Group’s new head office.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A [[computer generated imagery|CGI]] image of the proposed design, announced in May 2009.]]

===Background===
[[The Co-operative Group]] announced plans to move from its headquarters on Miller Street and [[Corporation Street, Manchester|Corporation Street]] to a new site in the [[Greater Manchester]] area in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op to quit city centre |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1021973_coop_to_quit_city_centre |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2011, the group grew strongly according to CEO [[Peter Marks]], membership doubled to six million and revenue and profits also doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op's sound investment at the Manchester International Festival |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/entertainment/manchester_international_festival/s/1425053_co-ops-sound-investment-at-the-manchester-international-festival |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takeovers of [[Somerfield]] and the [[Britannia (former building society)|Britainnia Building Society]] fuelled impetus for new head offices to accommodate the growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op completes Somerfield move |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7918963.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the group announced it would remain in [[Manchester city centre]] and would regenerate land opposite its Miller Street base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op unveils site of new HQ |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1086492_coop_unveils_site_of_new_hq |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building is close to [[Angel Meadow]], the site of a 19th-century slum once described by [[Friedrich Engels]] as "hell on earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Angel Meadow: 'Hell upon Earth' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8233000/8233388.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists conducted a survey in 2010, which continued into 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Digging up the past: Archaeologists reveal grim secrets of Angel Meadow, Manchester's filthiest slum |last=Kirby |first=Dean |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1487068_digging-up-the-past-archaeologists-reveal-grim-secrets-of-angel-meadow-manchesters-filthiest-slum |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CIS Tower]] and [[the Co-operative Bank]]'s Balloon Street headquarters are unaffected by the development.&lt;ref name="newage"/&gt; New Century Hall, home to [[Co-operative Food]],&lt;ref name="backonschedule"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op Noma site back on schedule |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1423044_co-op-noma-site-back-on-schedule |work=Manchester Evening News |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dantzic, [[Hanover Building|Hanover]], [[Redfern Building|Redfern]] and Federation Buildings will be vacated and renovated for [[Renting|let]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op Plan New Headquarters In Manchester |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=1917 |work=skyscrapernews.com |date=19 December 2008 | accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the Co-operative announced  the [[NOMA, Manchester|NOMA]] project, '''no'''rth of '''Ma'''nchester city centre, to regenerate a 20-acre site with office, retail, residential and hotel space to encourage visitors from the city centre. [[Manchester City Council]] contributed £20m to the project as an incentive for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=£20m for 'Co-op quarter' |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1241843_20m_for_coop_quarter |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the Co-operative announced its new headquarters would be known as One Angel Square.&lt;ref name="angelsquare"/&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:One Angel Square from CIS Tower, Oct 2012.jpg|thumb|left|One Angel Square as viewed from the CIS Tower nearing completion in October 2012.]]
Construction work began in July 2010 soon after planning permission was granted.&lt;ref name="july10"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Work starts at £100m Co-op HQ |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1301947_work_starts_at_100m_coop_hq_ |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first task was installing the 539 [[Deep foundation|pile foundations]] - each at an average depth of 18 metres.&lt;ref name="schofield"&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 Angel Square: Picture And Video Gallery |last=Schofield |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Architecture/1-Angel-Square-A-Picture-Gallery |work=Manchester Confidential |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work soon began on assembling the 3,300 tonnes of [[steel]] and 1,948 [[coffer]]ed concrete floor slabs which make up the structure of the building.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt; BAM Construction was the main building contractor with cost management, project management and [[Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015|CDM coordination]] provided by Gardiner &amp; Theobald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Global Experience - Manchester: One Angel Square | url = http://www.gardiner.com/projects/?loc=11&amp;proj=65 | website = gardiner.com | publisher = Gardiner &amp; Theobald }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialist services were supplied by [[Buro Happold]] for [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[fire engineering]]&lt;ref name="buro"/&gt; and Austrian-based [[Waagner Biro]] was commissioned to build the double skin façade.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;  The structure was digitally modelled by BAM before commencing assembly and construction to improve safety and create a building schedule thus saving time during the construction process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=BAM Sustainability Report 2010 |url=http://www.bam.co.uk/brochure/csr/sustainability-report-2010/pageflip.html |work=BAM Construction |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 4,000 workers from over 90 companies were involved in the building's construction making it the largest building site outside South East England.&lt;ref name="newage"&gt;{{Cite news |title=New HQ for a new age |url=http://www.thenews.coop/article/new-hq-new-age |work=thenewscoop |date=1 June 2009 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Tough times' for building sector, say industry experts |quote=Another major building project is the new £100m Co-operative Group head office in Manchester city centre - the UK's largest construction site outside the south east. |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-12299143 |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was [[top out|topped out]] in November 2011 and work began assembling the bronze-coloured diagonal panels of exterior façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=NoMa tops out |url=http://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/news/archive/10479-noma-tops-out.html |work=Place North West |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels were installed using roped access techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op Manchester – Installation, Waagner Biro |url=http://www.alternativeaccess.com/news/alternative-access-logistics/2012/co-op-manchester-installation-waagner-biro/ |work=Alternative Access |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated £17m of building materials out of the total £100m cost has been locally sourced reducing [[embodied energy]] and minimising environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Local economy receives £17m bonus from Co-operative Group's new HQ |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1468241_local-economy-receives-17m-bonus-from-co-operative-groups-new-hq |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mecanoo]] and Manchester-based [[Royal Haskoning]] designed the [[landscape architecture|landscape]] in front of the building.&lt;ref name="milestone"/&gt;

The building's distinctive form was conceived in a notebook sketch by the lead architect for the building, Mike Hitchmough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Original sketch of The Co-operative's new head office |quote=Original notebook sketch of The Co-operative's new head office by Mike Hitchmough, lead architect for the development |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theco-operative/4556852859/ |work=Flickr |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form was refined and developed, before being unveiled to the public in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-op unveils designs of new HQ |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/8061378.stm |work=BBC News |date=21 May 2009 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's interior primarily consists of [[open plan]] space and can accommodate up to 4,000 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Exciting times for the Co-op - it even flourishes in hard times |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1426089_exciting-times-for-the-co-op---it-even-flourishes-in-hard-times |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has 327,643 sq ft (30,439 sq m) of total space - approximately 29,000 sq ft (2,694 sq m) per floor.&lt;ref name="july10"/&gt; In keeping with the building's green credentials, employees will be encouraged to use [[public transport]] or [[Cycling|cycle]] to work.

===Form===
The building has been nicknamed the 'sliced egg' because of its distinctive shape.&lt;ref name="slicedegg"/&gt; A focal point is the diagonal slice which creates a nine-floor high atrium with its glass roof tilted towards the south, maximising daylight and [[passive solar gain]].&lt;ref name="interior"/&gt; The structure has three internal concrete cores in the form of an [[equilateral triangle]].&lt;ref name="interior"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Co-operative Group's Manchester HQ features shape of a sliced egg |url=http://www.worldinteriordesignnetwork.com/news/cooperative_groups_manchester_hq_features_shape_of_a_sliced_egg_100820/ |work=World Interior Design Network |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steel]] was utilised as the building main material; its strength allows for large column-free floors needed in an open plan building.&lt;ref name="steel"/&gt;

The building's exterior has a [[double skin facade]] with a cavity between its inner windows and the outer glass panel structure. The double skin facade is for sustainability and aesthetic reasons - and allows for greater control of [[HVAC|heating and ventilation]], and accentuates the three curved corners of the building. To accentuate the form further, the exterior aluminium structure holding the glass panels in place has been [[anodise]]d in a bronze-coloured finish, so it will shimmer in the sun. The facade was originally to be powder-coated but the client decided to spend an additional £120,000 on a bronze anodised finish. This excess was justified as being cheaper over 50 years than using a powder-coated finish which would require maintenance.&lt;ref name="buildingd"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Co-op's HQ: Have you heard the buzz? |url=http://www.building.co.uk/the-co-ops-hq-have-you-heard-the-buzz?/5046284.article |work=building.co.uk |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's form has been compared with [[The Ark, London|The Ark]] and [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="buildingd"/&gt;

===Sustainability===
[[File:Co op Building dual facade.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the double skin façade that increases natural ventilation. There is a walkway between the inner and exterior façade panels for maintenance and solar shading.]]
The building is one of the largest in Europe to have a [[BREEAM]] outstanding distinction as a result of its high, sustainable energy credentials.&lt;ref name="sustainability"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Sustainable development |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/estates/Developments/New-Head-Office/Sustainable/ |work=The Co-operative Group |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011 the building achieved the highest recorded BREEAM score, making it one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world.&lt;ref name="outstanding"/&gt;

The open atrium faces south to collect heat from the sun, an example of [[passive solar building design]].&lt;ref name="sustainability"/&gt; The diagonal slice is angled to the south to allow sunlight to pass into the upper floors and atrium. The sun emits [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[ultraviolet]], but changes to [[infrared]] when it passes through glass. This creates heat inside the building and overheating will be countered by five stepped curved shades above the atrium which prevent sunlight overheating the building and stops glare. In winter, louvres atop the double-skin façade are closed to maintain the warm air generated in the building. In summer, the opposite occurs and louvres atop the double-skin façade open and consequently expel hot, rising air from the building to reduce overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=One Angel Square, Co-operative Group HQ |url=http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=598 |work=breeam.org |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521150355/http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=598 |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's sustainable [[cogeneration]] heat and power plant uses bio-fuel and waste [[cooking oil]]. Its computer systems will recycle [[waste heat]]. The building has a used water recycling system and [[rainwater harvesting]].&lt;ref name="sustainability"/&gt; [[Thermal mass]] materials which have a high density such as concrete are used to control temperature fluctuations.

'''Originality''' is the aspect of created or invented works as being new or novel, and thus distinguishable from [[replica|reproductions]], clones, [[forgery|forgeries]], or [[derivative work]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=and clarify how or if this differs from the legal concept}} 
An original work is one not received from others nor one copied from or based upon the work of others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. It is a work created with a unique style and substance.
The term "originality" is often applied as a compliment to the [[creativity]] of [[artist]]s, [[writer]]s, and [[Intellectual|thinker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The modern idea of originality is tied to [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1997) pp. 12-13 quote: {{quotation|Modernist concern with issues of originality develops out of modernism's relation to romanticism, the romantics having invented the notion of originality as we know it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a notion that is often called [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Smith24"&gt;Smith (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterhouse26"&gt;Waterhouse (1926)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macfarlane07"&gt;Macfarlane (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of originality is culturally contingent. At the time of [[Shakespeare]], it was more common to appreciate the similarity with an admired classical work, and Shakespeare himself avoided "unnecessary invention".&lt;ref name="Lynch02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RSC07"&gt;[[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (2007) ''The RSC Shakespeare - William Shakespeare Complete Works'', Introduction to the Comedy of Errors, p. 215 quote: &lt;blockquote&gt;while we applaud difference, Shakespeare's first audiences fovoured likeness: a work was good not because it was original, but because it resembled an admired classical exemplar, which in the case of comedy meant a play by Terence or Plautus&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindey, Alexander (1952) ''Plagiarism and Originality''&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the start of the 18th century that the concept of originality became an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] in [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;Lynch, Jack (2002) [http://www.writing-world.com/rights/lynch.shtml ''The Perfectly Acceptable Practice of Literary Theft: Plagiarism, Copyright, and the Eighteenth Century''], in ''[http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/index.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation]'' 24, no. 4 (Winter 2002–3), pp. 51–54. Also available online since 2006 at ''Writing World''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Young]] (1759) ''Conjectures on Original Composition''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Originality in law==

In law, originality has become an important [[legal concept]] with respect to [[intellectual property]], where creativity and [[invention]] have manifest as [[copyright]]able works.{{clarify|date=July 2009|reason=please explain what it means in law: wikinews at http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.K._National_Portrait_Gallery_threatens_U.S._citizen_with_legal_action_over_Wikimedia_images claims "The legal concept of originality here involves the simple origination of a work from an author, and does not include the notions of novelty or innovation that is often associated with the non-legal meaning of the word." - is this considered correct or not?}}
In the [[patent]] law of the [[United States]] and most other countries, only original [[invention]]s are subject to protection. In addition to being original, inventions submitted for a patent must also be useful and [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|nonobvious]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[United States copyright law]] and the law of many other states, copyrights protect only ''original'' works of authorship, a property which has been historically and legally linked to a concept of "[[creativity]]". A work must pass a [[threshold of originality]] in order to be copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Feist v. Rural]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom]] [[intellectual property]] law, a [[derived work]] can demonstrate originality, and must do so if it is to respect copyright.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Originality under the United States Copyright Law ==

In the [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law of the United States]], more specifically under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 17 U.S.C 102], the work that is sought to be protected must satisfy the threshold for [[Threshold of originality|originality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 {{!}} U.S. Copyright Office|last=Office|first=U.S. Copyright|website=www.copyright.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of the countries require certain degree of [[Threshold of originality|originality]] in the work sought to be protected, such requirement does not stem from either the [[Berne Convention]] or the [[TRIPS Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/ta_docs_e/modules2_e.pdf|last=Module 2, Copyright and Related Rights|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is no uniformity in the standard for [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. In the [[United States]], [[Threshold of originality|originality]] necessitates bare minimum degree of creativity and independent creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#The_Concept_of_Originality|title=Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law - Copyright for Librarians|website=cyber.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the case of '''''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co]].'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/|title=Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Svc. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; held that the work must be independently created and must possess minimum degree of creativity. This interpretation requires an extremely low level of creativity and in the words of the court, “must possess some creative spark no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/|title=Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Svc. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also took the opportunity to reject the previously judicially-established and followed the ''[[sweat of the brow]]'' doctrine. According to the said doctrine, labour and hard-work alone could suffice to establish [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. After the dosctrine was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1991, in the [[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.|'''''Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp''''']]&lt;ref&gt;36 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; ''case'', the court held that the copies of public domain photographs could not be copyrighted since they lacked [[Threshold of originality|originality]] and while such reproductions may have involved skill and labour, no protection could be granted to them, on account of lack of [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. 

While the current legal requirements of [[Threshold of originality|originality]] viz. minimum level of creativity and independent labour can be easily assessed and applied in case of literary works, the courts are required to undertake a deeper legal and factual inquiry in photographic works. The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court for Southern District of New York]] in '''''[https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/cx/2005_Mannion.pdf Mannion v. Coors Brewing Company]'''''&lt;ref&gt;377 F.Supp.2d 444&lt;/ref&gt; considered originality in terms of timing, subject and rendition, and held that the nature and extent of the copyright would be independent in the three aspects. The requirement for [[Threshold of originality|originality]] was incorporated in the statute only in the Copyright Act, 1976 and over the course of time, the courts have evolved various metrics to apply the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/originality-requirements.html|title=Originality Requirements under U.S. and E.U. Copyright Law - Software Freedom Law Center|website=softwarefreedom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike, [[Novelty (patent)|Patents]], novelty is not required for a work to be considered as original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102|title=35 U.S. Code § 102 - Conditions for patentability; novelty|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/81/49/1475281/ '''''Sheldon (1936)''''']&lt;ref&gt;'''81 F.2d 49 (2d Cir. 1936)''' &lt;/ref&gt; had clarified that sometimes it is relevant for other purposes. Therefore, if the work created by you is identical to a pre-existing work but you are unaware of the latter's existence, you may still enjoy copyright protection for your work. 

Apart from novelty, the work is not required to be made with an intent to be original.  What is considered is only that it is actually an independent creation in effect. In 1951, the court in '''''[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/191/99/91570/ Alfred Bell Co. v. Catalda Arts]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/1775|title=Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts|website=h2o.law.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; held that the question as to whether there was intent to be original was not to be considered. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has also clarified that it is not necessary for the work to be artistic to qualify as original.  Furthermore, in the landmark ruling, the court observed that it would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Monet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. This observation was an embodiment of the principle of artistic or aesthetic neutrality which seeks to eliminate the inherent subjectivity involved in the judges deciding whether the work is artistic, and hence, the question as to whether it warrants protection.  The principle finds four broad justifications- (i) lack of expertise in the judges (ii) fear of elitism (iii) fear of paternalism (also called parentalism) (iv) lack of consensus on what constitutes art.  However, scholars note that the principle of aesthetic neutrality is often violated as the adjudicators end up favouring creators of what they believe is deserving of copyright grant.

In the United States, the work is not required to be non-commercial in nature for copyright protection and unlike the US trademark law, the work need to be necessarily lawful.  Therefore, works created for commercial purposes, such as advertisements can also be granted a copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/originality-requirements.html|title=Originality Requirements under U.S. and E.U. Copyright Law - Software Freedom Law Center|website=www.softwarefreedom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Originality Under Indian Copyright Law ==
[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/4010217/ Section 13(1)(a) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957] mentions 'originality' as a requirement for copyright protection to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Courts have interpreted this requirement of 'originality' in different ways. This has given rise to various doctrines/tests that can be helpful in determining whether a work meets the threshold of originality. The most prominent case with respect to 'originality' under the Indian Copyright Law is the ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1062099/ Eastern Book Company v DCB Modak]''&lt;ref&gt;Appeal (civil)  6472 of 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. This judgment gave rise to two doctrines i.e. ''modicum of creativity'' and the ''skill and judgment test''. This remains the accepted and current position of law in India as of now. However, prior to this, the Indian Courts used to follow the [[Sweat of the brow|Sweat of the Brow]] approach.

=== Sweat of the Brow theory ===
This theory bases the grant of copyright protection on the effort and labour that an author puts into her work as opposed to the creativity involved. [[Labor theory of property|Locke's theory of labour as property]] has often been extended to give jurisprudential basis to this theory of copyright law. In the case of ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1836871/ V. Govindan v E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone,]''&lt;ref&gt;AIR 1955 Mad 391&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that compilations of information would meet the threshold of 'originality' under the Indian Copyright Act since it involves some level of 'skill, labour and brain'.&lt;ref&gt;¶8, V. Govindan vs E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone And Anr. (AIR 1955 Mad 391)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar line of reasoning was adopted in the case of ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/130087/ Burlington Home Shipping Pvt Ltd v Rajnish Chibber]''&lt;ref&gt;1995 IVAD Delhi 732&lt;/ref&gt; where a database was held to be original enough to be protected by copyright under Indian law. However, like in other jurisdictions, this theory was discarded by the Indian Courts also and the focus was shifted to the creativity involved in any work. 

=== EBC Modak Case (Modicum of Creativity &amp; Skill and Judgment Test) ===
The EBC Modak case is the Indian counterpart of the [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|Feist Publications case]] in terms of the test it laid down. It concerned the copyrightability of Supreme Court judgments that were copy-edited and published by Eastern Book Company. These judgments were published along with 'headnotes' that were written by the Company itself. While explicitly discarding the Sweat of the Brow theory, the Court held that simply copy editing would not meet the threshold of originality under copyright law since it would only demonstrate an "''amount of skill, labour and capital put in the inputs of the copy-edited judgments and the original or innovative thoughts for the creativity would be completely excluded.''"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;¶37, ''Eastern Book Company v DB Modak''&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, it introduced the requirement of 'creativity' under originality. With respect to the level of creativity involved, the court adopted the 'minimal degree of creativity' approach. Following this standard, the headnotes that did not copy from the judgment verbatim were held to be copyrightable.

Finally, the Court also gave way to the 'Skill and Judgment Test' which is more or less a compromise between the sweat of the brow theory and the modicum of creativity test. While relying on the [[CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada|CCH Canadian Case]],&lt;ref&gt;[2004] 1 SCR 339&lt;/ref&gt; the Court essentially held that a work would meet the originality standard as long as there is labour or effort involved but not ''only'' labour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It must involve some level of skill and judgment as well. However, this approach mirrors the Sweat of the Brow theory more closely and is therefore a difficult theory to defend. Further, the Court held the division of a judgment into paragraphs and numbering them was enough to meet this standard of 'Skill and Judgment'. Whether this is the correct interpretation of the test as given in the CCH Canadian Case&lt;ref&gt;¶16, CCH Canadian ''Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada'', [2004] 1 SCR 339&lt;/ref&gt; remains debatable. 

== Originality in science ==
[[Scientific literature]] considered as [[primary source|primary]] must contain [[original research]], and even [[review articles]] contain original [[analysis]] or [[Interpretation_(philosophy)#Scientific_interpretation|interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobin|first1=Martin J.|title=Writing a Review Article for AJRCCM|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=October 2003|volume=168|issue=7|pages=732–734|doi=10.1164/rccm.2306019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Originality of ideas and creative works==
An original idea is one not thought up by another person beforehand. Sometimes, two or more people can come up with the same idea independently.

The evaluation of originality depends not only on the creative work itself, but also on the temporal context, the [[zeitgeist]]. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical [[Theme (music)|music themes]], the importance of objective characteristics and the zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), as well as its "absolute" originality influenced in similar [[Effect size|magnitude]] the popularity of a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|date=1980|title=Thematic fame, melodic originality, and musical zeitgeist: A biographical and transhistorical content analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/38/6/972|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=972–983|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.6.972|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jocb.230|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230|issn=0022-0175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original recording==
An original [[painting]], [[photographic negative]], [[Analog recording|analog]] audio, or video recording, will contain qualities that can be difficult, or under current technology may be impossible to [[Copying|copy]] in its full integrity. That can also apply for any other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]].

That is why it is often necessary to [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserve]] the original, in order to preserve its original integrity. The copy is made to preserve the original recording by saving the original from degenerating as it is being played, rather than to replace the original.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Paraguay]] on 4 August 1940.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II'', p428 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It saw voters approve the [[Constitution of Paraguay|new constitution]].&lt;ref name=N1/&gt;

==Background==
In 1939 President [[José Félix Estigarribia]] responded to a political stalemate by dissolving Congress and declared himself absolute [[dictator]]. To dramatize his government's desire for change, he scrapped the existing constitution and produced a new one. The new constitution reflected Estigarribia's desire for stability and power and provided for an extremely powerful state and executive. The President would be elected in direct elections for a term of five years, with re-election permitted for one additional term. They would also be able to intervene in the economy, control the press, suppress private groups, suspend individual liberties, and take exceptional actions for the good of the state. The Senate was abolished and the Chamber of Representatives limited in power. A new advisory Council of State was created, modeled on the experience of [[corporatist]] Italy and Portugal, to represent group interests including business, farmers, bankers, the military, and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The military was responsible for safeguarding the Constitution.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{csref|country=paraguay|author=Thomas C. Bruneau|section=Constitutional Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8317">'''Positive laws''' ({{lang-la|ius positum}}) are human-made laws that oblige or specify an action. It also describes the establishment of specific rights for an individual or group. Etymologically, the name derives from the verb ''to posit''.

The concept of positive law is distinct from "[[natural law]]", which comprises inherent rights, conferred not by act of legislation but by "God, nature or reason."{{sfn|Kelsen|2007|p=392}} Positive law is also described as the law that applies at a certain time (present or past) and at a certain place, consisting of [[statutory law]], and [[case law]] as far as it is binding.  More specifically, positive law may be characterized as "law actually and specifically enacted or adopted by proper authority for the government of an organized jural society."{{sfn|Black|1979}}

==''Lex humana'' versus ''lex posita''==
{{see also|Man-made law#Lex humana versus lex posita}}
[[Thomas Aquinas]] conflated [[man-made law]] (''lex humana'') and positive law (''lex posita'' or ''ius positivum'').{{sfn|Flannery|2001|p=73}}{{sfn|Voegelin|1997|p=227&amp;ndash;228}}{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=214}}  However, there is a subtle distinction between them.  Whereas human-made law regards law from the position of its origins (i.e. who it was that posited it), positive law regards law from the position of its legitimacy.  Positive law is law by the will of whoever made it, and thus there can equally be divine positive law as there is man-made positive law. Positive Law theory stems from the powers that have enacted it. This type of law is necessary as it is manmade or enacted by the state to protect the rights of the individuals, the governed, to resolve civil disputes and lastly to maintain order and safety in the society.  (More literally translated, ''lex posita'' is posit''ed'' rather than posit''ive'' law.){{sfn|Flannery|2001|p=73}}  In the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' Thomas himself writes of divine positive law where he says "''Si autem lex sit divinitus posita, auctoritate divina dispensatio fieri potest'' (if the law be divinely given, dispensation can be granted by divine authority)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#125 SCG (Hanover House edn 1955-57) bk 3, ch 125.10]&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Lex autem a Deo posita est'' (But the Law was established by God)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles4.htm SCG (Hanover House edn 1955-57) bk 4, ch 34(17)].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Luther]] also acknowledged the idea of divine positive law, as did [[Juan de Torquemada (cardinal)|Juan de Torquemada]].{{sfn|Heckel|Heckel|Krodel|2010|pp=45,51,285}}

[[Thomas Mackenzie, Lord Mackenzie|Thomas Mackenzie]] divided the law into four parts, with two types of positive law: divine positive law, [[natural law]], the positive law of independent states, and the [[law of nations]].{{sfn|Mackenzie|1862|p=42}}  The first, divine positive law, "concerns the duties of religion" and is derived from revelation.  He contrasted it with divine ''natural'' law, which is "recognized by reason alone, without the aid of revelation".{{sfn|Mackenzie|1862|p=42}}  The third, the positive law of independent states, is the law posited by "the supreme power in the state".  It is, in other words, man-made positive law.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1862|p=45}}  The fourth, the law of nations, regulates "independent states in their intercourse with each other".{{sfn|Mackenzie|1862|p=52}}

Thomas Aquinas has little difficulty with the idea of both divine positive law and human positive law, since he places no requirements upon the person who posits law that exclude either humans or the divine.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=214}}  However, for other philosophers the idea of both divine and human positive law has proven to be a stumbling block.   [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]] both espoused the notion of an ultimate sovereign.  Where Thomism (and indeed Mackenzie) divided sovereignty into the spiritual (God) and the temporal (Mackenzie's "supreme power in the state"), both Hobbes and Austin sought a single, undivided, sovereign as the ultimate source of the law.  The problem that this causes is that a temporal sovereign cannot exist if humans are subject to a divine positive law, but if divine positive law does not apply to all humans then God cannot be sovereign either.  Hobbes and Austin's answer to this is to deny the existence of divine ''positive'' law, and to invest sovereignty in humans, that are &amp;mdash; however &amp;mdash; subject to divine ''natural'' law.  The temporal authority is sovereign, and responsible for translating divine natural law into human positive law.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=155&amp;ndash;156,214}}

James Bernard Murphy explains: "although our philosophers often seek to use the term ''positive'' to demarcate specifically human law, the term and concept are not well suited to do so.  All of divine law is positive in source, and much of it is positive in content &amp;#91;&amp;hellip;&amp;#93;."{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=214}}

== Legal positivism ==
This term is also sometimes used to refer to the legal philosophy ''[[legal positivism]]'', as distinct from the schools of [[natural law]] and [[legal realism]]. In this sense, the term is often used in relation to the [[United States Code]], portions of which restate [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] (i.e., positive law), while other portions have themselves been enacted and are thus positive law.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

With respect to the broader sense, various [[philosopher]]s have put forward theories contrasting the value of positive law relative to [[natural law]]. The [[normative theory of law]], as put forth by the [[Brno school]], gave pre-eminence to positive law because of its rational nature. [[Classical liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophers usually favor natural law over legal positivism. Positive law, to French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], was freedom from internal obstacles.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Among the foremost proponents of legal positivism in the twentieth century was [[Hans Kelsen]], both in his European years prior to 1940, and in his American years following 1940 until his death in 1973.

[[File:The Times history of the war (1914) (14762199554).jpg|thumb|British prize court in World War I]]
A '''prize court''' is a court (or even a single individual, such as an [[ambassador]] or [[consul (representative)|consul]]) authorized to consider whether [[Prize (law)|prize]]s have been lawfully captured, typically whether a ship has been lawfully captured or seized in time of war or under the terms of the seizing ship's [[letters of marque and reprisal]].  A prize court may order the sale or destruction of the seized ship, and the distribution of any proceeds to the captain and crew of the seizing ship.  A prize court may also order the return of a seized ship to its owners if the seizure was unlawful, such as if seized from a country which had proclaimed its [[Neutral country|neutrality]].

==History/jurisdiction in various countries==
Prize courts were common in the 17th through 19th centuries, during times of American or European naval warfare.  The United States in 1780 established the Federal [[Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture]] to hear appeals of prize cases from state prize courts; this court was ended in 1787, after conclusion of the war. Under current [[U.S. law]], pursuant to {{UnitedStatesCode|10|7651|7681}}, the [[United States district court|district court]]s have exclusive jurisdiction in prize cases. Due to changes in the nature of naval warfare, no prize cases have been heard since the statutes were adopted in 1956.

In [[England and Wales]], prize jurisdiction is exercised by the [[Admiralty Court]], part of the [[Queen's Bench]] Division of the [[High Court of Justice]] (see Prize Courts Act 1894 and [[Senior Courts Act 1981]], ss. 20(1)(d), 27 and 62(2)), and by way of appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

In [[France]], the prize council (Conseil des prises) has jurisdiction to determine the issue of the prize. Since 2007, piracy has been transferred to criminal courts. The council's jurisdiction is reduced to war time. The way of appeal is open to the [[President of the French Republic]] acting as judge.

The [[International Prize Court]] was an international court proposed at the beginning of the 20th century, to hear prize cases. An international agreement, the ''Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court'', was established at [[The Hague]] on October 18, 1907, but this was never ratified or implemented.

'''Purveyance''' is the right of the [[Monarch|Crown]] to requisition goods and services for royal use, and was developed in [[England]] over the course of the late eleventh through the fourteenth centuries. In theory, the king's prerogative allowed him to collect goods needed for both household and military use, but the latter was discontinued in 1362. The primary problem with the system was that it was open to abuse from [[political corruption|corrupt officials]], who would often requisition goods and sell them for profit or use [[extortion]] and other means to obtain items or money that was not passed on or divulged to the king. Accordingly, English kings established numerous, though somewhat ineffectual, statutes in an attempt to limit the corruption.

When [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and the English Army invaded [[Scotland]], with little [[agricultural productivity]], they used purveyances. The English court had, of old, a right of customary purchase of food for the poor. The right was called '''prise'''. Edward took this and grossly expanded it to make the institution called purveyance. The [[sheriff]]s would buy food at a set price in the shires and the sellers had to sell at the government price. The government then created a system to store the food. Edward created a [[convoy]] system to move mountains of food from the English Midlands to southern Scotland, which the English controlled. Administrative historians say this was a real triumph in organizational power of government, but also a [[racket (crime)|racket]] because Edward paid late and low.&lt;ref&gt;(Recorded Lecture, Professor [[William E. Kapelle]], Brandeis University December 8th, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Discovery-Media&gt;Discovery Media: "[http://www.blurbwire.com/topics/Purveyance About Purveyance]." Retrieved on September 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward I also employed purveyances for his many [[Wales|Welsh]] campaigns, utilizing the produce of both the [[Isle of Anglesey]] and [[Ireland]]. Purveyance was largely the cause for intense dissatisfaction over Edward's campaign in [[Gascony]] of 1294–8, and in 1298, a nationwide investigation was held into abuses of royal administrators, including purveyors.

Purveyance continued to be the favoured method of the English kings for obtaining food and other necessities for feeding their armies, supplying their castles and garrisons, and supporting their itinerant households. Both [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used the system heavily: the former in his unsuccessful campaign against Scotland and then in the civil war against [[Thomas of Lancaster]] and the latter in his relatively successful campaign against Scotland and then in [[France]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. 

It was under Edward III that the issue of corruption and abuses that accompanied the collection of goods for military use particularly came to a head. Complaints reached such a feverish pitch in the opening years of the Hundred Years' War that Edward III launched another nationwide investigation, and effectively removed most purveyors from office. However, purveyance was too valuable a royal privilege to surrender, and it was only in 1362, under intense pressure from [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], that Edward III agreed to discontinue purveyance for military use.

When [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] was preparing for war against France during the Hundred Years' War, he ordered the continuance of purveyance for military purposes, but with the supposed order for all purveyors to be fair and reasonable, not to take any goods from church property, and to pay a fair price. However, many of the purveyors behaved notoriously badly, extorting many foodstuffs from the peasants and either buying at a low price and selling at a high price for a profit, or not paying at all.

Faced by a purveyor with armed men backing him, most peasants did not dare to resist. King Henry, acknowledging the corruption of his purveyors, included in a proclamation that anyone harassed or aggrieved by any captain or soldier should present themselves to the [[seneschal]] of the king's treasury. Complete justice, the king proclaimed, would be given on his arrival at Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;Agincourt, Juliet Barker, Abacus, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of purveyance as a tool for supplying the growing [[Royal Household|royal household]] would eventually come under fire with the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].

In the 17th century, purveyance was worth about £40,000 per year to the crown. However, Parliament wanted to put an end to it, though [[James I of England|James I]] would not relinquish that control without being financially compensated by Parliament. Parliament feared this would lead only to further corruption and no changes were made to the system during the reign of James I. During the Commonwealth an ''Act for taking away Purveyance and compositions for Purveyance'' was passed 12 December 1656 and given assent 9 June 1657. Since all laws of that period were declared null and void upon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], it would be the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], which finally abolished purveyance and other feudal charges.

[[File:Leeds castle red boxes.JPG|thumb|Right|A pair of Despatch boxes]]
'''Despatch boxes''', also known as '''red boxes''' or sometimes '''ministerial boxes''', are produced by [[Barrow Hepburn &amp; Gale]] and are used by [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British government]] to carry their documents. Similar in appearance to a [[briefcase]], they are primarily used to hold and transport official [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|departmental]] papers from place to place. They are not to be confused with the parliamentary [[despatch box]]es from which speeches are given in Parliament, although ministerial boxes are also referred to as "despatch boxes" in government documents.&lt;ref name="HMT 1 March 2011" /&gt;

==Ministerial box==
===Use===
According to [[HM Treasury]],
:"Ministers are permitted to use ordinary lockable briefcases to transport information which has been classified 'Confidential' or below. For information with a higher security level (such as 'Secret') they are required to use dispatch boxes, which offer a higher level of security, and which are usually red. However a travel version of the box is also available in black, which offers the same level of security as a red box, but is designed to be less conspicuous. In practice Ministers use despatch boxes for transporting the majority of their documents due to the greater level of security they offer."&lt;ref name="HMT 1 March 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Boxes - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministerial-red-boxes--2/red-boxes|website=www.gov.uk|date=1 March 2011|publisher=HM Treasury|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
The design of ministerial boxes has changed little since the 1860s. The boxes are manufactured in London by [[Barrow Hepburn &amp; Gale]]. Covered in red-stained rams' leather, they are embossed with the [[Royal Cypher]] and ministerial title. The {{convert|2|–|3|kg|0|adj=on}} boxes are constructed of slow-grown pine, lined with lead and black satin and, unlike a briefcase, the lock is on the bottom, opposite the hinges and the handle, to guarantee that the box is locked before being carried.&lt;ref name="BBC-8579587"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8579587.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thinking inside the box | date=23 March 2010 | first=Rajini | last=Vaidyanathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colour red has remained the traditional covering of the boxes.&lt;ref name="BBC-8579587"/&gt; The lead lining, which has been retained in modern boxes, was once meant to ensure that the box sank when thrown overboard in the event of capture.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems'': Chapter 14, Physical Tamper Resistance, p. 278 ([http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-14.pdf Online text] on the [[Cambridge University]] Computer Laboratory website)&lt;/ref&gt; Also bomb-proof, they are designed to survive any catastrophe that may befall their owner.&lt;ref name="whip"/&gt;

Exceptions to the red colouring are those carried by the [[Whip (politics)|government whips]], which are covered in black leather.&lt;ref name="whip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/mpwebsites/mparticles/mparticledetails/newsarticle/black-box-business///mpsite/kevin-brennan/|title=Black Box Business|author=[[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discreet black boxes are also available for ministers who need to travel by train.&lt;ref name="BBC-8579587"/&gt;

===Cost===
One box cost £865.43 in 2010.&lt;ref name="HMT 1 March 2011" /&gt; Between 2002 and 2007 the British Government spent £57,260 on new boxes.&lt;ref name="BBC-8579587"/&gt;

==Other variations==
===Budget Box===
[[File:Cropped Gladstone's Red Box.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Gladstone's Budget Box, made around 1860]]
Perhaps the best known red box is the '''Budget Box''', which is held up for a [[photoshoot]] outside [[11 Downing Street]], when the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] announces the Cabinet's annual [[budget]] plans. The first budget box was made for [[William Ewart Gladstone]] around 1860 and is lined in black satin and covered with scarlet leather. This box has been used by every Chancellor until 2011, with the exceptions of [[James Callaghan]] (1964–1967) and [[Gordon Brown]] (1997–2007), who had new ones commissioned in 1965 and 1997 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/budget/3379476/The-Budget-Box.html The Budget Box]&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's budget box was used by [[Alistair Darling]] (2007–2010) and by [[George Osborne]] in June 2010. It was subsequently retired due to its fragility, and will be displayed in the [[Cabinet War Rooms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1287794/Gladstones-box-set-pensioned-weeks-Budget.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Tim | last=Shipman | title=Gladstone's box set to be pensioned off after next week's Budget | date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2011, a new budget box commissioned by The National Archives has been used.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/03/20/the-budget-red-boxes-and-booze/ |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Simon |last=Read |title=The Budget: Red Boxes and Booze! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524232356/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/03/20/the-budget-red-boxes-and-booze/ |archivedate=24 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Budget Box of 1997 is made of yellow [[pine]] with a [[brass]] handle and lock, covered in scarlet leather and embossed with the [[Royal Cypher]] and the words ''Chancellor of the Exchequer'' directly beneath it.

===Royal red boxes===
Other red boxes of note are the ones delivered to the [[British monarchy|British Sovereign]] every day (except [[Christmas Day]] and [[Easter Sunday]]) by government departments, via the [[Page of the Presence]]. These boxes contain [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] and [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] documents,{{fact|date=December 2015}} most of which the monarch must sign and give [[Royal Assent]] to, before they can become law.{{fact|date=December 2015}}

===Green box===
Permanent Secretaries, who are civil servants rather than MPs or Lords, have similar boxes but coloured green. These have exactly the same function as the ministerial red boxes.

==Use in Singapore==
Former Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was said to have used a red box similar to the British ones, the exception being the logo. Education Minister [[Heng Swee Keat]], formerly Principal Private Secretary to Lee, revealed in a Facebook post that Lee continued using the red box till 4 February 2015, the day before his final hospitalisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/mr-lee-kuan-yews-red-box-heng-swee-keat-20150324]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Sri Lanka==
Until the late 2000's the Minister of Finance used a red box with the national emblem to carry the Cabinet's annual budget plans, similar to the Budget Box of the British government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7708">'''Rent control in Ontario''' refers to a system of [[rent regulation]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] which limits the amount by which the rent paid by tenants for rental accommodation can increase.

==History==
Rent regulation was first introduced in Ontario under the ''National Housing Act 1944''. After lobbying by business it was repealed in under a decade.

The modern history of rent controls began in July 1975 when the ''[[Residential Premises Rent Review Act 1975]]'' was enacted after the demand for rent controls became a major issue in the period leading to the [[Ontario general election, 1975|1975 provincial election]].&lt;ref name="Russell1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Russell|title=Federalism and the Charter: Leading Constitutional Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKigyfekmYsC&amp;pg=PA236|year=1989|publisher=MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-8428-0|pages=233-236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the ''Residential Tenancies Act'' was enacted.&lt;ref name="Russell1989"/&gt;

In 1985, the new [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberal]] government tightened rent controls with the ''Residential Rent Regulation Act'' and in 1992 the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] government of [[Bob Rae]] passed the ''Rent Control Act 1992''.&lt;ref name="TribunalOntario2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal|author2=Ontario|title=Ontario Residential Tenancies : Legislation, Rules and Guidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbL-BKec90gC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2002|publisher=CCH Canadian Limited|isbn=978-1-55141-045-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The ''Tenant Protection Act 1997'' was enacted by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Mike Harris]] and proclaimed in June 1998.&lt;ref name="Kälin2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian H. Kälin|title=International Real Estate Handbook: Acquisition, Ownership and Sale of Real Estate Residence, Tax and Inheritance Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfPgRUff_7QC&amp;pg=PA169|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02122-4|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act retained selected rights and obligations contained in Part IV of the previous ''Landlord and Tenant Act''.  (Parts I, II, and III were retitled the ''Commercial Tenancies Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90l07_e.htm |title=Commercial Tenancies Act |publisher=E-laws.gov.on.ca |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  The ''Tenant Protection Act'' both repealed the ''Rent Control Act'' and removed the dispute resolution process of the ''Landlord Tenant Act'', including evictions and rent increases, from the Ontario court system and assigned jurisdiction to a newly created [[quasi-judicial]] body, the [[Landlord and Tenant Board|Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/human-rights-and-rental-housing-ontario-background-paper/rental-housing-landscape-ontario |title=The Rental Housing Landscape in Ontario &amp;#124; Ontario Human Rights Commission |publisher=Ohrc.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the TPA landlord applications for eviction were automatically granted without a hearing unless the tenant filed a notice of dispute within five days. This provision had been the subject of a complaint to the [[Ontario Ombudsman]] and was removed from the new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltb.gov.on.ca/en/Law/116335.html |title=Interpretation Guidelines - Guideline #7 |publisher=Ltb.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current law==
The ''[[Residential Tenancies Act, 2006]]'' is the current law in Ontario that governs [[landlord-tenant law|landlord and tenant]] relations in residential rental accommodations.&lt;ref name="BoironBoiron2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pierre Boiron|author2=Claude Boiron|title=Commercial Real Estate Investing in Canada: The Complete Reference for Real Estate Professionals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFFDlgDjYBgC&amp;pg=PT698|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-73906-8|page=698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act received [[royal assent]] on June 22, 2006 and was proclaimed into law on January 31, 2007.  The Act repealed and replaced the ''Tenant Protection Act'', 1997 and created the [[Landlord and Tenant Board]] as a replacement for the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ontario.ca/archive/en/2006/10/20/Residential-Tenancies-Act-Takes-Effect-January-31-2007.html |title=Newsroom : Residential Tenancies Act Takes Effect January 31, 2007 |publisher=News.ontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rent control in Ontario formerly only applied to units that were first built or occupied before November 1, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://o.canada.com/business/rent-increase-loophole-leaves-ontario-renters-vulnerable&lt;/ref&gt; If the rental unit was in an apartment building constructed (or converted from a non-residential use) after November 1, 1991, then the rent control provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 did not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, s. 6(2)|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_06r17_e.htm#BK6|website=E-Laws|publisher=Government of Ontario|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2017, Premier of Ontario [[Kathleen Wynne]], along with [[Chris Ballard (politician)|Chris Ballard]], Minister of Housing, announced the Fair Housing Plan.  The plan includes a provision to roll-back the post-1991 rent control exemption such that all private rental units, including ones built or first occupied on or after November 1, 1991 will be subject to rent control.   This change will be effective April 20, 2017 regardless of when the legislation is passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rent-byebye-1991-loophole-1.4077446|title=Bye bye 1991 loophole — rent control to expand to all rental units in Ontario|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Safe Streets and Communities Act''''' is a bill that was passed by the [[41st Canadian Parliament]] 154-129 on March 12, 2012.

When [[Canadian Parliament|Parliament]] re-convened in September 2011, the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] introduced the ''Safe Streets and Communities Act'', an [[omnibus bill]] of nine separate measures. The measures include replacing the pardon system with 'record suspensions', [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentence]]s for certain sexual offences and mandatory minimum penalties for certain drug offences, making it illegal to make sexually explicit information available to a child, increasing prison sentences for [[Legal history of cannabis in Canada|marijuana offences]], reducing the ability of judges to sentence certain offenders to [[Conditional sentence (Canada)|house arrest]], allowing immigration officers to deny work permits to foreigners who are at risk of being sexually exploited, and enabling Canadians to sue state sponsors of terrorism for losses due to an act of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Weighty Tory crime bill targets drugs, sex offenders, 'out-of-control' youth |first=Steven |last=Chase |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= September 20, 2011 |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/weighty-tory-crime-bill-targets-drugs-sex-offenders-out-of-control-youth/article2172621/ |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweeping Conservative crime bill only 'the beginning' |first=Steven |last=Chase |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= September 20, 2011 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/sweeping-conservative-crime-bill-only-the-beginning/article2173915/page2/ |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly contentious aspect of the bill was the proposed enhancement of powers given to government authorities to monitor online communications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/08/09/pol-internet-privacy.html | work=CBC News | title=Internet privacy experts raise concerns over crime bill | date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this proposal was abandoned after an online petition opposing those measures garnered over 70,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openmedia.ca/news/70000-strong-petition-sways-government-plan|title=70,000+ Strong Petition Sways Government Plan - OpenMedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the smaller bills incorporated into this legislation was Bill C-23B, formerly called "Eliminating Pardons for Serious Offences." This section made significant changes to the country's pardon laws. Part 3 of the bill replaced the term "pardon" with "Record Suspension" and eliminated pardons for those with Schedule 1 criminal offences on their record or those with more than three offences each carrying a sentence of two years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  (S.C. 2012, c. 1) | url =  http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2012_1/page-12.html#h-19 | access-date = 19 July 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill caused much controversy. While the [[Canadian Police Association]] said the bill would work towards keeping communities more safe, it added it was concerned about the cost.&lt;ref name="Quebec"/&gt; The [[Quebec]] government said it would refuse to pay for the bill, calling it a short-term "[[Band-Aid]] solution."&lt;ref name="Quebec"&gt;{{cite news |title=Quebec will refuse to pay for omnibus crime bill |first=Meagan |last=Fitzpatrick |newspaper= [[CBC.ca]] |date= November 1, 2011 |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/11/01/pol-omnibus-crime-bill.html |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ontario]] government would also refuse to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANALYSIS: McGuinty sends shot across Harper's bow | first=Robert| last=Fisher |newspaper=[[CBC.ca]] | date= November 4, 2011 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2011/11/04/fisher-column-mcguinty.html |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas|Texan]] conservatives Judge John Creuzot, Republican Representative Jerry Madden, and Marc Levin also spoke out against the bill; according to Madden, "It's a very expensive thing to build new prisons and, if you build them, I guarantee you they will come. They'll be filled, OK? Because people will send them there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Texas conservatives reject Harper's crime plan |first=Terry |last=Milewski |newspaper= [[CBC.ca]] |date= October 17, 2011 |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/17/pol-vp-milewski-texas-crime.html |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5433">The '''Shafer Commission''', formally known as the '''National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse''', was appointed by U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in the early 1970s.  Its chairman was former Pennsylvania Governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]].  The commission issued a report on its findings in 1972 that called for the decriminalization of [[marijuana]] possession in the [[United States]]. The report was ignored by the [[White House]], but is an important document against [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]].
 
While the [[Controlled Substances Act]] was being drafted in a House committee in 1970, Assistant Secretary of Health [[Roger O. Egeberg]] had recommended that marijuana temporarily be placed in Schedule I, the most restrictive category of drugs, pending the Commission's report. On March 22, 1972, the Commission's chairman, [[Raymond P. Shafer]], presented a report to Congress and the public entitled "Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding," which favored ending marijuana prohibition and adopting other methods to discourage use.

The Commission's report said that while public sentiment tended to view marijuana users as dangerous, they actually found users to be more timid, drowsy and passive. It concluded that cannabis did not cause widespread danger to society. It recommended using social measures other than criminalization to discourage use. It compared the situation of cannabis to that of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/nc/ncrec1.htm |title=Drugs And Social Responsibility |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission's proposed decriminalization of marijuana possession was opposed, in 1974, by the recommendations of a congressional subcommittee chaired by Senator [[James Eastland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/marihuanahashish00unit#page/n5/mode/2up Marihuana-hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security: hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninety-third Congress, second session [-Ninety-fourth Congress, first session&amp;#93; .. ,1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration did not implement the  recommendations from The National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. However, the report has frequently been cited by individuals supporting removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the [[Controlled Substances Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5097 |title=Nixon Commission Report Advising Decriminalization of Marijuana Celebrates 30th Anniversary |publisher=NORML |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court held that the legislative power of a State does not extend to enacting a law which deprives a court of the State of one of its defining characteristics as a court or impairs one or more of those characteristics.{{r|HCA}}

== Background ==

[[File:Gypsy Joker Protest Run 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Members from several clubs meet at a run in South Australia, 2009 to protest the laws.]]In 2008 there was a move for controlling the activities of [[Outlaw motorcycle club|Outlaw Motorcycle clubs]] by numerous Australian [[State Government]]s that culminated in the [[South Australian Parliament]] introducing the Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008.&lt;ref name=SOCA&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|num_act|saoca200813o2008398|Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this legislation was to allow… ''the making of declarations and orders for the purpose of disrupting and restricting the activities of criminal organisations, their members and associates''. The essence of the scheme was that the [[Attorney-General of South Australia|Attorney-General]] could make a declaration, to the effect that the members of an organisation were involved in serious criminal activity and that there was a risk to public safety and order. If The [[South Australia Police#Commissioners|Commissioner of Police]] could then apply to the [[Magistrates Court of South Australia|Magistrates Court]] for a control order against any member of a declared organisation. There was no requirement that the person be notified of the application, nor that that person had committed or was ever likely to commit a criminal offence.

The court did not have any discretion whether a control order should be made, with the section 14(1) providing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Court must, on application by the Commissioner, make a control order against a person (the defendant) if the Court is satisfied that the defendant is a member of a declared organisation.''{{r|SOCA}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 14 May 2009 the [[Attorney-General of South Australia|Attorney-General]] considered that the members of the [[Finks Motorcycle Club]] were involved in serious criminal activity and made a declaration in relation to the club under section 10 of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;The SA Government Gazette, [http://www.governmentgazette.sa.gov.au/sites/default/files/documentstore/2009/May/2009_034.pdf No. 34 - Thursday, 14 May 2009 (page 1751) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioner of Police applied for a control order against a member of the Finks Motorcycle Club, Donald Hudson, who was not notified of the application and the Magistrates Court made the control order. The Commissioner of Police applied for a control order against another member, Sandro Totani. Both men made an application to the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]], claiming that parts of the Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act were invalid, and that the declaration made by the Attorney-General was also invalid. The Full Court of the Supreme Court held by a 2:1 majority that section 14(1) of the Act was invalid, but that section 10 which authorised the declaration by the Attorney-General, by itself, was a valid exercise of the legislative power of the State.&lt;ref name=SASC&gt;{{Cite AustLII|SASC|301|2009|litigants=Totani v South Australia |parallelcite=(2009) 105 [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 244 at [168] per [[David Bleby|Bleby J]], [[Trish Kelly|Kelly J]] agreeing, [[Richard Conway White|White J]] dissenting |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court]] (SA)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Bleby|Bleby J]] relied upon the decisions of the High Court in ''[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions for NSW]]|year=1996|court=HCA|num=24|parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Thomas v Mowbray]]''{{r|Mowbray}}.  This included references to the judgement of [[William Gummow|Gummow]] and [[Susan Crennan|Crennan]] JJ where their Honours said at [111]:&lt;blockquote&gt;As a general proposition, it may be accepted that legislation which requires a court exercising federal jurisdiction to depart to a significant degree from the methods and standards which have characterised judicial activities in the past may be repugnant to Ch III.{{r|Mowbray}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bleby J also cited the dissent of  [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Kirby J]] in ''Thomas v Mowbray'' where his Honour said at [366]:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Requiring such courts, as of ordinary course, to issue orders ex parte, that deprive an individual of basic civil rights, on the application of officers of the Executive Branch of Government and upon proof to the civil standard alone that the measures are reasonably necessary to protect the public from a future terrorist act, departs from the manner in which, for more than a century, the judicial power of the Commonwealth has been exercised under the Constitution.''&lt;ref name=Mowbray&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Thomas v Mowbray]]|year=2007|court=HCA|num=33|parallelcite=(2007) 233 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 307}} {{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2007/hca33-2007-08-2.pdf |title=Judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The State of South Australia then appealed that decision to the High Court of Australia.

== Decision ==
This appeal was dismissed by the High Court 6:1 with only [[Dyson Heydon|Heydon J]] dissenting.{{r|HCA}}

A majority of the Court considered that s 14(1) of the Act obliged the Magistrates Court to impose serious restraints on a person's liberty whether or not that person had committed or was ever likely to commit a criminal offence. The provision authorised the executive to enlist the Magistrates Court in implementing decisions of the executive and that the manner in which that occurred was incompatible with the Magistrates Court's institutional integrity as an independent and impartial tribunal.{{r|HCA}} French CJ held at [26] that the legislative power of a State does not extend to enacting a law which deprives a court of the State of one of its defining characteristics as a court or impairs one or more of those characteristics. The courts decision was based in part on their concern that the [[statute|Act]] infringed [[common law]] freedoms for the individuals involved, but mostly on the prospect of a Parliament directing [[judiciary|courts]] was inconsistent with the separation of powers under the Commonwealth Constitution which applied to the state Magistrates Court as a repository of federal judicial power under section 71 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams |author1-link=George Williams (lawyer) |author2=Brennan |author3=Lynch |lastauthoramp=y |title=Blackshield &amp; Williams: Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |chapter=Supplement to Chapter 15: South Australia v Totani |chapter-url=http://www.federationpress.com.au/pdf/SA%20v%20Totani.pdf |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''term loan''' is a monetary [[loan]] that is repaid in regular payments over a set period of time. Term loans usually last between one and ten years, but may last as long as 30 years in some cases. A term loan usually involves an unfixed [[interest rate]] that will add additional balance to be repaid.

==Usage==
Term loans can be given on an individual basis, but are often used for [[small business]] loans. The ability to repay over a long period of time is attractive for new or expanding enterprises, as the assumption is that they will increase their [[profit (accounting)|profit]] over time. Term loans are a good way of quickly increasing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] in order to raise a business’ supply capabilities or range. For instance, some new companies may use a term loan to buy company vehicles or rent more space for their operations.

===Considerations===
One thing to consider when getting a term loan is whether the interest rate is [[Fixed interest rate loan|fixed]] or [[Floating interest rate|floating]]. A fixed interest rate means that the percentage of interest will never increase, regardless of the financial market. Low-interest periods are usually an excellent time to take out a fixed rate loan. Floating interest rates will fluctuate with the market, which can be good or bad  for you depending on what happens with the global and national economy. Since some term loans last for 10 years, betting that the rate will stay consistently low is a real risk.

Also, consider whether the term loan you are looking at uses [[compound interest]]. If it does, the amount of interest will be periodically added to the [[Principal sum|principal]] borrowed amount, meaning that the interest keeps getting higher the longer the term lasts. If the loan does use compound interest, check to see if there are any penalties for early repayment of the loan. If you get a [[windfall gain|windfall]] or profits increase spectacularly, you may be able to pay off your entire balance before it is due, preventing you from paying additional interest by waiting for the loan term to end.

Some loaning institutions offer a variety of repayment plans for your term loan. Commonly, you may choose to pay off your debt in even amounts, or the amount you pay will gradually increase over the loan period. If you expect that you will be more financially able to repay in the future, causing an incremental increase may help you and save you interest. If you are unsure of your future monetary position, even payments may help prevent [[Default (finance)|defaulting]] on the loan if things go badly.

Choosing a term loan may be in your best interest, depending on your circumstances. Beware of extremely long repayment periods, as generally speaking, the longer the term, the more you will owe because the interest accrues over a long period of time. For more information, contact a [[financial advisor]] or speak to your bank about loan options they provide.

      <comment>Added link to the science of jet lag, which explains timeshifting of the circadian rhythm</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">{{redirect|Timeshifting|the video game|TimeShift (video game)|timeshift channels|Timeshift channel}}

As it relates to the [[circadian rhythm]], timeshifting is the action of someone who is using individually timed light exposure and light avoidance, sleep and napping episodes, and/or melatonin use to adapt their circadian rhythm more quickly to a new sleep/wake and light/dark schedule in order to reduce [[jet lag]] or adapt to a new work schedule, or reset their circadian rhythm to ensure peak performance when needed, or in preparation for medical treatment.

In broadcasting, '''time shifting''' is the recording of programming to a storage medium to be viewed or listened to after the live broadcasting. Typically, this refers to TV programming but can also refer to radio shows via [[Podcast|podcasts]].

In recent years, the advent of the [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) has made time shifting easier, by using an [[electronic program guide]] (EPG) and recording shows onto a hard disk. Some DVRs have other possible time shifting methods, such as being able to start watching the recorded show from the beginning even if the recording is not yet complete. In the past, time shifting was done with a [[video cassette recorder]] (VCR) and its timer function, in which the VCR tunes into the appropriate station and records the show onto video tape. 

Certain broadcasters transmit timeshifted versions of their channels, usually one hour in the future, to enable those without recording abilities to resolve conflicts and those with recording abilities more flexibility in scheduling conflicting recordings. (See [[timeshift channel]].)

==History in the United States==
The major legal issue involved in time shifting concerns "fair use" law and the possibility of copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="lawscomcp" &gt;[http://copyright.laws.com/time-shifting Time Shifting]. laws.com retrieved from copyright.laws.com Accessed 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This legal issue is first raised in the landmark court case of ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'' or the "Betamax case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=464&amp;invol=417 |title=Supreme Court ruling on the Betamax Case |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, Universal [[lawsuit|sued]] Sony, claiming its timed recording capability amounted to [[copyright infringement]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] found in favor of Sony; the majority decision held that time shifting was a [[fair use]], represented no substantial harm to the copyright holder and would not contribute to a diminished marketplace for its product.

By 1985 cable [[movie channel]]s encouraged time shifting by broadcasting films subscribers wanted for their home libraries overnight, so their VCRs could record them while they slept.&lt;ref name="holsopple19850605"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TBweAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7003%2C2983721 | title=Pay-TV looks elsewhere as theatrical movies lose their appeal | work=The Pittsburgh Press | date=1985-06-05 | accessdate=25 January 2015 | author=Holsopple, Barbara | pages=C12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deatley19850907"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lc8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1Y0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5630%2C870934 | title=VCRs put entertainment industry into fast-forward frenzy | work=The Free Lance-Star | date=1985-09-07 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=25 January 2015 | author=De Atley, Richard | pages=12-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some providers, such as satellite TV companies, have introduced [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) features allowing consumers to [[commercial skipping|skip over advertising]] entirely when watching a program which has been recorded to their DVR. The legality of this service, for which an extra fee can be assessed, has been challenged by television broadcasters, who assert that this form of time shifting is a violation of their copyright.&lt;ref name="lawscomcp" /&gt;

=== 1000 BC–2nd century CE===
The [[Sa Huỳnh culture]] flourished in coastal South China Sea, especially in southern to central Vietnam, from [[Mekong Delta]] to Quảng Bình province. The people that support Sa Huỳnh civilization were sea faring [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian-speaking]] people. The Sa Huỳnh relics can be found in several sites on the coasts of South China Sea, from [[Palawan]] in the Philippines to [[Orchid Island]] near Taiwan, suggesting that they sailed, settled and traded around the coasts of South China Sea.&lt;ref name ="NG-The Cham"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines – The ancestors of Vietnam's Cham people built one of the great empires of Southeast Asia | first = Adam | last = Bray | work = National Geographic | date = June 18, 2014 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed by the People's Republic of China on the argument that since 200 BC Chinese fishermen have used the Spratly islands.&lt;ref name="Wortzel, Higham 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wortzel |first1=Larry M. |authorlink1=Larry Wortzel |last2=Higham |first2=Robin D.S. |date=1 January 1999 |title=Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Military History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rfu-hR8msh4C&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=180 |isbn=978-0-313-29337-5 |accessdate=21 August 2014 |quote=China's claim to the islands are based on historic usage by Chinese fisherman as early as 200 B.C.E. and on the 1887 Chinese-Vietnamese Boundary Convention, while Vietnam claims historic links with the islands based primarily on having inherited modern French territory. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3rd century ===
Two famous Chinese books authored by Wan Zhen of the [[Eastern Wu]] State and published during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220–280 AD) and a work titled ''Guangzhou Ji'' (Chronicles of Guangzhou) authored by Pei Yuan of the Jin dynasties described the Paracel and Spratly islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harid=DKXRRfWtkw8C&amp;pg=PA154 154–155]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local government of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasties]] exercised jurisdiction over the islands by sending patrolling naval boats to the surrounding sea areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nordquist|Moore|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DKXRRfWtkw8C&amp;pg=PA155 155]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 5th–13th centuries ===
Naval forces of the Song State of the Southern Dynasties (420–479 AD) patrolled the Paracel and Spratly islands.&lt;ref name="NMp156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nordquist|Moore|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DKXRRfWtkw8C&amp;pg=PA156 156]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD), the islands were placed under the administration and authority of the Qiongzhou Perfecture (now Hainan Province).&lt;ref name="NMp156" /&gt; Chinese administration of the South China Sea continued into the North and South Song dynasties (970–1279).&lt;ref name="NMp156" /&gt;

Archaeologists have found Chinese made potteries porcelains and other historical relics from the Southern dynasties (420–589), the Sui dynasties (581–618), the Tang dynasty (618–907), the Song dynasties (960–1279), the Yuan dynasties (1206–1368), the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and later eras up to modern times on the South China Sea islands.&lt;ref name="NMp156" /&gt;

=== 6th–15th centuries ===
The South China Sea was known as the "Osean sea" by [[ShauShau the explorer]] and traders in the region. It was named after a [[Indianized kingdom|Hindu]] [[Thalassocracy|thalassocratic]] empire [[Champa]] that flourished in the actual central Vietnam around that period.&lt;ref name ="NG-The Cham"/&gt;

In 1596, the Spanish Colonial Government declared that each island in the Kalayaan Islands, now known as the Spratly Islands, had Barangay or Barrio status.

* 1884–1885 [[Sino-French War]]. In December 1884, alarmed by Japanese ambitions in Korea, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] ordered her ministers to extricate China from the undeclared war with France that had broken out on 23 August.  Important French victories in Tonkin and Formosa in February and early March 1885 strengthened her desire to end the Sino-French War, and although the Chinese won an unexpected victory in Tonkin in late March, defeating General de Négrier's 2nd Brigade at [[Battle of Bang Bo|Bang Bo]] and reoccupying [[Retreat from Lạng Sơn|Lạng Sơn]], this success was counterbalanced by the simultaneous French capture of the [[Pescadores Campaign|Pescadores Islands]]. China's position in early April 1885 was critical.  Seizing the opportunity offered by the fall of the Ferry ministry, the Chinese agreed to implement the provisions of the May 1884 [[Tientsin Accord]], which recognised France's protectorate over Vietnam.  In return, the French dropped their longstanding demand for an indemnity for the [[Bắc Lệ ambush]].  After a flurry of negotiations in Paris in the first days of April 1885, peace was made on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Thomazi, 258–62&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 11 May 1884 – The [[Tientsin Accord]] or '''Li–Fournier Convention''', concluded on 11 May 1884, was intended to settle an undeclared war between France and China over the sovereignty of Tonkin (northern Vietnam).  The convention, negotiated by Li Hung-chang for China and ''capitaine de vaisseau'' François-Ernest Fournier for France, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Thomazi, La conquête de l'Indochine, 189–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Thomazi-La-conquête&gt;{{cite book |title = La conquête de l'Indochine |first=Auguste|last=Thomazi|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9 June 1885 – The [[Treaty of Tientsin]], signed on 9 June 1885, officially ended the [[Sino-French War]].  The [[unequal treaty]] restated in greater detail the main provisions of the [[Tientsin Accord]], signed between France and China on 11 May 1884.  As Article 2 required China to recognise the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin established by the [[Treaty of Hue (1884)|Treaty of Hue]] in June 1884, implicitly abandoning her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam, the treaty formalised France's victory in the [[Sino-French War]].&lt;ref name= Thomazi-La-conquête/&gt;
* 1887 – In the 19th century, Europeans found that Chinese fishermen from Hainan annually visited the Spratly islands for part of the year, while in 1877 it was the British who launched the first modern legal claims to the Spratlys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNVf9R_L5FAC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed.

Thus [[Fangchenggang]] was supposed to be returned to [[Quảng Ninh Province]] in Vietnam, but this has not been done yet. Most people living in the area are Vietnamese fishermen who became one of the 56 ethnic groups of China, known as ethnic Vietnamese people of China or [[Gin people]].
* 1898 – The Philippine Islands were ceded by Spain to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] following the [[Spanish–American War]]. The Spratly Islands were not part of the Philippines per the Treaty.
* 12 April 1898 – France seized [[Guangzhouwan]] as a treaty port, and took [[Shanghai French Concession|its own concession]] in the treaty port of Shanghai. Kwangchow Wan, ([[Guangzhouwan]]), was leased by China to France for 99 years (or until 1997, as the British did in Hong Kong's New Territories), according to the Treaty of 12 April 1898, on 27 May as ''Territoire de Kouang-Tchéou-Wan'', to counter the growing commercial power of British Hong Kong&lt;ref&gt;A. Choveaux, 1925, pp. 74–77&lt;/ref&gt; and was effectively placed under the authority of the French Resident Superior in [[Tonkin]] (itself under the Governor General of [[French Indochina]], also in Hanoi); the French Resident was represented locally by Administrators.&lt;ref name="Olson 1991: 349"&gt;Olson 1991: 349&lt;/ref&gt; The French wanted to develop the port, which they called '''Fort-Bayard''', to serve southern China, in parts where France had exclusive rights to railway and mineral development. Their efforts, however, were hindered by the poverty of the surrounding land. The French retained control of the region until 1943 when the Japanese occupied the area during World War II. At the end of the war, the region returned briefly under French rule before being formally returned to China in 1946 by General [[Charles de Gaulle]], the French head of state. The old spellings "Tsankiang", "Chankiang" and "Tsamkong" were replaced by the [[pinyin]] romanisation "[[Zhanjiang]]" by the Chinese government in 1958. [[Zhanjiang]] is headquarters of the [[South Sea Fleet]] of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[South Sea Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CHN_Port_of_Zhanjiang_2532.php World Port Source]. World Port Source.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zhanjiang]] Port is one of the eight major ports in China, with an annual throughput of more than 2,600 million tons. As a natural port, it has about 60 kilometers depth and three islands outside to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port of Zhanjiang|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/136917.htm|publisher=baidu.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* June 1937 – China sends Huang Qiang, the chief of Chinese military region no. 9 on a secret tour in four islands in the Amphitrite Group of the Paracels. His boat was loaded with 30 backdated sovereignty markers. Because the mission was confidential Huang Qiang carried no markers dated 1937. The team buried a total of 12 backdated sovereignty markers, including 3 true old markers dating from the Qing dynasty, bearing the date 1902, gathered in the city of Guangdong:
** On Lin Dao (Woody Island): 2 markers dated 1921
** On Bei Dao (North Island): 2 markers from 1902 and 4 dated 1912
** On Ling Zhou Dao (?): 1 marker from 1902, 1 dated 1912 and 1 dated 1921.
** On Shi Dao (Rocky Island): 1 marker dated 1912.

* 1939 – Japan invades the islands and takes control of the South China Sea. The local government and many residents escape to Australia. The Spratlys and the Paracels were conquered by Japan in 1939.  Japan had set military bases on Woody and Pattle islands in the Paracels and Itu Aba in the Spratlys. Japan administered the Spratlys via Taiwan's jurisdiction and the Paracels via Hainan's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNVf9R_L5FAC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed.

* 1956 – North Vietnam Communist government formally accepted that the Paracel and Spratly islands were historically Chinese.  But, that same year, South Vietnam reopened the abandoned French camp on Shanhu Island in the Paracels and announced that it had annexed the Paracel archipelago as well as the Spratlys.  About the same time, the PLA reestablished a Chinese garrison on Yongxing Island in the Paracels, while the Republic of China (Taipei) put troops back on Taiping Island in the Spratlys.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Paracel_Spratly.html Paracel and Spratly Islands&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=website falls under [[WP:SPS]]|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Cloma proclaimed the establishment of a new country, "Freedomland" in the Spratly Islands.  The sole function of Freedomland turned out to be issuing postage stamps to collectors.  Cloma's announcement of Freedomland caused both Beijing and Taipei to reiterate China's claims to the Spratlys.  Taipei sent troops to drive Cloma off Taiping Island.  Its forces are still there. Cloma's proclamation of Freedomland was legal in the Philippines because, as Manila noted in its reply to protests of Cloma's actions from Beijing, Saigon, and Taipei, the Philippines had made no claim of its own to the Spratlys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36259">The '''Truth in Music Advertising''' act or bill, also known as '''Truth in Music Performance Advertising''' or simply '''Truth in Music''', is legislation, adopted into [[state law]] by most [[U.S. state]]s, that aims to protect the [[trademark]] of musical recording artists. The legislation provides that the name of a famous musical group cannot be used by a group of performers unless they include at least one member of the original group. The intent of the legislation is to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices, and to protect the livelihood of musicians who were in famous musical groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/truth-in-music-advertising-act/|title=Truth in Music Advertising Act Law and Legal Definition|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
From 1977 to 1981, Jon "Bowzer" Bauman hosted other musicians on his television show [[Sha Na Na (TV series)|''Sha Na Na'']]. He talked with [[Carl Gardner]] of [[the Coasters]] and [[Charlie Thomas (musician)|Charlie Thomas]] of [[the Drifters]], discovering in the process that they were being victimized by "knock-off" groups of performers using the name of a famous group without having a member of that group. [[Ben E. King]] said he, Thomas and [[Bill Pinkney]] were losing out on potential gigs and income because there were "so many fake Drifters performing".&lt;ref name="20/20 ABC News 2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3914512&amp;page=1 |title=Doo Wop Groups of the '50s and '60s Say 'Enough!' to Bogus Bands |work=[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]] |publisher=ABC News |date=November 30, 2007 |last=Stossel |first=John |last2=Mastropolo |first2=Frank }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herb Reed]] of [[the Platters]] told Bauman that his group had experienced "about 30" court cases fighting against fake groups. Researching the laws, Bauman found that the original musicians had scant legal protection against their group name being used by promoters or other performers, so he determined to amend the existing laws to increase protection for the original musicians. He allied with the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] (VGHF) to bring famous musicians together to help promote these new laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sharonherald.com/community/truth-in-music-crusade-gaining-steam/article_400c793b-7413-5bdb-a2bd-fdecc5cbeb42.html |title='Truth in Music' crusade gaining steam |last=Pinchot |first=Joe |date=August 16, 2006 |newspaper=The Herald |location=Sharon, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; VGHF President Bob Crosby said of the fake groups "It's a form of identity theft to the artists...

==Lawsuits==
[[The Drifters]] formed in 1953 with singer [[Clyde McPhatter]] and manager [[George Treadwell]] sharing the name equally. McPhatter sold his half to Treadwell in 1954, giving Treadwell full control of the Drifters' name, an action that he later regretted, because it caused financial problems for his fellow musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-drifters-mn0000118544/biography|title=The Drifters - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|author=|date=|website=AllMusic|access-date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treadwell died in 1967, leaving his widow, Faye Treadwell, as manager of the group. In 1969, the founder and editor of ''Rock Magazine'', Larry Marshak, planned a series of concerts to be performed by classic vocal groups including the Drifters. Former Drifter Ben E. King responded that he would not perform, but he referred Marshak to Charlie Thomas, Elsbeary Hobbs and Doc Green, who agreed. Thomas, Hobbs and Green continued to perform as the Drifters under Marshak's management through the 1970s. However, starting in 1972, Faye Treadwell revived the Drifters in the UK. Faye Treadwell and Marshak sued each other several times over the rights to the group name, with Treadwell winning the rights to the Drifters name in July 1999, Judge [[Nicholas H. Politan]] presiding in the case ''Marshak v. Treadwell, et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/22/nyregion/pop-music-there-are-oldies-and-there-are-new-oldies.html |title=There are Oldies, and There are New Oldies |last=Demaster |first=Karen |date=August 22, 1999 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshak appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/chuckmiller/the-drifters-a-legacy-of-harmony/26399/ |title=The Drifters: A Legacy of Harmony |last=Miller |first=Chuck |date=January 3, 2016 |newspaper=Times Union |publisher=The Hearst Corporation}} Originally published in [[Goldmine (magazine)|''Goldmine'']] magazine in 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Judges [[Samuel Alito]], [[Maryanne Trump Barry]] and [[Ruggero J. Aldisert]] determined in February 2001 that Marshak's 1978 trademark registration for the Drifters name must be canceled as invalid, and that Marshak must stop using the Drifters' name in business. Marshak was ordered to tell the court how much money he had made on performances by the Drifters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-3rd-circuit/1178360.html |title=Marshak v.

After learning of Faye Treadwell's declining health, daughter Tina Treadwell left her position as vice president at Disney to continue the court battle, filing parallel lawsuits in the US and the UK in December 2006. Tina Treadwell said of Marshak and his associates, "They've diluted the brand with impostors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/15/local/me-drifters15 |title=Drifters sure get around |date=March 15, 2007 |last=Mitchell |first=John L. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|''20/20'']] reported in 2007 that promoters Charles Mehlich and Larry Marshak were being sued in New Jersey for using the Drifters' name.&lt;ref name="20/20 ABC News 2007"/&gt; Marshak, his associate Barry Singer, and their attorney William L. Charron countersued, charging that New Jersey's Attorney General [[Anne Milgram]] should not have issued subpoenas to the [[The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel|Atlantic City Hilton Casino]] in her effort to enforce the state's recently passed Truth in Music law, to stop performances by groups billed as the Platters, the Drifters and the Coasters.

Debevoise]] found Marshak in [[contempt of court]] for continuing to use the group names after the 1999 injunction against him doing so. The court discovered that Marshak had employed business associates and his relatives to run legal entities which promoted concerts by the Platters, the Coasters and the Drifters despite having no original singers among the performers. Debevoise called this deceptive business practice "an elaborate shell game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/13/news/wk-quick13.s3 |title=Music promoter reprimanded |agency=Associated Press |date=September 13, 2007 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshak appealed, but lost in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law360.com/articles/109589/3rd-circ-backs-drifters-ex-manager-in-trademark-suit |title=3rd Circ.

Barry Singer's business, Singer Management Consultants, was ordered to pay $24&amp;nbsp;million in damages, with $9&amp;nbsp;million going to Faye Treadwell, but Singer filed for personal bankruptcy under [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]. In September 2010, a federal appeals court determined that Singer must pay Treadwell regardless of his bankruptcy filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fairlawn.dailyvoice.com/police-fire/broke-trademark-thief-still-on-the-hook-for-24m-to-the-drifters/629167/ |work=Fair Lawn-Glen Rock Daily Voice |title=Broke trademark thief still on the hook for $24M to the Drifters |last=DeMarco |first=Jerry |date=September 22, 2010 |location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faye Treadwell died in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/faye-treadwell-manager-drifters-dies-193900 |title=Faye Treadwell, Former Manager of the Drifters, Dies at 84 |date=June 1, 2011 |work=Hollywood Reporter |last=Barnes |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''UK Green Building Council''' ('''UKGBC''') is a [[United Kingdom]] membership organisation, formed in 2007, which aims to 'radically transform' the way that the [[built environment]] in the UK is planned, designed, constructed, maintained and operated.

The Council is concerned about the environmental impact of buildings and infrastructure on the environment, in particular the use of [[water]], materials, [[energy]], the impact of [[greenhouse gas emissions]], and the health of building occupants.

==Formation==
The organisation was founded in the autumn of 2006 and launched on February 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2022802,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the 2004 Sustainable Building Task Group Report ''Better Buildings - Better Lives'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060502043818/http:/dti.gov.uk/files/file15151.pdf Better Buildings - Better Lives]''National Archives. Accessed: 21 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended the UK Government should "review the advisory bodies concerned with sustainable buildings to simplify and consolidate them and to provide clear direction to the industry" (para 1.8, p.7).

Its first CEO was Paul King (formerly head of campaigns at [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]), who filled the role from its inception until December 2014.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitt|first1=Vern|title=Interview: Paul King|url=http://www.building.co.uk/interview-paul-king/5072488.article|accessdate=22 July 2015|work=Building|publisher=UBM|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;The current CEO is Julie Hirigoyen &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/companies/industry-moves/uk-gbc-names-new-chief-executive/8675020.article|title=JLL UK head of sustainability Julie Hirigoyen appointed UK Green Building Council chief|last=Wilson|first=Robyn|date=January 2015|work=Construction News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

UKGBC is a charitable organisation, and - through the [[World Green Building Council]] - is part of a global network of like-minded organisations in almost 80 countries. Its headquarters is at [[The Building Centre]] in London.

The '''UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration.html]&lt;/ref&gt; was prepared by [[UNCITRAL]], and adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 21 June 1985. In 2006 the model law was amended, it now includes more detailed provisions on interim measures. 

The model law is not binding, but individual states may adopt the model law by incorporating it into their domestic law (as, for example, [[Australia]] did, in the International Arbitration Act 1974, as amended).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/iaa1974276/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The model law was published in English and in French. Translations in all six United Nations languages now exist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/1985Model_arbitration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that there is a difference between the UNCITRAL ''Model Law'' on International Commercial Arbitration (1985) and the UNCITRAL ''Arbitration Rules''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration.html]&lt;/ref&gt; On its website, UNCITRAL explains the difference as follows: "The UNCITRAL Model Law provides a pattern that law-makers in national governments can adopt as part of their domestic legislation on arbitration. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, on the other hand, are selected by parties either as part of their contract, or after a dispute arises, to govern the conduct of an arbitration intended to resolve a dispute or disputes between themselves. Put simply, the Model Law is directed at States, while the Arbitration Rules are directed at potential (or actual) parties to a dispute."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration_faq.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Rehlander''''' was a 2011 case heard in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]. It struck down a [[Maine]] law providing that temporary commitment triggered automatic revocation of a patient's [[firearms license]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/12/02/new-york-disarms-the-mentally-ill#.yRG6gOZpU|title=New York Disarms the ‘Mentally Ill’|first1=James B.|last1=Jacobs|first2=Zoe|last2=Fuhr|work=The Marshall Project|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |reason=  Actually the court found that "temporary hospitalization under section 3863 does not constitute a "commitment" under section 922 — just as it clearly does not constitute a commitment under Maine law itself"|date=September 2016}}

The court held that the firearms ban could only apply to individuals who had received [[due process]] through a judicial hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/01/18/politics/how-does-maine-balance-public-safety-and-gun-rights-of-mentally-ill/|work=Bangor Daily News|title=How does Maine balance public safety and gun rights of mentally ill?|first=Robert|last=Long|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
