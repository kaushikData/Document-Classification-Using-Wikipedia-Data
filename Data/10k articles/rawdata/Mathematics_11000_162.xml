[[Image:Hypersphere coord.PNG|right|frame|[[Stereographic projection]] of the hypersphere's parallels (red), [[Meridian (perimetry, visual field)|meridians]] 
(blue) and hypermeridians (green).  Because this projection is [[conformal map|conformal]], the curves intersect each other orthogonally (in the yellow points) as in 4D.  All curves are circles: the curves that intersect {{angbr|0,0,0,1}} have infinite radius (= straight line). In this picture, the whole 3D space maps the ''surface'' of the hypersphere, whereas in the previous picture the 3D space contained the ''shadow'' of the bulk hypersphere.]]{{Redirect|Glome|the fictitious kingdom in the C.S. Lewis novel|Till We Have Faces}}[[Image:Hypersphere.png|right|frame|Direct projection of ''3-sphere'' into 3D space and covered with surface grid, showing structure as stack of 3D spheres (''2-spheres'')]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''3-sphere''', or '''glome'''&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Glome |id=Glome |access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;!--Yes, their numbering doesn't match our numbering.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, is a higher-dimensional analogue of a [[sphere]]. It may be embedded in 4-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] as the set of points equidistant from a fixed central point.  Analogously to how the boundary of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] in three dimensions is an ordinary sphere (or 2-sphere, a two-dimensional [[Surface (topology)|surface]]), the boundary of a ball in four dimensions is a 3-sphere (an object with three [[dimension]]s).  A 3-sphere is an example of a [[3-manifold]].

==Definition==
In [[coordinates]], a 3-sphere with center {{math|(''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and radius {{mvar|r}} is the set of all points {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in real, [[Four-dimensional space|4-dimensional space]] ({{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}) such that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^3(x_i - C_i)^2 = ( x_0 - C_0 )^2 + ( x_1 - C_1 )^2 + ( x_2 - C_2 )^2+ ( x_3 - C_3 )^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The 3-sphere centered at the origin with radius 1 is called the '''unit 3-sphere''' and is usually denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;S^3 = \left\{(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb{R}^4 : x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is often convenient to regard {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} as the space with 2 [[complex numbers|complex dimensions]] ({{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) or the [[quaternion]]s ({{math|'''H'''}}). The unit 3-sphere is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;S^3 = \left\{(z_1,z_2)\in\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;S^3 = \left\{q\in\mathbb{H} : \|q\| = 1\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This description as the [[quaternion]]s of [[quaternion#Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocation|norm]] one identifies the 3-sphere with the [[versor]]s in the quaternion [[division ring]]. Just as the [[unit circle]] is important for planar [[polar coordinates#Complex numbers|polar coordinates]], so the 3-sphere is important in the polar view of 4-space involved in quaternion multiplication. See [[polar decomposition#Quaternion polar decomposition|polar decomposition of a quaternion]] for details of this development of the three-sphere.
This view of the 3-sphere is the basis for the study of [[elliptic geometry#Elliptic space|elliptic space]] as developed by [[Georges Lemaître]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Lemaître (1948) "Quaternions et espace elliptique", ''Acta'' [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] 12:57&amp;ndash;78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

===Elementary properties===
The 3-dimensional cubic hyperarea of a 3-sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is
:&lt;math&gt;2\pi^2 r^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;
while the 4-dimensional quartic hypervolume (the volume of the 4-dimensional region bounded by the 3-sphere) is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \pi^2 r^4.&lt;/math&gt;

Every non-empty intersection of a 3-sphere with a three-dimensional [[hyperplane]] is a 2-sphere (unless the hyperplane is tangent to the 3-sphere, in which case the intersection is a single point). As a 3-sphere moves through a given three-dimensional hyperplane, the intersection starts out as a point, then becomes a growing 2-sphere that reaches its maximal size when the hyperplane cuts right through the "equator" of the 3-sphere. Then the 2-sphere shrinks again down to a single point as the 3-sphere leaves the hyperplane.

===Topological properties===
A 3-sphere is a [[Compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]], 3-dimensional [[manifold]] without boundary. It is also [[simply connected]]. What this means, in the broad sense, is that any loop, or circular path, on the 3-sphere can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the 3-sphere. The [[Poincaré conjecture]], proved in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], provides that the 3-sphere is the only three-dimensional manifold (up to [[homeomorphism]]) with these properties.

The 3-sphere is homeomorphic to the [[one-point compactification]] of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In general, any [[topological space]] that is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere is called a '''topological 3-sphere'''.

The [[homology group]]s of the 3-sphere are as follows: {{math|H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,'''Z''')}} and {{math|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,'''Z''')}} are both [[infinite cyclic]], while {{math|1=H&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,'''Z''') = {0&amp;#125;}} for all other indices {{mvar|i}}. Any topological space with these homology groups is known as a [[homology sphere|homology 3-sphere]]. Initially [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] conjectured that all homology 3-spheres are homeomorphic to {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but then he himself constructed a non-homeomorphic one, now known as the [[Poincaré homology sphere]]. Infinitely many homology spheres are now known to exist. For example, a [[Dehn filling]] with slope {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''}}}} on any [[knot theory|knot]] in the 3-sphere gives a homology sphere; typically these are not homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.

As to the [[homotopy groups]], we have {{math|1=π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = {0&amp;#125;}} and {{math|π&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is infinite cyclic. The higher-homotopy groups ({{math|''k'' ≥ 4}}) are all [[finite abelian group|finite abelian]] but otherwise follow no discernible pattern. For more discussion see [[homotopy groups of spheres]].

===Geometric properties===
The 3-sphere is naturally a [[smooth manifold]], in fact, a closed [[embedded submanifold]] of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The [[Euclidean metric]] on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} induces a [[metric tensor|metric]] on the 3-sphere giving it the structure of a [[Riemannian manifold]]. As with all spheres, the 3-sphere has constant positive [[sectional curvature]] equal to {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} where {{mvar|r}} is the radius.

Much of the interesting geometry of the 3-sphere stems from the fact that the 3-sphere has a natural [[Lie group]] structure given by quaternion multiplication (see the section below on [[#Group structure|group structure]]). The only other spheres with such a structure are the 0-sphere and the 1-sphere (see [[circle group]]).

Unlike the 2-sphere, the 3-sphere admits nonvanishing [[vector field]]s ([[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of its [[tangent bundle]]). One can even find three linearly independent and nonvanishing vector fields. These may be taken to be any left-invariant vector fields forming a basis for the [[Lie algebra]] of the 3-sphere. This implies that the 3-sphere is [[Parallelizable manifold|parallelizable]]. It follows that the tangent bundle of the 3-sphere is [[trivial bundle|trivial]]. For a general discussion of the number of linear independent vector fields on a {{mvar|n}}-sphere, see the article [[vector fields on spheres]].

There is an interesting [[group action|action]] of the [[circle group]] {{math|'''T'''}} on {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} giving the 3-sphere the structure of a [[principal circle bundle]] known as the [[Hopf bundle]]. If one thinks of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} as a subset of {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the action is given by
:&lt;math&gt;(z_1,z_2)\cdot\lambda = (z_1\lambda,z_2\lambda)\quad \forall\lambda\in\mathbb T&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[orbit space]] of this action is homeomorphic to the two-sphere {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Since {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not homeomorphic to {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Hopf bundle is nontrivial.

==Topological construction==
There are several well-known constructions of the three-sphere.  Here we describe gluing a pair of three-balls and then the one-point compactification.

===Gluing===
A 3-sphere can be constructed [[topology|topologically]] by [[Quotient space (topology)|"gluing" together]] the boundaries of a pair of 3-[[ball (mathematics)|balls]]. The boundary of a 3-ball is a 2-sphere, and these two 2-spheres are to be identified.  That is, imagine a pair of 3-balls of the same size, then superpose them so that their 2-spherical boundaries match, and let matching pairs of points on the pair of 2-spheres be identically equivalent to each other.  In analogy with the case of the 2-sphere (see below), the gluing surface is called an equatorial sphere.

Note that the interiors of the 3-balls are not glued to each other.  One way to think of the fourth dimension is as a continuous real-valued function of the 3-dimensional coordinates of the 3-ball, perhaps considered to be "temperature".  We take the "temperature" to be zero along the gluing 2-sphere and let one of the 3-balls be "hot" and let the other 3-ball be "cold". The "hot" 3-ball could be thought of as the "upper hemisphere" and the "cold" 3-ball could be thought of as the "lower hemisphere". The temperature is highest/lowest at the centers of the two 3-balls.

This construction is analogous to a construction of a 2-sphere, performed by gluing the boundaries of a pair of disks. A disk is a 2-ball, and the boundary of a disk is a circle (a 1-sphere). Let a pair of disks be of the same diameter.  Superpose them and glue corresponding points on their boundaries.  Again one may think of the third dimension as temperature.  Likewise, we may inflate the 2-sphere, moving the pair of disks to become the northern and southern hemispheres.

===One-point compactification===
After removing a single point from the 2-sphere, what remains is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane. In the same way, removing a single point from the 3-sphere yields three-dimensional space. 
An extremely useful way to see this is via [[stereographic projection]]. We first describe the lower-dimensional version.

Rest the south pole of a unit 2-sphere on the {{mvar|xy}}-plane in three-space.  We map a point {{math|P}} of the sphere (minus the north pole {{math|N}}) to the plane by sending {{math|P}} to the intersection of the line {{math|NP}} with the plane.  Stereographic projection of a 3-sphere (again removing the north pole) maps to three-space in the same manner.  (Notice that, since stereographic projection is [[conformal map projection|conformal]], round spheres are sent to round spheres or to planes.)

A somewhat different way to think of the one-point compactification is via the [[exponential map (Riemmanian geometry)|exponential map]].  Returning to our picture of the unit two-sphere sitting on the Euclidean plane: Consider a geodesic in the plane, based at the origin, and map this to a geodesic in the two-sphere of the same length, based at the south pole.  Under this map all points of the circle of radius {{pi}} are sent to the north pole.  Since the open unit disk is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane, this is again a one-point compactification.

The exponential map for 3-sphere is similarly constructed; it may also be discussed using the fact that the 3-sphere is the [[Lie group]] of unit quaternions.

==Coordinate systems on the 3-sphere==
The four Euclidean coordinates for {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} are redundant since they are subject to the condition that {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}. As a 3-dimensional manifold one should be able to parameterize {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} by three coordinates, just as one can parameterize the 2-sphere using two coordinates (such as [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]). Due to the nontrivial topology of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} it is impossible to find a single set of coordinates that cover the entire space. Just as on the 2-sphere, one must use ''at least'' two [[coordinate chart]]s. Some different choices of coordinates are given below.

===Hyperspherical coordinates===
It is convenient to have some sort of [[Hypersphere#Hyperspherical coordinates|hyperspherical coordinates]] on {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} in analogy to the usual [[spherical coordinates]] on {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. One such choice — by no means unique — is to use {{math|(''ψ'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}, where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x_0 &amp;= r\cos\psi \\
x_1 &amp;= r\sin\psi \cos\theta \\
x_2 &amp;= r\sin\psi \sin\theta \cos \varphi \\
x_3 &amp;= r\sin\psi \sin\theta \sin\varphi \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ψ}} and {{mvar|θ}} run over the range 0 to {{pi}}, and {{mvar|φ}} runs over 0 to 2{{pi}}. Note that, for any fixed value of {{mvar|ψ}}, {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|φ}} parameterize a 2-sphere of radius {{math|r sin ''ψ''}}, except for the degenerate cases, when {{mvar|ψ}} equals 0 or {{pi}}, in which case they describe a point.

The [[metric tensor|round metric]] on the 3-sphere in these coordinates is given by{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = r^2 \left[ d\psi^2 + \sin^2\psi\left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\, d\varphi^2\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[volume form]] by
:&lt;math&gt;dV =r^3 \left(\sin^2\psi\,\sin\theta\right)\,dr\wedge d\psi\wedge d\theta\wedge d\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

These coordinates have an elegant description in terms of [[quaternion]]s. Any unit quaternion {{mvar|q}} can be written as a [[versor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;q = e^{\tau\psi} = \cos\psi + \tau\sin\psi&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|τ}} is a [[Quaternion#Square roots of .E2.88.921|unit imaginary quaternion]]; that is, a quaternion that satisfies {{math|1=''τ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}}. This is the quaternionic analogue of [[Euler's formula]]. Now the unit imaginary quaternions all lie on the unit 2-sphere in {{math|Im '''H'''}} so any such {{mvar|τ}} can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = (\cos\theta) i + (\sin\theta\cos\varphi) j + (\sin\theta\sin\varphi) k&lt;/math&gt;
With {{mvar|τ}} in this form, the unit quaternion {{mvar|q}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;q = e^{\tau\psi} = x_0 + x_1 i + x_2 j + x_3 k&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2,3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are as above.

When {{mvar|q}} is used to describe spatial rotations (cf. [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s), it describes a rotation about {{mvar|τ}} through an angle of {{math|2''ψ''}}.

===Hopf coordinates===
[[File:Hopf Fibration.png|right|250px|thumb|The Hopf fibration can be visualized using a [[stereographic projection]] of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and then compressing {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to a ball.  This image shows points on {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and their corresponding fibers with the same color.]]
For unit radius another choice of hyperspherical coordinates, {{math|(''η'', ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, makes use of the embedding of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} in {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In complex coordinates {{math|(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} we write
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
z_1 &amp;= e^{i\,\xi_1}\sin\eta \\
z_2 &amp;= e^{i\,\xi_2}\cos\eta. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This could also be expressed in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x_0 &amp;= \cos\xi_1\sin\eta \\
x_1 &amp;= \sin\xi_1\sin\eta \\
x_2 &amp;= \cos\xi_2\cos\eta \\
x_3 &amp;= \sin\xi_2\cos\eta. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{mvar|η}} runs over the range 0 to {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can take any values between 0 and 2{{pi}}. These coordinates are useful in the description of the 3-sphere as the [[Hopf bundle]]
:&lt;math&gt;S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|A diagram depicting the poloidal ({{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}) direction, represented by the red arrow, and the toroidal ({{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) direction, represented by the blue arrow, although the terms ''poloidal'' and ''toroidal'' are arbitrary in this ''[[Flat torus#Flat torus|flat torus]]'' case.]]
For any fixed value of {{mvar|η}} between 0 and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, the coordinates {{math|(''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} parameterize a 2-dimensional [[torus]]. Rings of constant {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} above form simple orthogonal grids on the tori. See image to right. In the degenerate cases, when {{mvar|η}} equals 0 or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, these coordinates describe a [[circle]].

The round metric on the 3-sphere in these coordinates is given by
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = d\eta^2 + \sin^2\eta\,d\xi_1^2 + \cos^2\eta\,d\xi_2^2&lt;/math&gt;
and the volume form by
:&lt;math&gt;dV = \sin\eta\cos\eta\,d\eta\wedge d\xi_1\wedge d\xi_2.&lt;/math&gt;

To get the interlocking circles of the [[Hopf fibration]], make a simple substitution in the equations above&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=The Flat Torus in the Three-Sphere|url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/script/b3d/hypertorus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
z_1 &amp;= e^{i\,(\xi_1+\xi_2)}\sin\eta \\
z_2 &amp;= e^{i\,(\xi_2-\xi_1)}\cos\eta. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case {{mvar|η}}, and {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} specify which circle, and {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} specifies the position along each circle. One round trip (0 to 2{{pi}}) of {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} equates to a round trip of the torus in the 2 respective directions.

===Stereographic coordinates===
Another convenient set of coordinates can be obtained via [[stereographic projection]] of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} from a pole onto the corresponding equatorial {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[hyperplane]]. For example, if we project from the point {{math|(−1, 0, 0, 0)}} we can write a point {{mvar|p}} in {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} as
:&lt;math&gt;p = \left(\frac{1-\|u\|^2}{1+\|u\|^2}, \frac{2\mathbf{u}}{1+\|u\|^2}\right) = \frac{1+\mathbf{u}}{1-\mathbf{u}}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|1='''u''' = (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a vector in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|1={{norm|''u''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In the second equality above, we have identified {{mvar|p}} with a unit quaternion and {{math|1='''u''' = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''i'' + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''j'' + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''k''}} with a pure quaternion. (Note that the numerator and denominator commute here even though quaternionic multiplication is generally noncommutative). The inverse of this map takes {{math|1=''p'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{1+x_0}\left(x_1, x_2, x_3\right).&lt;/math&gt;

We could just as well have projected from the point {{math|(1, 0, 0, 0)}}, in which case the point {{mvar|p}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;p = \left(\frac{-1+\|v\|^2}{1+\|v\|^2}, \frac{2\mathbf{v}}{1+\|v\|^2}\right) = \frac{-1+\mathbf{v}}{1+\mathbf{v}}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|1='''v''' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is another vector in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The inverse of this map takes {{mvar|p}} to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{1-x_0}\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the {{math|'''u'''}} coordinates are defined everywhere but {{math|(−1, 0, 0, 0)}} and the {{math|'''v'''}} coordinates everywhere but {{math|(1, 0, 0, 0)}}. This defines an [[atlas (topology)|atlas]] on {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} consisting of two [[chart (topology)|coordinate charts]] or "patches", which together cover all of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Note that the transition function between these two charts on their overlap is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\|u\|^2}\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
and vice versa.

==Group structure==
When considered as the set of unit [[quaternion]]s, {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} inherits an important structure, namely that of quaternionic multiplication. Because the set of unit quaternions is closed under multiplication, {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} takes on the structure of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Moreover, since quaternionic multiplication is [[smooth function|smooth]], {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be regarded as a real [[Lie group]]. It is a [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]], [[Compact space|compact]] Lie group of dimension 3. When thought of as a Lie group {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is often denoted [[symplectic group|{{math|Sp(1)}}]] or {{math|U(1, '''H''')}}.

It turns out that the only [[hypersphere|spheres]] that admit a Lie group structure are [[unit circle|{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], thought of as the set of unit [[complex number]]s, and {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the set of unit quaternions. One might think that {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the set of unit [[octonion]]s, would form a Lie group, but this fails since octonion multiplication is [[associative|nonassociative]]. The octonionic structure does give {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}} one important property: ''[[parallelizability]]''. It turns out that the only spheres that are parallelizable are {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

By using a [[matrix (math)|matrix]] representation of the quaternions, {{math|'''H'''}}, one obtains a matrix representation of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. One convenient choice is given by the [[Pauli matrices]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1+ x_2 i + x_3 j + x_4 k \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}\;\;\,x_1 + i x_2 &amp; x_3 + i x_4 \\ -x_3 + i x_4 &amp; x_1 - i x_2\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This map gives an [[injective]] [[algebra homomorphism]] from {{math|'''H'''}} to the set of 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 complex matrices. It has the property that the [[absolute value]] of a quaternion {{mvar|q}} is equal to the [[square root]] of the [[determinant]] of the matrix image of {{mvar|q}}.

The set of unit quaternions is then given by matrices of the above form with unit determinant. This matrix subgroup is precisely the [[special unitary group]] {{math|SU(2)}}. Thus, {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} as a Lie group is [[isomorphic]] to {{math|SU(2)}}.

Using our Hopf coordinates {{math|(''η'', ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} we can then write any element of {{math|SU(2)}} in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}e^{i\,\xi_1}\sin\eta &amp; e^{i\,\xi_2}\cos\eta \\ -e^{-i\,\xi_2}\cos\eta &amp; e^{-i\,\xi_1}\sin\eta\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another way to state this result is if we express the matrix representation of an element of {{math|SU(2)}} as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. It is seen that an arbitrary element {{math|''U'' ∈ SU(2)}} can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;U=\alpha_0 I + \sum_{i=1}^3\alpha_i J_i.&lt;/math&gt;
The condition that the determinant of {{mvar|U}} is +1 implies that the coefficients {{mvar|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} are constrained to lie on a 3-sphere.

==In literature==
In [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]]'s ''[[Flatland]]'', published in 1884, and in ''[[Sphereland]]'', a 1965 sequel to Flatland by [[Dionys Burger]], the 3-sphere is referred to as an '''oversphere''', and a 4-sphere is referred to as a '''hypersphere'''.

Writing in the [[American Journal of Physics]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark A. Peterson]]. [http://link.aip.org/link/ajpias/v47/i12/p1031/s1 "Dante and the 3-sphere"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223083042/http://link.aip.org/link/ajpias/v47/i12/p1031/s1 |date=2013-02-23 }}, American Journal of Physics, vol 47, number 12, 1979, pp1031-1035&lt;/ref&gt; Mark A. Peterson describes three different ways of visualizing 3-spheres and points out language in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' that suggests [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] viewed the Universe in the same way.

'''Alain Badiou''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|d|j|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|alɛ̃ badju|lang}} {{audio|Fr-Alain Badiou.oga|&lt;small&gt;(listen)&lt;/small&gt;}}; born 17 January 1937) is a French philosopher, formerly chair of Philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure|École normale supérieure]] (ENS) and founder of the faculty of Philosophy of the [[Université de Paris VIII]] with [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. Badiou has written about the concepts of [[being]], [[truth]], [[Event (philosophy)|event]] and the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] in a way that, he claims, is neither [[postmodern]] nor simply a repetition of [[Age of Enlightenment|modernity]]. Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations, and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for resurrecting the practice of [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=|last1=Badiou|first1=Alain|last2=Engelmann|first2=Peter|date=27 March 2015|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=978-0745688367|language=English|script-title=Philosophy and the Idea of Communism}}&lt;!--|access-date=23 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Badiou is the son of a mathematician who was a working member of the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in France during [[World War II]] [[:fr:Raymond Badiou|Raymond Badiou]] (1905–1996). He was a student at the [[Lycée Louis-Le-Grand]] and then the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (1955–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Tzuchien Tho, Giuseppe Bianco, ''Badiou and the Philosophers: Interrogating 1960s French Philosophy'', A&amp;C Black, 2013, pp. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he wrote his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) on [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] for [[Georges Canguilhem]] (the topic was "Demonstrative Structures in the First Two Books of Spinoza's [[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]", "''Structures démonstratives dans les deux premiers livres de l'Éthique de Spinoza''").&lt;ref&gt;Tzuchien Tho, Giuseppe Bianco, ''Badiou and the Philosophers: Interrogating 1960s French Philosophy'', A&amp;C Black, 2013, pp. xviii–xix.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the lycée in [[Reims]] from 1963 where he became a close friend of fellow playwright (and philosopher) [[François Regnault]],&lt;ref name="cahiers"&gt;[http://www.web.mdx.ac.uk/cahiers/names/regnault.html François Regnault Homepage at Cahiers pour l'Analyse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818130430/http://www.web.mdx.ac.uk/cahiers/names/regnault.html |date=18 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a couple of novels before moving first to the faculty of letters of the [[University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne|University of Reims]] (the ''collège littéraire universitaire'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alain-badiou.jimdo.com/|title=La chronobiographie|website=alain-badiou|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to the [[University of Paris VIII]] (Vincennes-Saint Denis) in 1969.&lt;ref name="www.web.mdx.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.web.mdx.ac.uk/cahiers/names/badiou.html Badiou Homepage at Concept and Form: The Cahiers pour l'Analyse and Contemporary French Thought] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417154037/http://www.web.mdx.ac.uk/cahiers/names/badiou.html |date=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Badiou was politically active very early on, and was one of the founding members of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU). The PSU was particularly active in the struggle for the [[decolonization]] of Algeria. He wrote his first novel, ''Almagestes'', in 1964. In 1967 he joined a study group organized by [[Louis Althusser]], became increasingly influenced by [[Jacques Lacan]] and became a member of the editorial board of ''[[Cahiers pour l'Analyse]]''.&lt;ref name="www.web.mdx.ac.uk"/&gt; By then he "already had a solid grounding in mathematics and logic (along with [[Lacanianism|Lacanian theory]])",&lt;ref name="www.web.mdx.ac.uk"/&gt; and his own two contributions to the pages of ''Cahiers'' "anticipate many of the distinctive concerns of his later philosophy".&lt;ref name="www.web.mdx.ac.uk"/&gt;

The [[May 1968 in France|student uprisings of May 1968]] reinforced Badiou's commitment to the far Left, and he participated in increasingly militant groups, such as the [[:fr:Union des communistes de France marxiste-léniniste|Union des communistes de France marxiste-léniniste]] (UCFml). To quote Badiou himself, the UCFml is "the [[Maoist]] organization established in late 1969 by [[Natacha Michel]], [[Sylvain Lazarus]], myself and a fair number of young people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others=translated by David Macey and Steve Corcoran |title=The Communist Hypothesis |year=2010 |month= |url= |type=pbk |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher=Verso |location= |isbn=978-1-84467-600-2 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=58 |chapter=Part I: "We Are Still the Contemporaries of May '68"|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Badiou joined the faculty of the newly founded University of Paris VIII/Vincennes-Saint Denis which was a bastion of counter-cultural thought. There he engaged in fierce intellectual debates with fellow professors [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], whose philosophical works he considered unhealthy deviations from the Althusserian program of a scientific [[Marxism]].

In the 1980s, as both Althusserian [[structural Marxism]] and [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] went into decline (after Lacan died and Althusser was committed to a psychiatric hospital), Badiou published more technical and [[abstraction|abstract]] philosophical works, such as ''Théorie du sujet'' (1982), and his magnum opus, ''Being and Event'' (1988). Nonetheless, Badiou has never renounced Althusser or Lacan, and sympathetic references to Marxism and psychoanalysis are not uncommon in his more recent works (most notably ''Petit panthéon portatif'' / ''Pocket Pantheon'').&lt;ref name="Pantheon _Lacan"&gt;Badiou, Alain.

He took up his current position at the ENS in 1999. He is also associated with a number of other institutions, such as the [[Collège International de Philosophie]]. He was a member of [[:fr:Organisation politique|"L'Organisation Politique"]] which, as mentioned above, he founded in 1985 with some comrades from the Maoist UCFml. This organization disbanded in 2007, according to the French Wikipedia article (linked to in the previous sentence). In 2002, he was a co-founder of the Centre International d'Etude de la Philosophie Française Contemporaine, alongside [[Yves Duroux]] and his former student [[Quentin Meillassoux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciepfc.fr/spip.php?article83|accessdate=24 January 2014|title=Quentin Meillassoux|publisher=CIEFPC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908155453/http://www.ciepfc.fr/spip.php?article83|archivedate=8 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badiou has also enjoyed success as a dramatist with plays such as ''Ahmed le Subtil''.

In the last decade, an increasing number of Badiou's works have been translated into English, such as ''Ethics'', ''Deleuze'', ''Manifesto for Philosophy'', ''Metapolitics'', and ''Being and Event''. Short pieces by Badiou have likewise appeared in American and English periodicals, such as ''[[Lacanian Ink]]'', ''[[New Left Review]]'', ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'', ''Cosmos and History'' [http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/] and ''Parrhesia''. Unusually for a contemporary European philosopher his work is increasingly being taken up by militants in countries like India, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 2005–6 Badiou got into a fierce controversy within the confines of Parisian intellectual life. It started in 2005 with the publication of his "Circonstances 3: Portées du mot 'juif' – The Uses of the Word 'Jew'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/badword.htm |title=Alain Badiou – Uses of the Word "Jew" |publisher=Lacan.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525014305/http://www.lacan.com/badword.htm| archivedate= 25 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book generated a strong response with Badiou being labelled [[Anti-Semitic]]. The wrangling became a ''cause célèbre'' with articles going back and forth in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' and in the cultural journal ''[[Les Temps modernes]]''. Linguist and Lacanian philosopher [[Jean-Claude Milner]], a past president of [[Collège international de philosophie]], has accused Badiou of Anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;On that subject, see articles against Badiou by:

== Key concepts ==
{{Original research section|date=August 2018}}
Badiou makes repeated use of several concepts throughout his philosophy. One of the aims of his thought is to show that his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique. Therefore, he uses them to interrogate art and history as well as ontology and scientific discovery. Johannes Thumfart argues that Badiou's philosophy can be regarded as a contemporary reinterpretation of [[Platonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/symptom/?p=64 |last=Thumfart | first=Johannes | title=Learning from Las Vegas: Badiou's Platonism Today |publisher=The Symptom 9. Lacan.com |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditions===
According to Badiou, philosophy is suspended from four conditions (art, love, politics, and science), each of them fully independent "truth procedures." (For Badiou's notion of truth procedures, see below.) Badiou consistently maintains throughout his work (but most systematically in ''[[Manifesto for Philosophy]]'') that philosophy must avoid the temptation to suture itself ('sew itself', that is, to hand over its entire intellectual effort) to any of these independent truth procedures. When philosophy does suture itself to one of its conditions (and Badiou argues that the history of philosophy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is primarily a history of sutures), what results is a philosophical "disaster." Consequently, philosophy is, according to Badiou, a thinking of the ''compossibility'' of the several truth procedures, whether this is undertaken through the investigation of the intersections between distinct truth procedures (the intersection of art and love in the novel, for instance), or whether this is undertaken through the more traditionally philosophical work of addressing categories like truth or the subject (concepts that are, as concepts, external to the individual truth procedures, though they are functionally operative in the truth procedures themselves). For Badiou, when philosophy addresses the four truth procedures in a genuinely philosophical manner, rather than through a suturing abandonment of philosophy as such, it speaks of them with a theoretical terminology that marks its philosophical character: "inaesthetics" rather than art; metapolitics rather than politics; ontology rather than science; etc.

[[Truth]], for Badiou, is a specifically philosophical category. While philosophy's several conditions are, on their own terms, "truth procedures" (i.e., they produce truths as they are pursued), it is only philosophy that can speak of the several truth procedures ''as'' truth procedures. (The lover, for instance, does not think of her love as a question of truth, but simply and rightly as a question of love. Only the philosopher sees in the true lover's love the unfolding of a truth.) Badiou has a very rigorous notion of truth, one that is strongly against the grain of much of contemporary European thought. Badiou at once embraces the traditional modernist notion that truths are genuinely invariant (always and everywhere the case, eternal and unchanging) and the incisively postmodernist notion that truths are constructed through processes. Badiou's theory of truth, exposited throughout his work, accomplishes this strange mixture by uncoupling invariance from self-evidence (such that invariance does not imply self-evidence), as well as by uncoupling constructedness from relativity (such that constructedness does not lead to relativism).

The idea, here, is that a truth's invariance makes it genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed unless there is a rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in question becomes, but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in ''[[Being and Event]]'' and fleshed out in important ways in ''[[Logics of Worlds]]''. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou's work under the title of the "veridical"). While such knowledge is produced in the process of being faithful to a truth event, it should be noted that, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] and [[Heidegger]], distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms "democratic materialism," denies the existence of truth and only recognizes "[[Physical body|bodies]]" and "[[languages]]." Badiou proposes a turn towards the "[[materialist dialectic]]," which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, ''except'' there are also truths.

===Inaesthetic===
In ''Handbook of Inaesthetics'' Badiou both draws on the original Greek meaning and the later Kantian concept of  "aesthesis" as "material perception"  and coins the phrase "inaesthetic" to refer to a concept of artistic creation that denies "the reflection/object relation" yet, at the same time, in reaction against the idea of [[mimesis]], or poetic reflection of "nature", he affirms that art is "immanent" and "singular". Art is immanent in the sense that its truth is given in its immediacy in a given work of art, and singular in that its truth is found in art and art alone—hence reviving the ancient materialist concept of "aesthesis". His view of the link between philosophy and art is tied into the motif of pedagogy, which he claims functions so as to "arrange the forms of knowledge in a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them". He develops these ideas with examples from the prose of [[Samuel Beckett]] and the poetry of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Fernando Pessoa]] (who he argues has developed a body of work that philosophy is currently incapable of incorporating), among others.

==''Being and Event''&lt;!--'Being and Event' redirects here--&gt;==
The major propositions of Badiou's philosophy all find their basis in ''Being and Event'', in which he continues his attempt (which he began in ''Théorie du sujet'') to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;See here Feltham and Clamens's introduction in Badiou's book ''Infinite Thought'', Continuum (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on [[semiotics]] and language, any notion of a subject. Badiou's work is, by his own admission,&lt;ref&gt;See Badiou's book ''Infinite Thought'', Continuum (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to break out of contemporary philosophy's fixation upon language, which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him, in ''Being and Event'', to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] and religious thinkers such as [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]. His philosophy draws upon both 'analytical' and 'continental' traditions. In Badiou's own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up.&lt;ref&gt;See here Badiou's comments in the introduction to the English version of ''Being and Event'', Continuum (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Being and Event'' offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication.

As is implied in the title of the book, two elements mark the thesis of ''Being and Event'': the place of ontology, or 'the science of being qua being' (being in itself), and the place of the event – which is seen as a rupture in being – through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of [[set theory]], and specifically [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (with the axiom of choice), to which Badiou accords a fundamental role in a manner quite distinct from the majority of either mathematicians or philosophers.

===Mathematics as ontology===
{{Fanpov|date=December 2014}}
{{Weasel|date=December 2014}}
{{Original research section|date=December 2014}}
For Badiou the problem which the [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition of philosophy has faced and never satisfactorily dealt with is that while beings themselves are plural, and thought in terms of multiplicity, being itself is thought to be singular; that is, ''it'' is thought in terms of the one. He proposes as the solution to this impasse the following declaration: that the [[Henology|One]] is not (''l'Un n'est pas''). This is why Badiou accords set theory (the axioms of which he refers to as the "ideas of the multiple") such stature, and refers to mathematics as the very place of ontology: Only set theory allows one to conceive a 'pure doctrine of the multiple'. Set theory does not operate in terms of definite individual elements in groupings but only functions insofar as what belongs to a set is of the same relation as that set (that is, another set too). What individuates a set, therefore, is not an existential positive proposition, but other multiples whose properties (i.e., ''structural'' relations) validate its presentation. The ''structure'' of being thus secures the regime of the count-as-one. So if one is to think of a set – for instance, the set of people, or humanity – as counting as one, the multiple elements which belong to that set are secured as one consistent concept (humanity), but only in terms of what does ''not'' belong to that set. What is crucial for Badiou is that the structural form of the count-as-one, which makes multiplicities thinkable, implies (somehow or other) that the proper name of ''being'' does not belong to an ''element'' as such (an original 'one'), but rather the void set (written Ø), the set to which nothing (not even the void set itself) belongs. It may help to understand the concept 'count-as-one' if it is associated with the concept of 'terming': a multiple is ''not'' one, but it is referred to with 'multiple': one word. To count a set as one is to mention that set. How the being of terms such as 'multiple' does not contradict the non-being of the one can be understood by considering the multiple nature of terminology: for there to be a term without there also being a system of terminology, within which the difference between terms gives context and meaning to any one term, is impossible. 'Terminology' implies precisely difference between terms (thus multiplicity) as the condition for meaning. The idea of a term without meaning is incoherent, the count-as-one is a ''structural effect'' or a ''situational operation''; it is not an event of 'truth'. Multiples which are 'composed' or 'consistent' are count-effects. 'Inconsistent multiplicity' [''meaning?''] is [somehow or other] 'the presentation of presentation.'

Badiou's use of set theory in this manner is not just illustrative or [[heuristic]]. Badiou uses the [[axiom]]s of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory to identify the relationship of being to history, Nature, the State, and God. Most significantly this use means that (as with set theory) there is a strict prohibition on self-belonging; a set cannot contain or belong to itself. This results from the [[axiom of foundation]] – or the axiom of regularity – which enacts such a prohibition (cf. p.&amp;nbsp;190 in ''Being and Event''). (This axiom states that every non-empty set A contains an element y that is [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] from A.)  Badiou's philosophy draws two major implications from this prohibition. Firstly, it secures the inexistence of the 'one': there cannot be a grand overarching set, and thus it is fallacious to conceive of a grand cosmos, a whole Nature, or a Being of God. Badiou is therefore – against [[Georg Cantor]], from whom he draws heavily – staunchly [[atheism|atheist]]. However, secondly, this prohibition prompts him to introduce the event. Because, according to Badiou, the axiom of foundation 'founds' all sets in the void, it ties all being to the historico-social situation of the multiplicities of de-centred sets – thereby effacing the positivity of subjective action, or an entirely 'new' occurrence. And whilst this is acceptable ontologically, it is unacceptable, Badiou holds, philosophically. Set theory mathematics has consequently 'pragmatically abandoned' an area which philosophy cannot. And so, Badiou argues, there is therefore only one possibility remaining: that ontology can say nothing about the event.

Several critics have questioned Badiou's use of mathematics. Mathematician [[Alan Sokal]] and physicist [[Jean Bricmont]] write that Badiou proposes, with seemingly "utter seriousness," a blending of psychoanalysis, politics and [[set theory]] that they contend is preposterous.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan and Jean Bricmont (1999) ''Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science '' Macmillan, {{ISBN|9780312204075}}, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] has questioned Badiou's grasp of the foundation of mathematics, writing in 2012:
:There is no evidence that I can find in ''Being and Event'' that the author really understands what he is talking about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= |title=A Nothing Would do As Well|journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=31 August 2012 |author=Scruton, Roger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a critique from a mathematician's point of view is the essay 'Badiou's Number: A Critique of Mathematics as Ontology' by Ricardo L. Nirenberg and David Nirenberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/uploads/pdf/nirenbergs_badiousnumber_complete.pdf |last=Nirenberg |first=Ricardo L. |author2=David Nirenberg |title=Badiou's Number: A Critique of Mathematics as Ontology |publisher=Critical Inquiry |accessdate=20 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811064012/http://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/uploads/pdf/nirenbergs_badiousnumber_complete.pdf |archive-date=11 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes issue in particular with Badiou's matheme of the Event in ''Being and Event'', which has already been alluded to in respect of the 'axiom of foundation' above. Nirenberg and Nirenberg write:

:Rather than being defined in terms of objects previously defined, ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is here defined in terms of itself; you must already have it in order to define it. Set theorists call this a not-well-founded set. This kind of set never appears in mathematics—not least because it produces an unmathematical ''mise-en-abîme'': if we replace ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' inside the bracket by its expression as a bracket, we can go on doing this forever—and so can hardly be called "a matheme."'

===The event and the subject===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Badiou-an original drawing.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Drawing from 18 November 2006 "Truth procedure in politics" lecture]] --&gt;
Badiou again turns here to mathematics and set theory – Badiou's language of ontology – to study the possibility of an indiscernible element existing extrinsically to the situation of ontology. He employs the strategy of the mathematician [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul J. Cohen]], using what are called the ''conditions'' of sets. These conditions are thought of in terms of domination, a domination being that which defines a set. (If one takes, in binary language, the set with the condition 'items marked only with ones', any item marked with zero negates the property of the set. The condition which has only ones is thus dominated by any condition which has zeros in it [cf. p.&amp;nbsp;367-71 in ''Being and Event''].) Badiou reasons using these conditions that every discernible (nameable or constructible) set is dominated by the conditions which don't possess the property that makes it discernible as a set. (The property 'one' is always dominated by 'not one'.) These sets are, in line with constructible ontology, relative to one's being-in-the-world and one's being in language (where sets and concepts, such as the concept 'humanity', get their names). However, he continues, the dominations themselves are, whilst being relative concepts, not necessarily intrinsic to language and constructible thought; rather one can axiomatically define a domination – in the terms of mathematical ontology – as a set of conditions such that any condition outside the domination is dominated by at least one term inside the domination. One does not necessarily need to refer to constructible language to conceive of a 'set of dominations', which he refers to as the indiscernible set, or the generic set. It is therefore, he continues, possible to think beyond the strictures of the relativistic constructible universe of language, by a process Cohen calls [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. And he concludes in following that while ontology can mark out a space for an inhabitant of the constructible situation to decide upon the indiscernible, it falls to the subject – about which the ontological situation cannot comment – to nominate this indiscernible, this generic point; and thus nominate, and give name to, the undecidable event. Badiou thereby marks out a philosophy by which to refute the apparent relativism or apoliticism in post-structuralist thought.

Badiou's ultimate ethical maxim is therefore one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is to name the indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, it is important to note, ''becomes'' a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.

In line with his concept of the event, Badiou maintains, politics is not about politicians, but activism based on the present situation and the {{Sic|evental}} (his translators' neologism) rupture. So too does love have this characteristic of becoming ''anew''. Even in science the guesswork that marks the event is prominent. He vigorously rejects the tag of '[[Decisionism|decisionist]]' (the idea that once something is decided it 'becomes true'), but rather argues that the recasting of a truth comes prior to its veracity or verifiability. As he says of [[Galileo]] (p.&amp;nbsp;401):

:''When Galileo announced the principle of inertia, he was still separated from the truth of the new physics by all the chance encounters that are named in subjects such as Descartes or Newton. How could he, with the names he fabricated and displaced (because they were at hand – 'movement', 'equal proportion', etc.), have supposed the veracity of his principle for the situation to-come that was the establishment of modern science; that is, the supplementation of his situation with the indiscernible and unfinishable part that one has to name 'rational physics'?''

While Badiou is keen to reject an equivalence between politics and philosophy, he correlates nonetheless his political activism and skepticism toward the parliamentary-democratic process with his philosophy, based around singular, situated truths, and potential revolutions.

==L'Organisation Politique==
Alain Badiou is a founding member (along with [[Natacha Michel]] and [[Sylvain Lazarus]]) of the militant French political organisation ''L'Organisation Politique'', which was active from 1985 until it disbanded in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;See the organisation's website at https://web.archive.org/web/20071028083920/http://www.orgapoli.net/&lt;/ref&gt; It called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention in a wide range of issues (including immigration, labor, and housing). In addition to numerous writings and interventions, ''L'Organisation Politique'' highlighted the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants (les sans papiers), stressing that they must be conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/alain-badiou-political-action-organisation-politique/ |last=Robinson | first=Andrew | title=An A to Z of Theory.

==Sarkozy pamphlet==
Alain Badiou gained great notoriety in 2007 with his pamphlet ''The Meaning of [[Sarkozy]]'' (''De quoi Sarkozy est-il le nom?''), which quickly sold 60,000 copies, whereas for 40 years the sales of his books had oscillated between 2,000 and 6,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Conan, [http://toutsurlachine.blogspot.ie/2010/03/portrait-badiou-la-star-de-la-philo-est.html?m=1 "Badiou, la star de la philo est-il un salaud?"], in ''Marianne'' no. 671, 27 Feb 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3976">In [[mathematics]], the '''André–Oort conjecture''' is an open problem in [[number theory]] that generalises the [[Arithmetic of abelian varieties#Manin–Mumford conjecture|Manin–Mumford conjecture]].  A prototypical version of the conjecture was stated by [[Yves André]] in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=André | first1=Yves | title=''G''-functions and geometry | series=Aspects of Mathematics | volume=E13 | publisher=Vieweg | year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more general version was conjectured by [[Frans Oort]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Oort | first1=Frans | chapter=Canonical liftings and dense sets of CM points | title=Arithmetic Geometry | editor=Fabrizio Catanese | publisher=Cambridge University Press | place=Cambridge | year=1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern version is a natural generalisation of these two conjectures.

==Statement==

The conjecture in its modern form is as follows.  Let ''S'' be a [[Shimura variety]] and let ''V'' be a set of special points in ''S''.  Then the irreducible components of the [[Zariski closure]] of ''V'' are special subvarieties.

André's first version of the conjecture was just for one dimensional subvarieties of Shimura varieties, while Oort proposed that it should work with subvarieties of the moduli space of [[Abelian_variety#Polarisation_and_dual_abelian_variety|principally polarised]] [[Abelian variety|Abelian varieties]] of dimension ''g''.

==Partial results==

Various results have been established towards the full conjecture by [[Ben Moonen]], Yves André, [[Andrei Yafaev]], [[Bas Edixhoven]], [[Laurent Clozel]], and [[Emmanuel Ullmo]], among others.  Most of these results were conditional upon the [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] being true.  The biggest unconditional results came in 2009 when [[Jonathan Pila]] used techniques from [[o-minimal theory|o-minimal]] geometry and [[transcendental number theory]] to prove the conjecture for arbitrary products of [[modular curve]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Pila | first1=Jonathan | title=Rational points of definable sets and results of André–Oort–Manin–Mumford type | journal=Int.

==Generalisations==

Just as the André–Oort conjecture can be seen as a generalisation of the Manin–Mumford conjecture, so too the André–Oort conjecture can be generalised.  The usual generalisation considered is the Zilber–Pink conjecture, an open problem which combines a generalisation of the André–Oort conjecture proposed by Richard Pink&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Pink | first1=Richard | chapter=A combination of the conjectures of Mordell–Lang and André–Oort | title=Geometric methods in algebra and number theory | series=Progress in Mathematics | volume=253 | publisher=Birkhauser | year=2005 | pages=251–282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and conjectures put forth by [[Boris Zilber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Zilber | first1=Boris | title=Exponential sums equations and the Schanuel conjecture | journal=J.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6437">In [[mathematical economics]], '''applied general equilibrium''' ('''AGE''') models were pioneered by [[Herbert Scarf]] at [[Yale University]] in 1967, in two papers, and a follow-up book with Terje Hansen in 1973, with the aim of empirically estimating the [[Arrow–Debreu model]] of [[general equilibrium theory]] with empirical data, to provide "“a general method for the explicit numerical solution of the neoclassical model”
(Scarf with Hansen 1973: 1)

Scarf's method iterated a sequence of simplicial subdivisions which would generate a decreasing sequence of simplices around any solution of the general equilibrium problem. With sufficiently many steps, the sequence would produce a price vector that clears the market.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Brouwer fixed-point theorem|Brouwer's Fixed Point theorem]] states that a continuous mapping of a simplex into itself has at least one fixed point. This paper describes a numerical algorithm for approximating, in a sense to be explained below, a fixed point of such a mapping (Scarf 1967a: 1326).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scarf never built an AGE model, but hinted that “these novel numerical techniques might be useful in assessing consequences for the economy of a change in the economic environment” (Kehoe et al. 2005, citing Scarf 1967b). His students elaborated the Scarf algorithm into a tool box, where the price vector could be solved for any changes in policies (or exogenous shocks), giving the equilibrium ‘adjustments’ needed for the prices. This method was first used by Shoven and Whalley (1972 and 1973), and then was developed through the 1970s by Scarf’s students and others.&lt;ref&gt;A list of Scarf's students appears in Kehoe et alia (2005: 5): Ph.D. Students: Terje Hansen, Timothy Kehoe, Rolf Mantel, [[Michael J. Todd (matheamtician)|Michael J. Todd]], Ludo van der Heyden and John Whalley, and Andrew Feltstein, Ana Matirena-Mantel, Marcus Miller, Donald Richter, Jaime Serra-Puche, John Shoven and John Spencer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most contemporary applied general equilibrium models are numerical
analogs of traditional two-sector general equilibrium models popularized
by James Meade, Harry Johnson, Arnold Harberger, and others in the
1950s and 1960s. Earlier analytic work with these models has examined
the distortionary effects of taxes, tariffs, and other policies, along with
functional incidence questions. More recent applied models, including
those discussed here, provide numerical estimates of efficiency and distributional
effects within the same framework.

Scarf's fixed-point method was a break-through in the mathematics of computation generally, and specifically in optimization and computational economics. Later researchers continued to develop iterative methods for computing fixed-points, both for topological models like Scarf's and for models described by functions with continuous second derivatives or convexity or both. Of course, "[[ analysis|global]] [[Newton's method|Newton method]]s"&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Smale]], Global analysis and economics, ''Handbook of Mathematical Economics'', K. J. Arrow and M. D. Intrilligator, North-Holland, Amsterdam, ''' 1''' (1981), pp. 331--370.&lt;/ref&gt; for essentially convex and smooth functions and path-following methods for [[diffeomorphism]]s converged faster than did robust algorithms for continuous functions, when the smooth methods are applicable.&lt;ref&gt;

==AGE and CGE models==
AGE models, being based on Arrow–Debreu general equilibrium theory, work in a different manner than [[CGE model]]s. The model first establishes the existence of equilibrium through the standard Arrow–Debreu exposition, then inputs data into all the various sectors, and then applies Scarf’s algorithm (Scarf 1967a, 1967b and Scarf with Hansen 1973) to solve for a price vector that would clear all markets. This algorithm would narrow down the possible relative prices through a simplex method, which kept reducing the size of the ‘net’ within which possible solutions were found. AGE modelers then consciously choose a cutoff, and set an approximate solution as the net never closed on a unique point through the iteration process.

CGE models are based on macro balancing equations, and use an equal number of equations (based on the standard macro balancing equations) and unknowns solvable as simultaneous equations, where exogenous variables are changed outside the model, to give the endogenous results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="627">'''Bounded growth''' occurs when the growth rate of a mathematical function is constantly increasing at a decreasing rate. Asymptotically, bounded growth approaches a fixed value.
This contrasts with [[exponential growth]], which is constantly increasing at an accelerating rate, and therefore approaches infinity in the limit.

An example of bounded growth is the [[logistic function]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">In [[mathematics]], '''Choquet theory''', named after [[Gustave Choquet]], is an area of [[functional analysis]] and [[convex analysis]] concerned with [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] which have [[support (mathematics)|support]] on the [[extreme points]] of a [[convex set]] ''C''. Roughly speaking, every [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of ''C'' should appear as a weighted average of extreme points, a concept made more precise by generalizing the notion of weighted average from a [[convex combination]] to an [[integral]] taken over the set ''E'' of extreme points. Here ''C'' is a subset of a [[real vector space]] ''V'', and the main thrust of the theory is to treat the cases where ''V'' is an infinite-dimensional (locally convex Hausdorff) [[topological vector space]] along lines similar to the finite-dimensional case. The main concerns of Gustave Choquet were in [[potential theory]]. Choquet theory has become a general paradigm, particularly for treating [[convex cone]]s as determined by their extreme [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]], and so for many different notions of ''positivity'' in mathematics.

The two ends of a [[line segment]] determine the points in between: in vector terms the segment from ''v'' to ''w'' consists of the λ''v'' + (1 &amp;minus; λ)''w'' with 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. The classical result of [[Hermann Minkowski]] says that in [[Euclidean space]], a [[bounded set|bounded]], [[closed set|closed]] [[convex set]] ''C'' is the [[convex hull]] of its extreme point set ''E'', so that any ''c'' in ''C'' is a (finite) [[convex combination]] of points ''e'' of ''E''. Here ''E'' may be a finite or an [[infinite set]]. In vector terms, by assigning non-negative weights ''w''(''e'') to the ''e'' in ''E'', [[almost all]] 0, we can represent any ''c'' in ''C'' as

:&lt;math&gt; c = \sum_{e\in E} w(e) e\ &lt;/math&gt;

with 

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{e\in E} w(e) = 1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In any case the ''w''(''e'') give a [[probability measure]] supported on a finite subset of ''E''. For any [[affine function]] ''f'' on ''C'', its value at the point ''c'' is 

:&lt;math&gt;f (c) = \int f(e) d w(e).&lt;/math&gt;

In the infinite dimensional setting, one would like to make a similar statement.

'''Choquet's theorem''' states that for a [[compact set|compact]] convex subset ''C'' of a [[normed space]] ''V'', given ''c'' in ''C'' there exists a [[probability measure]] ''w'' supported on the set ''E'' of extreme points of ''C'' such that, for any affine function ''f'' on ''C,'' 

:&lt;math&gt;f (c) = \int f(e) d w(e).&lt;/math&gt; 

In practice ''V'' will be a [[Banach space]]. The original [[Krein–Milman theorem]] follows from Choquet's result. Another corollary is the [[Riesz representation theorem]] for [[state (functional analysis)|states]] on the continuous functions on a metrizable compact Hausdorff space.

More generally, for ''V'' a [[locally convex topological vector space]], the '''Choquet–Bishop–de Leeuw theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Errett Bishop]]; [[Karel deLeeuw|Karl de Leeuw]]. [http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/AIF/AIF_1959__9_/AIF_1959__9__305_0/AIF_1959__9__305_0.pdf "The representations of linear functionals by measures on sets of extreme points"]. Annales de l'institut Fourier, 9 (1959), pp. 305–331.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the same formal statement.

In addition to the existence of a probability measure supported on the extreme boundary that represents a given point ''c'', one might also consider the uniqueness of such measures. It is easy to see that uniqueness does not hold even in the finite dimensional setting. One can take, for counterexamples, the convex set to be a [[cube]] or a ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Uniqueness does hold, however, when the convex set is a finite dimensional [[simplex]].{{citation-needed|date=April 2017}} So that the weights ''w''(''e'') are unique. A finite dimensional simplex is a special case of a '''Choquet simplex'''. Any point in a Choquet simplex is represented by a unique probability measure on the extreme points.

In [[graph theory]], '''circular coloring''' may be viewed as a refinement of usual [[graph coloring]].  The ''circular chromatic number'' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\chi_c(G)&lt;/math&gt; can be given by any of the following definitions, all of which are equivalent (for finite graphs).

#&lt;math&gt;\chi_c(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the infimum over all real numbers &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; so that there exists a map from &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; to a circle of circumference 1 with the property that any two adjacent vertices map to points at distance &lt;math&gt;\ge \frac{1}{r}&lt;/math&gt; along this circle.  
#&lt;math&gt;\chi_c(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the infimum over all rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; so that there exists a map from &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; to the cyclic group &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}/n{\mathbb Z}&lt;/math&gt; with the property that adjacent vertices map to elements at distance &lt;math&gt;\ge k&lt;/math&gt; apart.  
#In an oriented graph, declare the ''imbalance'' of a cycle &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;|E(C)|&lt;/math&gt; divided by the minimum of the number of edges directed clockwise and the number of edges directed counterclockwise.  Define the ''imbalance'' of the oriented graph to be the maximum imbalance of a cycle.  Now, &lt;math&gt;\chi_c(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum imbalance of an orientation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

It is relatively easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\chi_c(G) \le \chi(G)&lt;/math&gt; (especially using 1. or 2.), but in fact &lt;math&gt;\lceil \chi_c(G) \rceil = \chi(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is in this sense that we view circular chromatic number as a refinement of the usual chromatic number.  

Circular coloring was originally defined by {{harvtxt|Vince|1988}}, who called it "star coloring".

Coloring is dual to the subject of [[nowhere-zero flows]] and indeed, circular coloring has a natural dual notion: circular flows.

== Circular complete graphs ==
{{infobox graph
 | name = Circular complete graph
 | vertices = ''n''
 | edges = ''n''(''n''-2''k''+1) / 2
 | chromatic_number = ⌈n/k⌉
 | girth = &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\infty &amp; n = 2k\\ n &amp; n = 2k+1\\ 4 &amp; 2k+2 \leq n &lt; 3k \\ 3 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

}}

For integers &lt;math&gt;n,k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n\ge 2k&lt;/math&gt;, the '''circular complete graph''' {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;n/k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (also known as a '''circular clique''') is the graph with vertex set &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}/n{\mathbb Z}&lt;/math&gt; and edges between elements at distance &lt;math&gt;\ge k&lt;/math&gt; apart.
That is, the vertices are numbers {0, 1, ..., ''n''-1} and vertex ''i'' is adjacent to:
:''i''+k, ''i''+k+1, ..., ''i''+''n''-''k'' mod ''n''. 
For example, {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;n/1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is just the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}, while {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;2n+1 / n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is isomorphic to the [[cycle graph]] {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

A circular coloring is then, according to the second definition above, a [[graph homomorphism|homomorphism]] into a circular complete graph.
The crucial fact about these graphs is that {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;a/b&lt;/sub&gt;''}} admits a homomorphism into {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;c/d&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if and only if ''a/b'' ≤ ''c/d''. This justifies the notation, since if the rational numbers ''a/b'' and ''c/d'' are equal, then {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;a/b&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;c/d&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are homomorphically equivalent. 
Moreover, the homomorphism order among them refines the order given by complete graphs into a [[dense order]], corresponding to rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. For example
:{{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;2/1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;7/3&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → ... → {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;3/1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;4/1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → ...
or equivalently
:{{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → ... → {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''}} → ...
The example on the figure can be interpreted as a homomorphism from the [[flower snark]] {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''}} into {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which comes earlier than {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, corresponding to the fact that &lt;math&gt;\chi_c(J_5) \le 2.5 &lt; 3&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Common and special causes''' are the two distinct origins of variation in a process, as defined in the statistical thinking and methods of [[Walter A. Shewhart]] and [[W. Edwards Deming]]. Briefly, "common causes", also called '''natural patterns''', are the usual, historical, quantifiable variation in a system, while "special causes" are unusual, not previously observed, non-quantifiable variation.

The distinction is fundamental in [[philosophy of statistics]] and [[philosophy of probability]], with different treatment of these issues being a classic issue of [[probability interpretations]], being recognised and discussed as early as 1703 by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]; various alternative names have been used over the years.

The distinction has been particularly important in the thinking of economists [[Frank Knight]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[G. L. S. Shackle]].

==Origins and concepts==

In 1703, [[Jacob Bernoulli]] wrote to [[Gottfried Leibniz]] to discuss their shared interest in applying [[mathematics]] and [[probability]] to games of chance. [[Jacob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] speculated whether it would be possible to gather [[Mortality rate|mortality]] data from gravestones and thereby calculate, by their existing practice, the probability of a man currently aged 20 years outliving a man aged 60 years. [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] replied that he doubted this was possible:

''Nature has established patterns originating in the return of events but only for the most part. New illnesses flood the human race, so that no matter how many experiments you have done on corpses, you have not thereby imposed a limit on the nature of events so that in the future they could not vary.''

This captures the central idea that some variation is predictable, at least approximately in frequency. This ''common-cause variation'' is evident from the experience base. However, new, unanticipated, emergent or previously neglected phenomena (e.g. "new diseases") result in variation outside the historical experience base. [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] argued that such ''special-cause variation'' is fundamentally unpredictable in frequency of occurrence or in severity.

[[John Maynard Keynes]] emphasised the importance of special-cause variation when he wrote:

''By "uncertain" knowledge ... I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The game of roulette is not subject, in this sense, to uncertainty ... The sense in which I am using the term is that in which the prospect of a European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence, or the obsolescence of a new invention ... About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know!''

==Definitions==

===Common-cause variations===
Common-cause variation is characterised by:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

*Phenomena constantly active within the system;
*Variation predictable [[probability|probabilistically]];
*Irregular variation within a historical experience base; and
*Lack of significance in individual high or low values.

The outcomes of a perfectly balanced [[roulette]] wheel are a good example of common-cause variation. Common-cause variation is the ''noise'' within the system.

[[Walter A. Shewhart]] originally used the term ''chance cause''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''common cause'' was coined by [[Harry Alpert]] in 1947.  The [[Western Electric Company]] used the term ''natural pattern''.&lt;ref name="Western Electric Company 1956, 23–24"&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shewhart called a process that features only common-cause variation as being ''in [[statistical control]]''. This term is deprecated by some modern statisticians who prefer the phrase ''stable and predictable''.

===Special-cause variation===

Special-cause variation is characterised by:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

*New, unanticipated, emergent or previously neglected phenomena within the system;
*Variation inherently unpredictable, even probabilistically;
*Variation outside the historical experience base; and
*Evidence of some inherent change in the system or our knowledge of it.

Special-cause variation always arrives as a surprise. It is the ''signal'' within a system.

Walter A. Shewhart originally used the term ''assignable cause''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

==Importance to economics==
{{details|Knightian uncertainty}}
In economics, this circle of ideas is analysed under the rubric of "[[Knightian uncertainty]]". [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Frank Knight]] both discussed the inherent unpredictability of economic systems in their work and used it to criticise the mathematical approach to economics, in terms of [[expected utility]], developed by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and others. Keynes in particular argued that economic systems did not automatically tend to the equilibrium of [[full employment]] owing to their agents' inability to predict the future. As he remarked in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'':

''... as living and moving beings, we are forced to act ... [even when] our existing knowledge does not provide a sufficient basis for a calculated mathematical expectation.''

Keynes' thinking was at odds with the [[classical liberalism]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economists, but [[G. L. S. Shackle]] recognised the importance of Keynes's insight and sought to formalise it within a [[free-market]] philosophy.

In [[financial economics]], the [[black swan theory]] of [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] is based on the significance and unpredictability of special causes.

==Importance to industrial and quality management==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

A special-cause failure is a failure that can be corrected by changing a component or process, whereas a common-cause failure is equivalent to noise in the system and specific actions cannot be made to prevent the failure.

[[Harry Alpert]] observed:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

: ''A riot occurs in a certain prison. Officials and sociologists turn out a detailed report about the prison, with a full explanation of why and how it happened here, ignoring the fact that the causes were common to a majority of prisons, and that the riot could have happened anywhere.''

The quote recognises that there is a temptation to react to an extreme outcome and to see it as significant, even where its causes are common to many situations and the distinctive circumstances surrounding its occurrence, the results of mere chance. Such behaviour has many implications within management, often leading to ad hoc interventions that merely increase the level of variation and frequency of undesirable outcomes.

[[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] and [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] both advocated the [[control chart]] as a means of managing a [[business process]] in an economically efficient manner.

==Importance to statistics==

===Deming and Shewhart===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

Within the [[frequency probability]] framework, there is no process whereby a [[probability]] can be attached to the future occurrence of special cause.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} One might naively ask whether the [[bayesian probability|Bayesian]] approach does allow such a probability to be specified. The existence of special-cause variation led [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] to an interest in [[Bayesian probability]], but no formal synthesis emerged from their work. Most statisticians of the Shewhart-Deming school take the view that special causes are not embedded in either experience or in current thinking (that's why they come as a surprise; their prior probability has been neglected—in effect, assigned the value zero) so that any subjective probability is doomed to be hopelessly badly [[calibration (probability)|calibrated]] in practice.

It is immediately apparent from the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] quote above that there are implications for [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Deming observed that in any forecasting activity, the [[population (statistics)|population]] is that of future events while the [[sampling frame]] is, inevitably, some [[subset]] of historical events. Deming held that the disjoint nature of population and sampling frame was inherently problematic once the existence of special-cause variation was admitted, rejecting the general use of probability and conventional statistics in such
situations. He articulated the difficulty as the distinction between [[analytic and enumerative statistical studies]].

[[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] argued that, as processes subject to special-cause variation were inherently unpredictable, the usual techniques of probability could not be used to separate special-cause from common-cause variation. He developed the [[control chart]] as a statistical [[heuristic]] to distinguish the two types of variation. Both Deming and [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] advocated the control chart as a means of assessing a process's state of [[statistical control]] and as a foundation for forecasting.

===Keynes===

[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] identified three domains of probability:&lt;ref name=keynes1921&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keynes|first1=J. M.|year=1921|title=[[A Treatise on Probability]]|isbn=0-333-10733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[frequency]] probability;
*subjective or [[Bayesian probability]]; and
*events lying outside the possibility of any description in terms of probability (special causes)

and sought to base a [[probability theory]] thereon.

==Common mode failure in engineering==
{{OR section|date=February 2013}}

'''Common mode failure''' has a more specific meaning in engineering. It refers to events which are not [[statistics|statistically independent]].  Failures in multiple parts of a system may be caused by a single fault, particularly random failures due to environmental conditions or aging. An example is when all of the pumps for a fire sprinkler system are located in one room.  If the room becomes too hot for the pumps to operate, they will all fail at essentially the same time, from one cause (the heat in the room).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.safetyinengineering.com/FileUploads/CMF%20in%20high-integrity%20C&amp;I%20systems_1329414280_2.pdf | title=Common-Mode Failure Considerations in High-Integrity C&amp;I Systems | publisher=Safety in Engineering | date=February 2012 | accessdate=November 21, 2012 | author=Thomson, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is an electronic system wherein a fault in a power supply injects noise onto a supply line, causing failures in multiple subsystems.

This is particularly important in safety-critical systems using multiple [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] channels. If the probability of failure in one subsystem is ''p'', then it would be expected that an ''N'' channel system would have a probability of failure of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''N''.&lt;/sup&gt; However, in practice, the probability of failure is much higher because they are not statistically independent; for example [[ionizing radiation]] or [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) may affect all the channels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Randell|Randell, Brian]] ''Design Fault Tolerance'' in ''The Evolution of Fault-Tolerant Computing'', Avizienis, A.; Kopetz, H.; Laprie, J.-C. (eds.), pp. 251-270. Springer-Verlag, 1987. {{ISBN|3-211-81941-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''principle of redundancy'' states that, when events of failure of a component are statistically independent, the probabilities of their joint occurrence multiply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hissa.nist.gov/chissa/SEI_Framework/framework_16.html | title=SEI Framework: Fault Tolerance Mechanisms | publisher=NIST High Integrity Software Systems Assurance | work=Redundancy Management | date=March 30, 1995 | accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for instance, if the probability of failure of a component of a system is one in one thousand per year, the probability of the joint failure of two of them is one in one million per year, provided that the two events are statistically independent.  This principle favors the strategy of the redundancy of components.  One place this strategy is implemented is in [[RAID 1]], where two hard disks store a computer's data redundantly.

But even so there can be many common modes: consider a RAID1 where two disks are purchased online and are installed in a computer, there can be many common modes:

* The disks are likely to be from the same manufacturer and of the same model, therefore they share the same design flaws.
* The disks are likely to have similar serial numbers, thus they may share any manufacturing flaws affecting production of the same batch.
* The disks are likely to have been shipped at the same time, thus they are likely to have suffered from the same transportation damage.
* As installed both disks are attached to the same power supply, making them vulnerable to the same power supply issues.
* As installed both disks are in the same case, making them vulnerable to the same overheating events.
* They will be both attached to the same card or motherboard, and driven by the same software, which may have the same bugs.
* Because of the very nature of RAID1, both disks will be subjected to the same workload and very closely similar access patterns, stressing them in the same way.

Also, if the events of failure of two components are maximally statistically dependent, the probability of the joint failure of both is identical to the probability of failure of them individually.  In such a case, the advantages of redundancy are negated.  Strategies for the avoidance of common mode failures include keeping redundant components physically isolated.

A prime example of redundancy with isolation is a [[nuclear power|nuclear power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | title=A Study of Common-Mode Failures | publisher=UK Atomic Energy Authority: Safety and Reliability Directorate | author1=Edwards, G. T. |author2=Watson, I.

The new [[European Pressurized Reactor]] has two [[containment building]]s, one inside the other.  However, even here it is possible for a common mode failure to occur (for example, in the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]], mains power was severed by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]], then the thirteen backup diesel generators were all simultaneously disabled by the subsequent tsunami that flooded the basements of the turbine halls).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13052">In the [[mathematics]] of [[binary relation]]s, the '''composition relations''' is a concept of forming a new relation {{nowrap|''S'' ∘ ''R''}} from two given relations ''R'' and ''S''. The composition of relations is called '''relative multiplication'''&lt;ref&gt;Bjarni Jónssen (1984) "Maximal Algebras of Binary Relations", in ''Contributions to Group Theory'', K.I. Appel editor [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|978-0-8218-5035-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[algebraic logic#Calculus of relations|calculus of relations]]. The composition is then the '''relative product''' of the factor relations. [[Composition of functions]] is a special case of composition of relations.

The words [[uncle]] and [[aunt]] indicate a compound relation: for a person to be an uncle, he must be a brother of a parent (or a sister for an aunt). In [[algebraic logic]] it is said that the relation of Uncle ( ''xUz'' ) is the composition of relations "is a brother of" ( ''xBy'' ) and "is a parent of" ( ''yPz'' ).
:&lt;math&gt;U = BP \quad \equiv \quad xByPz \iff xUz.&lt;/math&gt;

Beginning with [[Augustus De Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;A. De Morgan (1860) "On the Syllogism: IV and on the Logic of Relations"&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional form of reasoning with by [[syllogism]] has been subsumed by relational logical expressions and their composition.&lt;ref name=DDM/&gt;

== Definition ==
If &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq Y\times Z&lt;/math&gt; are two binary relations, then
their composition &lt;math&gt;S\circ R&lt;/math&gt; is the relation
:&lt;math&gt;S\circ R = \{ (x,z)\in X\times Z\mid \exists y\in Y: (x,y)\in R\land (y,z)\in S \}.&lt;/math&gt;

In   other words, &lt;math&gt;S\circ R\subseteq X\times Z&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the rule that says &lt;math&gt;(x,z)\in S\circ R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is an element &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\,R\,y\,S\,z&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y,z)\in S&lt;/math&gt;).

In particular fields, authors might denote by {{math|''R'' ∘ ''S''}} what is defined here to be {{math|''S'' ∘ ''R''}}.
The convention chosen here is such that [[function composition]] (with the usual notation) is obtained as a special case, when ''R'' and ''S'' are [[functional relation]]s. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Kilp, Knauer &amp; Mikhalev, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; prefer to write &lt;math&gt;\circ_l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ_r&lt;/math&gt; explicitly when necessary, depending whether the left or the right relation is the first one applied.

A further variation encountered in computer science is the [[Z notation]]: &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote the traditional (right) composition, but ⨾ &lt;span style="font-size:180%; font-weight: 600;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; (a fat open semicolon with Unicode code point U+2A3E) denotes left composition.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 13568:2002(E), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2a3e/index.htm Unicode character: Z Notation relational composition] from FileFormat.info&lt;/ref&gt; This use of semicolon [[Function_composition#Alternative_notations|coincides]] with the notation for function composition used (mostly by computer scientists) in [[category theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barr &amp; Charles Wells (1998) [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/Barr-Wells-ctcs.pdf Category Theory for Computer Scientists], page 6, from [[McGill University]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the notation for dynamic conjunction within linguistic [[dynamic semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;Rick Nouwen and others (2016) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dynamic-semantics/#EncDynTypLog Dynamic Semantics] §2.2, from [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The semicolon notation (with this semantic) was introduced by [[Ernst Schröder]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="Taylor1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Taylor|title=Practical Foundations of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSCqyNgzamcC&amp;pg=PA24|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63107-5|page=24}} A free HTML version of the book is available at http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/&lt;/ref&gt;

The binary relations &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes regarded as the morphisms &lt;math&gt;R\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; in a [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''[[Category of relations|Rel]]''' which has the sets as objects. In '''Rel''', composition of morphisms is exactly composition of relations as defined above. The category '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' of sets is a subcategory of '''Rel''' that has the same objects but fewer morphisms. A generalization of this is found in the theory of [[allegory (category theory)|allegories]].

==Properties==

* Composition of relations is [[Associative property|associative]]. &lt;math&gt;T \circ ( S  \circ R ) = ( T \circ S) \circ R&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[converse relation]] of  {{nowrap| ''S'' ∘ ''R''}} is {{nowrap|1= (''S'' ∘ ''R'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;  ∘  ''S''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This property makes the set of all binary relations on a set a [[semigroup with involution]].

* The composition of [[partial function|(partial) function]]s (i.e. functional relations) is again a (partial) function.
* If ''R'' and ''S'' are [[injective]], then {{nowrap|''S'' ∘ ''R''}} is injective, which conversely implies only the injectivity of ''R''.
* If ''R'' and ''S'' are [[surjective]], then {{nowrap|''S'' ∘ ''R''}} is surjective, which conversely implies only the surjectivity of ''S''.
* The set of binary relations on a set ''X'' (i.e. relations from ''X'' to ''X'') together with (left or right) relation composition forms a [[monoid]] with zero, where the identity map on ''X'' is the [[neutral element]], and the empty set is the [[Absorbing element|zero element]].

== Composition in terms of matrices ==
Finite homogeneous binary relations are represented by [[logical matrix|logical matrices]]. The entries of these matrices are either zero or one, depending on whether the relation represented is false or true for the row and column corresponding to compared objects. Working with such matrices involves the Boolean arithmetic with 1 + 1 = 1 and 1 × 1 = 1. An entry in the [[matrix product]] of two logical matrices will be 1, then, only if the row and column multiplied have a corresponding 1. Thus the logical matrix of a composition of relations can be found by computing the matrix product of the matrices representing the factors of the composition. "Matrices constitute a method for ''computing'' the conclusions traditionally drawn by means of hypothetical syllogisms and sorites."&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Copilowish]] (December 1948) "Matrix development of the calculus of relations", [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] 13(4): 193–203 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2267134?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor link], quote from page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterogeneous relations==
{{main|Heterogeneous relation}}
Consider a heterogeneous relation ''R'' ⊆ ''A'' × ''B''. Then using composition of relation ''R'' with its [[converse relation|converse]] ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, there are homogeneous relations ''R R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; (on ''A'') and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; ''R'' (on ''B'').

If ∀''x'' ∈ ''A'' ∃''b'' ∈ B ''aRb'' (''R'' is a [[total relation]]), then ∀''x'' ''xRR''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' so that ''R R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[reflexive relation]] or I ⊆ ''R R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; where I is the identity relation {''x''I''x'' : ''x'' ∈ ''A''}. Similarly, if ''R'' is a [[surjective relation]] then 
:''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; ''R'' ⊇ I = {''x''I''x'' : ''x'' ∈ ''B''}. In this case ''R'' ⊆ ''R R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; ''R''. The opposite inclusion occurs for a [[difunctional]] relation.

The composition &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}^T R &lt;/math&gt; is used to distinguish relations of Ferrer's type, which satisfy &lt;math&gt;R \bar{R}^T R = R .&lt;/math&gt;
===Example===
[[File:Tripod_(graph).svg|thumb|right|250px|Composition of ''R'' with ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; produces the relation with this graph, Switzerland connected to the other countries (loops not shown).]]
Let ''A'' = { France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland } and ''B'' = { French, German, Italian } with the relation ''R'' given by ''aRb'' when ''b'' is a [[national language]] of ''a''. The [[logical matrix]] for ''R'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt; Using the [[converse relation]] ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, two questions can be answered: "Is there a translator?" has answer &lt;math&gt;R^T R = B \times B,&lt;/math&gt; the [[universal relation]] on ''B''. The international question, "Does he speak my language?" is answered by &lt;math&gt;R R^T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt; This symmetric matrix, representing a homogeneous relation on ''A'', is associated with the [[star graph]] S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; augmented by a [[loop (graph theory)|loop]] at each node.

==Schröder rules==
For a given set ''V'', the collection of all [[binary relation]]s on ''V'' forms a [[Boolean lattice]] ordered by [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] (⊆). Recall that [[complement (set theory)|complementation]] reverses inclusion:
&lt;math&gt;A \subset B \implies B^{\complement} \subseteq A^{\complement} .&lt;/math&gt; In the [[calculus of relations]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Vaughn Pratt]] [http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ocbr.pdf The Origins of the Calculus of Relations], from [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt; it is common to represent the complement of a set by an overbar: &lt;math&gt;\bar{A} = A^{\complement} .&lt;/math&gt;

If ''S'' is a binary relation, let &lt;math&gt;S^T&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[converse relation]], also called the ''transpose''. Then the Schröder rules are
:&lt;math&gt;QR \subseteq S \quad \equiv \quad Q^T \bar{S} \subseteq \bar{R} \quad \equiv \quad \bar{S} R^T \subseteq \bar{Q} .&lt;/math&gt;
Verbally, one equivalence can be obtained from another: select the first or second factor and transpose it; then complement the other two relations and permute them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunther Schmidt]] &amp; Thomas Ströhlein (1993) ''Relations and Graphs'', pages 15 to 19, [[Springer books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this transformation of an inclusion of a composition of relations was detailed by [[Ernst Schröder]], in fact [[Augustus De Morgan]] first articulated the transformation as Theorem K in 1860.&lt;ref name=DDM&gt; Daniel D. Merrill (1990) ''Augustus De Morgan and the Logic of Relations'', page 121, [[Kluwer Academic]] {{ISBN|9789400920477}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote 
:&lt;math&gt;L M \subseteq N \implies \bar{N} M^T \subseteq \bar{L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan indicated contraries by lower case, conversion as M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and inclusion with )), so his notation was &lt;math&gt;n M^{-1} )) \ l.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With Schröder rules and complementation one can solve for an unknown relation ''X'' in relation inclusions such as 
:&lt;math&gt;R X \subseteq S \quad \text{and} \quad XR \subseteq S .&lt;/math&gt;
For instance, by Schröder rule &lt;math&gt;RX \subseteq S \implies R^T \bar{S} \subseteq \bar{X} ,&lt;/math&gt; and complementation gives &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \overline{R^T \bar{S}},&lt;/math&gt; which is called the '''right residual of S by R''' .

==Quotients==
Just as composition of relations is a type of multiplication resulting in a product, so some compositions compare to division and produce quotients. Three quotients are exhibited here: left residual, right residual, and symmetric quotient. The left residual of two relations is defined presuming that they have the same domain (source), and the right residual presumes the same codomain (range, target). The symmetric quotient presumes two relations share a domain.

'''Definitions:'''
* Left residual: &lt;math&gt;A\backslash B \ =\  \overline{A^T \bar{B} } &lt;/math&gt;
* Right residual: &lt;math&gt;D/C \ =\  \overline{\bar{D} C^T} &lt;/math&gt;
* Symmetric quotient: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{syq} (E, F) = \overline{E^T \bar{F} } \cap \overline{\bar{E}^T F}&lt;/math&gt;

Using Schröder's rules, ''AX'' ⊆ ''B'' is equivalent to ''X'' ⊆ ''A''\''B''. Thus the left residual is the greatest relation satisfying ''AX'' ⊆ ''B''. Similarly, the inclusion ''YC'' ⊆ ''D'' is equivalent to ''Y'' ⊆ ''D''/''C'', and the right residual is the greatest relation satisfying ''YC'' ⊆ ''D''.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Schmidt (2011) ''Relational Mathematics'', pages 43 to 6, Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications, vol. 132, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-521-76268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Join: another form of composition ==
{{main|Join (relational algebra)}}

Other forms of composition of relations, which apply to general ''n''-place relations instead of binary relations, are found in the ''[[Join (relational algebra)|join]]'' operation of [[relational algebra]]. The usual composition of two binary relations as defined here can be obtained by taking their join, leading to a ternary relation, followed by a projection that removes the middle component. For example, in the query language SQL there is the operation [[Join (SQL)]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''continuum structure function (CSF)''' is defined by [[Laurence Baxter]] as a nondecreasing [[map (mathematics)|map]]ping from the unit [[hypercube]] to the unit [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]. It is used by Baxter to help in the [[Mathematical model]]ling of the level of performance of a system in terms of the performance levels of its components.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L A (1984) Continuum structures I., ''Journal of Applied Probability'', 21 (4), pp. 802–815 {{jstor|3213697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L A, (1986), Continuum structures.

He took a second position at the [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] from 1987 to 1993, but retained his appointment at the Hebrew University. From 1998 to 2002, he was chair of the Institute of Computer Science and then Director of the School of Engineering and Computer Science at the Hebrew University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/dd-employment.html Employment history] from Dolev's web site at the Hebrew University, retrieved 2012-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he became the first Israeli on the Scientific Council of the European Research Council.&lt;ref name="jp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8797">'''David Edwin Pingree''' (January 2, 1933, [[New Haven, Connecticut]]&amp;nbsp;– November 11, 2005, [[Providence, Rhode Island]]) was a University Professor, and Professor of History of Mathematics and Classics at [[Brown University]], and one of America's leading historians of the exact sciences in antiquity (primarily [[mathematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/news/inmemoriam.html "In Memoriam"] ''Mathematical Association of America''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts in 1950 and thereafter attended [[Harvard University]], where he earned his doctorate in 1960 with a dissertation on the supposed transmission of [[Hellenistic astrology]] to India under the joint supervision of [[Daniel Henry Holmes Ingalls, Sr.]] and [[Otto Eduard Neugebauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13667|title=David Pingree}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his PhD, Pingree remained at Harvard three more years as a member of its Society of Fellows before moving to the [[University of Chicago]] to accept the position of Research Associate at the Oriental Institute.

He joined the History of Mathematics Department at Brown University in 1971, eventually holding the chair until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilbourhall.org/History%20of%20the%20History%20of%20Math%20Dept.htm "A brief history of the Department ", ''Wilbour Hall'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As successor to [[Otto Neugebauer]] (1899–1990) in Brown's History of Mathematics Department (which Neugebauer established in 1947), Pingree numbered among his colleagues men of extraordinary learning, especially [[Abraham Sachs]] and [[Gerald Toomer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sihspai.umd.edu/home.asp “Remembering David E. Pingree”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904123741/http://www.sihspai.umd.edu/home.asp |date=2006-09-04 }}, Jon McGinnis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/15/histmath&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.umf.maine.edu/~molinsky/cshpm/Bulletin/38-2006.pdf "Memorial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032441/http://faculty.umf.maine.edu/~molinsky/cshpm/Bulletin/38-2006.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''Bulletin of the Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Mathematics'', Toke Lindegaard Knudsen, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
D. Pingree is known for propounding his theory of "unoriginality" of the Indian science of astronomy ([[Jyotisha|jyotiṣa]]), the majority of this science rests, according to his preference, solely on foreign concepts. This theory of unoriginality is highly debated amongst scholars and some of his arguments have been dismissed. K. S. Shukla for example, points out Pingree’s free and incorrect amendations to the manuscript of the Yavanajātaka, which Pingree believed to be highly corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Mak (Kyoto University), ''[https://www.academia.edu/2451483/The_transmission_of_Greek_astral_science_to_India_reconsidered_-_Critical_remarks_on_the_contents_and_the_newly_discovered_manuscript_of_the_Yavanaj%C4%81taka The transmission of Greek astral science to India reconsidered - Critical remarks on the contents and the newly discovered manuscript of the Yavanajātaka]''. Institute for Research in Humanities, 2012.10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jon McGinnis of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, describes Pingree's life-work thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Pingree devoted himself to the study of the exact sciences, such as mathematics, mathematical astronomy and astral omens. He was also acutely interested in the transmission of those sciences across cultural and linguistic boundaries. His interest in the transmission of the exact sciences came from two fronts or, perhaps more correctly, his interest represents two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, he was concerned with how one culture might appropriate, and so alter, the science of another (earlier) culture in order to make that earlier scientific knowledge more accessible to the recipient culture. On the other hand, Pingree was also interested in how scientific texts surviving from a later culture might be used to reconstruct or cast light on our fragmentary records of earlier sciences. In this quest, Pingree would, with equal facility use ancient Greek works to clarify Babylonian texts on divination, turn to Arabic treatises to illuminate early Greek astronomical and astrological texts, seek Sanskrit texts to explain Arabic astronomy, or track the appearance of Indian astronomy in medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jon McGinnis (University of Missouri, St. Louis), ''[http://www.sihspai.umd.edu/Memoriam_David%20E.%20Pingree.html Remembering David E. Pingree]''. The International Society for the History of Arabic/Islamic Science and Philosophy website. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June, 2007 the Brown University Library acquired Pingree's personal collection of scholarly materials. The collection focuses on the study of mathematics and exact sciences in the ancient world, especially India, and the relationship of Eastern mathematics to the development of mathematics and related disciplines in the West.  The collection contains some 22,000 volumes, 700 fascicles, and a number of manuscripts.  The holdings consist of both antiquarian and recent materials published in Sanskrit, Arabic, Hindi, Persian and Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2006-07/06-180.html "Brown University Library Acquires Collection of David E. Pingree"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1975 and a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1981, he was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard, the [[American Philosophical Society]], and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]; he was also A.D. White Professor-at-Large at [[Cornell University]] from 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/web/classics/grbs/FTexts/47/Pingree.pdf "David E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64383">'''Finite-difference time-domain''' or '''Yee's method''' (named after the Chinese American applied mathematician [[Kane S. Yee]], born 1934) is a [[numerical analysis]] technique used for modeling [[computational electrodynamics]] (finding approximate solutions to the associated system of [[differential equation]]s).  Since it is a [[time domain|time-domain]] method, FDTD solutions can cover a wide [[frequency]] range with a single [[computer simulation|simulation]] run, and treat nonlinear material properties in a natural way.

The FDTD method belongs in the general class of [[Discretization|grid]]-based differential numerical modeling methods ([[finite difference methods]]). The time-dependent [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are discretized using [[central difference|central-difference]] approximations to the space and time [[partial derivative]]s. The resulting [[finite difference method|finite-difference]] equations are solved in either software or hardware in a [[leapfrog integration|leapfrog]] manner:  the [[electric field]] [[vector component]]s in a volume of space are solved at a given instant in time; then the [[magnetic field]] vector components in the same spatial volume are solved at the next instant in time; and the process is repeated over and over again until the desired transient or steady-state electromagnetic field behavior is fully evolved.

== History ==
Finite difference schemes for time-dependent [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) have been employed for many years in [[computational fluid dynamics]] problems,&lt;ref name="vonneumann49" /&gt; including the idea of using centered finite difference operators on staggered grids in space and time to achieve second-order accuracy.&lt;ref name="vonneumann49" /&gt;
The novelty of Kane Yee's FDTD scheme, presented in his seminal 1966 paper,&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt; was to apply centered finite difference operators on staggered grids in space and time for each electric and magnetic vector field component in Maxwell's curl equations.
The descriptor "Finite-difference time-domain" and its corresponding "FDTD" acronym were originated by [[Allen Taflove]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="taflove80" /&gt;
Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as primary means to computationally model many scientific and engineering problems dealing with [[electromagnetic wave]] interactions with material structures. Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-[[Direct current|DC]] (ultralow-frequency [[geophysics]] involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwaves]] (radar signature technology, [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to [[visible light]] ([[photonic crystal]]s, nano[[plasmon]]ics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;  In 2006, an estimated 2,000 FDTD-related publications appeared in the science and engineering literature (see [[#Popularity|Popularity]]). As of 2013, there are at least 25 commercial/proprietary FDTD software vendors; 13 free-software/[[Open source|open-source]]-software FDTD projects; and 2 freeware/closed-source FDTD projects, some not for commercial use (see [[#External links|External links]]).

=== Development of FDTD and Maxwell's equations===
An appreciation of the basis, technical development, and possible future of FDTD numerical techniques for Maxwell’s equations can be developed by first considering their history.  The following lists some of the key publications in this area.

== FDTD models and methods ==
When [[Maxwell's differential equations]] are examined, it can be seen that the change in the E-field in time (the time derivative) is dependent on the change in the H-field across space (the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]]).  This results in the basic FDTD time-stepping relation that, at any point in space, the updated value of the E-field in time is dependent on the stored value of the E-field and the numerical curl of the local distribution of the H-field in space.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt;

The H-field is time-stepped in a similar manner. At any point in space, the updated value of the H-field in time is dependent on the stored value of the H-field and the numerical curl of the local distribution of the E-field in space. Iterating the E-field and H-field updates results in a marching-in-time process wherein sampled-data analogs of the continuous electromagnetic waves under consideration propagate in a numerical grid stored in the computer memory.

[[Image:FDTD Yee grid 2d-3d.svg|thumb|right|450px|Illustration of a standard Cartesian Yee cell used for FDTD, about which electric and magnetic field vector components are distributed.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt; Visualized as a cubic [[voxel]], the electric field components form the edges of the cube, and the magnetic field components form the normals to the faces of the cube. A three-dimensional space lattice consists of a multiplicity of such Yee cells. An electromagnetic wave interaction structure is mapped into the space lattice by assigning appropriate values of permittivity to each electric field component, and permeability to each magnetic field component.]]
This description holds true for 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D FDTD techniques. When multiple dimensions are considered, calculating the numerical curl can become complicated. Kane Yee's seminal 1966 paper proposed spatially staggering the vector components of the E-field and H-field about rectangular unit cells of a Cartesian computational grid so that each E-field vector component is located midway between a pair of H-field vector components, and conversely.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt;  This scheme, now known as a '''Yee lattice''', has proven to be very robust, and remains at the core of many current FDTD software constructs.

Furthermore, Yee proposed a leapfrog scheme for marching in time wherein the E-field and H-field updates are staggered so that E-field updates are conducted midway during each time-step between successive H-field updates, and conversely.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt; On the plus side, this explicit time-stepping scheme avoids the need to solve simultaneous equations, and furthermore yields dissipation-free numerical wave propagation. On the minus side, this scheme mandates an upper bound on the time-step to ensure numerical stability.&lt;ref name="taflove75a" /&gt; As a result, certain classes of simulations can require many thousands of time-steps for completion.

=== Using the FDTD method ===
To implement an FDTD solution of Maxwell's equations, a computational domain must first be established. The computational domain is simply the physical region over which the simulation will be performed. The E and H fields are determined at every point in space within that computational domain. The material of each cell within the computational domain must be specified. Typically, the material is either free-space (air), [[metal]], or [[dielectric]].  Any material can be used as long as the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], [[permittivity]], and [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] are specified.

The permittivity of dispersive materials in tabular form cannot be directly substituted into the FDTD scheme.
Instead, it can be approximated using multiple Debye, Drude, Lorentz or critical point terms.
This approximation can be obtained using open fitting programs&lt;ref name="fitting" /&gt; and does not necessarily have physical meaning.

Once the computational domain and the grid materials are established, a source is specified. The source can be current on a wire,  applied electric field or impinging plane wave.
In the last case FDTD can be used to simulate light scattering from arbitrary shaped objects, planar periodic structures at various incident angles,&lt;ref name="obl_it" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obl_sfdtd" /&gt; and photonic band structure of infinite periodic structures.&lt;ref name="TMatrix" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hao" /&gt;

Since the E and H fields are determined directly, the output of the simulation is usually the E or H field at a point or a series of points within the computational domain. The simulation evolves the E and H fields forward in time.

Processing may be done on the E and H fields returned by the simulation. Data processing may also occur while the simulation is ongoing.

While the FDTD technique computes electromagnetic fields within a compact spatial region, scattered and/or radiated far fields can be obtained via near-to-far-field transformations.&lt;ref name="umashankar82" /&gt;

=== Strengths of FDTD modeling ===
Every modeling technique has strengths and weaknesses, and the FDTD method is no different.

* FDTD is a versatile modeling technique used to solve Maxwell's equations. It is intuitive, so users can easily understand how to use it and know what to expect from a given model.
* FDTD is a time-domain technique, and when a broadband pulse (such as a Gaussian pulse) is used as the source, then the response of the system over a wide range of frequencies can be obtained with a single simulation. This is useful in applications where resonant frequencies are not exactly known, or anytime that a broadband result is desired.
* Since FDTD calculates the E and H fields everywhere in the computational domain as they evolve in time, it lends itself to providing animated displays of the electromagnetic field movement through the model. This type of display is useful in understanding what is going on in the model, and to help ensure that the model is working correctly.
* The FDTD technique allows the user to specify the material at all points within the computational domain. A wide variety of linear and nonlinear dielectric and magnetic materials can be naturally and easily modeled.
* FDTD allows the effects of apertures to be determined directly. Shielding effects can be found, and the fields both inside and outside a structure can be found directly or indirectly.
* FDTD uses the E and H fields directly. Since most EMI/EMC modeling applications are interested in the E and H fields, it is convenient that no conversions must be made after the simulation has run to get these values.

=== Weaknesses of FDTD modeling===
* Since FDTD requires that the entire computational domain be gridded, and the grid spatial discretization must be sufficiently fine to resolve both the smallest electromagnetic wavelength and the smallest geometrical feature in the model, very large computational domains can be developed, which results in very long solution times. Models with long, thin features, (like wires) are difficult to model in FDTD because of the excessively large computational domain required. Methods such as [[Eigenmode Expansion]] can offer a more efficient alternative as they do not require a fine grid along the z-direction.&lt;ref name="phot_cad" /&gt;
* There is no way to determine unique values for permittivity and permeability at a material interface.
* Space and time steps must satisfy the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]], or the [[leapfrog integration]] used to solve the partial differential equation is likely to become unstable.
* FDTD finds the E/H fields directly everywhere in the computational domain. If the field values at some distance are desired, it is likely that this distance will force the computational domain to be excessively large. Far-field extensions are available for FDTD, but require some amount of postprocessing.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
* Since FDTD simulations calculate the E and H fields at all points within the computational domain, the computational domain must be finite to permit its residence in the computer memory. In many cases this is achieved by inserting artificial boundaries into the simulation space. Care must be taken to minimize errors introduced by such boundaries. There are a number of available highly effective absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) to simulate an infinite unbounded computational domain.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;  Most modern FDTD implementations instead use a special absorbing "material", called a [[perfectly matched layer]] (PML) to implement absorbing boundaries.&lt;ref name="berenger94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gedney96" /&gt;
* Because FDTD is solved by propagating the fields forward in the time domain, the electromagnetic time response of the medium must be modeled explicitly.  For an arbitrary response, this involves a computationally expensive time convolution, although in most cases the time response of the medium (or [[Dispersion (optics)]]) can be adequately and simply modeled using either the recursive convolution (RC) technique, the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) technique, or the Z-transform technique. An alternative way of solving [[Maxwell's equations]] that can treat arbitrary dispersion easily is the [[Computational electrodynamics#Pseudo-spectral spatial domain .28PSSD.29|Pseudospectral Spatial-Domain method
(PSSD)]], which instead propagates the fields forward in space.

===Grid truncation techniques===
The most commonly used grid truncation techniques for open-region FDTD modeling problems are the Mur absorbing boundary condition (ABC),&lt;ref name="mur81" /&gt; the Liao ABC,&lt;ref name="liao84" /&gt; and various [[perfectly matched layer]] (PML) formulations.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berenger94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gedney96" /&gt; The Mur and Liao techniques are simpler than PML. However, PML (which is technically an absorbing region rather than a boundary condition ''per se'') can provide orders-of-magnitude lower reflections. The PML concept was introduced by J.-P. Berenger in a seminal 1994 paper in the Journal of Computational Physics.&lt;ref name="berenger94" /&gt;  Since 1994, Berenger's original split-field implementation has been modified and extended to the uniaxial PML (UPML), the convolutional PML (CPML), and the higher-order PML. The latter two PML formulations have increased ability to absorb evanescent waves, and therefore can in principle be placed closer to a simulated scattering or radiating structure than Berenger's original formulation.

To reduce undesired numerical reflection from the PML additional back absorbing layers technique can be used.&lt;ref name="back_pml" /&gt;

Notwithstanding both the general increase in academic publication
throughput during the same period and the overall expansion of interest
in all Computational electromagnetics (CEM)  techniques, there are
seven primary reasons for the tremendous expansion of interest in FDTD
computational solution approaches for Maxwell’s equations:

# FDTD uses no linear algebra.  Being a fully explicit computation, FDTD avoids the difficulties with linear algebra that limit the size of frequency-domain integral-equation and finite-element electromagnetics models to generally fewer than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; electromagnetic field unknowns.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt; FDTD models with as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; field unknowns have been run; there is no intrinsic upper bound to this number.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# FDTD is accurate and robust.  The sources of error in FDTD calculations are well understood, and can be bounded to permit accurate models for a very large variety of electromagnetic wave interaction problems.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# FDTD treats impulsive behavior naturally.  Being a time-domain technique, FDTD directly calculates the impulse response of an electromagnetic system.  Therefore, a single FDTD simulation can provide either ultrawideband temporal waveforms or the sinusoidal steady-state response at any frequency within the excitation spectrum.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# FDTD treats nonlinear behavior naturally.  Being a time-domain technique, FDTD directly calculates the nonlinear response of an electromagnetic system.  This allows natural hybriding of FDTD with sets of auxiliary differential equations that describe nonlinearities from either the classical or semi-classical standpoint.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;  One research frontier is the development of hybrid algorithms which join FDTD classical electrodynamics models with phenomena arising from quantum electrodynamics, especially vacuum fluctuations, such as the [[Casimir effect]].&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Johnson, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1007.0966 Numerical methods for computing Casimir interactions]," in Casimir Physics (D. Dalvit, [[P. Milonni]], D. Roberts, and F. da Rosa, eds.), vol. 834 of ''Lecture Notes in Physics'', ch. 6, pp. 175–218, Berlin: Springer, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
# FDTD is a systematic approach. With FDTD, specifying a new structure to be modeled is reduced to a problem of mesh generation rather than the potentially complex reformulation of an integral equation.  For example, FDTD requires no calculation of structure-dependent Green functions.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# Parallel-processing computer architectures have come to dominate supercomputing.  FDTD scales with high efficiency on parallel-processing CPU-based computers, and extremely well on recently developed GPU-based accelerator technology.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# Computer visualization capabilities are increasing rapidly. While this trend positively influences all numerical techniques, it is of particular advantage to FDTD methods, which generate time-marched arrays of field quantities suitable for use in color videos to illustrate the field dynamics.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
 
Taflove has argued that these factors combine to suggest that FDTD will remain one of
the dominant computational electrodynamics techniques (as well as potentially other multiphysics problems).&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;

=== Implementations ===
There are hundreds of simulation tools that implement FDTD algorithms, many optimized to run on parallel-processing clusters.

Frederick Moxley suggests further applications with computational quantum mechanics and simulations.&lt;ref name="Moxleylecture" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12072">In [[abstract algebra]], an [[abelian group]] {{nowrap|(''G'', +)}} is called '''finitely generated''' if there exist finitely many elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''G'' such that every ''x'' in ''G'' can be written in the form
:''x'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;
with [[integer]]s ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, we say that the set {{nowrap|1={''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}{{null}}}} is a ''[[generating set of a group|generating set]]'' of ''G'' or that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; ''generate'' ''G''.

Every finite abelian group is finitely generated. The finitely generated abelian groups can be completely classified.

==Examples==
* The [[integers]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, are a finitely generated abelian group.
* The [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, are a finite (hence finitely generated) abelian group.
* Any [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of finitely many finitely generated abelian groups is again a finitely generated abelian group.
* Every [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] forms a finitely generated [[free abelian group]].

There are no other examples (up to isomorphism). In particular, the group &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},+\right)&lt;/math&gt; of [[rational number]]s is not finitely generated:&lt;ref name="Silverman-Tate-1992"&gt;Silverman &amp; Tate (1992), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=mAJei2-JcE4C|page=102|text=not finitely generated}} p. 102]&lt;/ref&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are rational numbers, pick a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; [[coprime]] to all the denominators; then &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt; cannot be generated by &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;. The group &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q}^*,\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; of non-zero rational numbers is also not finitely generated. The groups of real numbers under addition &lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbb{R},+\right)&lt;/math&gt; and non-zero real numbers under multiplication &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{R}^*,\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; are also not finitely generated.&lt;ref name="Silverman-Tate-1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Harpe (2000), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=60fTzwfqeQIC|page=46|text=The multiplicative group Q}} p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The '''fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups''' can be stated two ways, generalizing the two forms of the [[fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups|fundamental theorem of ''finite'' abelian groups]]. The theorem, in both forms, in turn generalizes to the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]], which in turn admits further generalizations.

===Primary decomposition===
The primary decomposition formulation states that every finitely generated abelian group ''G'' is isomorphic to a [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of [[primary cyclic group]]s and infinite [[cyclic group]]s. A primary cyclic group is one whose [[order of a group|order]] is a power of a [[prime number|prime]]. That is, every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{q_t},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' ≥ 0 is the ''[[Rank of an abelian group|rank]]'', and the numbers ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are powers of (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. In particular, ''G'' is finite if and only if ''n'' = 0.  The values of ''n'', ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are ([[up to]] rearranging the indices) uniquely determined by ''G''.

===Invariant factor decomposition===
We can also write any finitely generated abelian group ''G'' as a direct sum of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_u},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[divisor|divides]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which divides ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on up to ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Again, the rank ''n'' and the ''[[invariant factor]]s'' ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; are uniquely determined by ''G'' (here with a unique order).  The rank and the sequence of invariant factors determine the group up to isomorphism.

===Equivalence===
These statements are equivalent as a result of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], which implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{jk}\simeq \mathbb{Z}_{j} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''j'' and ''k'' are [[coprime]].

===History===
The history and credit for the fundamental theorem is complicated by the fact that it was proven when group theory was not well-established, and thus early forms, while essentially the modern result and proof, are often stated for a specific case. Briefly, an early form of the finite case was proven in {{harv|Gauss|1801}}, the finite case was proven in {{harv|Kronecker|1870}}, and stated in group-theoretic terms in {{harv|Frobenius|Stickelberger|1878}}. The [[Finitely presented group|finitely ''presented'']] case is solved by [[Smith normal form]], and hence frequently credited to {{harv|Smith|1861}},&lt;ref name="fuchs"/&gt; though the finitely ''generated'' case is sometimes instead credited to {{harv|Poincaré|1900}}; details follow.

This generalized an earlier result of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] from ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), which classified quadratic forms; Kronecker cited this result of Gauss's.

Stickelberger, Uber Grubben von vertauschbaren Elementen, J. reine u. angew.

The fundamental theorem for [[Finitely presented group|''finitely presented'']] abelian groups was proven by [[Henry John Stephen Smith]] in {{harv|Smith|1861}},&lt;ref name="fuchs"/&gt; as integer matrices correspond to finite presentations of abelian groups (this generalizes to finitely presented modules over a principal ideal domain), and [[Smith normal form]] corresponds to classifying finitely presented abelian groups. There is the additional technicality of showing that a finitely ''presented'' abelian group is in fact finitely ''generated'', so Smith's classification is not a complete proof for finitely generated abelian groups.

The fundamental theorem for ''finitely generated'' abelian groups was proven by [[Henri Poincaré]] in {{harv|Poincaré|1900}}, using a matrix proof (which generalizes to principal ideal domains). This was done in the context of computing the
[[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of a complex, specifically the [[Betti number]] and [[Torsion coefficient (topology)|torsion coefficient]]s of a dimension of the complex, where the Betti number corresponds to the rank of the free part, and the torsion coefficients correspond to the torsion part.&lt;ref name=stillwell175 /&gt;

Kronecker's proof was generalized to ''finitely generated'' abelian groups by Emmy Noether in {{harv|Noether|1926}}.&lt;ref name=stillwell175 /&gt;

==Corollaries==
Stated differently the fundamental theorem says that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a [[free abelian group]] of finite [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] and a finite abelian group, each of those being unique up to isomorphism. The finite abelian group is just the [[torsion subgroup]] of ''G''. The rank of ''G'' is defined as the rank of the torsion-free part of ''G''; this is just the number ''n'' in the above formulas.

A [[corollary]] to the fundamental theorem is that every finitely generated [[torsion-free abelian group]] is free abelian. The finitely generated condition is essential here: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is torsion-free but not free abelian.

Every [[subgroup]] and [[factor group]] of a finitely generated abelian group is again finitely generated abelian. The finitely generated abelian groups, together with the [[group homomorphism]]s, form an [[abelian category]] which is a [[Subcategory#Types_of_subcategories|Serre subcategory]] of the [[category of abelian groups]].

==Non-finitely generated abelian groups==
Note that not every abelian group of finite rank is finitely generated; the rank 1 group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is one counterexample, and the rank-0 group given by a direct sum of [[infinite set|countably infinitely many]] copies of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is another one.

[[File:Chimpanzee seated at typewriter.jpg|thumb|Given an [[infinity|infinite]] length of time, a [[chimpanzee]] punching at random on a typewriter would [[almost surely]] type out all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays.]]

The '''infinite monkey theorem''' states that a monkey hitting keys at [[randomness|random]] on a typewriter keyboard for an [[infinity|infinite]] amount of time will [[almost surely]] type a given text, such as the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]]. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the [[probability]] that monkeys filling the [[observable universe]] would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]] is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the [[age of the universe]] is ''extremely'' low (but technically not zero).

In this context, "almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the "monkey" is not an actual monkey, but a [[metaphor]] for an abstract device that produces an endless [[random sequence]] of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the "monkey metaphor" is that of French mathematician [[Émile Borel]] in 1913,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the first instance may have been even earlier.

Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the history of this idea from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De natura deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods), through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]], up to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Borel and [[Arthur Eddington]] used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]].

==Solution==

===Direct proof===
There is a straightforward proof of this theorem. As an introduction, recall that if two events are [[statistically independent]], then the probability of both happening equals the product of the probabilities of each one happening independently. For example, if the chance of rain in [[Moscow]] on a particular day in the future is 0.4 and the chance of an [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]] on any particular day is 0.00003, then the chance of both happening on the same day is {{nowrap|1=0.4 × 0.00003 = 0.000012}}, assuming that they are indeed independent.

Suppose the typewriter has 50 keys, and the word to be typed is ''banana''. If the keys are pressed randomly and independently, it means that each key has an equal chance of being pressed. Then, the chance that the first letter typed is 'b' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter typed is ''a'' is also 1/50, and so on. Therefore, the chance of the first six letters spelling ''banana'' is
:(1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) = (1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/15&amp;nbsp;625&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;,
less than one in 15 billion, but not zero, hence a possible outcome.

From the above, the chance of ''not'' typing ''banana'' in a given block of 6 letters is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Because each block is typed independently, the chance ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of not typing ''banana'' in any of the first ''n'' blocks of 6 letters is

:&lt;math&gt;X_n=\left(1-\frac{1}{50^6}\right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n'' grows, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; gets smaller. For an ''n'' of a million, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.9999, but for an ''n'' of 10 billion ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.53 and for an ''n'' of 100 billion it is roughly 0.0017. As ''n'' approaches infinity, the probability ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[limit of a function|approaches]] zero; that is, by making ''n'' large enough, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be made as small as is desired,&lt;ref name="Isaac1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaac |first=Richard E. |title=The Pleasures of Probability |year=1995 |publisher=Springer | isbn = 0-387-94415-X |pages=48–50}} Isaac generalizes this argument immediately to variable text and alphabet size; the common main conclusion is on p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This shows that the probability of typing "banana" in one of the predefined non-overlapping blocks of six letters tends to 1. In addition the word may appear across two blocks, so the estimate given is conservative.&lt;/ref&gt; and the chance of typing ''banana'' approaches 100%.

The same argument shows why at least one of infinitely many monkeys will produce a text as quickly as it would be produced by a perfectly accurate human typist copying it from the original. In this case ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the probability that none of the first ''n'' monkeys types ''banana'' correctly on their first try. When we consider 100 billion monkeys, the probability falls to 0.17%, and as the number of monkeys ''n'' increases, the value of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; – the probability of the monkeys failing to reproduce the given text – approaches zero arbitrarily closely. The limit, for ''n'' going to infinity, is zero.  So the probability of the word ''banana'' appearing at some point in an infinite sequence of keystrokes is equal to one.

====Infinite strings====
This can be stated more generally and compactly in terms of [[string (computer science)|strings]], which are sequences of characters chosen from some finite alphabet:
* Given an infinite string where each character is chosen [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]], any given finite string almost surely occurs as a [[substring]] at some position.
* Given an infinite sequence of infinite strings, where each character of each string is chosen uniformly at random, any given finite string almost surely occurs as a prefix of one of these strings.

Both follow easily from the second [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]. For the second theorem, let ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[event (probability theory)|event]] that the ''k''th string begins with the given text. Because this has some fixed nonzero probability ''p'' of occurring, the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent, and the below sum diverges,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty P(E_k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
the probability that infinitely many of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; occur is 1. The first theorem is shown similarly; one can divide the random string into nonoverlapping blocks matching the size of the desired text, and make ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; the event where the ''k''th block equals the desired string.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The first theorem is proven by a similar if more indirect route in {{cite book |last=Gut |first=Allan |title=Probability: A Graduate Course |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-22833-0 |pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probabilities===
However, for physically meaningful numbers of monkeys typing for physically meaningful lengths of time the results are reversed. If there were as many monkeys as there are atoms in the observable universe typing extremely fast for trillions of times the life of the universe, the probability of the monkeys replicating even a ''single page'' of Shakespeare is unfathomably small.

Ignoring punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, a monkey typing letters uniformly at random has a chance of one in 26 of correctly typing the first letter of ''[[Hamlet]].'' It has a chance of one in 676 (26&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;26) of typing the first two letters. Because the probability shrinks [[exponential growth|exponentially]], at 20 letters it already has only a chance of one in 26&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; = 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376 (almost 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;). In the case of the entire text of ''Hamlet'', the probabilities are so vanishingly small as to be inconceivable. The text of Hamlet contains approximately 130,000 letters.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Using the Hamlet text [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/1ws2611.txt from gutenberg], there are 132680 alphabetical letters and 199749 characters overall&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a probability of one in 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; to get the text right at the first trial. The average number of letters that needs to be typed until the text appears is also 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

For any required string of 130,000 letters from the set a-z, the average number of letters that needs to be typed until the string appears is (rounded) 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;, except in the case that all letters of the required string are equal, in which case the value is about 4% more, 3.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;. In that case failure to have the correct string starting from a particular position reduces with about 4% the probability of a correct string starting from the next position (i.e., for overlapping positions the events of having the correct string are not independent; in this case there is a positive correlation between the two successes, so the chance of success after a failure is smaller than the chance of success in general). The figure 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; is derived from ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;26&lt;sup&gt;130000&lt;/sup&gt; by taking the logarithm of both sides: log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = 1300000×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(26) =&amp;nbsp;183946.5352, therefore ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;0.5352&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183946&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;3.429&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183946&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; or including punctuation, 4.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;26 letters ×2 for capitalisation, 12 for punctuation characters = 64, 199749×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(64) =&amp;nbsp;4.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt; (this is generous as it assumes capital letters are separate keys, as opposed to a key combination, which makes the problem vastly harder).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if every proton in the observable universe were a monkey with a typewriter, typing from the [[Big Bang]] until the [[end of the universe]] (when protons [[Proton decay|might no longer exist]]), they would still need a still far greater amount of time – more than three hundred and sixty thousand ''orders of magnitude'' longer – to have even a 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt; chance of success. To put it another way, for a one in a trillion chance of success, there would need to be 10&lt;sup&gt;360,641&lt;/sup&gt; universes made of atomic monkeys.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

There are ~10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; protons in the observable universe. Assume the monkeys write for 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; years (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years is when [[Future of an expanding universe#Stellar remnants escape galaxies or fall into black holes|all stellar remnants will have either been ejected from their galaxies or fallen into black holes]], 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; years is when all but 0.1% of [[Future of an expanding universe#All nucleons decay|protons have decayed]]). Assuming the monkeys type non-stop at a ridiculous 400 [[words per minute]] (the world record is 216wpm for a single minute), that's about 2000 characters per minute (Shakespeare's average word length is a bit under 5 letters). There are about half a million minutes in a year, this means each monkey types half a billion characters per year. This gives a total of 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt; letters typed – which is still zero in comparison to 10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;. For a one in a trillion chance, multiply the letters typed by a trillion: 10&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;. 10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;360,641&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Charles Kittel|Kittel]] and [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] put it in their textbook on [[thermodynamics]], the field whose statistical foundations motivated the first known expositions of typing monkeys,&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman Company | year=1980 | isbn=0-7167-1088-9 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The probability of ''Hamlet'' is therefore zero in any operational sense of an event...", and the statement that the monkeys must eventually succeed "gives a misleading conclusion about very, very large numbers."

In fact there is less than a one in a trillion chance of success that such a universe made of monkeys could type any particular document a mere 79 characters long.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As explained at {{cite web |url=http://www.nutters.org/docs/more-monkeys |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016011846/http://www.nutters.org/docs/more-monkeys |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}, the problem can be approximated further. 10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(64)=78.9 characters.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Almost surely===
{{Main|Almost surely}}

The probability that an infinite randomly generated string of text will contain a particular finite substring is&amp;nbsp;1. However, this does not mean the substring's absence is "impossible", despite the absence having a prior probability of 0. For example, the immortal monkey ''could'' randomly type G as its first letter, G as its second, and G as every single letter thereafter, producing an infinite string of Gs; at no point must the monkey be "compelled" to type anything else. (To assume otherwise implies the [[gambler's fallacy]].) However long a randomly generated finite string is, there is a small but nonzero chance that it will turn out to consist of the same character repeated throughout; this chance approaches zero as the string's length approaches infinity. There is nothing special about such a monotonous sequence except that it is easy to describe; the same fact applies to any nameable specific sequence, such as "RGRGRG" repeated forever, or "a-b-aa-bb-aaa-bbb-...", or "Three, Six, Nine, Twelve…".

If the hypothetical monkey has a typewriter with 90 equally likely keys that include numerals and punctuation, then the first typed keys might be "3.14" (the first three [[digits of pi]]) with a probability of (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 1/65,610,000. Equally probable is any other string of four characters allowed by the typewriter, such as "GGGG", "mATh", or "q%8e". The probability that 100 randomly typed keys will consist of the first 99 digits of pi (including the separator key), or any other ''particular'' sequence of that length, is much lower: (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;. If the monkey's allotted length of text is infinite, the chance of typing only the digits of pi is 0, which is just as ''possible'' (mathematically probable) as typing nothing but Gs (also probability 0).

The same applies to the event of typing a particular version of ''Hamlet'' followed by endless copies of itself; or ''Hamlet'' immediately followed by all the digits of pi; these specific strings are [[infinite set|equally infinite]] in length, they are not prohibited by the terms of the thought problem, and they each have a prior probability of 0. In fact, ''any'' particular infinite sequence the immortal monkey types will have ''had'' a prior probability of 0, even though the monkey must type something.

This is an extension of the principle that a finite string of random text has a lower and lower probability of ''being'' a particular string the longer it is (though all specific strings are equally unlikely). This probability approaches 0 as the string approaches infinity. Thus, the probability of the monkey typing an endlessly long string, such as all of the digits of pi in order, on a 90-key keyboard is (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; which equals (1/∞) which is essentially 0. At the same time, the probability that the sequence ''contains'' a particular subsequence (such as the word MONKEY, or the 12th through 999th digits of pi, or a version of the King James Bible) increases as the total string increases. This probability approaches 1 as the total string approaches infinity, and thus the original theorem is correct.

===Correspondence between strings and numbers===
In a simplification of the thought experiment, the monkey could have a typewriter with just two keys: 1 and 0. The infinitely long string thusly produced would correspond to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] digits of a particular [[real number]] between 0 and 1. A countably infinite set of possible strings end in infinite repetitions, which means the corresponding real number is [[rational number|rational]]. Examples include the strings corresponding to one-third (010101…), five-sixths (11010101…) and five-eighths (1010000…).  Only a subset of such real number strings (albeit a countably infinite subset) contains the entirety of ''Hamlet'' (assuming that the text is subjected to a numerical encoding, such as [[ASCII]]).

Meanwhile, there is an ''[[uncountably]]'' infinite set of strings which do not end in such repetition; these correspond to the [[irrational numbers]]. These can be sorted into two uncountably infinite subsets: those which contain ''Hamlet'' and those which do not. However, the "largest" subset of all the real numbers are those which not only contain ''Hamlet'', but which contain every other possible string of any length, and with equal distribution of such strings. These irrational numbers are called [[normal number|normal]]. Because almost all numbers are normal, almost all possible strings contain all possible finite substrings. Hence, the probability of the monkey typing a normal number is 1. The same principles apply regardless of the number of keys from which the monkey can choose; a 90-key keyboard can be seen as a generator of numbers written in base 90.

==History==

===Statistical mechanics===
In one of the forms in which probabilists now know this theorem, with its "dactylographic" [i.e., typewriting] monkeys ({{lang-fr|singes dactylographes}}; the French word ''singe'' covers both the monkeys and the apes), appeared in [[Émile Borel]]'s 1913 article "''Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité''" (''[[Statistical mechanics]] and irreversibility''),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Émile Borel | title=Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité | journal=J. Phys. (Paris) |series=Series 5 | volume=3 | year=1913 | pages=189–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book "Le Hasard" in 1914. His "monkeys" are not actual monkeys; rather, they are a metaphor for an imaginary way to produce a large, random sequence of letters. Borel said that if a million monkeys typed ten hours a day, it was extremely unlikely that their output would exactly equal all the books of the richest libraries of the world; and yet, in comparison, it was even more unlikely that the laws of statistical mechanics would ever be violated, even briefly.

The physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] drew on Borel's image further in ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928), writing:

These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events. Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.&lt;ref name="KK" /&gt;  It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.

===Origins and "The Total Library"===
In a 1939 essay entitled "The Total Library", Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the infinite-monkey concept back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics.'' Explaining the views of [[Leucippus]], who held that the world arose through the random combination of atoms, Aristotle notes that the atoms themselves are homogeneous and their possible arrangements only differ in shape, position and ordering. In ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', the Greek philosopher compares this to the way that a tragedy and a comedy consist of the same "atoms", ''i.e.'', alphabetic characters.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Περὶ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς'' (''On Generation and Corruption''), 315b14.&lt;/ref&gt; Three centuries later, [[Cicero]]'s ''De natura deorum'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'') argued against the atomist worldview:

{{quote|He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the ''Annals'' of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tullius Cicero, ''De natura deorum'', 2.37. Translation from ''Cicero's Tusculan Disputations; Also, Treatises On The Nature Of The Gods, And On The Commonwealth'', C. D. Yonge, principal translator, New York, Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, Franklin Square. (1877). [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988 Downloadable text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges follows the history of this argument through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]],&lt;ref&gt;The English translation of "The Total Library" lists the title of Swift's essay as "Trivial Essay on the Faculties of the Soul."  The appropriate reference is, instead: Swift, Jonathan, Temple Scott et al. "A Tritical Essay upon the Faculties of the Mind." The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, Volume 1. London: G. Bell, 1897, pp. 291-296. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FctEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Prose+Works+of+Jonathan+Swift&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JdyDTb-yM8u3tweNmcy8BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; then observes that in his own time, the vocabulary had changed. By 1939, the idiom was "that a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum." (To which Borges adds, "Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice.") Borges then imagines the contents of the Total Library which this enterprise would produce if carried to its fullest extreme:

{{quote|Everything would be in its blind volumes. Everything: the detailed history of the future, [[Aeschylus]]' ''The Egyptians'', the exact number of times that the waters of the Ganges have reflected the flight of a falcon, the secret and true nature of Rome, the encyclopedia Novalis would have constructed, my dreams and half-dreams at dawn on August 14, 1934, the proof of [[Pierre Fermat]]'s [[Fermat's last theorem|theorem]], the unwritten chapters of ''[[Edwin Drood]]'', those same chapters translated into the language spoken by the [[Garamantes]], the paradoxes Berkeley invented concerning Time but didn't publish, Urizen's books of iron, the premature epiphanies of [[Stephen Dedalus]], which would be meaningless before a cycle of a thousand years, the Gnostic [[Gospel of Basilides]], the song the sirens sang, the complete catalog of the Library, the proof of the inaccuracy of that catalog. Everything: but for every sensible line or accurate fact there would be millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings. Everything: but all the generations of mankind could pass before the dizzying shelves—shelves that obliterate the day and on which chaos lies—ever reward them with a tolerable page.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges, Jorge Luis]]. "''La biblioteca total''" (The Total Library), ''Sur'' No. 59, August 1939. Trans. by [[Eliot Weinberger]]. In ''Selected Non-Fictions'' (Penguin: 1999), {{isbn|0-670-84947-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges' total library concept was the main theme of his widely read 1941 short story "[[The Library of Babel]]", which describes an unimaginably vast library consisting of interlocking hexagonal chambers, together containing every possible volume that could be composed from the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation characters.

==Real monkeys==
In 2003, lecturers and students from the [[University of Plymouth]] MediaLab Arts course used a £2,000 grant from the [[Arts Council]] to study the literary output of real monkeys. They left a computer keyboard in the enclosure of six [[Celebes crested macaque]]s in [[Paignton Zoo]] in [[Devon]] in [[England]] for a month, with a radio link to broadcast the results on a website.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news | title= No words to describe monkeys' play | date= 2003-05-09 | publisher= BBC News | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3013959.stm | accessdate = 2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the monkeys produce nothing but five total pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare | url= http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = vivaria.net | year= 2002 | accessdate = 2014-07-11 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130120215600/http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf | archivedate = 2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely consisting of the letter S, the lead male began bashing the keyboard with a stone, and the monkeys followed by soiling it. [http://i-dat.org/mike-phillips/ Mike Phillips], director of the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technology (i-DAT), said that the artist-funded project was primarily performance art, and they had learned "an awful lot" from it. He concluded that monkeys "are not random generators. They're more complex than that. ... They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there."&lt;ref name="BBC News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Associated2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58790,00.html |title=Monkeys Don't Write Shakespeare |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Wired News |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2007-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040201230858/http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0%2C1284%2C58790%2C00.html |archivedate=2004-02-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and criticisms==

===Evolution===
[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley - Project Gutenberg eText 16935.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Huxley]] is sometimes misattributed with proposing a variant of the theory in his debates with [[Samuel Wilberforce]].]]
In his 1931 book ''The Mysterious Universe'', Eddington's rival [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]] attributed the monkey parable to a "Huxley", presumably meaning [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. This attribution is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Padmanabhan2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thanu |last=Padmanabhan |title=The dark side of astronomy |journal=Nature |volume=435 |pages=20–21 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/435020a |issue=7038|bibcode=2005Natur.435...20P }} {{cite book |author=Platt, Suzy; Library of Congress Congressional Research Service |title=Respectfully quoted: a dictionary of quotations |year=1993 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=0-88029-768-9|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is sometimes further reported that Huxley applied the example in a [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|now-legendary debate]] over [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' with the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, held at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at Oxford on 30 June 1860. This story suffers not only from a lack of evidence, but the fact that in 1860 the typewriter itself had yet to emerge.&lt;ref name="Rescher2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Rescher |title=Studies in the Philosophy of Science |year=2006 |publisher=ontos verlag |isbn=3-938793-20-1 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the original mix-up, monkey-and-typewriter arguments are now common in arguments over evolution. For example, Doug Powell argues as a [[Christian apologist]] that even if a monkey accidentally types the letters of ''Hamlet'', it has failed to produce ''Hamlet'' because it lacked the intention to communicate. His parallel implication is that natural laws could not produce the information content in [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="Powell2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Doug |title=Holman Quicksource Guide to Christian Apologetics |year=2006 |publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman | isbn = 0-8054-9460-X |pages=60, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more common argument is represented by Reverend [[John F. MacArthur]], who claims that the genetic mutations necessary to produce a tapeworm from an amoeba are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamlet's soliloquy, and hence the odds against the evolution of all life are impossible to overcome.&lt;ref name="MacArthur2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=MacArthur |title=Think Biblically!: Recovering a Christian Worldview |year=2003 |publisher=Crossway Books |isbn=1-58134-412-0 |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] employs the typing monkey concept in his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to demonstrate the ability of [[natural selection]] to produce biological [[complexity]] out of random [[mutation]]s. In a simulation experiment Dawkins has his [[weasel program]] produce the Hamlet phrase ''METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL'', starting from a randomly typed parent, by "breeding" subsequent generations and always choosing the closest match from progeny that are copies of the parent, with random mutations. The chance of the target phrase appearing in a single step is extremely small, yet Dawkins showed that it could be produced rapidly (in about 40 generations) using cumulative selection of phrases.  The random choices furnish raw material, while cumulative selection imparts information.  As Dawkins acknowledges, however, the weasel program is an imperfect analogy for evolution, as "offspring" phrases were selected "according to the criterion of resemblance to a ''distant ideal'' target."  In contrast, Dawkins affirms, evolution has no long-term plans and does not progress toward some distant goal (such as humans).  The weasel program is instead meant to illustrate the difference between [[non-random]] cumulative selection, and [[random]] single-step selection.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=1996 |title=The Blind Watchmaker |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=0-393-31570-3  |pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the typing monkey analogy, this means that ''Romeo and Juliet'' could be produced relatively quickly if placed under the constraints of a nonrandom, Darwinian-type selection because the [[fitness function]] will tend to preserve in place any letters that happen to match the target text, improving each successive generation of typing monkeys.

A different avenue for exploring the analogy between evolution and an unconstrained monkey lies in the problem that the monkey types only one letter at a time, independently of the other letters. Hugh Petrie argues that a more sophisticated setup is required, in his case not for biological evolution but the evolution of ideas:

{{quote|In order to get the proper analogy, we would have to equip the monkey with a more complex typewriter. It would have to include whole Elizabethan sentences and thoughts. It would have to include Elizabethan beliefs about human action patterns and the causes, Elizabethan morality and science, and linguistic patterns for expressing these. It would probably even have to include an account of the sorts of experiences which shaped Shakespeare's belief structure as a particular example of an Elizabethan. Then, perhaps, we might allow the monkey to play with such a typewriter and produce variants, but the impossibility of obtaining a Shakespearean play is no longer obvious. What is varied really does encapsulate a great deal of already-achieved knowledge.&lt;ref name="Blachowicz1998"&gt;As quoted in {{cite book |first=James |last=Blachowicz |title=Of Two Minds: Nature of Inquiry |year=1998 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-3641-1 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[James W. Valentine]], while admitting that the classic monkey's task is impossible, finds that there is a worthwhile analogy between written English and the [[metazoa]]n genome in this other sense: both have "combinatorial, hierarchical structures" that greatly constrain the immense number of combinations at the alphabet level.&lt;ref name="Valentine2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Valentine |title=On the Origin of Phyla |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-84548-6 |pages=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
[[R. G. Collingwood]] argued in 1938 that art cannot be produced by accident, and wrote as a sarcastic aside to his critics,

{{quote|...some ... have denied this proposition, pointing out that if a monkey played with a typewriter ... he would produce ... the complete text of Shakespeare. Any reader who has nothing to do can amuse himself by calculating how long it would take for the probability to be worth betting on. But the interest of the suggestion lies in the revelation of the mental state of a person who can identify the 'works' of Shakespeare with the series of letters printed on the pages of a book...&lt;ref name="Sclafani1975"&gt;p.126 of ''The Principles of Art'', as summarized and quoted by {{cite journal |first=Richard J. |last=Sclafani |title=The logical primitiveness of the concept of a work of art |journal=British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1975 |volume=15 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/15.1.14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nelson Goodman]] took the contrary position, illustrating his point along with Catherine Elgin by the example of Borges' "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]",

{{quote|What Menard wrote is simply another inscription of the text. Any of us can do the same, as can printing presses and photocopiers. Indeed, we are told, if infinitely many monkeys ... one would eventually produce a replica of the text. That replica, we maintain, would be as much an instance of the work, ''Don Quixote'', as Cervantes' manuscript, Menard's manuscript, and each copy of the book that ever has been or will be printed.&lt;ref name="John2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=John, Eileen and Dominic Lopes, editors |title=The Philosophy of Literature: Contemporary and Classic Readings: An Anthology |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-1208-5 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another writing, Goodman elaborates, "That the monkey may be supposed to have produced his copy randomly makes no difference. It is the same text, and it is open to all the same interpretations...." [[Gérard Genette]] dismisses Goodman's argument as [[begging the question]].&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gérard |last= Genette |title=The Work of Art: Immanence and Transcendence |year=1997 |publisher=Cornell UP |isbn=0-8014-8272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jorge J. E. Gracia]], the question of the identity of texts leads to a different question, that of author. If a monkey is capable of typing ''Hamlet'', despite having no intention of meaning and therefore disqualifying itself as an author, then it appears that texts do not require authors. Possible solutions include saying that whoever finds the text and identifies it as ''Hamlet'' is the author; or that Shakespeare is the author, the monkey his agent, and the finder merely a user of the text. These solutions have their own difficulties, in that the text appears to have a meaning separate from the other agents: what if the monkey operates before Shakespeare is born, or if Shakespeare is never born, or if no one ever finds the monkey's typescript?&lt;ref name="Gracia1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gracia |first=Jorge |title=Texts: Ontological Status, Identity, Author, Audience |year=1996 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-2901-6 |pages=1–2, 122–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random document generation===
The theorem concerns a [[thought experiment]] which cannot be fully carried out in practice, since it is predicted to require prohibitive amounts of time and resources. Nonetheless, it has inspired efforts in finite random text generation.

One computer program run by Dan Oliver of Scottsdale, Arizona, according to an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', came up with a result on August 4, 2004: After the group had worked for 42,162,500,000 billion billion monkey-years, one of the "monkeys" typed, "&lt;tt&gt;VALENTINE. Cease toIdor:eFLP0FRjWK78aXzVOwm)-‘;8.t&lt;/tt&gt;" The first 19 letters of this sequence can be found in "The Two Gentlemen of Verona". Other teams have reproduced 18 characters from "Timon of Athens", 17 from "Troilus and Cressida", and 16 from "Richard II".&lt;ref name="ja"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/09/070409crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all Newyorker.com] Acocella, Joan "The Typing Life: How writers used to write" ''[[The New Yorker]]'' April 9, 2007, a review of ''The Iron Whim: A Fragmented History of Typewriting'' (Cornell) 2007, by Darren Wershler-Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

A website entitled ''The Monkey Shakespeare Simulator'', launched on July 1, 2003, contained a [[Java applet]] that simulated a large population of monkeys typing randomly, with the stated intention of seeing how long it takes the virtual monkeys to produce a complete Shakespearean play from beginning to end. For example, it produced this partial line from ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', reporting that it took "2,737,850 million billion billion billion monkey-years" to reach 24 matching characters:
:&lt;tt&gt;RUMOUR. Open your ears; 9r"5j5&amp;?OWTY Z0d&lt;/tt&gt;...''

Due to processing power limitations, the program used a probabilistic model (by using a [[random number generator]] or RNG) instead of actually generating random text and comparing it to Shakespeare. When the simulator "detected a match" (that is, the RNG generated a certain value or a value within a certain range), the simulator simulated the match by generating matched text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5809583/the-story-of-the-monkey-shakespeare-simulator-project |title=The story of the Monkey Shakespeare Simulator Project |last1=Inglis-Arkell |first1=Esther |date=June 9, 2011 |website=io9 |publisher=gizmodo |access-date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More sophisticated methods are used in practice for [[natural language generation]]. If instead of simply generating random characters one restricts the generator to a meaningful vocabulary and conservatively following grammar rules, like using a [[context-free grammar]], then a random document generated this way can even fool some humans (at least on a cursory reading) as shown in the experiments with [[SCIgen]], [[snarXiv]], and the [[Postmodernism Generator]].

===Testing of random-number generators===
{{main|Diehard tests}}
Questions about the statistics describing how often an ideal monkey is [[expected value|expected]] to type certain strings translate into [[Randomness tests|practical tests for random-number generators]]; these range from the simple to the "quite sophisticated". Computer-science professors [[George Marsaglia]] and [[Arif Zaman]] report that they used to call one such category of tests "overlapping m-[[tuple]] tests" in lectures, since they concern overlapping m-tuples of successive elements in a random sequence. But they found that calling them "monkey tests" helped to motivate the idea with students. They published a report on the class of tests and their results for various RNGs in 1993.&lt;ref name="Marsaglia1993"&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Infinite monkey theorem in popular culture}}
The infinite monkey theorem and its associated imagery is considered a popular and proverbial illustration of the mathematics of probability, widely known to the general public because of its transmission through popular culture rather than through formal education.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Examples of the theorem being referred to as proverbial include: Why Creativity Is Not like the Proverbial Typing Monkey. Jonathan W. Schooler, Sonya Dougal, ''Psychological Inquiry'', Vol. 10, No. 4 (1999); and ''The Case of the Midwife Toad'' ([[Arthur Koestler]], New York, 1972, page 30): ''"Neo-Darwinism does indeed carry the nineteenth-century brand of materialism to its extreme limits—to the proverbial monkey at the typewriter, hitting by pure chance on the proper keys to produce a Shakespeare sonnet."'' The latter is sourced from [http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html Parable of the Monkeys], a collection of historical references to the theorem in various formats.&lt;/ref&gt; This is helped by the innate humor stemming from the image of literal monkeys rattling away on a set of typewriters, and is a popular visual gag.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Last Exit to Springfield]]", [[Mr. Burns]] shows [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] "a room with a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters. Soon they will have written the greatest novel known to man!" Burns then chastises one monkey for typing, "[[It was the best of times, it was the worst of times|It was the best of times, it was the ''blurst'' of times]]!".

In his 1978 radio play, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', [[Douglas Adams]] invoked the theorem to illustrate the power of the 'Infinite Improbability Drive' that powered a spaceship. From Episode 2: "[[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford]], there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for [[Hamlet (play)|Hamlet]] they've worked out."

A quotation attributed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Wilensky, speech at a 1996 conference |url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27695.html |title=Quote Details: Robert Wilensky: We've heard that a... |publisher=The Quotations Page |date= |accessdate=2012-01-18}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a 1996 speech by Robert Wilensky stated, "We've heard that a million monkeys at a million keyboards could produce the complete works of Shakespeare; now, thanks to the Internet, we know that is not true."

The enduring, widespread popularity of the theorem was noted in the introduction to a 2001 paper, "Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks: The Internet in the Light of the Theory of Accidental Excellence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://skylla.wz-berlin.de/pdf/2002/ii02-101.pdf Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513012236/http://skylla.wz-berlin.de/pdf/2002/ii02-101.pdf |date=2008-05-13 }}, Ute Hoffmann &amp; Jeanette Hofmann, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung gGmbH (WZB), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Plenty of people have had fun with the famous notion that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time could eventually write the works of Shakespeare".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Ringle, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28521-2002Oct27?language=printer "Hello? This is Bob"], ''Washington Post'', 28 October 2002, page C01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the previously mentioned [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] funded experiment involving real monkeys and a computer keyboard received widespread press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/documentation/press/ Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare] – some press clippings.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the theorem was listed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in a list of eight classic [[thought experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greta Lorge, [https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-06/st_best "The Best Thought Experiments: Schrödinger's Cat, Borel's Monkeys"], ''Wired'' Issue 15.06, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], an '''inscribed''' [[plane (geometry)|planar]] [[shape]] or [[solid (geometry)|solid]] is one that is enclosed by and "fits snugly" inside another geometric shape or solid. To say that "figure F is inscribed in figure G" means precisely the same thing as "figure G is circumscribed about figure F". A circle or ellipse inscribed in a convex polygon (or a sphere or ellipsoid inscribed in a convex [[polyhedron]]) is tangent to every side or face of the outer figure (but see [[Inscribed sphere]] for semantic variants). A polygon inscribed in a circle, ellipse, or polygon (or a polyhedron inscribed in a sphere, ellipsoid, or polyhedron) has each vertex on the outer figure; if the outer figure is a polygon or polyhedron, there must be a vertex of the inscribed polygon or polyhedron on each side of the outer figure. An inscribed figure is not necessarily unique in orientation; this can easily be seen, for example, when the given outer figure is a circle, in which case a rotation of an inscribed figure gives another inscribed figure that is congruent to the original one.

Familiar examples of inscribed figures include [[circle]]s inscribed in [[triangle]]s or [[regular polygon]]s, and triangles or regular polygons inscribed in circles. A circle inscribed in any polygon is called its [[incircle]], in which case the polygon is said to be a [[tangential polygon]]. A polygon inscribed in a circle is said to be a [[cyclic polygon]], and the circle is said to be its circumscribed circle or [[circumcircle]].

The '''inradius''' or [[filling radius]] of a given outer figure is the [[radius]] of the inscribed circle or sphere, if it exists.

The definition given above assumes that the objects concerned are embedded in two- or three-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]], but can easily be generalized to higher dimensions and other [[metric space]]s.

For an alternative usage of the term "inscribed", see the [[inscribed square problem]], in which a square is considered to be inscribed in another figure (even a non-[[Convex shape|convex]] one) if all four of its vertices are on that figure.

==Properties==

*Every circle has an inscribed triangle with any three given [[angle]] measures (summing of course to 180°), and every triangle can be inscribed in some circle (which is called its [[circumscribed circle]] or circumcircle).
*Every triangle has an inscribed circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]].
*Every circle has an inscribed regular polygon of ''n'' sides, for any ''n''≥3, and every regular polygon can be inscribed in some circle (called its circumcircle).
*Every regular polygon has an inscribed circle (called its incircle), and every circle can be inscribed in some regular polygon of ''n'' sides, for any ''n''≥3.
*Not every polygon with more than three sides has an inscribed circle; those polygons that do are called [[tangential polygon]]s. Not every polygon with more than three sides is an inscribed polygon of a circle; those polygons that are so inscribed are called [[cyclic polygon]]s.
*Every triangle can be inscribed in an ellipse, called its [[Steiner circumellipse]] or simply its Steiner ellipse, whose center is the triangle's [[centroid]].
*Every non-equilateral triangle has an infinitude of inscribed [[ellipse]]s. One of them is a circle, and one of them is the [[Steiner inellipse]] which is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of the sides.
*Every acute triangle has [[Triangle#Figures inscribed in a triangle|three inscribed squares]]. In a right triangle two of them are merged and coincide with each other, so there are only two distinct inscribed squares. An obtuse triangle has a single inscribed square, with one side coinciding with part of the triangle's longest side.
*A [[Reuleaux triangle]], or more generally any [[curve of constant width]], can be inscribed with any [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] inside a square of the appropriate size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5142">In [[statistics]], the '''jackknife''' is a [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] technique especially useful for [[variance]] and [[Bias of an estimator|bias]] estimation. The jackknife predates other common resampling methods such as the [[bootstrap (statistics)|bootstrap]]. The jackknife [[estimator]] of a parameter is found by systematically leaving out each observation from a dataset and calculating the estimate and then finding the average of these calculations. Given a sample of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the jackknife estimate is found by aggregating the estimates of each &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-sized sub-sample.

The jackknife technique was developed by [[Maurice Quenouille]] (1924-1973) from 1949, and refined in 1956. [[John Tukey]] expanded on the technique in 1958 and proposed the name "jackknife" since, like a physical [[:wikt:jack-knife|jack-knife]] (a compact folding knife), it is a [[:wikt:rough-and-ready|rough-and-ready]] tool that can improvise a solution for a variety of problems even though specific problems may be more efficiently solved with a purpose-designed tool.{{sfn|Cameron|Trivedi|2005|p=375}}

The jackknife is a linear approximation of the bootstrap.{{sfn|Cameron|Trivedi|2005|p=375}}

==Estimation==
The jackknife estimate of a parameter can be found by estimating the parameter for each subsample omitting the ''i''-th observation.{{sfn|Efron|1982|p=2}} For example, if the parameter to be estimated is the population mean of ''x'', we compute the mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; for each subsample consisting of all but the ''i''-th data point:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_i =\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j=1,j\ne i}^n x_j, \quad \quad i=1, \dots ,n.&lt;/math&gt;

These ''n'' estimates form an estimate of the distribution of the sample statistic if it were computed over a large number of samples. In particular, the mean of this sampling distribution is the average of these ''n'' estimates:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \bar{x}_i.&lt;/math&gt;

A jackknife estimate of the variance of the estimator can be calculated from the variance of this distribution of &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_i:&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Efron|1982|p=14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McIntosh|first1=Avery I.|title=The Jackknife Estimation Method|url=http://people.bu.edu/aimcinto/jackknife.pdf|website=Boston University|publisher=Avery I. McIntosh|accessdate=2016-04-30}}: p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(\bar{x})=\frac{n-1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\bar{x}_i - \bar{x})^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Bias estimation and correction==
The jackknife technique can be used to estimate the bias of an estimator calculated over the entire sample. Say &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the calculated estimator of the parameter of interest based on all &lt;math&gt;{n}&lt;/math&gt; observations. Let
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_\mathrm{(.)}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\theta}_\mathrm{(i)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_\mathrm{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; is the estimate of interest based on the sample with the ''i''-th observation removed, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_\mathrm{(.)}&lt;/math&gt; is the average of these "leave-one-out" estimates.
The jackknife estimate of the bias of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\text{Bias}}_\mathrm{(\theta)}=(n-1)(\hat{\theta}_\mathrm{(.)} - \hat{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

and the resulting bias-corrected jackknife estimate of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{\text{Jack}}=n\hat{\theta} - (n-1)\hat{\theta}_\mathrm{(.)}&lt;/math&gt;

This removes the bias in the special case that the bias is &lt;math&gt;O(n^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; and to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{-2})&lt;/math&gt; in other cases.{{sfn|Cameron|Trivedi|2005|p=375}}

==Statement of the theorem==

It may be helpful to first recall the following terms:
* A ''topological vector space'' is a vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; such that the vector space operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition are continuous.
* A topological vector space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; is called ''normable'' if there is a norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \| \colon X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that the open balls of the norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|&lt;/math&gt; generate the given topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;.  (Note well that a given normable topological vector space might admit multiple such norms.)
* A [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''[[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]]'' if, for every two distinct points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U_{x}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that does not contain &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  In a topological vector space, this is equivalent to requiring that, for every &lt;math&gt;x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is an open neighbourhood of the origin not containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that being T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is weaker than being a [[Hausdorff space]], in which every two distinct points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; admit open neighbourhoods &lt;math&gt;U_{x}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{y}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;U_{x} \cap U_{y} = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;;  since normed and normable spaces are always Hausdorff, it is a &amp;ldquo;surprise&amp;rdquo; that the theorem only requires T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[convex set]]'' if, for any two points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in A&lt;/math&gt;, the line segment joining them lies wholly within &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for all &lt;math&gt;0 \leq t \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(1 - t) x + t y \in A&lt;/math&gt;.
* A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a topological vector space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[bounded set]]'' if, for every open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, there exists a scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \lambda U&lt;/math&gt;.  (One can think of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as being &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as being &amp;ldquo;big enough&amp;rdquo; to inflate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to cover &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.)

Expressed in these terms, Kolmogorov's normability criterion is as follows:

'''Theorem.''' A topological vector space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; is normable if and only if it is a T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space and admits a bounded convex neighbourhood of the origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11451">[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded, non-empty, real set has a least upper bound.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''least-upper-bound property''' (sometimes the '''completeness''' or '''supremum property''')&lt;ref&gt;Bartle and Sherbert (2011) define the "completeness property" and say that it is also called the "supremum property". (p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; is a fundamental property of the [[real number]]s and certain other ordered sets.  A set {{math|''X''}} has the least-upper-bound property [[if and only if]] every non-empty [[set (mathematics)|subset]] of {{math|''X''}} with an [[upper bound]] has a [[least upper bound|''least'' upper bound]] (supremum) in {{math|''X''}}.

The least-upper-bound property is one form of the [[completeness axiom]] for the real numbers, and is sometimes referred to as '''Dedekind completeness'''.&lt;ref&gt;Willard says that an ordered space "X is Dedekind complete if every subset of X having an upper bound has a least upper bound." (pp. 124-5, Problem 17E.)&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to prove many of the fundamental results of [[real analysis]], such as the [[intermediate value theorem]], the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], the [[extreme value theorem]], and the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].  It is usually taken as an axiom in synthetic [[construction of the real numbers|constructions of the real numbers]] (see [[least upper bound axiom]]), and it is also intimately related to the construction of the real numbers using [[Dedekind cut]]s.

In [[order theory]], this property can be generalized to a notion of [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] for any [[partially ordered set]].   A [[linearly ordered set]] that is [[dense order|dense]] and has the least upper bound property is called a [[linear continuum]].

==Statement of the property==

===Statement for real numbers===
Let {{math|''S''}} be a non-empty set of [[real number]]s.
* A real number {{math|''x''}} is called an '''[[upper bound]]''' for {{math|''S''}} if {{math|''x'' ≥ ''s''}} for all {{math|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}.
* A real number {{math|''x''}} is the '''least upper bound''' (or '''[[supremum]]''') for {{math|''S''}} if {{math|''x''}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} for every upper bound {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''S''}}.
The '''least-upper-bound property''' states that any non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound must have a least upper bound in ''real numbers''.

===Generalization to ordered sets===
{{main article|Completeness (order theory)}}
More generally, one may define upper bound and least upper bound for any [[subset]] of a [[partially ordered set]] {{math|''X''}}, with “real number” replaced by “element of {{math|''X''}}”.  In this case, we say that {{math|''X''}} has the least-upper-bound property if every non-empty subset of {{math|''X''}} with an upper bound has a least upper bound.

For example, the set {{math|'''Q'''}} of [[rational number]]s does not have the least-upper-bound property under the usual order.  For instance, the set

: &lt;math&gt; \left\{ x \in \mathbf{Q} : x^2 \le 2 \right\} = \mathbf{Q} \cap \left(-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

has an upper bound in {{math|'''Q'''}}, but does not have a least upper bound in {{math|'''Q'''}} (since the square root of two is [[Irrational number|irrational]]).  The [[construction of the real numbers]] using [[Dedekind cut]]s takes advantage of this failure by defining the irrational numbers as the least upper bounds of certain subsets of the rationals.

==Proof==

===Logical status===
The least-upper-bound property is equivalent to other forms of the [[completeness axiom]], such as the convergence of [[Cauchy sequence]]s or the [[nested intervals theorem]].  The logical status of the property depends on the [[construction of the real numbers]] used: in the [[Construction of the real numbers#Synthetic approach|synthetic approach]], the property is usually taken as an axiom for the real numbers (see [[least upper bound axiom]]); in a constructive approach, the property must be proved as a [[theorem]], either directly from the construction or as a consequence of some other form of completeness.

===Proof using Cauchy sequences===
It is possible to prove the least-upper-bound property using the assumption that every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges.  Let {{math|''S''}} be a [[nonempty]] set of real numbers, and suppose that {{math|''S''}} has an upper bound {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Since {{math|''S''}} is nonempty, there exists a real number {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} that is not an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}.  Define sequences {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} recursively as follows:
# Check whether {{math|(''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ⁄ 2}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}.
# If it is, let {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and let {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ⁄ 2}}.
# Otherwise there must be an element {{math|''s''}} in {{math|''S''}} so that {{math|''s''&gt;(''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ⁄ 2}}.  Let {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''s''}} and let {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.
Then {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ⋯ ≤ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|{{!}}''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''{{!}} → 0}} as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}.  It follows that both sequences are Cauchy and have the same limit {{math|''L''}}, which must be the least upper bound for {{math|''S''}}.

==Applications==
The least-upper-bound property of {{math|'''R'''}} can be used to prove many of the main foundational theorems in [[real analysis]].

===Intermediate value theorem===
Let {{math|''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R'''}} be a [[continuous function]], and suppose that {{math|''f'' (''a'') &lt; 0}} and {{math|''f'' (''b'') &gt; 0}}.  In this case, the [[intermediate value theorem]] states that {{math|''f''}} must have a [[Root of a function|root]] in the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.  This theorem can proved by considering the set
:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  ''f'' (''x'') &lt; 0 for all ''x'' ≤ ''s''} }}.
That is, {{math|''S''}} is the initial segment of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} that takes negative values under {{math|''f''}}.  Then {{math|''b''}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}, and the least upper bound must be a root of {{math|''f''}}.

===Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem===
The [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]] for {{math|'''R'''}} states that every [[sequence]] {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of real numbers in a closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} must have a convergent [[subsequence]].  This theorem can be proved by considering the set
:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  ''s'' ≤ ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for infinitely many ''n''} }}.
Clearly {{math|''b''}} is an upper bound for {{math|''S''}}, so {{math|''S''}} has a least upper bound {{math|''c''}}.  Then {{math|''c''}} must be a [[limit point]] of the sequence {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and it follows that {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has a subsequence that converges to {{math|''c''}}.

===Extreme value theorem===
Let {{math|''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R'''}} be a [[continuous function]] and let {{math|''M'' {{=}} sup ''f'' ([''a'', ''b''])}}, where {{math|''M'' {{=}} ∞}} if {{math|''f'' ([''a'', ''b''])}} has no upper bound.  The [[extreme value theorem]] states that {{math|''M''}} is finite and {{math|''f'' (''c'') {{=}} ''M''}} for some {{math|''c'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']}}.  This can be proved by considering the set
:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  sup ''f'' ([''s'', ''b'']) {{=}} ''M''} }}.
If {{math|''c''}} is the least upper bound of this set, then it follows from continuity that {{math|''f'' (''c'') {{=}} ''M''}}.

===Heine–Borel theorem===
Let {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} be a closed interval in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let {{math|{''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''} }} be a collection of [[open set]]s that [[Cover (topology)|covers]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.  Then the [[Heine–Borel theorem]] states that some finite subcollection of {{math|{''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''} }} covers {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} as well.  This statement can be proved by considering the set
:{{math|''S''  {{=}}  {''s'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']  :  [''a'', ''s''] can be covered by finitely many ''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''} }}.
This set must have a least upper bound {{math|''c''}}.  But {{math|''c''}} is itself an element of some open set {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and it follows that {{math|[''a'', ''c'' + ''δ'']}} can be covered by finitely many {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for some sufficiently small {{math|''δ'' &gt; 0}}.  This proves that {{math|''c'' + ''δ'' ∈ ''S''}}, and it also yields a contradiction unless {{math|''c'' {{=}} ''b''}}.

==History==

The importance of the least-upper-bound property was first recognized by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in his 1817 paper ''Rein analytischer Beweis des Lehrsatzes dass zwischen je  zwey  Werthen,  die  ein  entgegengesetztes  Resultat  gewäahren,  wenigstens eine reelle Wurzel der Gleichung liege''.&lt;ref name="Sundström"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | title = A Pedagogical History of Compactness | last1 = Raman-Sundström | first1 = Manya | date = August–September 2015 | volume = 122 | issue = 7 | pages = 619–635 | jstor = 10.4169/amer.math.monthly.122.7.619| doi = 10.4169/amer.math.monthly.122.7.619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mainly used for the evaluation of [[nuclear medicine]] [[medical imaging|imaging]] data after the injection of a labeled ligand that binds reversibly to specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] or [[enzyme]].

In conventional [[Multi-compartment model|compartmental analysis]], an [[iterative method]] is used to fit the individual model parameters in the solution of a compartmental model of specific configuration to the measurements with a measured plasma time-activity curve that serves as an forcing (input) function, and the binding of the tracer can then be described. Graphical analysis is a simplified method that transforms the model equations into a linear equation evaluated at multiple time points and provides fewer parameters (i.e., slope and intercept). Although the slope and the intercept can be interpreted in terms of a combination of model parameters if a compartmental model configuration is assumed, the graphical methods are independent of any specific model configuration. In case of irreversible tracers, certain fraction of the radioactivity is trapped in the tissue or the binding site during the course of the experiment, whereas reversible tracers show uptake and loss from all compartments throughout the study. The theoretical foundation of graphical analysis for irreversible tracers (also called [[Patlak plot|Patlak graphical analysis]] or [[Patlak plot]]) was laid by [[Clifford Patlak]] and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.S.

Based on the original work of Patlak, [[Jean Logan]] and her colleagues&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; from [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] extended the method to tracers with reversible kinetics.

== Description ==

The kinetics of radiolabeled compounds in a compartmental system can be described in terms of a set of first-order, constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=K. Godfrey | title=Compartmental Models and Their Application | publisher=Academic Press, New York | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J.A. Jacquez | title=Compartmental Analysis in Biology and Medicine | publisher=The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor | edition=2nd | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The time course of the activity in the multicompartmental system driven by a metabolite-corrected plasma input function &lt;math&gt;C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be described by:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \mathbf{KA} + \mathbf{Q}C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector of activity concentration for each compartment at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the transfer constants between compartments, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of plasma-to-tissue transfer constants. Patlak and Blasberg&lt;ref name="Patlak1985" /&gt; showed that the above equation can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t A(\tau) \, d\tau = -\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_n^T&lt;/math&gt; represents a row vector of 1s and &lt;math&gt;A(t) = \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  The total activity in the [[region of interest]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is a combination of radioactivities from all compartments plus a plasma volume fraction (&lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; and thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the following linear equation:

: &lt;math&gt;{{\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) {{\int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} + {{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t &gt; t'&lt;/math&gt;, Patlak and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the steady-state condition.  When this condition is satisfied, the intercept has reached its constant value so that after some time a plot of &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} C_p(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} \mathrm{ROI}(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a straight line with slope &lt;math&gt;(-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} + V_p)&lt;/math&gt; and intercept &lt;math&gt;{{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

For a catenary two-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; (forward transport from plasma to tissue), &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; (reverse transport from tissue to plasma), &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; ([[Binding (molecular)|binding]] parameter proportional to &lt;math&gt;B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;k_4&lt;/math&gt; (dissociation constant) to analyze enzyme or receptor system, the slope represents the total [[distribution volume]] (&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt;) and is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_1}{k_2}(1+\frac{k_3}{k_4}) + V_p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k_3 = B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_4 = k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_3}{k_4} = \frac{B_\max}{K_d}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_d = k_\mathrm{off}/k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;B_\max&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of ligand binding sites, &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium [[dissociation constant]] for the ligand-binding site complex, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding association constant, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding dissociation constant.  For a one-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope is &lt;math&gt;\lambda + V_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partition coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;{K_1}/{k_2}&lt;/math&gt;) and the intercept is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{k_2(1+V_p/\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7047">'''Lung compliance''', or '''pulmonary compliance''', is a measure of the [[lung]]'s [[compliance (physiology)|ability to stretch and expand]] (distensibility of elastic tissue). In clinical practice it is separated into two different measurements, static compliance and dynamic compliance. Static lung compliance is the change in volume for any given applied pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Lung+compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic lung compliance is the compliance of the lung at any given time during actual movement of air.

Low compliance indicates a stiff lung (one with high [[elastic recoil]]) and can be thought of as a thick balloon – this is the case often seen in [[fibrosis]]. High compliance indicates a pliable lung (one with low elastic recoil) and can be thought of as a grocery bag – this is the case often seen in [[emphysema]]. Compliance is highest at moderate [[lung volumes]], and much lower at volumes which are very low or very high. The compliance of the lungs demonstrate [[Hysteresis#Respiratory physiology|lung hysteresis]]; that is, the compliance is different on inspiration and expiration for identical volumes.

==Calculation==
Pulmonary compliance is calculated using the following equation, where Δ''V'' is the change in volume, and Δ''P'' is the change in pleural pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;Compliance =  \frac{ \Delta V}{ \Delta P} &lt;/math&gt;

For example, if a patient inhales 500 mL of air from a spirometer with an intrapleural pressure before inspiration of −5&amp;nbsp;cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and −10&amp;nbsp;cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at the end of inspiration. Then: &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math chem&gt; Compliance = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta P} = \frac{.5\;\ce L}{-5\;\ce{cm \, H2O} - (-10\;\ce{cm \, H2O})} = \frac{.5\;\ce L}{5\;\ce{cm \, H2O}} = 0.1\;\ce L\;\times\;\ce{cm \, H2O^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Static compliance (''C''&lt;sub&gt;stat&lt;/sub&gt;)===
Static compliance represents pulmonary compliance during periods without gas flow, such as during an inspiratory pause. It can be calculated with the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;C_{stat} = \frac{V_T}{P_{plat}-\mathrm{PEEP}}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:{{math|size=100%|1=''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = tidal volume}}; 
:''P''&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; = plateau pressure; 
:PEEP = [[positive end-expiratory pressure]]. 
''P''&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at the end of inhalation and prior to exhalation using an inspiratory hold maneuver. During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; is never bigger than [[Peak inspiratory pressure|PIP]] and is typically &lt;10 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O lower than PIP when airway resistance is not elevated. &lt;!-- And as we all know, --&gt;.

===Dynamic compliance (''C''&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;)===
Dynamic compliance represents pulmonary compliance during periods of gas flow, such as during active inspiration. Dynamic compliance is always lower than or equal to static lung compliance because PIP − PEEP is always greater than ''P''&lt;sub&gt;plat&lt;/sub&gt; − PEEP. It can be calculated using the following equation, where 
:{{math|size=100%|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt; = Dynamic compliance}}; 
:{{math|size=100%|1=''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = tidal volume}}; 
:{{math|size=100%|1=PIP = [[Peak inspiratory pressure]]}} (the maximum pressure during inspiration); 
:PEEP = Positive End Expiratory Pressure: 
:&lt;math&gt;C_{dyn} = \frac{V_T}\mathrm{PIP-PEEP}&lt;/math&gt;
Alterations in airway resistance, lung compliance and chest wall compliance influence ''C''&lt;sub&gt;dyn&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Clinical significance==
Lung compliance is an important measurement in [[respiratory physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oac.med.jhmi.edu/res_phys/Encyclopedia/Compliance/Compliance.HTML Compliance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikischin W, Gerhardt T, Everett R, Bancalari E | title = A new method to analyze lung compliance when pressure-volume relationship is nonlinear. | journal = Am J Respir Crit Care Med | volume = 158 | issue = 4 | pages = 1052–60 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9769260 | doi=10.1164/ajrccm.158.4.9801011}} [http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/158/4/1052 article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|4/4ch2/s4ch2_21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[fibrosis]] is associated with a ''decrease'' in pulmonary compliance.
* [[emphysema]]/[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] may be associated with an ''increase'' in pulmonary compliance due to the loss of alveolar and elastic tissue.

[[Pulmonary surfactant]] increases compliance by decreasing the surface tension of water. The internal surface of the [[alveolus]] is covered with a thin coat of fluid. The water in this fluid has a high surface tension, and provides a force that could collapse the alveolus. The presence of surfactant in this fluid breaks up the surface tension of water, making it less likely that the alveolus can collapse inward. If the alveolus were to collapse, a great force would be required to open it, meaning that compliance would decrease drastically.

==Functional significance of abnormally high or low compliance==
Low compliance indicates a stiff lung and means extra work is required to bring in a normal volume of air. This occurs as the lungs in this case become fibrotic, lose their distensibility and become stiffer.

In a highly compliant lung, as in [[emphysema]], the elastic tissue is damaged by [[enzymes]]. These enzymes are secreted by leukocytes (white blood cells) in response to a variety of inhaled irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Patients with emphysema have a very high lung compliance due to the poor [[elastic recoil]]. They have extreme difficulty exhaling air. In this condition extra work is required to get air out of the lungs. In addition, patients often have difficulties inhaling air as well. This is due to the fact that a high compliant lung results in many collapsed alveoli which makes inflation difficult. Compliance also increases with increasing age.

Both peak inspiratory and plateau pressure increase when elastic resistance increases or when pulmonary compliance decreases (e.g. during abdominal insufflation, ascites, intrinsic lung disease, obesity, pulmonary edema, tension pneumothorax). On the other hand, only peak inspiratory pressure increases (plateau pressure unchanged) when airway resistance increases (e.g. airway compression, bronchospasm, mucous plug, kinked tube, secretions, foreign body). &lt;ref&gt;''Marino, Paul. The ICU Book. 3rd Edition. Pages 465-467.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliance decreases in the following cases:

* [[Supine position]]
* [[Laparoscopic surgery|Laparoscopic]] surgical interventions
* Severe [[Restrictive lung disease|restrictive]] pathologies
* Chronic [[Restrictive lung disease|restrictive]] pathologies
* [[Hydrothorax]]
* [[Pneumothorax]]
* High standing of a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]
* Acute [[asthma]] attacks [Increased compliance also occurs, for an unclear reason&lt;ref&gt;J.B.West, [[Respiratory Physiology]], 9th edition, page 99&lt;/ref&gt;]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4233">[[File:Minimum bounding rectangle.svg|thumb|A series of geometric shapes enclosed by its minimum bounding box (in 2 dimensions)]]
In [[geometry]], the '''minimum''' or '''smallest bounding''' or '''enclosing box''' for a point set (''S'') in ''N'' dimensions is the box with the smallest [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] (area, volume, or  hypervolume in higher dimensions) within which all the points lie. When other kinds of measure are used, the minimum box is usually called accordingly, e.g., "minimum-perimeter bounding box".

The minimum bounding box of a point set is the same as the minimum bounding box of its [[convex hull]], a fact which may be used heuristically to speed up computation.&lt;ref name=tous83&gt;{{cite_paper
| author = Toussaint, G. T
| title = Solving geometric problems with the rotating calipers
| publisher=Proc. MELECON '83, Athens 
|url=http://web.cs.swarthmore.edu/~adanner/cs97/s08/pdf/calipers.pdf 
|year = 1983
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "box"/"hyperrectangle" comes from its usage in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], where it is indeed visualized as a rectangle (two-dimensional case), [[rectangular parallelepiped]] (three-dimensional case), etc.

In the two-dimensional case it is called the [[minimum bounding rectangle]].

==Axis-aligned minimum bounding box==
The [[axis-aligned]] minimum bounding box (or '''AABB''') for a given point set is its minimum bounding box subject to the constraint that the edges of the box are parallel to the (Cartesian) coordinate axes. It is simply the [[Cartesian product]] of ''N'' intervals each of which is defined by the minimal and maximal value of the corresponding coordinate for the points in ''S''.

Axis-aligned minimal bounding boxes are used to an approximate location of an object in question and as a very simple descriptor of its shape. For example, in [[computational geometry]] and its applications when it is required to find intersections in the set of objects, the initial check is the intersections between their MBBs. Since it is usually a much less expensive operation than the check of the actual intersection (because it only requires comparisons of coordinates), it allows quickly excluding checks of the pairs that are far apart.

==Arbitrarily oriented minimum bounding box==
The arbitrarily oriented minimum bounding box is the minimum bounding box, calculated subject to no constraints as to the orientation of the result. [[Minimum bounding box algorithms]] based on the [[rotating calipers]] method can be used to find the minimum-area or minimum-perimeter bounding box of a two-dimensional convex polygon in linear time, and of a two-dimensional point set in the time it takes to construct its [[convex hull]] followed by a linear-time computation.&lt;ref name=tous83/&gt; A three-dimensional rotating calipers algorithm can find the minimum-volume arbitrarily-oriented bounding box of a three-dimensional point set in cubic time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | author = Joseph O'Rourke | title = Finding minimal enclosing boxes | publisher = [[Springer Netherlands]] | journal = Parallel Programming | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matlab implementations of the latter as well as the optimal compromise between accuracy and CPU time are available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | last1 = Chang | first1 = Chia-Tche
 | last2 = Gorissen | first2 = Bastien
 | last3 = Melchior | first3 = Samuel
 |date=2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object oriented minimum bounding box==
In the case where an object has its own [[local coordinate system]], it can be useful to store a bounding box relative to these axes, which requires no transformation as the object's own transformation changes.

==Digital image processing==
In [[computer graphics|digital image processing]], the ''bounding box'' is merely the coordinates of the rectangular border that fully encloses a [[digital image]] when it is placed over a page, a canvas, a screen or other similar bidimensional background.

In [[mathematics]], a '''monopole''' is a [[Connection (fiber bundle)|connection]] over a [[principal bundle]] ''G'' with a section of the associated [[adjoint bundle]].

==Physical interpretation==

Physically, the section can be interpreted as a ''[[Higgs field]]'', where the connection and Higgs field should{{why|date=December 2016}} satisfy the [[Bogomolny equations]] and be of [[finite action]].

'''Nina Karlovna Bari''' ({{lang-ru|Нина Карловна Бари}}, November 19, 1901, [[Moscow]] – July 15, 1961, [[Moscow]]) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[mathematician]] known for her work on [[trigonometric series]].&lt;ref name="asc"&gt;[http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/bari.htm Biography of Nina Karlovna Bari]'', by Giota Soublis, [[Agnes Scott College]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nina Bari was born in [[Russia]] on 19 November 1901, the daughter of Olga and Karl Adolfovich Bari, a physician. In 1918, she became one of the first women to be accepted to the Department of Physics and Mathematics at the prestigious [[Moscow State University]]. She graduated in 1921—just three years after entering the university. After graduation, Bari began her teaching career. She lectured at the [[Moscow Forestry Institute]], the [[Moscow Polytechnic Institute]], and the [[Sverdlov Communist Institute]]. Bari applied for and received the only paid research fellowship awarded by the newly created [[Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics]]. As a student, Bari was drawn to an elite group nicknamed the Luzitania—an informal academic and social organization. She studied trigonometric series and functions under the tutelage of [[Nikolai Luzin]], becoming one of his star students.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; She presented the main result of her research to the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] in 1922—the first women to address the society.&lt;ref name="ed 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=ed|first=Pamela Proffitt,|title=Notable women scientists|year=1999|publisher=Gale Group|location=Detroit [u.a.]|isbn=0787639001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Bari completed her doctoral work on the topic of trigonometric expansions,&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=36443}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning the Glavnauk Prize for her thesis work.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; In 1927, Bari took advantage of an opportunity to study in Paris at the Sorbonne and the College de France. She then attended the [[Polish Mathematical Congress]] in Lwów, Poland; a Rockefeller grant enabled her to return to Paris to continue her studies. Bari's decision to travel may have been influenced by the disintegration of the Luzitanians. Luzin's irascible, demanding personality had alienated many of the mathematicians who had gathered around him. By 1930, all traces of the Luzitania movement had vanished, and Luzin left Moscow State for the Academy of Science's [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]]. In 1932, she became a professor at [[Moscow State University]] and in 1935 was awarded the title of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, a more prestigious research degree than traditional Ph.D.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; By this time, she had completed foundational work on trigonometric series.&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; 

== Career and later life ==
She was a close collaborator with [[Dmitrii Menshov]] on a number of research projects.&lt;ref name="mactutor" /&gt; She and Menshov took charge of function theory work at Moscow State during the 1940s. In 1952, she published an important piece on primitive functions, and trigonometric series and their almost everywhere convergence. Bari also posted works at the 1956 Third All—Union Congress in Moscow and the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="ed 1999" /&gt;

Mathematics was the center of Bari's intellectual life, but she enjoyed literature and the arts. She was also a mountain hiking enthusiast and tackled the [[Caucasus]], [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges in Russia. Bari's interest in mountain hiking was inspired by her husband, [[Viktor Vladimirovich Nemytskii]], a Soviet mathematician, Moscow State professor and an avid mountain explorer. There is no documentation of their marriage available, but contemporaries believe the two married later in life. Bari's last work—her 55th publication—was a 900-page monograph on the state of the art of trigonometric series theory, which is recognized as a standard reference work for those specializing in function and trigonometric series theory.&lt;ref name="ed 1999"/&gt;

==Death==
On 12 July 1961, Bari was killed when she fell in front of an oncoming metro train in Moscow.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

In [[recreational mathematics]], a '''pandiagonal magic cube''' is a [[magic cube]] with the additional property that all [[broken diagonal]]s (parallel to exactly two of the three coordinate axes) have the same sum as each other. Pandiagonal magic cubes are extensions of [[diagonal magic cube]]s (in which only the unbroken diagonals need to have the same sum as the rows of the cube) and generalize [[pandiagonal magic square]]s to three dimensions.

In a pandiagonal magic cube, all 3m planar arrays must be [[panmagic square]]s. The 6 oblique squares are always magic. Several of them may be panmagic squares.
A proper pandiagonal magic cube has exactly 9m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lines plus the 4 main triagonals summing correctly. (No broken triagonals have the correct sum.)

Order 7 is the smallest possible pandiagonal magic cube.

'''Process qualification''' is the qualification of manufacturing and production processes to confirm they are able to operate at a certain standard during sustained commercial manufacturing. Data covering critical process parameters must be recorded and analyzed to ensure critical quality attributes can be guaranteed throughout production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Qualification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/cms/index.php?id=215|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include testing equipment at maximum operating capacity to show quantity demands can be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all processes have been qualified the manufacturer should have a complete understanding of the process design and have a framework in place to routinely monitor operations. Only after process qualification has been completed can the manufacturing process begin production for commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Validation A Lifecycle Approach|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/aboutfda/centersoffices/cder/ucm255585.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally important as qualifying processes and equipment is qualifying software and personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROCESS QUALIFICATION (P2Q)|url=http://www.validation-online.net/process-qualification.html|publisher=validation-online.net|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well trained staff and accurate, thorough records helps ensure ongoing protection from process faults and quick recovery from otherwise costly process malfunctions. In many countries qualification measures are also required, especially in the [[pharmaceutical manufacturing]] field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2001_83_cons2009/2001_83_cons2009_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Process qualification should cover the following aspects of manufacturing:
* Facility
* Utilities
* Equipment
* Personnel
* End-to-end manufacturing
* Control protocols and monitoring software.

Process qualification is the second stage of [[Process Validation]].

A vital component of process qualification is [[Process Performance Qualification Protocol]]. PPQ Protocol is essential in defining and maintaining production standards within an organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4759">'''Realized variance''' or '''realised variance''' (RV, see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) is the sum of squared returns. For instance the RV can be the sum of squared daily returns for a particular month, which would yield a measure of price variation over this month. More commonly, the realized variance is computed as the sum of squared intraday returns for a particular day.

The realized variance is useful because it provides a relatively accurate measure of volatility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andersen |first=Torben G. |last2=Bollerslev |first2=Tim |authorlink2=Tim Bollerslev  |year=1998 |month= |title=Answering the sceptics: yes standard volatility models do provide accurate forecasts|pages=885–905|journal=International Economic Review |volume=39 |doi=10.2307/2527343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which is useful for many purposes, including volatility forecasting and forecast evaluation.

==Related quantities==

Unlike the [[variance]] the realized variance is a random quantity.

The realized [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] is the square root of the realized variance, or the square root of the RV multiplied by a suitable constant to bring the measure of volatility to an annualized scale.
For instance, if the RV is computed as the sum of squared daily returns for some month, then an annualized realized volatility is given by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{12 \times RV}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties under ideal conditions==

Under ideal circumstances the RV consistently estimates the quadratic variation of the price process that the returns are computed from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barndorff-Nielsen |first=Ole E. |last2=Shephard |first2=Neil |authorlink=Ole Barndorff-Nielsen|authorlink2=Neil Shephard  |date=May 2002 |title=Econometric analysis of realised volatility and its use in estimating stochastic volatility models|pages=253–280 |doi=10.1111/1467-9868.00336|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B  |volume=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen and Neil Shephard (2002), [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]], Series B, 63, 2002, 253–280.

For instance suppose that the price process &lt;math&gt;P_t=\exp{(p_t)}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[stochastic integral]]

: &lt;math&gt;p_t = p_0 + \int_0^t \sigma_s dB_s ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_s&lt;/math&gt; is a standard [[Brownian motion]], and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_s&lt;/math&gt; is some (possibly random) process for which the integrated variance,

: &lt;math&gt;IV = \int_0^t \sigma_s^2 ds,&lt;/math&gt;

is well defined.

The realized variance based on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intraday returns is given by &lt;math&gt;RV^{(n)} = \sum_{i=1}^n r_{i,n}^2,&lt;/math&gt; where the intraday returns may be defined by
: &lt;math&gt;r_{i,n} = p_{\frac{it}{n}}-p_{\frac{(i-1)t}{n}},\qquad i=1,\ldots,n.&lt;/math&gt;

Then it has been shown that, as &lt;math&gt;n\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; the realized variance converges to IV in probability. Moreover, the RV also [[converges in distribution]] in the sense that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{RV^{(n)}-IV}{\sqrt{2t\int_0^t \sigma_s^4 ds}},&lt;/math&gt;

is approximately distributed as a standard normal random variables when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large.

==Properties when prices are measured with noise==

When prices are measured with noise the RV may not estimate the desired quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Peter Reinhard |last2=Lunde |first2=Asger |authorlink=Peter Reinhard Hansen |date=April 2006 |title=Realized variance and market microstructure noise |pages=127–218 |doi=10.1198/073500106000000071 |url=http://pubs.amstat.org/doi/abs/10.1198/073500106000000071 |accessdate= |journal=Journal of Business and Economic Statistics |volume=24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714225454/http://pubs.amstat.org/doi/abs/10.1198/073500106000000071 |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This problem motivated the development of a wide range of robust realized measures of volatility, such as the [[realized kernel]] estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barndorff-Nielsen |first=Ole E. |last2=Hansen |first2=Peter Reinhard |last3=Lunde |first3=Asger |last4=Shephard |first4=Neil |authorlink=Ole Barndorff-Nielsen |authorlink2=Peter Reinhard Hansen |authorlink4=Neil Shephard |date=November 2008 |title=Designing realised kernels to measure the ex-post variation of equity prices in the presence of noise |pages=1481–1536 |doi=10.3982/ECTA6495 |url=http://www.econometricsociety.org/abstract.asp?ref=0012-9682&amp;vid=76&amp;iid=6&amp;aid=9&amp;s=-9999 |accessdate= |journal=Econometrica |volume=76 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726230752/http://www.econometricsociety.org/abstract.asp?ref=0012-9682&amp;vid=76&amp;iid=6&amp;aid=9&amp;s=-9999 |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanesco broccoli''' (also known as '''Roman cauliflower''', '''Broccolo Romanesco''', '''Romanesque cauliflower''' or simply  '''Romanesco''') is an [[eating|edible]] flower bud of the species ''[[Brassica oleracea]]''. First documented in Italy, it is [[Chartreuse_(color)|chartreuse]] in color. Romanesco has a striking appearance because its form is a natural approximation of a [[fractal]]. When compared to a traditional [[cauliflower]], its texture as a vegetable is far more crunchy, and its flavor is not as assertive, being delicate and nutty.

The Romanesco has been grown in Italy since the 16th century.

==Description==
[[File:Romanesco broccoli (3).jpg|thumb|The Romanesco superficially resembles a cauliflower, but it has a visually striking [[fractal]] form]]

Romanesco superficially resembles a cauliflower, but it is [[Chartreuse_(color)|chartreuse]] in color, and its form is strikingly [[fractal]] in nature. The [[inflorescence]] (the bud) is [[self-similar]] in character, with the branched [[meristem]]s making up a [[logarithmic spiral]]. In this sense the bud's form approximates a natural [[fractal]]; each bud is composed of a series of smaller buds, all arranged in yet another logarithmic spiral. This self-similar pattern continues at several smaller levels. The pattern is only an approximate fractal since the pattern eventually terminates when the feature size becomes sufficiently small. The number of spirals on the head of Romanesco broccoli is a [[Fibonacci number]].&lt;ref name="Fibonacci Numbers and Series"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Knott|title=Fibonacci Numbers and Nature|url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#veg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110183546/http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#leaf|archivedate=10 January 2015|work=Ron Knott's Web Pages on Mathematics|date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutritionally, romanesco is rich in [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin K]], [[dietary fiber]], and [[carotenoids]].{{CN|date=November 2015}}

The causes of its differences in appearance from the normal [[cauliflower]] and [[broccoli]] have been modeled as an extension of the preinfloresence stage of bud growth, but the genetic basis of this is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin Kieffer|author2=Michael P.

[[File:S1ABanimated.gif|thumb|An illustration of the selection principle S1(A,B)]]
In mathematics, a '''selection principle''' is a rule asserting
the possibility of obtaining mathematically significant objects by 
selecting elements from given sequences of sets. The theory of '''selection principles'''
studies these principles and their relations to other mathematical properties.
Selection principles mainly describe covering properties, 
measure- and category-theoretic properties, and local properties in 
topological spaces, especially function spaces. Often, the 
characterization of a mathematical property using a selection 
principle is a nontrivial task leading to new insights on the 
characterized property.

==The main selection principles==
In 1924, [[Karl Menger]]
&lt;ref name="Karl Menger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menger|first1=Karl|
title=Einige Überdeckungssätze der punktmengenlehre|
journal=Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie|date=1924|volume=133|
pages=421–444|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-6110-4_14|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6110-4_14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following basis property for metric spaces: 
Every basis of the topology contains a sequence of sets with vanishing 
diameters that covers the space. Soon thereafter, 
[[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurewicz|first1=Witold|
title=Über eine verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|
journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|date=1926|volume=24.1|pages=401–421|
url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01216792|doi=10.1007/bf01216792}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed that Menger's basis property is equivalent to the 
following selective property: for every sequence of open covers of the space, 
one can select finitely many open sets from each cover in the sequence, such that the selected sets cover the space.
Topological spaces having this covering property are called '''Menger spaces'''.

Hurewicz's reformulation of Menger's property was the first important 
topological property described by a selection principle. 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; be classes of mathematical objects.
In 1996, [[Marion Scheepers]]&lt;ref name=coc1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheepers|first1=Marion|
title=Combinatorics of open covers I: Ramsey theory|
journal=Topology and its Applications|date=1996|volume=69|pages=31–62|
url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864195000674|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following selection hypotheses,
capturing a large number of classic mathematical properties:

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where the classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; consist of covers of some ambient space, Scheepers also introduced the following selection principle.

* &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, none containing a finite subcover, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\bigcup \mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup \mathcal{F}_2,\dotsc\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, [[Boaz Tsaban]] identified the prevalence of the following related principle:
*&lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{B}}&lt;/math&gt;: Every member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains a member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions thus defined are ''selection principles''. An instantiation of a selection principle, by considering specific classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, gives a ''selection (or: selective) property''. However, these terminologies are used interchangeably in the literature.

===Variations===

For a set &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the '''star of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the set &lt;math&gt;\text{St}(A,\mathcal{F})=\bigcup\{F\in\mathcal{F}:A\cap F\neq\emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1999, [[Ljubisa D.R. Kocinac]] introduced the following ''star selection principles'':&lt;ref name=Kssp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kocinac|first1=Ljubisa D. R.|
title=Star selection principles: a survey|
journal=Khayyam Journal of Mathematics|date=2015|volume=1|pages=82–106|
url=http://emis.de/journals/KJM/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(U_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(\bigcup \mathcal{F}_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Covering properties==

Covering properties form the kernel of the theory of selection principles.  Selection properties that are not covering properties are often studied by using implications to and from selective covering properties of related spaces.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  An ''open cover'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a family of open sets whose union is the entire space &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;  For technical reasons, we also request that the entire space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of the cover.  The class of open covers of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}&lt;/math&gt;. (Formally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, but usually the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is fixed in the background.) The above-mentioned property of Menger is, thus, &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. In 1942, Fritz Rothberger considered Borel's strong measure zero sets, and introduced a topological variation later called [[Rothberger space]] (also known as ''C&lt;math&gt;''&lt;/math&gt; space''). In the notation of selections, Rothberger's property is the property &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''point-cofinite''' if it has infinitely many elements, and every point  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. (This type of cover was considered by Gerlits and Nagy, in the third item of a certain list in their paper. The list was enumerated by Greek letters, and thus these covers are often called '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-covers'''.) The class of point-cofinite open covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[Hurewicz space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-cover''' if every finite subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. The class of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[γ-space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega}}{\mathbf{\Gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By using star selection hypotheses one obtains properties such as '''star-Menger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;), '''star-Rothberger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;) and '''star-Hurewicz''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;).

===The Scheepers Diagram===
There are 36 selection properties of the form &lt;math&gt; \Pi(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\Pi\in\{\text{S}_1, \text{S}_\text{fin},\text{U}_\text{fin}, \bigl(~~\bigr)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in\{\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{\Omega}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Some of them are trivial (hold for all spaces, or fail for all spaces). Restricting attention to [[Lindelöf space]]s, the diagram below, known as the ''Scheepers Diagram'',&lt;ref name=coc1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul|date=1996|title=Combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|pages=241–266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2|last1=Just|first1=Winfried}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents nontrivial selection properties of the above form, and every nontrivial selection property is equivalent to one in the diagram.  Arrows denote implications.

==Local properties==

Selection principles also capture important non-covering properties.

Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that have the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in their closure is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the ''countable'' elements of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sequences in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that converge to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma_y}&lt;/math&gt;.

* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fréchet–Urysohn space|Fréchet–Urysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Gamma_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fréchet–Urysohn space|strongly Fréchet–Urysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Gamma_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable strong fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological Games==

There are close connections between selection principles and [[topological game|Topological Games]].

===The Menger game===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Menger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game for two players, Alice and Bob.  It has an inning per each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  At the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; inning, Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,
and Bob chooses a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  
If the family &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A '''strategy''' for a player is a function determining the move of the player, given the earlier moves of both players. A strategy for a player is a '''winning strategy''' if each play where this player sticks to this strategy is won by this player.

* A topological space is &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on this space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc1" /&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Bob has a winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Marion|date=1995-01-01|title=A direct proof of a theorem of Telgársky|url=http://www.ams.org/proc/1995-123-11/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1/|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume=123|issue=11|pages=3483–3485|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1|issn=0002-9939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telgársky|first=Rastislav|date=1984-06-01|title=On games of Topsoe.|url=http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/12050|journal=MATHEMATICA SCANDINAVICA|volume=54|issue=0|pages=170–176|doi=10.7146/math.scand.a-12050|issn=1903-1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar way, we define games for other selection principles from the given Scheepers Diagram. In all these cases a topological space has a property from the Scheepers Diagram if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the corresponding game.&lt;ref name="pawlikowski"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=Janusz|title=Undetermined sets of point-open games|url=https://eudml.org/doc/212029|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=144|issue=3|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dynamical systems theory|theory of dynamical systems]], the '''shadowing lemma''' is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] describing the behaviour of pseudo-orbits near a [[Hyperbolic set|hyperbolic invariant set]]. Informally, the theory states that every pseudo-orbit (which one can think of as a numerically computed trajectory with rounding errors on every step&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | title = Shadowing Theorem | urlname =  ShadowingTheorem }}&lt;/ref&gt;) stays uniformly close to some true trajectory (with slightly altered initial position)—in other words, a pseudo-trajectory is "shadowed" by a true one. 

== Formal statement ==
Given a map ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''X'' of a [[metric space]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') to itself, define a '''&amp;epsilon;-pseudo-orbit''' (or '''&amp;epsilon;-orbit''') as a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; of points such that &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; belongs to a &amp;epsilon;-neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;f(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, near a hyperbolic invariant set, the following statement holds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Katok |first2=B. |last2=Hasselblatt |title=Introduction to the Modern Theory of Dynamical Systems |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-34187-6 |at=Theorem 18.1.2. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Let &amp;Lambda; be a hyperbolic invariant set of a [[diffeomorphism]] f. There exists a neighborhood U of &amp;Lambda; with the following property: for any ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there exists ''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, such that any (finite or infinite) &amp;epsilon;-pseudo-orbit that stays in U also stays in a &amp;delta;-neighborhood of some true orbit.
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall (x_n),\, x_n\in U, \, d(x_{n+1},f(x_n))&lt;\varepsilon \quad \exists (y_n), \, \, y_{n+1}=f(y_n),\quad \text{such that} \,\, \forall n \,\, x_n\in U_{\delta}(y_n).

In [[graph theory]], a '''single-entry single-exit (SESE)''' region in a given [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is an ordered edge pair (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') of distinct [[Control flow graph|control flow]] edges ''a'' and ''b'' where:

#''a'' dominates ''b''&lt;br/&gt;
#''b'' postdominates ''a''&lt;br/&gt;
# Every cycle containing ''a'' also contains ''b'' and vice versa.

where a node ''x'' is said to '''dominate''' node ''y'' in a [[directed graph]] if every path from start to ''y'' includes ''x''. A node ''x'' is said to '''postdominate''' a node ''y'' if every path from ''y'' to end includes ''x''.                                     

So, ''a'' and ''b'' refer to the entry and exit edge, respectively. The first condition ensures that every path from start into the region passes through the region’s entry edge, ''a''.  The second condition ensures that every path from inside the region to end passes through the region’s exit edge, ''b''. The first two conditions are necessary but not enough to characterize SESE regions: since backedges do not alter the dominance or postdominance relationships, the first two conditions alone do not prohibit backedges entering or exiting the region. The third condition encodes two constraints: every path from inside the region to a point 'above' ''a'' passed through ''b'', and every path from a point 'below' ''b'' to a point inside the region passes through ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=178258 The program structure tree: computing control regions in linear time]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9338">The term '''singularity''' for an explanation of unstable systems was first, and in a most general meaning used in 1873 by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].  Maxwell does not differentiate between [[dynamical system]]s and [[social system]]s. Therefore, a singularity refers to a context in which a small change can cause a large effect. The existence of singularities is primarily an argument against [[determinism]] and absolute [[causality]] for Maxwell. Indeed, following the same initial conditions will always achieve the same results, but such a statement is of little value in a world in which the same initial conditions are never repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: “Does the Progress of Physical Science tend to give any Advantage to the Opinion of Necessity (or Determinism) over that of the Contingency of Events and the Freedom of the Will?” in: L. Champbell/ W. Garnett: “The Life of James Clerk Maxwell”. London 1882, S. 440ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In summary, singularities are determined by the following characteristics which can vary in strength:
# Instability: Singularities are related to effect in which small causes produce great effects.
# System relatedness: Singularities represent a peculiarity based on a system and affect its identity.
# Uniqueness: Singularities do not stand out from quantitative singularity, but rather by qualitative uniqueness.
# Irreversibility: The caused changes of systems are largely irreversible.
# Subjectivity: The awareness is dependent on the human perception and experience.
# Randomness: Singularities are often considered as random because generally either the causes or their effects are not well known.
# Complexity: Their occurrence is often connected to the complexity of the system and its environment.
# Interaction: Singularities often arise when unexpected interactions occur between two systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holzkämpfer, H.: Management von Singularitäten und Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, S. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities in dynamical systems ==
A further development of Maxwell's thoughts in relation to dynamic systems was carried out first by the French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. Poincaré distinguished four different simple singularities (points singuliers) of differential equations. These are the node (les noeuds), the saddle (les cols), the focus (les foyers) and the center (les centers).&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, H.: Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle, in: Journal de mathématiques, 1881. S. 375-422.&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent times, the [[chaos theory]] found special attention. However, deterministic chaos is just a special case of a singularity, in which a small cause produces a large observable effect due to a nonlinear dynamic behavior. In contrast the singularities raised by Maxwell, such as a loose rock at a singular point on a slope, show a linear dynamic behavior as it was demonstrated by Poincaré.
Singularities are the common staple of the chaos theory, [[catastrophe theory]] and [[bifurcation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tu, P.N.V.: Dynamical Systems: An Introduction with Applications in Economics and Biology, 2. überarb. und erw. Aufl., Berlin, Heidelberg u.a. 1994, S.195ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities in social systems ==
In social systems, a deterministic chaos is unlikely, because the elements of the system are some individuals that engage with awareness, will and foresight purposefully into the dynamic behavior of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Weizsäcker, C. C. von: Ordnung und Chaos in der Wirtschaft, in: W. Gerock/ H. Haken u.a. (Hrsg.): Ordnung und Chaos in der unbelebten und belebten Natur. Stuttgart 1989. S. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not exclude that approaches deterministic chaos in social systems are available. Rather, there is also an increase in the social development of nonlinear dynamics and instabilities .&lt;ref&gt;Bühl, W.L.: Sozialer Wandel im Ungleichgewicht: Zyklen, Fluktuationen, Katastrophen, Stuttgart 1990, S. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaos in the colloquial sense of complete disorder or confusion, however, is to be found. It is often the basis for singularities, where cause-and-effect relationships are not clear. There are already numerous examples of singularities in social systems with Maxwell and Poincaré. Maxwell states that a word can start a war and all the great discoveries of man based on singular states. Poincaré gives the example of a roofer who drops a brick and randomly kills a passing man.

== Singularities in natural history ==
The development of systems provides the science currently so before that by a singular [[Big Bang]] uniformly dispersed plasma spread after the creation of the universe in space, which is cooled with increasing expansion, so that formed atoms and finally for very small (singular) fluctuations in the uniform density inhomogeneities created self-reinforcing. They subsequently led to the formation of galaxies, stars and other systems in the universe, from which humans emerged at the end. Even if the singularity of the Big Bang can be avoided in the mathematical models, singularities remain an essential element of history.
The evolutionary history shows that not only successful mutations can be perceived as positive singularities, but the humanization and the human becoming, the singular most important event in the evolution and represents a jump from the continuum of past evolutionary development of the planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hagemann, R.: Mutationen als produktive Singularitäten, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularitäten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vorträge anläßlich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. März bis 2. April 1985 zu Halle (Saale), Leipzig 1989, S. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, C.: Die Hominisation, ein singulärer Sprung aus dem Kontinuum der Evolution?, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularitäten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vorträge anläßlich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. März bis 2. April 1985 zu Halle (Saale). Leipzig 1989, S. 141–154.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently, Ward and Kirschvink show that the history of life has been more influenced by disasters than by continuous evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, P., Kirschvink, J .: A New History of Life, Munich 2016, S.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Disasters are here first destructive singularities that create space for new developments in the sense of innovations as productive singularities.&lt;ref&gt;Holzkämpfer, H .: Management of Singularities and Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, pp. 133ff and 139ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities and complexity==
Closely related is the notion of singularity with the concept of [[complexity]]. J.C. Maxwell has already pointed out that a system has all the more singular points, the more complex it is. Complexity is also the basis of perceived chaos and singularities. 
Suppose a seemingly insignificant event that produces a great effect, even in a simple context, how difficult would it be to detect the reason in a complex situation with tremendously many elements and relationships.
Complexity that is kind of a breeding ground for singularities, shows the downfall of ancient cultures. Causes such as intruders, internal conflicts or natural disasters are not sufficient alone to justify the destruction of a culture. Rather requirement is an increasing complexity and associated declining marginal returns.&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, J.A.: The Collapse of Complex Societies, Cambridge, New York u.a. 1988, S. 42ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] shows how difficult decisions are in a very complex environment. Thus, the complexity of financial systems and financial products is a major challenge of the financial markets and institutions to look at.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, J.-P.: Complexity and the financial crisis, Introductory remarks at the Conference on The Macroeconomy and Financial Systems in Normal Times and in Times of Stress, jointly organized by Banque de france and the Bundesbank, 8. June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution is to reduce complexity and increase the potential for adaptation and robustness. In a complex world with increasing singularities, it is therefore necessary to abandon optimization potential to gain adaptability to external shocks and disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, M.: Adaptability: The Significance of Variability from Molecule to Ecosystem, New York, London 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4832">A '''spherical design''', part of [[combinatorial design]] theory in [[mathematics]], is a finite set of ''N'' points on the ''d''-dimensional unit [[n-sphere|''d''-sphere]] ''S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'' such that the average value of any polynomial ''f'' of degree ''t'' or less on the set equals the average value of ''f'' on the whole sphere (that is, the integral of ''f'' over ''S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'' divided by the area or [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] of ''S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'').  Such a set is often called a '''spherical''' ''t''-'''design''' to indicate the value of ''t'', which is a fundamental parameter.

Spherical designs can be of value in [[approximation theory]], in [[statistics]] for [[experimental design]] (being usable to construct [[rotatable design]]s), in [[combinatorics]], and in [[geometry]].  The main problem is to find examples, given ''d'' and ''t'', that are not too large; however, such examples may be hard to come by.
Spherical t-designs have also recently been appropriated in [[quantum mechanics]] in the form of [[quantum t-designs]] with various applications to [[quantum information theory]], [[quantum computing]] and [[POVM]]s.

The concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel (1977). 

== Spherical designs in the circle ==

The existence and structure of spherical designs with ''d'' = 1 (that is, in a circle) were studied in depth by Hong (1982).

== Spherical designs in any dimension ==

Shortly thereafter, Seymour and Zaslavsky (1984) proved that such designs exist of all sufficiently large sizes; that is, given positive integers ''n'' and ''t'', there is a number ''N''(''d'',''t'') such that for every ''N'' &amp;ge; ''N''(''d'',''t'') there exists a spherical ''t''-design of ''N'' points in dimension ''d''.  However, their proof gave no idea of how big ''N''(''d'',''t'') is.  Good estimates for that were found later on.  Besides these "large" sizes, there are many sporadic small spherical designs; many of them are related to finite [[group action]]s on the sphere and are of great interest in themselves.

Recently, Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Viazovska obtained the asymptotic upper bound
&lt;math&gt; N(d,t)&lt;C_d t^d&lt;/math&gt; for all positive integers ''d'' and&amp;nbsp;''t''.  This is optimal except that the value of ''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is unknown.

== 2-dimensional spherical design ==
{{main | geodesic grid }}

Spherical designs with ''d'' = 2 (that is, on the surface of a sphere) ...

One application of spherical designs is for whole-sphere data collection.
Spherical t-designs meet the "accurately approximate integrals by sums" criteria for "good" pixelizations of the sphere.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Stephen Arthur Cook''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|size=100%|sep=,|OC|OOnt}} (born December 14, 1939) is an American-Canadian [[computer science|computer scientist]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]] who has made major contributions to the fields of [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[proof complexity]]. He is a [[university professor]] at the [[University of Toronto]], [[Department of Computer Science (University of Toronto)|Department of Computer Science]] and [[University of Toronto Department of Mathematics|Department of Mathematics]].

==Biography==
[[File:Stephen A. Cook 1968 (enlarged portion).jpg|left|upright|thumb|Cook in 1968]]
Cook received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1961 from the [[University of Michigan]], and his [[Master's degree]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]], respectively in 1962 and 1966, from the Mathematics Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/cook_n991950.cfm|title=Stephen Arthur Cook|website=A. M. Turing Award|first=Bruce|last=Kapron|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[University of California, Berkeley]], mathematics department in 1966 as an assistant professor, and stayed there until 1970 when he was denied reappointment. In a speech celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Berkeley EECS department, fellow [[Turing Award]] winner and Berkeley professor [[Richard Karp]] said that, "It is to our everlasting shame that we were unable to persuade the math department to give him tenure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/BEARS/CS_Anniversary/karp-talk.html A Personal View of Computer Science at Berkeley - Richard Karp]&lt;/ref&gt; Cook joined the faculty of [[University of Toronto]], Computer Science and Mathematics Departments in 1970 as an associate professor, where he was promoted to professor in 1975 and [[Distinguished Professor]] in 1985.

==Research==
Stephen Cook is considered one of the forefathers of [[computational complexity theory]].

During his PhD, Cook worked on complexity of functions, mainly on multiplication. In his seminal 1971 paper "The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/1971.pdf "The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures"], PDF file of a scanned version&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://4mhz.de/cook.html "The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures"], PDF file of a retyped version&lt;/ref&gt; Cook formalized the notions of [[polynomial-time reduction]] (a.k.a. [[Cook reduction]]) and [[NP-complete]]ness, and proved the existence of an [[NP-complete]] problem by showing that the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] (usually known as SAT) is [[NP-complete]]. This theorem was proven independently by [[Leonid Levin]] in the [[Soviet Union]], and has thus been given the name [[Cook-Levin theorem|the Cook-Levin theorem]]. The paper also formulated the most famous problem in computer science, the [[P vs. NP problem]]. Informally, the "P vs. NP" question asks whether every optimization problem whose answers can be efficiently verified for correctness/optimality can be solved optimally with an efficient algorithm. Given the abundance of such optimization problems in everyday life, a positive answer to the "P vs. NP" question would likely have profound practical and philosophical consequences.

Cook conjectures that there are optimization problems (with easily checkable solutions) which cannot be solved by efficient algorithms, i.e., P is not equal to NP. This conjecture has generated a great deal of research in [[computational complexity theory]], which has considerably improved our understanding of the inherent difficulty of computational problems and what can be computed efficiently. Yet, the conjecture remains open and is among the seven famous [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ P vs. NP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }} problem on [[Millennium Prize Problems]] page - [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/pvsnp.pdf P vs. NP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212514/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/pvsnp.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} problem's official description by Stephen Cook on [[Millennium Prize Problems]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Cook received the [[Turing award]] for his contributions to complexity theory. His citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For his advancement of our understanding of the complexity of computation in a significant and profound way. His seminal paper, ''The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures,'' presented at the 1971 ACM SIGACT Symposium on the Theory of Computing, laid the foundations for the theory of NP-Completeness. The ensuing exploration of the boundaries and nature of NP-complete class of problems has been one of the most active and important research activities in computer science for the last decade.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his "Feasibly Constructive Proofs and the Propositional Calculus"&lt;ref&gt;[http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800116.803756 "Feasibly Constructive Proofs and the Propositional Calculus"] on ACM&lt;/ref&gt; paper published in 1975, he introduced the equational theory PV (standing for Polynomial-time Verifiable) to formalize the notion of proofs using only polynomial-time concepts. He made another major contribution to the field in his 1979 paper, joint with his student [[Robert A. Reckhow]], "The Relative Efficiency of Propositional Proof Systems",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2273702 "The Relative Efficiency of Propositional Proof Systems"] on JStore&lt;/ref&gt; in which they formalized the notions of [[p-simulation]] and efficient [[propositional proof system]], which started an area now called propositional [[proof complexity]]. They proved that the existence of a proof system in which every true formula has a short proof is equivalent to [[NP (complexity)|NP]] = [[coNP]]. Cook co-authored a book with his student [[Phuong The Nguyen]] in this area titled "Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cup.es/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521517294 "Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity"]'s official page&lt;/ref&gt;

His main research areas are [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[proof complexity]], with excursions into [[programming language semantics]], [[parallel computation]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. Other areas which he has contributed to include [[bounded arithmetic]], [[bounded reverse mathematics]], [[complexity of higher type functions]], [[complexity of analysis]], and lower bounds in propositional [[proof system]]s.

===Some other contributions===
He named the complexity class [[NC (complexity)|NC]] after [[Nick Pippenger]]. The complexity class [[SC (complexity)|SC]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Steve's class": origin of SC|url=http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/9298|work=Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the complexity class [[AC0]] and its hierarchy [[AC (complexity)|AC]] are also introduced by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who introduced the complexity class AC?|url=http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/12649|work=Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Don Knuth]] the [[KMP algorithm]] was inspired by Cook's automata for recognizing concatenated palindromes in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty Questions for Donald Knuth|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Cook was awarded a [[Steacie Fellowship]] in 1977, a [[Killam Research Fellowship]] in 1982, and received the [[CRM-Fields-PIMS prize]] in 1999. He has won [[John L. Synge Award]] and [[Bernard Bolzano Medal]], and is a fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] and [[Royal Society of Canada]]. Cook was elected to membership in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] ([[United States]]) and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Cook won the ACM [[Turing Award]] in 1982. 
[[Association for Computing Machinery]] honored him as a Fellow of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] in 2008 for his
''fundamental contributions to the theory of computational complexity''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=N991950&amp;srt=year&amp;year=2008 Stephen Cook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123205310/http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=N991950&amp;srt=year&amp;year=2008 |date=2009-01-23 }} on ACM Fellows&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Government of Ontario]] appointed him to the [[Order of Ontario]] in 2013, the highest honor in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ontario.ca/mci/en/2013/01/25-appointees-named-to-ontarios-highest-honour.html|title=25 Appointees Named to Ontario's Highest Honour|work=Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has won the 2012 [[Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering]], the highest honor for scientist and engineers in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chung|last=Emily|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/02/26/science-herzberg-stephen-cook.html|title=Computer scientist wins Canada's top science prize|publisher=cbc.ca|date=February 27, 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Herzberg Medal is awarded by [[NSERC]] for "both the sustained excellence and overall influence of research work conducted in Canada in the natural sciences or engineering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Prizes-Prix/Herzberg-Herzberg/Profiles-Profils/Cook-Cook_eng.asp|title=Current Winner - 2012 - Stephen Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named an [[Officer of the Order of Canada]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/canada/1296405-four-nova-scotians-among-order-of-canada-honourees "Four Nova Scotians among Order of Canada honourees"]. ''[[The Chronicle-Herald]]'', July 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was granted the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] 2015 in the Information and Communication Technologies category "for his important role in identifying what computers can and cannot solve efficiently," in the words of the jury's citation. His work, it continues, "has had a dramatic impact in all fields where complex computations are crucial."

Cook has supervised numerous MSc students, and 34 PhD students have completed their degrees under his supervision.&lt;ref name="mathgenealogy"&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=14011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cook lives with his wife in [[Toronto]]. They have two sons, [[Gordon Cook|Gordon]] and [http://www.falsifian.org/ James].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen A. Cook - Home Page|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He plays the [[violin]] and enjoys [[sailing]]. He is often called by his short name Steve Cook.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1295">The '''Strassburg tablet''', dating to c. 1800 BCE, is the oldest instance of [[algebra]] that has been found. The Strassburg tablet is often claimed to be the historical beginning point of algebra. The Strassburg tablet is a [[Babylon]]ian tablet that was recently discovered.

In [[logic]], a '''substructural logic''' is a logic lacking one of the usual [[structural rule]]s (e.g. of classical and intuitionistic logic), such as [[monotonicity of entailment|weakening]], [[idempotency of entailment|contraction]], exchange or associativity.  Two of the more significant substructural logics are [[relevant logic|relevance logic]] and [[linear logic]].

In a [[sequent calculus]], one writes each line of a proof as

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

Here the structural rules are rules for [[rewriting]] the [[Sides of an equation|LHS]] of the sequent, denoted Γ, initially conceived of as a string (sequence) &lt;!-- CS link for string was wrong --&gt; of propositions. The standard interpretation of this string is as [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]: we expect to read

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A,\mathcal B \vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;

as the sequent notation for

:(''A'' '''and''' ''B'') '''implies''' ''C''.

Here we are taking the [[Sides of an equation|RHS]] Σ to be a single proposition ''C'' (which is the [[intuitionistic]] style of sequent); but everything applies equally to the general case, since all the manipulations are taking place to the left of the [[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;.

Since conjunction is a [[commutative]] and [[associative]] operation, the formal setting-up of sequent theory normally includes '''structural rules''' for rewriting the sequent Γ accordingly—for example for deducing

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B,\mathcal A\vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;

from

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A,\mathcal B\vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;.

There are further structural rules corresponding to the ''[[idempotent]]'' and ''[[monotonic]]'' properties of conjunction: from

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma,\mathcal A,\mathcal A,\Delta\vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;

we can deduce

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma,\mathcal A,\Delta\vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;.

Also from

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma,\mathcal A,\Delta\vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;

one can deduce, for any ''B'',

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma,\mathcal A,\mathcal B,\Delta\vdash\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Linear logic]], in which duplicated hypotheses 'count' differently from single occurrences, leaves out both of these rules, while [[relevant logic|relevant (or relevance) logic]]s merely leaves out the latter rule, on the ground that ''B'' is clearly irrelevant to the conclusion.

The above are basic examples of structural rules. It is not that these rules are contentious, when applied in conventional propositional calculus. They occur naturally in proof theory, and were first noticed there (before receiving a name).

== Premise composition ==
There are numerous ways to compose premises (and in the multiple-conclusion case, conclusions as well). One way is to collect them into a set. But since e.g. {a,a} = {a} we have contraction for free if premises are sets. We also have associativity and permutation (or commutativity) for free as well, among other properties. In substructural logics, typically premises are not composed into sets, but rather they are composed into more fine-grained structures, such as trees or multisets (sets that distinguish multiple occurrences of elements) or sequences of formulae. For example, in linear logic, since contraction fails, the premises must be composed in something at least as fine-grained as multisets.

== History ==
It is a relatively young field. The first conference on the topic was held in October 1990 in Tübingen, as "Logics with Restricted Structural Rules". During the conference Kosta Došen proposed the term "substructural logics", which is now in use today.

In mathematics, '''swirl functions''' are [[special function]]s defined as follows&lt;ref&gt;Trott, M. Graphica 1: The World of Mathematica Graphics. The Imaginary Made Real: The Images of Michael Trott. Champaign, IL: Wolfram Media, pp. 36–37 and 86, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;：

: &lt;math&gt;S(k,n,r,\theta)=\sin(k\cos(r) -n\theta)  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'', ''n'' are integers.

''n'' is the number of blades, ''k'' is related to the shape of each blade.

==Symmetry==
The function ''S''(''k'',''n'',''r'',''&amp;theta;'') satisfies the following relations:
;mirror symmetry

*&lt;math&gt;f(-k, n, r, \theta)=-f(k, n, r, -\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f(-k, n, r, \theta)=-f(k, -n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f(-k, -n, r, \theta)=-f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f(-k, n, r, -\theta)=-f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;  f(-k, n, r, \theta)=-f(k, n, -r, -\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; f(-k, n, -r, -\theta)=-f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;   f(-k, -n, -r, \theta)=-f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; f(-k, n, -r, -\theta)=-f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

;full symmetry
*&lt;math&gt;f(k, -n, r, \theta)=f(k, n, r, -\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f(k, -n, r, -\theta)=f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; f(k, n, -r, \theta)=f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; f(k, n, -r, \theta)=f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; f(k, n, -r, \theta)=f(k, -n, r, -\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;  f(k, -n, -r, -\theta)=f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; f(k, n, -r, \theta)-f(k, n, r, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

;rotation symmetry

: &lt;math&gt;S\left(k,n,r,\theta+\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)=S(k,n,r,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">[[Image:Thue-number.svg|thumb|The Thue number of the 5-[[Cycle graph|cycle]] is four.]]
In the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[graph theory]], the '''Thue number''' of a graph is a variation of the [[chromatic index]], defined by Alon et al. (2002) and named after mathematician [[Axel Thue]], who studied the [[squarefree word]]s used to define this number.

Alon et al. define a ''nonrepetitive coloring'' of a graph to be an assignment of colors to the edges of the graph, such that there does not exist any even-length [[path (graph theory)|simple path]] in the graph in which the colors of the edges in the first half of the path form the same sequence as the colors of the edges in the second half of the path. The Thue number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed in any nonrepetitive coloring.

Variations on this concept involving vertex colorings or more general walks on a graph have been studied by several authors including Barát and Varjú, Barát and Wood (2005), Brešar and Klavžar (2004), and Kündgen and Pelsmajer.

== Example ==

Consider a [[pentagon]], that is, a [[Cycle graph|cycle]] of five vertices. If we color the edges with two colors, some two adjacent edges will have the same color x; the path formed by those two edges will have the repetitive color sequence xx.  If we color the edges with three colors, one of the three colors will be used only once; the path of four edges formed by the other two colors will either have two consecutive edges or will form the repetitive color sequence xyxy.  However, with four colors it is not difficult to avoid all repetitions. Therefore, the Thue number of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is four.

== Results ==

Alon et al. use the [[Lovász local lemma]] to prove that the Thue number of any graph is at most quadratic in its maximum degree; they provide an example showing that for some graphs this quadratic dependence is necessary.  In addition they show that the Thue number of a path of four or more vertices is exactly three, and that the Thue number of any cycle is at most four, and that the Thue number of the [[Petersen graph]] is exactly five.

The known cycles with Thue number four are ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, and  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;. Alon et al. conjecture that the Thue number of any larger cycle is three; they verified computationally that the cycles listed above are the only ones of length ≤ 2001 with Thue number four. Currie resolved this in a 2002 paper, showing that all cycles with 18 or more vertices have Thue number 3.

== Computational complexity ==

Testing whether a coloring has a repetitive path is in NP, so testing whether a coloring is nonrepetitive is in co-NP, and Manin showed that it is co-NP-complete. The problem of finding such a coloring belongs to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2^P&lt;/math&gt; in the [[polynomial hierarchy]], and again Manin showed that it is complete for this level.

In mathematics, a [[zero of a function|zero]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is a value {{mvar|a}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''a'') = 0}}.

In [[complex analysis]], '''zeros''' of [[holomorphic function]]s and [[meromorphic function]]s play a particularly important role because of the duality between zeros and poles.

A function {{mvar|f}} of a [[complex variable]] {{mvar|z}} is ''meromorphic'' in the [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of a point &lt;math&gt;z_0,&lt;/math&gt; if either {{mvar|f}} or its [[reciprocal function]] {{math|1/''f''}} is ''holomorphic'' in some neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; (that is, if {{mvar|f}} or {{math|1/''f'' }} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] in a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;). If &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is zero of {{math|1/''f'' }}, then it is a '''pole''' of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|f}}.

Thus a '''pole''' is a certain type of [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] of a function, nearby which the function behaves relatively regularly, in contrast to [[essential singularities]], such as 0 for the [[logarithm function]], and [[branch point]]s, such as 0 for the complex [[square root function]].

== Definitions ==
A [[function of a complex variable]] {{mvar|z}} is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in an [[open set|open domain]] {{mvar|U}} if it is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] with respect to {{mvar|z}} at every point of {{mvar|U}}. Equivalently, it is holomorphic if it is [[analytic function|analytic]], that is, if its [[Taylor series]] exists at every point of {{mvar|U}}, and converges to the function in some [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the point. A function is [[meromorphic function|meromorphic]] in {{mvar|U}} if every point of {{mvar|U}} has a neighbourhood such that either {{mvar|f}} or {{math|1/''f''}} is holomorphic in it.

A '''[[zero of a function|zero]]''' of a meromorphic function {{mvar|f}} is a complex number {{mvar|z}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''z'') = 0}}. A '''pole''' of {{mvar|f}} is a zero of {{math|1/''f''}}.

If {{mvar|f}} is a function that is meromorphic in a neighbourhood of a point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the [[complex plane]], then there exists an integer {{mvar|n}} such that 
:&lt;math&gt;(z-z_0)^n f(z)&lt;/math&gt;
is holomorphic and nonzero in a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; (this is a consequence of the analytic property).
If {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, then &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is a ''pole'' of '''order''' (or multiplicity) {{mvar|n}} of {{mvar|f}}. If {{math|''n'' &lt; 0}}, then &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is a ''zero'' of order &lt;math&gt;|n|&lt;/math&gt; of {{mvar|f}}. ''Simple zero'' and ''simple pole'' are terms used for zeroes and poles of order &lt;math&gt;|n|=1&lt;/math&gt;. ''Degree'' is sometimes used synonymously to order.

This characterization of zeros and poles implies that zeros and poles are [[isolated point|isolated]], that is, every zero or pole has a neighbourhood that does not contain any other zero and pole.

Because of the ''order'' of  zeros and poles being defined as a non-negative number {{mvar|n}} and the symmetry between them, it is often useful to consider a pole of order {{mvar|n}} as a zero of order {{math|–''n''}} and a zero of order {{mvar|n}} as a pole of order {{math|–''n''}}. In this case a point that is neither a pole nor a zero is viewed as a pole (or zero) of order '''0'''.

A meromorphic function may have infinitely many zeros and poles. This is the case for the [[Gamma function]] (see the image in the info box), which is meromorphic in the whole complex plane, and has a simple pole at every non-positive integer. The [[Riemann zeta function]] is also meromorphic in the whole complex plane, with a single pole of order 1 at {{math|1=''z'' = 1}}. It has no zeros in the left halfplane besides at all even integers along the negative real line, and the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is the conjecture that all other zeros are along {{math|1=Re(''z'') = 1/2}}.

In a neighbourhood of a point &lt;math&gt;z_0,&lt;/math&gt; a nonzero meromorphic function {{mvar|f}} is the sum of a [[Laurent series]] with at most finite ''principal part'' (the terms with negative index values):
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sum_{k\geq -n} a_k (z - z_0)^k,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|n}} is an integer, and &lt;math&gt;a_{-n}\neq 0.&lt;/math&gt; Again, if {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}} (the sum starts with &lt;math&gt;a_{-|n|} (z - z_0)^{-|n|}&lt;/math&gt;, the principal part has {{mvar|n}} terms), one has a pole of order {{mvar|n}}, and if {{math|''n'' ≤ 0}} (the sum starts with &lt;math&gt;a_{|n|} (z - z_0)^{|n|}&lt;/math&gt;, there is no principal part), one has a zero of order &lt;math&gt;|n|&lt;/math&gt;.

==At infinity==
A function &lt;math&gt; z \mapsto f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is ''meromorphic at infinity'' if it is meromorphic in some neighbourhood of infinity (that is outside some [[disk (mathematics)|disk]]), and there is an integer {{mvar|n}} such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to \infty}\frac{f(z)}{z^n}&lt;/math&gt;
exists and is a nonzero complex number.

In this case, the [[point at infinity]] is a pole of order {{mvar|n}} if {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, and a zero of order {{mvar|n}} if {{math|''n'' &lt; 0}}.

For example, a [[polynomial]] of degree {{mvar|n}} has a pole of degree {{mvar|n}} at infinity.

The [[complex plane]] extended by a point at infinity is called the [[Riemann sphere]].

If {{mvar|f}} is a function that is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere, then it has a finite number of zeros and poles, and the sum of the orders of its poles equals the sum of the orders of its zeros. 

Every [[rational function]] is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere, and, in this case, the sum of orders of the zeros or of the poles is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

[[File:Pole-order9-infin.png|right|thumb|300px|A pole of order 9, at infinity, for a [[polynomial function|polynomial complex function]] of degree 9, such as &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^9&lt;/math&gt;]]
* The function
::&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{3}{z}&lt;/math&gt;
: is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere. It has a pole of order 1 or simple pole at &lt;math&gt; z= 0,&lt;/math&gt; and a simple zero at infinity.

* The function
:: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{z+2}{(z-5)^2(z+7)^3}&lt;/math&gt;
: is meromorphic on the whole Riemann sphere. It has a pole of order 2 at &lt;math&gt; z=5,&lt;/math&gt; and a pole of order 3 at &lt;math&gt; z = -7&lt;/math&gt;. It has a simple zero at &lt;math&gt; z=-2,&lt;/math&gt; and a quadruple zero at infinity.

* The function
:: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{z-4}{e^z-1}&lt;/math&gt;
: is meromorphic in the whole complex plane, but not at infinity. It has poles of order 1 at &lt;math&gt; z=2\pi ni\text{ for } n\in\Bbb Z&lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen by writing the [[Taylor series]] of &lt;math&gt; e^z&lt;/math&gt; around the origin.

* The function
::&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z&lt;/math&gt;
: has a single pole at infinity of order 1, and a single zero at the origin.

All above examples except for the third are [[rational functions]]. For a general discussion of zeros and poles of such functions, see {{sectionlink|Pole–zero plot|Continuous-time systems}}.

==Function on a curve==

The concept of zeros and poles extends naturally to functions on a ''complex curve'', that is [[complex analytic manifold]] of dimension one (over the complex numbers). The simplest examples of such curves are the [[complex plane]] and the [[Riemann surface]]. This extension is done by transferring structures and properties through [[Atlas (topology)|chart]]s, which are analytic [[isomorphism]]s.

More precisely, let {{mvar|f}} be a function from a complex curve {{mvar|M}} to the complex numbers. This function is holomorphic (resp. meromorphic) in a neighbourhood of a point {{mvar|z}} of {{mvar|M}} if there is a chart &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f \circ \phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic (resp. meromorphic) in a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;\phi(z).&lt;/math&gt; Then, {{mvar|z}} is a pole or a zero of order {{mvar|n}} if the same is true for &lt;math&gt;\phi(z).&lt;/math&gt;

If the curve is [[compact space|compact]], and the function {{mvar|f}} is meromorphic on the whole curve, then the number of zeros and poles is finite, and the sum of the orders of the poles equals the sum of the orders of the zeros. This is one of the basic facts that are involved in [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">In [[real algebraic geometry]], the ''' Łojasiewicz inequality''', named after [[Stanisław Łojasiewicz]], gives an upper bound for the distance of a point to the nearest zero of a given [[real analytic function]].  Specifically, let ƒ&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''U''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a real analytic function on an [[open set]] ''U'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''Z'' be the zero [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of ƒ. Assume that ''Z'' is not empty.  Then for any [[compact set]] ''K'' in ''U'', there exist positive constants α and ''C'' such that, for all  ''x'' in ''K'' 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist}(x,Z)^\alpha \le C|f(x)|. &lt;/math&gt;

Here α can be large.

The following form of this inequality is often seen in more analytic contexts:  with the same assumptions on ƒ, for every ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''U'' there is a possibly smaller open neighborhood ''W'' of ''p'' and constants θ&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;(0,1) and ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)-f(p)|^\theta\le c|\nabla f(x)|. &lt;/math&gt;
