&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Acute bronchitis''', also known as a '''chest cold''', is short-term [[inflammation]] of the [[bronchus|bronchi]] (large and medium-sized airways) of the [[lung]]s.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Def&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Bronchitis?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153154/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; The most common symptom is a [[cough]].&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Other symptoms include [[sputum|coughing up mucus]], [[wheezing]], [[shortness of breath]], [[fever]], and chest discomfort.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Def/&gt; The infection may last from a few to ten days.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Def/&gt; The cough may persist for several weeks afterward with the total duration of symptoms usually around three weeks.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Def/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Some have symptoms for up to six weeks.&lt;ref name=Tac2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
In more than 90% of cases the cause is a [[viral infection]].&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Def/&gt; Risk factors include exposure to [[tobacco smoke]], dust, and other [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name=NIH2011Def/&gt; A small number of cases are due to high levels of air pollution or bacteria such as ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' or ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Causes Bronchitis?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/causes|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402130114/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/causes|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on a person's signs and symptom.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Diag&gt;{{cite web|title=How Is Bronchitis Diagnosed?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/diagnosis|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402195428/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/diagnosis|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color of the sputum does not indicate if the infection is viral or bacterial.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Determining the underlying organism is typically not needed.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Other causes of similar symptoms include [[asthma]], [[pneumonia]], [[bronchiolitis]], [[bronchiectasis]], and [[COPD]].&lt;ref name=AFP2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=RH|title=Diagnosis and treatment of acute bronchitis.|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 December 2010|volume=82|issue=11|pages=1345–50|pmid=21121518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wen2006/&gt; A [[chest X-ray]] may be useful to detect pneumonia.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Prevention is by not smoking and avoiding other lung irritants.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Pre/&gt; Frequent hand washing may also be protective.&lt;ref name=NIH2011Pre&gt;{{cite web|title=How Can Bronchitis Be Prevented?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/prevention|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184916/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/prevention|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and [[NSAIDs]] to help with the fever.&lt;ref name=Tac2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2011Tx&gt;{{cite web|title=How Is Bronchitis Treated?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/treatment|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113109/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi/treatment|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cough medicine]] has little support for its use and is not recommended in children less than six years of age.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=SM|last2=Schroeder|first2=K|last3=Fahey|first3=T|title=Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=24 November 2014|volume=11|pages=CD001831|pmid=25420096|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001831.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salbutamol]] is not effective in children with an acute cough who do not have restricted airways.&lt;ref name=Becker2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Lorne A.|last2=Hom|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Villasis-Keever|first3=Miguel|last4=van der Wouden|first4=Johannes C.|date=2015-09-03|title=Beta2-agonists for acute cough or a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=9|pages=CD001726|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001726.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26333656|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is weak evidence that salbutamol may be useful in adults with wheezing due to a restricted airway; however, it may result in nervousness, shakiness or a tremor.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker2015 /&gt; [[Antibiotic]]s should generally not be used.&lt;ref name="Smith2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=SM|last2=Fahey|first2=T|last3=Smucny|first3=J|last4=Becker|first4=LA|date=19 Jun 2017|title=Antibiotics for acute bronchitis.|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=6|pages=CD000245|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000245.pub4|pmid=28626858|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is when acute bronchitis is due to [[pertussis]].&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt; Tentative evidence supports [[honey]] and [[pelargonium]] to help with symptoms.&lt;ref name=AFP2010/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, society and culture --&gt;
Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases.&lt;ref name=Tac2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chest2006/&gt; About 5% of adults are affected and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year.&lt;ref name=Wen2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flem2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=DM|last2=Elliot|first2=AJ|title=The management of acute bronchitis in children.|journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date=March 2007|volume=8|issue=4|pages=415–26|pmid=17309336|doi=10.1517/14656566.8.4.415}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs more often in the winter.&lt;ref name=Wen2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wenzel|first1=RP|last2=Fowler AA|first2=3rd|title=Clinical practice. Acute bronchitis.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=16 November 2006|volume=355|issue=20|pages=2125–30|pmid=17108344|doi=10.1056/nejmcp061493}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 10 million people in the United States visit a [[Physician|doctor]] each year for this condition with approximately 70% receiving antibiotics, most of which are not needed.&lt;ref name=Tac2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tackett|first1=KL|last2=Atkins|first2=A|title=Evidence-based acute bronchitis therapy.|journal=Journal of pharmacy practice|date=December 2012|volume=25|issue=6|pages=586–90|pmid=23076965|doi=10.1177/0897190012460826}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are efforts to decrease the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis.&lt;ref name=Chest2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braman|first1=SS|title=Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.|journal=Chest|date=January 2006|volume=129|issue=1 Suppl|pages=95S-103S|pmid=16428698|doi=10.1378/chest.129.1_suppl.95S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Bronchitis may be indicated by an [[expectorate|expectorating]] [[cough]], shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), and wheezing. On occasion, [[chest pain]]s, [[fever]], and [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] or [[malaise]] may also occur. In addition, bronchitis caused by [[Adenoviridae]] may cause systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms as well. However, the coughs due to bronchitis can continue for up to three weeks or more even after all other symptoms have subsided.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Cause==
Acute bronchitis can be caused by contagious [[pathogen]]s, most commonly viruses. Typical viruses include [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|respiratory syncytial virus]], [[rhinovirus]], [[influenza]], and others. Bacteria are uncommon pathogens but may include ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
*Damage caused by irritation of the airways leads to inflammation and leads to neutrophils infiltrating the lung tissue.
*Mucosal hypersecretion is promoted by a substance released by [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]].
*Further obstruction to the airways is caused by more [[goblet cells]] in the small airways. This is typical of [[chronic bronchitis]].
*Although infection is not the reason or cause of chronic bronchitis, it is seen to aid in sustaining the bronchitis.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MildPerihilarairwaycuffing.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Mild peri hilar cuffing as seen in viral bronchitis]]
A [[physical examination]] will often reveal decreased intensity of breath sounds, wheezing,  [[rhonchi]], and prolonged [[Exhalation|expiration]].  Most physicians rely on the presence of a persistent dry or wet cough as evidence of bronchitis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A variety of tests may be performed in patients presenting with cough and shortness of breath:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* A [[chest X-ray]] is useful to exclude pneumonia which is more common in those with a fever, [[Tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[Tachypnea|fast respiratory rate]], or who are old.&lt;ref name=Wen2006/&gt;
* A sputum sample showing [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s (inflammatory white blood cells) and [[microbiological culture|culture]] showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as [[Streptococcus|''Streptococcus'' species]].
* A [[blood test]] would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised [[white blood cell]] count and elevated [[C-reactive protein]]).

==Prevention==
An oral whole cell nontypeable [[Haemophilus influenzae vaccine]] may protect against the disease, but "the evidence is mixed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teo|first1= Edward|last2=House|first2=Hugh|last3= Lockhart|first3=Kathleen |last4= Purchuri|first4= Sai Navya|last5= Pushparajah|first5= Jennifer|last6= Cripps |first6=Allan W |last7= van Driel|first7= Mieke L,|title=Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=2014| issue=9| pages= CD010010.|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010010.pub2|pmid=10796676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Most cases are [[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limited]] and resolve themselves in a few weeks.

===Antibiotics===
Evidence does not support the general use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis.&lt;ref name=Smith2014/&gt; While some evidence suggests antibiotics speed up resolution of the cough by about 12 hours there is a greater risk of gastrointestinal problems and no change in longer term outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=SM|last2=Smucny|first2=J|last3=Fahey|first3=T|title=Antibiotics for acute bronchitis.|journal=JAMA|volume=312|issue=24|pages=2678–9|pmid=25536260|doi=10.1001/jama.2014.12839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics use also leads to the promotion of [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]], which increase morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name="Cough"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hueston WJ | title = Antibiotics: neither cost effective nor 'cough' effective | journal = The Journal of Family Practice | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–5 |date=March 1997 | pmid = 9071245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smoking cessation===
{{details|Smoking cessation}}
To help the bronchial tree heal faster and not make bronchitis worse, [[tobacco smoking|smokers]] should quit smoking completely.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Prognosis==
Acute bronchitis usually lasts a few days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Bronchitis | publisher = Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research | date = 2007-04-20 | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchitis/DS00031/DSECTION=1 | accessdate = 2008-05-30 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325133230/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchitis/DS00031/DSECTION%3D1 | archivedate = 2008-03-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may accompany or closely follow a cold or the flu, or  may occur on its own. Bronchitis usually begins with a dry cough, including waking the sufferer at night. After a few days, it progresses to a wetter or productive cough, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, and headache. The fever, fatigue, and malaise may last only a few days, but the wet cough may last up to several weeks.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Should the cough last longer than a month, some physicians may issue a referral to an [[Otorhinolaryngology|otorhinolaryngologist]] (ear, nose and throat doctor) to see if a condition other than bronchitis is causing the irritation. It is possible that having irritated bronchial tubes for as long as a few months may inspire [[asthma]]tic conditions in some patients.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In addition, if one starts coughing  mucus tinged with blood, one should see a [[physician]]. In rare cases, physicians may conduct tests to see whether the cause of the bloody sputum is a serious condition such as [[tuberculosis]] or [[lung cancer]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Epidemiology==
Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases.&lt;ref name=Tac2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chest2006/&gt; About 5% of adults are affected and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year.&lt;ref name=Wen2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flem2007/&gt; It occurs more often in the winter.&lt;ref name=Wen2006/&gt;

In infants under one year of age, acute bronchitis was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the US in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb174-Emergency-Department-Visits-Overview.jsp|title=Overview of Emergency Department Visits in the United States, 2011|last=Weiss|first=A.J.|last2=Wier|first2=L.M.|date=June 2014|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|location=Rockville, MD|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803154735/http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb174-Emergency-Department-Visits-Overview.jsp|archive-date=2014-08-03|dead-url=no|access-date=|last3=Stocks|first3=C.|last4=Blanchard|first4=J.|work=HCUP Statistical Brief #174|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amami Wakōen Sanatorium''', or '''National Sanatorium Amami Wakōen''' is a sanatorium for leprosy or ex-leprosy patients in [[Amami]]-shi, [[Kagoshima]]-ken, [[Japan]] starting in 1943. In 2008, there were 56 almost healthy residents and their average age was about 80 years.

==History==
===Background===
The sanatorium in Amami Oshima was the last one of national sanatoriums starting with the Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium in 1930. There was considerable resistance within the island to the establishment of a sanatorium.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Leprosy History (1993) Shun-Ichi Yamamoto,  University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amami Wakoen===
*Dec 1943:Amami Wakoen was started.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Leprosy History (1993), Shun-Ichi Yamamoto, University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo p162&lt;/ref&gt;
*April 1944:Amami Wakoen was formally established. The first in-patients were 19.
*Sep 1944: The first director, Dr. Koh Yasuda died in a battle in China.
*Jun 1945: Employee Yoshinosuke Yanagida was killed by shooting from an airplane.
*Feb 2, 1946: Under American occupation.
*Jan 1948:　Promin was given by the Catholic Church and was used in 7 patients.
*Dec 1952:　Amami was returned to Japan. National Sanatorium Amami Wakoen.
*Apr 1996:The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
*Jul 1998: The trial for compensation started.
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was unconstitutional.
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods.

===Number of Patients===
The number of in-patients is the sum of patients which changed not only by the newly diagnosed hospitalized and those who died among in-patients, by other factors such as the number of patients who escaped or were discharged, depending on the condition of the times. Recently they were encouraged to be discharged, but the long period of the segregation policy causing leprosy stigma might influence the number of those who went into the society.

*Since 1996, it has been encouraged for the residents(ex-patients) to leave the sanatorium.

==Bringing up children born to leprosy patients==
*Children born to Hansen's disease patients in Amami-Oshima, Kagoshima, Japan (2009), Moriyama K et al. Jpn J Leprosy 78, 231-250: from Pubmed Nihon Hansenbyo Gakkai Zasshi. 2009 Sep;78(3):231-50.
*In Japan, in this sanatorium only, patients could give birth to children. In Japanese sanatoriums, marriage was all right, but it was difficult to give birth to their children, and vasectomy and interruption of pregnancy had been conducted. Catholic Joan Matsubara(later secretary of Wako-en), Father Patrick Finn, Kaoru Ohira,(director),outlined how children born to patients would be grown up and made the internal rules of the couples' dormitory. Between 1953 and 1954, children were grown up by Matsubara's family and nurses. And since November 1954, children were brought up at nurseries (First "Children's House", and later at "Naze Engel House") and children between 2 and 3 years went to "White Lily House". The children could meet their parents at times and now they are full-fledged grown-up citizens.

==Outlook for the future==
*There were 56 residents in 2008 and their mean age was about 80.  They hope that they will be cared for by the nation peacefully as long as they live. There have been many opportunities concerning how the sanatorium will remain under the care of the nation. However, there has been no clear vision.

Animals are exposed to tobacco smoke and other cigarette by-products through their use as experimental subjects and through contact with smokers, as in the case of pets in houses where smoking takes place.

==Direct exposure in experimental settings==
The first recorded attempts to artificially induce animal tumors through the application of tobacco products occurred in 1911.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol83/index.php |title = Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary Smoking |publisher = [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |year = 2004 |accessdate= 12 January 2009 |format = PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206231621/http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol83/index.php| archivedate= 6 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 series of [http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol83/index.php/ monographs] released by the [http://www.iarc.fr/ International Agency for Research on Cancer], a part of the [http://www.who.int/en/ World Health Organisation], summarized research from the 1960s onwards about the [[carcinogen]]icity of tobacco on various laboratory animals.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"/&gt;

===Methods===
As set out in the IARC monographs, the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke is determined in two ways. The first is through the application of cigarette-smoke condensates to skin. Cigarette-smoke condensates are collected by passing smoke through cold traps and recovering the retained material. The cigarettes are usually machine-smoked and the material is washed from the traps using a volatile substance such as acetone, which is then removed. Many of the procedures for collecting this cigarette-smoke-condensate have not yet been standardized across laboratories, including how the condensate is stored, in what numbers and fashion the cigarettes are smoked, and the type of solvent used. Once the condensate is collected, it is painted onto the skin of the animal test subjects, which are then examined at set intervals to assess the growth of tumors.

The second method, as described by the IARC monographs, used to measure the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke to animals is by exposing them to mainstream cigarette smoke. The IARC monographs define mainstream cigarette smoke as that which is emitted by the mouth end of the cigarette and therefore the smoke that human smokers would be exposed to most. The IARC monographs describe the methods and equipment that scientists have developed to make more effective and standardize the deliverance of mainstream cigarette smoke. These devices vary between whole-body and nose-only exposure, but typically involve machine smoked cigarette smoke being pumped into a small chamber that contains the animal test subjects. A variety of factors differentiate the experience of a human smoker from these animal test subjects'. Human smokers inhale smoke voluntarily and therefore do so more deeply than do animal test subjects which typically adopt short, shallow breaths when exposed to smoke. The animal test subjects, primarily rodents and dogs, also have significantly morphologically different upper respiratory system from humans. Despite these variables, the doses of smoke administered to these animals can be determined by examining tissue and blood samples. Dogs, which cannot be exposed to cigarette smoke via inhalation chambers as easily as can small rodents, require different methods of cigarette smoke exposure. These methods include thracheostomy, in which smoke is pumped through a tube directly into a hole cut in the dog's throat, or through a mask fitted to the dog's face.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"/&gt;

====Results====
The IARC monographs concluded that the application of cigarette-smoke condensates onto the skin of mice induces tumors, of both benign and malignant variety. Although the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke was first established in humans, various types of animals have also been exposed to tobacco smoke inhalation in attempts to yield further experimental proof and control for various experimental factors, including types of tobacco and levels of exposure, which would be considered unethical in human studies. The IARC monographs, referencing studies which used various methods of smoke inhalation, concluded that a significantly greater number of pulmonary tumors occurred among mice exposed to smoke than those in the control groups. Since the 1960s, the animal most used in testing the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke has been the Syrian [[Golden Hamster]] due to its resistance to pulmonary infections and the infrequency with which it spontaneously develops pulmonary tumors.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"/&gt; According to the IARC monographs these studies have proven, and repeatedly confirmed, the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke for hamsters.

Some studies referenced in the IARC monographs found that certain, but not all, groups of rats exposed to mainstream smoke were significantly more likely to develop lung tumors. The IARC monographs also referenced studies involving rabbits and dogs that were much less conclusive. The authors, however, cited various experimental limitations, such as small test or control groups and missing data, that could account for the lack of conclusive results.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"/&gt;

===Effects of environmental tobacco smoke===
Multiple studies have also been conducted to determine the carcinogenicity of environmental tobacco to animals. These studies typically fall under the categories of simulated environmental tobacco, administering condensates of [[sidestream smoke]], or observational studies of cancer among pets.

===Simulated environmental tobacco smoke===
To study the consequences of passive smoking, scientists expose animals to sidestream smoke, that which emanates from the cigarette's burning cone and through its paper, or a combination of mainstream and sidestream smoke.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"/&gt; The IARC monographs conclude that mice with prolonged exposure to simulated second-hand smoke, that is six hours a day, five days a week, for five months with a subsequent four-month interval before dissection, will have significantly higher inicidence and multiplicity of lung tumors than with control groups.

====Condensates of sidestream smoke====
The IARC monographs concluded that sidestream smoke condensates had a significantly higher carcinogenic effect upon mice than did mainstream smoke condensates.&lt;ref name="iarc-monograph"/&gt;

====Observational studies in pets====
Second-hand smoke is recognized as a risk factor for cancer in pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.livescience.com/animals/070831_pets_smoking.html |title = Secondhand Smoke Causes Cancer in Pets |first = Andrea |last = Thompson |publisher = LiveScience |date = 31 August 2007 |accessdate = 31 August 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901184450/http://www.livescience.com/animals/070831_pets_smoking.html| archivedate= 1 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[Tufts University|Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] linked the occurrence of feline oral cancer to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke through an overexpression of the [[p53]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Snyder LA, Bertone ER, Jakowski RM, Dooner MS, Jennings-Ritchie J, Moore AS |title=p53 expression and environmental tobacco smoke exposure in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma. |journal=Vet Pathol |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=209–14 |year=2004 |pmid=15133168 |doi=10.1354/vp.41-3-209 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted at the same universities concluded that cats living with a smoker were more likely to get [[feline lymphoma]]; the risk increased with the duration of exposure to second-hand smoke and the number of smokers in the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bertone ER, Snyder LA, Moore AS |title= Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Risk of Malignant Lymphoma in Pet Cats. |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=156 |issue=3 |pages=268–273 |year=2002 |pmid=12142262 |doi= 10.1093/aje/kwf044 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Colorado State University]] researchers, looking at cases of canine lung cancer, was generally inconclusive, though the authors reported a weak relation for lung cancer in dogs exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. The number of smokers within the home, the number of packs smoked in the home per day, and the amount of time that the dog spent within the home had no effect on the dog's risk for lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reif JS, Dunn K, Ogilvie GK, Harris CK |title=Passive smoking and canine lung cancer risk. |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=234–9 |year=1992 |pmid=1546698 |ref=harv |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a tobacco-industry researcher in [[Germany]] proposed a study of the effects on animals of lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke. The proposed study was blocked by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drope J, Chapman S |title=Tobacco industry efforts at discrediting scientific knowledge of environmental tobacco smoke: a review of internal industry documents |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=55 |issue=8 |pages=588–94 |year=2001 |pmid=11449018|doi=10.1136/jech.55.8.588 |pmc=1731959 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described in an internal company report:

{{quote|PM [Philip Morris] recently succeeded in blocking Adlkofer's plan to conduct lifetime animal inhalation study of sidestream smoke. ( . . .an INBIFO study has shown that in 90-day inhalation test, no non-reversible changes has [sic] been detected. In a lifetime study, the results were almost certain to be less favorable. Based on the analysis, the other members of the German industry agreed that the proposed study should not proceed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pmdocs.com/PDF/2023036828_6838_0.PDF |title = Smoking and health research activities in Europe |publisher = Philip Morris document archive |accessdate = 10 August 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 2008 study conducted by the [[Henry Ford Health System]] found that given information about the harmful effects of passive smoking on their pets, 28.4% of pet owners who smoke would be motivated to quit, 8.7% would ask those who live with them to quit, and 14.2% would stop smoking indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milberger SM, Davis RM, Holm AL |title=Pet owners' attitudes and behaviours related to smoking and second-hand smoke: a pilot study. |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=156–158 |year=2008 |pmid=19208667 |doi=10.1136/tc.2008.028282 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal nicotine poisoning==
Animals like dogs, cats, squirrels, and other small animals are affected not only by second-hand smoke inhalation, but also [[nicotine poisoning]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Domestic pets, especially dogs, usually fall ill when owners leave nicotine products like cigarette butts, chewing tobacco, or nicotine gum within reach of the animal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Littered cigarette butts from smokers can be a problem for small animals which mistake them for food if they find them, particularly in urban environments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Cigarette butt]]s are the remains of a cigarette after smoking which contain the [[Cigarette filter|filter]] which is meant to contain tar, particles, and toxins from the cigarette such as ammonia, arsenic, benzene, turpentine and other [[List of additives in cigarettes|toxins]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Cigarette butts can be found in high quantities as litter. It can take 18 months to 10 years for the filter to degrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Martin|first= Terry |title= Cigarette Litter and How It Affects Us|url= http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/cigaretteingredients/a/ciglitter.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cigarette litter awareness campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Butt out!|url=http://savannahnow.com/stories/061103/LOCcigbutts.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; encourage smokers to avoid littering and to even carry pocket ashtrays, cigarette butts rank number one on the list of worst litter problems in the U.S. This makes it easy for small animals like puppies, squirrels, and raccoons to find and unsuspectingly consume nicotine. A reported 4.5 trillion cigarette butts wind up as litter worldwide per year. Cigarette butts reportedly account for 30% of the waste items found on U.S. shorelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carlozo |first=Louis R. | title=Kicking butts |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-06-18/features/0806170174_1_cigarette-butts-secondhand-beach-house | work=Chicago Tribune | date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be a hazard to animals like seagulls and turtles because when placed in large bodies of water like oceans, the toxins of the cigarette butt can be detrimental to marine life.  Researchers at San Diego State University claim that filter-tipped cigarette butts are toxic especially for marine and fresh-water fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Joyce |first=Ed |title=SDSU Study Says Cigarette Butts Kill Fish |url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2009/may/01/sdsu-study-says-cigarette-butts-kill-fish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even just one cigarette butt alone soaking in water for a day is hazardous enough to kill 50% of fish in a litre of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramos |first=Will |title=Cigarette Butts Toxic to Fish |url=http://www.oceanleadership.org/2009/cigarette-butts-toxic-to-fish/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113095222/http://www.oceanleadership.org/2009/cigarette-butts-toxic-to-fish/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins have the most blubber in the marine life and toxins concentrate there, thus dolphins especially are the most affected by the toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effect of cigarette butt pollution on marine life |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/22910665/Effect-of-cigarette-butt-pollution-on-marine-life/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918183134/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/22910665/Effect-of-cigarette-butt-pollution-on-marine-life |archivedate=18 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toxins of the cigarette butt can cause health problems in animals like vomiting, tremors and hypersalivation. Veterinary Medicine published a case of a 10-year-old female Labrador retriever ingesting cigarette butts. The Labrador vomited several times and had increased blood urea nitrogen, total protein, and albumin concentrations with hemolysis and lipemia also observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hackendahl NC, Sereda CW |title=The Dangers of Nicotine Ingestion In Dogs |journal=Veterinary Medicine |pages=218–224 |date=March 2004 |url=http://www.aspcapro.org/animal-poison-control/documents/zj-toxbrief_0304.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111007155524/http://www.aspcapro.org/animal-poison-control/documents/zj-toxbrief_0304.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 October 2011 |format=PDF |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apomorphine hydrochloride and activated charcoal had to be administered along with other fluids. 5 days after the incident, the dog's health returned to normal. The toxic level of nicotine in a dog or cat is reported as 20–100&amp;nbsp;mg which is about one to five cigarettes.

A newer product available in some markets, nicotine [[dissolvable tobacco|dissolvables]], contains about 1&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotine per pellet. Other products like Camel Strips which contain 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotine per strip and sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|title=Tobacco company's new, dissolvable nicotine products could lead to accidental poisoning |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100419090943.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this nicotine content is low in comparison to a cigarette, these items can be more attractive to unwary small animals like puppies.

==Controversy between animal rights activists and the tobacco industry==
Much controversy exists over animal testing especially with nicotine and tobacco products. Animal activism groups are especially vocal about claims of companies like Phillip Morris funding animal tobacco research. There has always much tension between [[animal rights|animal activists groups]], and researchers and this became especially visible with the serious attack against a researcher. [[Edythe D. London]], a UCLA professor leading a 3-year study was targeted by activists and her home was flooded by the Animal Liberation Front. A fire-bomb was also left in front of her house by the North American Animal Liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hermes |first=JJ |title=Animal Rights|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Animal-Rights-Militants/160 |accessdate= 28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident Edyth London wrote an article titled "Why I use animals in my research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=London |first= Edythe |title= Why I Use Animals In My Research |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/01/opinion/oe-london1/2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, London expressed an interest in solving the problem of addiction and offering help to those who  need help in quitting their tobacco addiction. She did admit to being funded by [[Philip Morris USA]] and sees no problem with it.

On the Philip Morris website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=PhillipMorrisUSA |title= Philip Morris USA |url=http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Products/Cigarettes/Research_Development/Animal_Care_Use_Statement/default.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the company claims that they do not presently conduct internal research with the use of laboratory animals. They do fund external research, but claim to do so in a humane and responsible manner as shown by their accreditation by the [[Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care]].

In 2001, [[Natural American Spirit|American Spirit]] claimed to have turned to cruelty-free cigarettes in which the company doesn't conduct cigarette testing using animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smoking Animals |url=http://www.smokinganimals.com/aspirit.html |accessdate= 28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was praised by animal activists groups and used to encourage other tobacco companies to follow the leadership of American Spirit.

The main argument of animal activists, besides the ethical treatment of animals, is there is no point in continuing to perform these experiments on animals to prove the detrimental effects of tobacco, which are already known. The Impact Press like claims that "in one experiment, vivisectors cut holes in beagles' throats and made them breathe concentrated cigarette smoke for an entire year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Healther |title=Dying For a Cigarette |url= http://www.impactpress.com/articles/febmar02/cigs2302.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also claims that at the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, the rhesus monkeys live in tight, metal cages and pregnant monkeys are exposed to nicotine. There is also disapproval by animal activists of a March of Dimes funded study in which nicotine was given to pregnant rats, and then the offspring were tested to see how they performed in a maze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine |title=Concerns About the March of Dimes |url=http://www.pcrm.org/resch/charities/mod_common_qs.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716211005/http://www.pcrm.org/resch/charities/mod_common_qs.html |archivedate=16 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like [[PETA]] are using slogans like "Don't get burned by Philip Morris. They're using your money to hurt animals". PETA also claims that there is still a question as to the reliability of results from animal testing for tobacco studies. According to an article, federal regulatory and research agencies have almost 200 test methods which guarantee effectiveness in animal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wanjek |first= Christopher |title=Why Lab Animals Are Still Used |url=http://www.livescience.com/health/080212-bad-animal-testing.html |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods]] exists to review these methods. Some researchers, however, continue to argue that there are [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] of cigarette-smoking which still need to be conducted, and that animal studies are not superfluous, but necessary.

== History ==

=== Anthem Insurance Company===

Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two [[Indianapolis]], Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.&lt;ref name=directory/&gt; The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,&lt;ref name=ibj1989&gt;{{cite news|title=The Blues Battle Back: Agents, Brokers See Major Restructuring, Marketing Shift as Effort to Revive Sagging Image, Recoup Dwindling Market Share|author=John B. Thomas|date=21 August 1989|work=Indianapolis Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and merged in 1985 as parent company, '''Associated Insurance Companies, Inc,''' to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.&lt;ref name="ibj1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoovers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.WellPoint_Inc.cf4bc120e33b9019.html|title=WellPoint, Inc.|publisher=Hoovers|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibj1994&gt;{{cite news|title=Associated Group on the grow again|author=A.J. Schneider|date=5 December 1994|work=Indianapolis Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to '''The Associated Group''' (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,&lt;ref name="hoovers.com"/&gt; and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.

Formerly Anthem Inc. was an [[insurance]] company which began in the 1980s as a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of the group insurance operations of [[American General Insurance]].

'''Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield''' was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=ASSOCIATED GROUP/COMMUNITY MUTUAL MERGER CREATES ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ASSOCIATED+GROUP%2FCOMMUNITY+MUTUAL+MERGER+CREATES+ANTHEM+BLUE+CROSS...-a017545059|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=PRNewswire|date=October 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield]] organizations of several states to achieve [[economy of scale]], converting them in the process from [[non-profit]] to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and [[WellPoint]] merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
 
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock.   WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.

WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.

Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of [[Anthem (insurance)|Anthem]] and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.&lt;ref name=directory&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brennan, Gerald|author2=David E. Salamie|title=WellPoint, Inc.|publisher=International Directory of Company Histories|editor=Jay P. Pederson|volume=103|date=2009|pages=505–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.&lt;ref name="amednews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amednews.com/article/20041220/business/312209996/2/|title=Anthem, WellPoint merge into largest health plan|publisher=American Medical News|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.&lt;ref name="amednews.com"/&gt; At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.&lt;ref name="amednews.com"/&gt;

In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to '''Anthem Inc.'''.

For the fiscal year 2017, Anthem reported earnings of US$3.843 billion, with an annual revenue of US$90.039 billion, an increase of 6.1% over the previous fiscal cycle.

*October 2017: Anthem said it would not renew its [[pharmacy benefit management]] relationship with [[Express Scripts]] saying Express had overcharged it $3 billion and that it would eventually handle the PBM process itself through its new IngenioRx unit.  The Express Scripts contract expires in 2019 and Anthem said it would enter a 5-year contract with [[CVS Health]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-18/anthem-breaking-with-express-scripts-plans-own-benefits-firm&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically Cigna in March 2018 announced plans to acquire Express Scripts for $58 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/business/dealbook/cigna-express-scripts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state [[patient advocacy]] office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opa.ca.gov/about/consumer_information/files/pdf/OPA%20Booklet_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723124810/http://www.opa.ca.gov/about/consumer_information/files/pdf/OPA%20Booklet_2011.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-health-ratings-20140129,0,1664847.story|title=Report criticizes California health plans for treatment of chronic ailments|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=28 March 2014|first=Chad|last=Terhune|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Giving for uninsured ===
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |title=WellPoint's giving for uninsured falls short, records show |author=Noam Levey |date=March 18, 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wellpoint18-2010mar18,0,7460942,full.story }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy cancellations===
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Reuters |date=March 18, 2010 |url=http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/SPECIAL-REPORT-Insurer-targeted-HIV-patients-to-drop-coverage-2010-03-17T133338Z |title=Special Report: Insurer targeted HIV patients to drop coverage |author=Murray Waas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/04/24-1 |title=WellPoint Routinely Targets Breast Cancer Patients &amp;#124; Common Dreams &amp;#124; Breaking News &amp; Views for the Progressive Community |publisher=Common Dreams |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the [[California Department of Managed Health Care]]. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), [[WellPoint]] paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any [[medical debt]]s incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.

In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a [[computer algorithm]], identified women recently diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournalism.org/2010/10/reuters-and-milwaukee-journal-sentinel-receive-2010-barlett-steele-awards-2/|title=2010 Barlett &amp; Steele Award Winners|date=5 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabew.org/2010/10/reuters-milwaukee-j-s-win-11-barlett-steele-awards/|title=Reuters, Milwaukee J-S win ’10 Barlett &amp; Steele Awards|work=sabew.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[Kathleen Sebelius]], and President [[Barack Obama]], to call on WellPoint to end the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2253577/|title=How WellPoint's bad behavior advances health care reform.|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with [[credit card]]s, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20110920,0,2211923.column Using plastic to pay Anthem bill? Prepare to lose your coverage] By David Lazarus September 20, 2011, Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to health care reform ===
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to [[Max Baucus]], the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33129315/ Fact or fiction? Senate chairman has ties to big insurer]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, WellPoint’s [[Anthem Blue Cross]] unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for [[Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration|health care reform]]. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. [[Jerry Brown]] to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-insurers-reform3-2009sep03,0,2545747.story |work=LA Times|title=Group alleges illegal actions by two giant health insurers Consumer Watchdog accuses WellPoint and UnitedHealthcare of pressuring workers|date= 3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care reform law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Bloomberg|title=UnitedHealth Joins WellPoint to hone Health Law Lobby|date= January 31, 2011|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-31/unitedhealth-joins-wellpoint-in-alliance-aiming-to-hone-health-law-lobby.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 premium increase in Maine ===
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of [[Maine]] for the right to increase premiums further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seminal.firedoglake.com/diary/8735|title=WellPoint Sues Maine To Raise Premiums 18.5% - MyFDL|work=firedoglake.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/05/wellpoint-subsidiary-figh_n_309529.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Arthur | last=Delaney | title=WellPoint Subsidiary Fights Maine Over Big Rate Hike (VIDEO) | date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mainecahc.org/publications/Anthem_summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 premium increase in California ===
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some [[Anthem Blue Cross]] individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt; Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a [[poster child]] for the problem of rising US [[health costs]], when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;  The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, [http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-02-06/business/17848006_1_health-insurance-department-of-insurance-plans-home-and-automobile-insurers Anthem blue cross raises premiums]&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;

To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as [[unemployment]] and declining [[wages]] led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/health/policy/16anthem.html In California exhibit a on Insurance], Feb 16 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9830192 Anthem to delay insurance rate hike amid criticism], Feb 13 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".&lt;ref&gt;San Jose Mercury News, [http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_14435478?source=most_viewed Feinstein takes on anthem blue cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reclassifying expenses===
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new [[loss ratio]] requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Igor |last=Volsky|title=WellPoint Reclassifies Costs As ‘Medical Care’ To Meet Reform’s Medical Loss Ratio Requirement|work= Think Progress|date= March 31, 2010|url= http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/03/31/wellpoint-mlr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009-10 security breach===
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online.  After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not.  As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open.  After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a [[class-action lawsuit]] against Anthem.  While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach.  According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.&lt;ref&gt;Perkes, Courtney.

[[KABC-TV]], 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denying benefits===
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for [[stage four cancer]]s, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/05/28/health-insurance-provider-denies-cancer-treatment-premium-mri-scan-tumor-sonoma-county-man-battling-cancer-denied-coverage-by-anthem-blue-cross-after-paying-100k-in-premiums/ |title=Sonoma County Man Battling Cancer Denied Coverage By Anthem Blue Cross After Paying $100K In Premiums |author=Andria Borba |publisher=KPIX-CBS San Francisco |date=May 28, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-29}} includes video and transcript of coverage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoekeating.tumblr.com/post/86148140639/unbelievable|title=Unbelievable |publisher=tumblr.com |date=2014-05-18 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/05/30/anthem-blue-cross-to-cover-sonoma-county-cancer-patient-after-kpix-5-report-health-insurance-provider-denies-treatment-premium-mri-scan-tumor-paying-100k-in-premiums-jeffrey-rusch-zoe-keating/|title=Anthem Blue Cross To Cover Sonoma County Cancer Patient After KPIX 5 Report|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 medical data breach===
{{main|Anthem medical data breach}}
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain [[personally identifiable information]] from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association#Member companies|brands Anthem, Inc. uses]] to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, [[Amerigroup]], [[Caremore]], and [[UniCare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/data-breach-at-health-insurer-anthem-could-impact-millions/|title=Data Breach at Health Insurer Anthem Could Impact Millions —  Krebs on Security|work=krebsonsecurity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Healthlink]] says it was also a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthlink homepage|url=http://www.healthlink.com|website=healthlink.com|accessdate=10 February 2015|location=Center of page; even the Anthem page doesn't reference Healthlink.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised.

'''''Are the Kids Alright?''''' is a documentary film which explores mental health care for children and youths at risk in Texas. The filmmaker, [[Ellen Spiro]], gained unprecedented access to troubled children and their families, as well as the judicial, psychiatric and correctional institutions. By following several different families, the filmmakers document the results of the decline in the availability of mental health services for the youth who most desperately need it.

[[File:Natural Beehive.jpg|thumb|right|Bees in a natural hive, located at Coromandel Valley, South Australia.]]
'''Beelining''' (also known as '''bee lining''', '''bee hunting''', and '''coursing bees''') is an ancient art used to locate [[feral]] [[Western honey bee|bee]] colonies. It is performed by capturing and marking foraging worker bees, then releasing them from various points to establish (by elementary [[trigonometry]]) the direction and distance of the colony's home.{{cn|date=December 2015}} Beeliners generally have homemade capture boxes which aid them in their quest.

Beelining was formerly a serious occupation in [[Appalachia]] where it was a means to obtain [[honey]] as a sweetener, and sometimes to capture wild colonies for [[domestication]]. When a [[hollow tree]] (gum) was found, it often was sawed above and below the colony and carried back to be set up as a kept [[beehive (beekeeping)|hive]] near home. Honey was harvested from such colonies by "sulphuring," (using burning [[sulfur]]) to kill the [[insect]]s.

Feral hives in the USA are uncommon since the arrival of [[varroa]] mites in the 1980s, and may represent an important, though small, pool of genetic resistance to the mites.  Their value as potential breeding stock may far outweigh the value of their honey.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

'''Benenden Health''' (formerly '''The Post Office Sanatorium Society''') is a mutual society in the UK providing private medical cover. Its membership consists of over 800,000 individuals and employees of corporate schemes provided by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benenden.co.uk/about-benenden/|title=About Benenden|last=|first=|date=|website=www.benenden.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benenden Health has been the shirt sponsor of [[York City F.C.|York City Football Club]] since the 2012–13 season.

==History==
'''The Post Office Sanatorium Society''' was founded in 1905 to help working class [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]] employees control the [[tuberculosis]] epidemic when conventional medical insurance was not widely affordable. The business model of weekly member fees was proposed by a Post Office clerk, Charles Garland.

In 1923 the name became '''The Post Office and Civil Service Sanatorium Society''', as the membership was opened to a new industry. In October 1990, the registered office moved from [[London]] to [[York]].  ''Ahead of its Time'', a film about Benenden Health's history was made by Trafalgar Productions in 2011.

In June 2012, delegates at Benenden Health's annual conference in [[Manchester]] voted to remove the last of its membership eligibility criteria, meaning that any [[United Kingdom]] resident aged 16 and over can now join Benenden Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benenden.co.uk/media-centre/benenden-healthcare-set-to-open-doors-to-all/ |title=Benenden Healthcare set to open doors to all |publisher=benenden.co.uk|date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2012, Benenden Health became shirt sponsor of [[York City F.C.|York City Football Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benenden.co.uk/media-centre/benenden-healthcare-to-support-wembley-winners-york-city-fc-in-forthcoming-season/ |title=Benenden Healthcare to support Wembley winners York City FC in forthcoming season |publisher=benenden.co.uk|date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, 'Benenden Healthcare Society' rebranded with new trading style 'benenden health'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benenden.co.uk/media-centre/benenden-healthcare-rebrands-and-looks-to-grow-in-tough-healthcare-market/ |title=Benenden Healthcare rebrands and looks to grow in tough healthcare market|publisher=benenden.co.uk|date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rebrand, the society also enabled a free mid-season shirt swap with [[York City F.C.|York City Football Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/sport/10177059.York_City_sponsor_in____Shirt_Swap___/ |title=York City sponsor in "Shirt Swap"|publisher=yorkpress.co.uk|date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Benenden Health was voted UK's 'most trusted' private healthcare provider for the third year running in the Moneywise Most Trusted awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benenden.co.uk/media-centre/benenden-health-scoops-hat-trick-of-prestigious-customer-service-awards/ |title=Benenden Health scoops hat trick of prestigious customer service awards|publisher=yorkpress.co.uk|date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2018, it has been voted for this award for seven years running.

As of 2015, the organisation was trading as 'Benenden'.

In 2017, Benenden Health was voted 'Most trusted health insurance provider via employer' in the Moneywise Customer Service Awards.

In early 2018, the society rebranded as Benenden Health.

==Services==
Benenden Health has recently added further products beyond healthcare, including travel and home insurance. Benenden Health relaunched a Health Cash Plan for its members in 2017.

Satisfaction surveys vary from a 2017 in-house survey where [https://www.benenden.co.uk/health/cover/healthcare/benenden-healthcare-reviews/ 4 out of 5] existing members said they'd recommend the organisation (from 1,208 reviews) to its own Facebook page reviews section. The company was awarded a 1 star rating in a Best Companies survey in 2015/16 and achieved the status of 'one to watch' in 2017.

==Benenden Hospital==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:ben hospital.jpg|frame|Entrance to Benenden Hospital]] --&gt;
Benenden Hospital was founded in 1907 in [[Benenden]], [[Kent]] and became the centre for hospital treatment for members of Trade Unions and Friendly Societies and subsequently large numbers of public sector employees who joined what is now Benenden Health.

The services provided at the hospital have moved with the times. From treatment for tuberculosis - which was its original role - to the management of chest diseases, to the current day where the hospital provides a wide range of consultation, diagnosis and treatment services for most medical and surgical specialties.

In recent years the hospital has increasingly taken patients who are not members of Benenden Health. Local [[National Health Service]] agencies are increasing their use of the hospital's facilities, as are patients who use private medical insurance or who pay directly for their own hospital care. The hospital provides a range of clinical services which are tailored to meet the needs of individual patients. The hospital has a Modern Matron – a senior and experienced professional – who has the authority to resolve problems.  It was rated outstanding by the [[Care Quality Commission]] in May 2017.  22% of its activity is now commissioned by the NHS, mostly orthopaedic, gynaecology and ophthalmology surgery for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent provider to NHS rated 'outstanding' by CQC|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/7018003.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT0RsaVlqaGtOekV3WlRnMiIsInQiOiJrM0ZcL0wzVmVreFlabnhWUHF0aHk3eVRHd2VkeFdZbWpxbjgwNHRwdUZUQ3FPV2h4WjFhTFhITlZXR1hxaGQ2UFJ2V3BpeFF0cTNTeldHZzlJa1lwQ0pRalwvQXcyZW9lUEZpN2RwMEdBQzIrQ05ZRFhaWlwvODNEWXFBdEhjOFZFQiJ9|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WOOLMORE STREET BRITISH RESTAURANT 1942.jpg|right|thumb|A ''British Restaurant'' in Woolmore Street, [[Poplar, London]] in 1942]]
'''British Restaurants''' were communal kitchens created in 1940 during the Second World War to help people who had been bombed out of their homes, had run out of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|ration coupons]] or otherwise needed help.&lt;ref &gt;see "Sources for the History of London 1939–45: Rationing" [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/War/londonRation.html ''History in Focus: War'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|pages=129-154}} In 1943, 2,160 British Restaurants served 600,000 very inexpensive meals a day.{{sfnp|Calder|1969|page=386}} They were disbanded in 1947. There was a political dimension as well, as the Labour Party saw them as a permanent solution to equalising consumption across the class line and guaranteeing a nourishing diet to the poor.{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|pages=144-145}}

==Second World War==
Originally called 'Community Feeding Centres', the name British Restaurants was chosen by the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]].{{sfnp|Calder|1969|page=386}}  They were set up by the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and run by local government or voluntary agencies on a non-profit basis. Meals were sold for a set maximum price of 9[[penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (equivalent to just under 4[[penny sterling|p]], about US$2 or [[Pound Sterling|£]]1 GBP in purchasing power 2008) or less. No-one could be served with a meal of more than one serving of meat, game, poultry, fish, eggs, or cheese.&lt;ref name=molas97 &gt;{{citation
  |url=http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/foodrationpage9.htm |title=Food Rationing pages at www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608211311/http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/foodrationpage9.htm |archivedate=8 June 2008 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one in ten restaurants the meals were prepared at central depots.  Schools were often used because they had cafeterias and kitchens. In London, mobile canteens delivered meals to air raid shelters and on the street in the aftermath of air raids.{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|page=142}}

By contrast, ordinary private restaurants continued in operation and were not subject to rationing. They did have some restrictions: for instance, no meal could be more than three courses and the maximum price was five shillings (equivalent to $10 or £5 in buying power by 2008). 

By mid-1941, over two hundred British Restaurants operated in the [[London County Council]] area, although the [[Wartime Social Survey]] conducted in 1942–43 indicated they were more popular in London than in the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=histac &gt;{{citation

  | title=The Home Front | publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]] | date=2005 | orig-year =
1945 | isbn=1-904897-11-8 | page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1943, there were some 2,160 British Restaurants across the country, serving around 600,000 meals per day for around 9d a time.{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|pages=125-139}} 546 authorities made profits and 203 made losses, though they were set up to be [[not-for-profit]].

Some smaller places did not qualify for a British Restaurant, but, instead, had what was termed a "Cash and Carry Restaurant" with meals being delivered from a nearby British Restaurant.&lt;ref name=bpears&gt;{{citation
  | url=http://www.bpears.org.uk/Misc/War_NE/w_section_03.html | chapter=3. Food and rationing | accessdate=9 May 2009 | title=Rowlands Gill and the North East | last=Pears|first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food in British Restaurants==
The ministry's dieticians prepared food based upon regional preferences and health. For example, the food served in Scotland was very different from that served in London due to the taste preferences of the inhabitants. Health was also a concern for BRs, as they were supposed to provide diners with "one third of the day's energy needs".{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|pages=129-154}} The dieticians were especially concerned with [[Vitamin C]] intake. Due to the war efforts and rationing, fruit intake was extremely limited. Vegetables such as cabbage, which has a high percentage of Vitamin C, were implemented as a staple vegetable in BRs, in order to provide diners with beneficial nutrients. There was concern that, with mass catering, vitamins such as Vitamin C would be destroyed in the food sources.{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|pages=129-154}}

The food in British Restaurants was said to be filling and of good quality. For 9d, customers could get a three-course meal. Traditionally, customers wanted a meal of meat and two vegetables. Most BRs served choices of five meat dishes, five vegetables, and five desserts. BRs in more populated areas had even more options. Popular dishes included roasts and potatoes, which acted as a substitute for bread. The foods served in British Restaurants could be prepared in large quantities, which made them good options for feeding an abundance of people.{{sfnp|Atkins|2011|pages=129-154}} The preparation of food in BRs was industrialised, which also helped with inexpensive, commercial food preparation. For example, volunteers sliced potatoes with machines, rather than by hand.&lt;ref &gt;HuntleyFilmArchives (2014-01-24), World War Two British Restaurant. Film 91022, retrieved 2017-04-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
After 1947 some restaurants were converted, under the [[Civic Restaurants Act 1947|Civic Restaurants Act]], into civic restaurants run by the local council. In 1949, 678 still existed throughout the United Kingdom. The restaurants moved beyond the privations of wartime and into the new world of a Labour government making many changes to the social fabric of the country. The Labour Minister of Food, [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], noted that "private enterprise in the catering trade has, on the whole and by and large, catered for the middle class and not for the working class."&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite hansard

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a civic restaurant operated at a loss for three consecutive years the act provided that ministerial consent would be needed for it to continue to remain open. These restaurants existed at least into the mid-1950s.

'''Cannabis in Slovenia''' is illegal but decriminalized. While medical marijuana is not allowed, the use of certain cannabinoid drugs is permitted.

==Classification==
In 2012, a proposal was drafted to decriminalize medical cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za4zakone.webs.com/|title=za4zakone|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to obtain the necessary support. A new proposal was drafted in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sksk.si/index.php?topic=zakon|title=Zakon - SKSK|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which succeeded in gaining enough public support. As a result, the Slovenian government re-classified cannabinoids as Class II illegal drugs (from the original Class I), thus allowing for the medical use of cannabinoid drugs but not medical marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/zdravje/novice/slovenija-dovolila-uporabo-konoplje-v-medicinske-namene/339830|title=Slovenija dovolila uporabo konoplje v medicinske namene|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nijz.si/uporaba-konoplje-v-medicini|title=Uporaba konoplje v medicini|work="NIJZ"|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
The possession of any drug for personal use in small quantities is not registered as a criminal act in Slovenia, but it is instead a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of 42-210€ or up to 5 days of jail. It is in this sense that it is considered "decriminalized". This can be reduced further if the offender agrees to undergo treatment. This policy is similar to the one in force in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=23256|title=Zakon o proizvodnji in prometu s prepovedanimi drogami (ZPPPD)|work="Uradni List"|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat Crew had proceeded to the [[fishing trawler]] ''Sea King'' in ''motor lifeboat 44381'', because the trawler had lost power off the Columbia bar, and was taking on water. Sexton had helped treat a wounded fisherman, had helped bring over portable pumps to pump out the trawler, when the trawler unexpectedly turned over. Two of the trawler's crew, and the Coast Guardsmen, were thrown into the Ocean, and were eventually rescued, but Sexton and two other crew members were trapped in the vessel's pilot house, and drowned.

==Coast Guard Medal citation==
His award citation stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Petty Officer SEXTON is cited for extraordinary heroism on 11 January 1991 while serving as [[emergency medical technician]] aboard [[USCG motor life boat|Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat]] CG-44381. The boat crew was responding to a distress call from F/V SEA KING, a 75-foot stern [[fishing trawler|trawler]] with four persons on board, which was taking on water and in danger of sinking, four nautical miles northwest of the [[Columbia River Bar]], with her decks awash and after compartment and engine room steadily filling up with water. From the relative safety the motor lifeboat, Petty Officer SEXTON unselfishly volunteered to go aboard the foundering fishing vessel to treat the injuries of a SEA KING crew member who had fallen to the deck boat during a failed helicopter hoist. He skillfully diagnosed the victim’s injuries, informed the flight surgeon of the extent of the injuries and provided first aid treatment. Once the victim was stabilized, Petty Officer SEXTON turned his attention to assisting with the dewatering of the vessel. The SEA KING required several dewatering pumps to remove the initial quantity of sea water from the engine room. Then, hourly dewatering of the vessel was necessary to maintain proper trim aboard the vessel. After more than 6 hours of this exhausting routine, with the worst of the treacherous bar crossing behind them, the SEA KING suddenly, without warning, rolled over, throwing victims into the churning seas and trapping Petty Officer SEXTON in the enclosed pilot house. He went down with vessel, sacrificing his life while attempting to save the lives of the SEA KING’s crew members. Petty Officer SEXTON demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent danger in this rescue. His courage and devotion to duty are most heartily commended and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sexton Hall==
The first barracks new Coast Guard recruits stay at, upon their arrival at the Coast Guard training depot in [[Cape May, New Jersey]], is named ''"Sexton Hall"'', in his honor.

'''Chemical phosphorus removal''' is a wastewater treatment method, where phosphorus is removed using salts of [[aluminum]] (e.g. [[alum]] or poly-aluminum chloride), [[iron]] (e.g. [[ferric chloride]]), or [[calcium]] (e.g. lime). [[Phosphate]] forms precipitates with the metal ions and is removed together with the sludge in the separation unit ([[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation tank]], [[dissolved air flotation|flotation tank]], etc.).

====Burgus v. Braun (1997)====

Barden represented P. Burgess in her malpractice suit against Dr. Bennett Braun.  Burgess claimed that Braun’s use of repressed memory therapy and his diagnosis of “multiple personality disorder” caused them severe emotional, psychological, and financial harm.  The case was settled in 1997 for a record $10.6 Million. A wave of international media attention from this case—including a page 1, col. 1 story in the NYTimes—was instrumental in subsequent mental health reforms.&lt;ref name="Braun Media"&gt;[Belluck, P.  She Recovered Memories, Then Millions in Damages, The New York Times, pg 1, col 1, Nov 9, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;[Keenan, M., "The Devil and Dr. Braun," New City, Chicago, IL, June 22, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reform litigation regarding "Rebirthing Therapy" and Coercive "Holding Therapy" ====

"REBIRTHING THERAPY": Barden joined forces with the national media as well as prosecutors and legislators in Colorado to end “rebirthing therapy” in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;See, Rouse, Karen.  Rebirthing verdict may curb restraint therapy. Denver Post, April 22, 2001 See, Lowe, Peggy. Ethics specialist blasts 'rebirthing'. Rocky Mountain News,  April 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  "It's easily the most reckless and abusive treatment of a child I've ever seen," said Christopher Barden, a psychologist and lawyer who specializes in psychotherapy abuse cases. Barden testified for Jefferson County prosecutors in their criminal case against Evergreen therapists Connell Watkins and Julie Ponder.

COERCIVE "HOLDING THERAPY": Barden was appointed Special Assistant Attorney General in Utah to assist in the prosecution of “coercive attachment” therapists.  Joint litigation and legislative efforts closed the clinic and ended these practices. See, Santini, J.,  Legislative Panel Backs Measure That Would Ban 'Holding Therapy', The Salt Lake Tribune,  September 20, 2002, Friday, at Pg. A10.  "Before voting to support the measure, the Child Welfare Oversight Panel on Thursday considered testimony from Christopher Barden, an expert in child psychology, who called coercive therapy "quackery." "These therapists really believe they are helping people," Barden said, "just like lobotomizers believed they were helping people." The bill Barden co-authored and supported (HB05) to ban abusive practices passed the Utah House of Representatives by a 68-2 margin.

===Political campaign===
On April 28, 2010, Barden announced that he would seek the [[Republican Party of Minnesota]]'s endorsement for [[Attorney General of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcco.com/politics/attorney.general.election.2.1660920.html |title=Republican Kicks Off Bid To Unseat AG Swanson |publisher=wcco.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-10-22}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received that endorsement at the party's state convention on April 29, 2010, and lost his challenge to incumbent Attorney General [[Lori Swanson]] in the November 2010 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helgeson |first=Baird |url=http://www.startribune.com/blogs/92473324.html?elr=KArks7PYDiaK7DUvckD_V_jEyhD:UiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU |title=Barden receives GOP nod for attorney general |publisher=StarTribune.com |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Diet for a New America''''' is a 1987 bestselling book by [[John Robbins (author)|John Robbins]].&lt;ref name=robbins&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/02/garden/eating-well.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Eating Well|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Marian Burros|date=December 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book discusses [[vegetarianism]], the environmental impact of [[factory farming]] and [[animal rights]].&lt;ref name=robbins /&gt;

In 1991 [[KCET]], the Los Angeles [[PBS]] affiliate, produced a film documentary based on the book called ''Diet for a New America: Your Health, Your Planet''.&lt;ref name=KCET&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-16/entertainment/ca-1811_1_beef-council|title=KCET's 'Diet' Isn't Savory for Beef, Dairy Industries|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Sharon Bernstein|date=September 16, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is narrated by John Robbins and features interviews with [[Michael Klaper]], [[T. Colin Campbell]], and [[John A. McDougall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people=John Robbins|title=Diet for a New America: Your Health, Your Planet|url=https://archive.org/details/DietForANewAmerica |medium=Documentary|publisher=[[KCET]] (PBS)|location= |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Colman McCarthy]] and [[Cleveland Amory]] compared the book to [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''.&lt;ref name=robbins /&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarthy&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Geneva%20NY%20Finger%20Lake%20Times/Geneva%20NY%20Finger%20Lake%20Times%201988%20Aug%201988/Geneva%20NY%20Finger%20Lake%20Times%201988%20Aug%201988%20-%200220.pdf|title=A Calmer, Rational Approach|newspaper=Finger Lakes Times|author=[[Colman McCarthy]]|date=August 6, 1988|quote=Robbins has written a book that is the pioneering match of Aldo Leopold's ''Sand County Almanac'', John Rawls' ''A Theory of Justice'', and Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''Finger Lakes Times'' McCarthy writes: "Robbins has written a book that is the pioneering match of Aldo Leopold's ''[[A Sand County Almanac|Sand County Almanac]]'', John Rawls' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', and Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring''."&lt;ref name=mccarthy /&gt;

[[Marian Burros]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes: "Much of what Mr. Robbins has to say about diet in this country is unremarkable: we eat too much meat and dairy products. Much of what Mr. Robbins has to say about the inhumane treatment of animals on [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] is correct. But Mr. Robbins undermines his case by exaggerating; facts mix with factoids and anecdotes."&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23153">In the United States a '''Doctor of Physical Therapy''' ('''DPT''') degree is now an entry level professional degree. A DPT is a practitioner who is educated in many areas of rehabilitation. However, a Doctor of Physical Therapy is not a medical doctor and can't prescribe medications in some countries like the United Kingdom. A Transitional Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree is also offered for those who already hold a professional Bachelor or Master of Physical Therapy (BPT or MPT) degree. As of 2015, all accredited and developing physical therapist programs are DPT programs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;http://www.capteonline.org/uploadedFiles/CAPTEorg/State_Boards/MasterListofAccreditedPTPrograms.pdf#search=%22DPT%22&lt;/ref&gt; The DPT degree currently prepares students to be eligible for the PT license examination in all 50 states. Along with the license examination, some states do require physical therapists to take a law exam and a criminal background check. As of March 2017, there are 222 accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aptaapps.apta.org/accreditedschoolsdirectory/default.aspx?UniqueKey=|title=Accredited Schools Directory|website=aptaapps.apta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a DPT program the doctor of physical therapy may continue training in a [[residency (medicine)|residency]] and then fellowship. As of December 2013, there are 178 credentialed physical therapy residencies and 34 fellowships in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abptrfe.org/home.aspx|title=ABPTRFE|first=Brightfind2|last=Brightfind2|website=www.abptrfe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 63 additional developing residencies and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abptrfe.org/apta/abptrfe/Directory.aspx?navID=10737432672|title=Directory of Residency Programs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credentialed residencies are between 9 and 36 months while credentialed fellowships are between 6 and 36 months.

In 2000 the [[American Physical Therapy Association]] (APTA) passed its ''Vision 2020'' statement, which states (in part):

: "By 2020, physical therapy will be provided by physical therapists who are doctors of physical therapy, recognized by consumers and other health care professionals as the practitioners of choice to whom consumers have direct access for the diagnosis of, interventions for, and prevention of impairments, functional limitations, and disabilities related to movement, function, and health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.org/Vision2020/ |title=Vision 2020 |publisher=American Physical Therapy Association |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this statement highlights, the DPT program is an integral part of the APTA's continued advocacy for legislation granting consumers (''i.e.'' patients and clients) direct access to physical therapists, rather than requiring physician referral.  Direct access is said to decrease wait times for access to care and even help reduce both cost to consumer and overall healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elmwoodpark.suntimes.com/news/politics/10606269-418/direct-access-to-physical-therapists-being-sought.html |title=Direct access to physical therapists being sought |work=Elm Leaves |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 1, 2015, all 50 states and the District of Columbia currently allow some form of direct access to physical therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.org/Media/Releases/Legislative/2014/7/1/|title=Michigan Grants Patients Direct Access to Physical Therapists|first=Kelly|last=Gardner|website=www.apta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the DPT degree==
In 1992, the [[University of Southern California]] initiated the first post-professional "transitional" (DPT) program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacm.org/MedicalUnit/PhysicalTherapy.aspx|title=Physical Therapy:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This "transitional" DPT takes into account a physiotherapist's current level of knowledge and skill and purports to offer programs that upgrade clinical skills to meet the needs of the current health care environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Postprofessional Clinical Doctorates [Draft Document]. Consensus Conference on Postprofessional Education. Alexandria, Va: American Physical Therapy Association; 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey B. 2001 APTA Presidential Address: We have arrived! Phys Ther. 2001;81:1830- 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creighton University]] followed by initiating the first entry-level DPT program in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spahp.creighton.edu/admission/dpt/doctor-of-physical-therapy|title=Doctor of Physical Therapy|date=8 April 2016|website=spahp.creighton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy W. Healing the 
Generations: A History of Physical Therapy and the American Physical Therapy Association. Alexandria, Va: American Physical Therapy Association; 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor of Physiotherapy has since been adopted in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Australia the PhD or Professional Doctorate in Physiotherapy is offered by a number of Universities. These programmes are usually professional entry masters level programmes with the opportunity to undertake research to lead to a doctorate degree. Alternatively, these programmes are masters pre-qualifying Physiotherapy courses with an enhanced research element in the final phase of the course that leads to undertaking a doctorate. The first full pre-qualifying Doctorate in Physiotherapy programme in the United Kingdom was accredited in 2017 at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] in [[Glasgow]].

The typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Physical Therapy is 3 to 4 years after earning a bachelor's degree. Depending on residency and fellowship training, if undertaken, the doctor may have completed several years of additional training. Obtaining a DPT could also be done by accelerated programs offered by some universities that can be applied to by freshman. These programs give students the opportunity receive a bachelor's degree and DPT in 6- to 7- years.With these programs, there are various admission points over the course of their curriculum. Various programs allow students to apply directly out of high school and they will automatically matriculate into the professional phase of the program after completing the required undergraduate courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capteonline.org/uploadedFiles/CAPTEorg/About_CAPTE/Resources/Aggregate_Program_Data/AggregateProgramData_PTPrograms.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission==

Admission to a Doctor of Physical Therapy program in the USA is highly competitive. According to the Aggregate Program Data Report from CAPTE from 2016-2017, the average GPA for enrolling students was 3.6&lt;ref name=CAPTE17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capteonline.org/uploadedFiles/CAPTEorg/About_CAPTE/Resources/Aggregate_Program_Data/AggregateProgramData_PTPrograms.pdf |title=2016-2017 Aggregate Program Data|publisher=Commission on Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education |date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=2018-01-24 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of 3.10 - 3.88 for all programs.&lt;ref name=CAPTE17/&gt; On average there were 500 applicants per program with an average of 46 students enrolled&lt;ref name=CAPTE17/&gt;  A bachelor's degree generally is required before beginning a Doctor of Physical Therapy program, but there is no requirement on the degree earned, as long as all prerequisite course requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.org/ProspectiveStudents/Admissions/PTProcess/|title=Physical Therapist (PT) Admissions Process|first=Libby|last=Ross|website=www.apta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining a DPT could also be done by accelerated programs by some universities that can be applied by freshman. Through these programs students can receive a bachelor's degree and a DPT in 6- to 7- years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physical-therapists.htm#tab-4|title=Physical Therapists :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the admission process into schools, one must fulfill the course prerequisites of the program. Students also must obtain physical therapy experience from clinics with hours that might have to be verified by a physical therapist depending on the school they are applying to. The Graduate Record Examination(GRE) must be taken and submitted to the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apta.org/ProspectiveStudents/Admissions/PTProcess/|title=Physical Therapist (PT) Admissions Process|last=Ross|first=Libby|website=www.apta.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition Doctor of Physical Therapy degree==

The t-DPT degree is conferred upon completion of a structured postprofessional educational experience that results in the augmentation of knowledge, skills, and behaviors to a level consistent with the current professional (entry-level) DPT standards. The t-DPT degree enables the US-licensed physical therapist to attain degree parity with therapists who hold the professional DPT by filling in any gaps between their professional baccalaureate or master's degree PT education and the current professional DPT degree education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.org/PostprofessionalDegree/TransitionDPTFAQs/|title=FAQ: Postprofessional DPT (Transition)|first=Kelly|last=Gardner|website=www.apta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-professional DPT (Transitional) degree is designed to provide the doctoral credential to those who currently holding a master's or bachelor's degree in the field. Post-professional DPT (Transitional) degree programs are typically offered on a primarily online learning model and are often one year in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.org/PostprofessionalDegree/TransitionDPTFAQs/ |title=FAQ:Postprofessional DPT (Transition) |publisher=American Physical Therapy Association |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The use of the title ''doctor'' by physical therapists and other non-physician health care professionals is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/health/policy/02docs.html?_r=2&amp;ref=health |title=When the Nurse Wants to Be Called ‘Doctor’ |work=The New York Times |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the president of the American Physical Therapy Association responded:

: "To provide accurate information to consumers, the American Physical Therapy Association has taken a proactive approach and provides clear guidelines for physical therapists regarding the use of the title "Doctor." These guidelines state that physical therapists, in all clinical settings, who hold a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree (DPT) shall indicate they are physical therapists when using the title "Doctor" or "Dr," and shall use the titles in accord with jurisdictional law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.org/Media/Letters/2011/10/5/ |title=APTA Responds to The New York Times on Physical Therapists Using the Term 'Doctor' |publisher=American Physical Therapy Association |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DPT degree has been described as an example of "credential creep" or degree inflation in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''. Citing concerns that the DPT, and similar professional doctorates in areas such as [[occupational therapy]], do not meet the standards of traditional doctorate degrees, the journal states: "The six-and-a-half-year doctor of physical therapy, or DPT, is rapidly replacing a six-year master's degree ... The American Physical Therapy Association ... has not set separate requirements for doctoral programs.  To be accredited they need only to meet the same requirements as master's programs."&lt;ref name=creep&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csun.edu/pubrels/clips/June07/06-18-07M.pdf |title=Credential Creep |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics question whether the rigor of the physical therapy curriculum and the current scope of practice warrant the conferral of a professional degree similar to that characteristic of medicine, dentistry, or nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/79/10/978.full |last=Messaros |first=A |title=Fatal assumption [letter to the editor] |journal=Physical Therapy |date=October 1999 |volume=79 |issue=10 |pages=981–982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents counter that the existing curricula are "victims of 'curricular inflation'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/79/10/978.full |last1=Threlkeld |first1=A |last2=Jensen |first2=G |last3=Royeen |first3=C |title=Author response |journal=Physical Therapy |date=October 1999 |volume=79 |issue=10 |pages=986–990}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rothstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/78/4/358.full.pdf |last=Rothstein |first=J |title=Education at the Crossroads: For Today's Practice, the DPT [editorial] |journal=Physical Therapy |date=April 1998 |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=358–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moffat&lt;ref&gt;Moffat M. APTA Presidential Address: Will the legacy of our past provide us with a legacy for the future? Phys Ther. 1994;74:1063-1066.&lt;/ref&gt; noted, the previous master's and even baccalaureate curricula rival that of most other doctoral programs, and these curricula often require more than the typical 72 credits mandated for a doctoral degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/78/11/1208.full.pdf |last=Sahrmann |first=S |title=Moving Precisely? Or Taking the Path of Least Resistance? |journal=Physical Therapy |date=November 1998 |volume=78 |issue=11 |pages=1208–1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 Fact Sheet from APTA reported that the mean number of credits required for the professional phase of the typical baccalaureate program was 83.0 credits and that the typical master's degree program required 95.5 credits.&lt;ref&gt;2000 Fact Sheet: Physical Therapist Education Program. Alexandria, Va: American Physical Therapy Association; October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 the typical number of prerequisite credits was 114.2 and the total number of professional credits was 116.5 for a total of 230.7 credit hours.&lt;ref&gt;2009 fact sheet: Physical Therapist Education Program. Alexandria, Va: American Physical Therapy Association; August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is well in excess of the typical 72 professional credits mandated for a doctoral degree. Additional credit hours may be earned in residency and fellowship as well. Threlkeld et al.&lt;ref&gt;Threlkeld A. Jensen G, Royeen C [author response]. PhysTher. 1999:79:986-990.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the scope of existing physical therapy curricula already matches that of a professional doctorate, further submitting that students of a well-defined DPT program will have earned the right to be recognized with the doctoral title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paeaonline.org/index.php?ht=a/GetDocumentAction/i/69169|title=Physician Assistant Education Association|website=Physician Assistant Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional degree (entry-level) ==
The professional (entry-level) DPT degree is currently the degree conferred by all physical therapist professional programs upon successful completion of a three- to four-year post-baccalaureate degree program in the [[United States]], preparing the graduate to enter the practice of physical therapy.  Admission requirements for the program include completion of an undergraduate degree that includes specific prerequisite coursework, volunteer experience (or other exposure to the profession), and completion of a standardized graduate examination (e.g., [[GRE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.usc.edu/sublayout.aspx?menu_id=52&amp;id=72|title=DPT - Frequently Asked Questions - USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical prerequisite courses may include two semesters of anatomy and physiology with labs, two semesters of physics with labs, two semesters of chemistry with labs, a general course in psychology, another course in psychology, statistics, two semesters of biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/pt/prospective/elp/admissions.html|title=Columbia University Program in Physical Therapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may include other courses required by specific schools.

The physical therapist curriculum consists of foundational  sciences (i.e., [[gross anatomy]], cellular [[histology]], [[embryology]], [[neurology]], [[neuroscience]], [[kinesiology]], [[physiology]], [[exercise physiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], [[radiology]]/[[Medical imaging|imaging]], [[medical screening]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.apu.edu/graduate/behavioral-applied-sciences/physical-therapy/physical-therapy-phd/|title=Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) Coursework — Azusa Pacific University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[behavioral sciences]] (communication, social and psychologic factors, ethics and values, law, business and management sciences, clinical reasoning and evidence-based practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgefox.edu/physical-therapy/academics/curriculum.html|title=Program Requirements - Physical Therapy Program - George Fox University|website=www.georgefox.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and clinical sciences (cardiovascular/pulmonary, endocrine and metabolic, gastrointestinal and [[genitourinary]], [[integumentary]], [[musculoskeletal]], neuromuscular).  Coursework also includes material specific to the practice of physical therapy (patient/client management model, prevention, wellness, and health promotion, practice management, management of care delivery, social responsibility, advocacy, and core values). Additionally, students have to engage in full-time clinical practice under the supervision of licensed physical therapists with an expectation of  providing safe, competent, and effective physical therapy.

== Continuing Education ==
Post-graduation, licensed physical therapists have the ability to pursue a clinical residency or fellowship to expand their knowledge and experience. Clinical residencies are designed to further a physical therapy resident's knowledge in a specific area of clinical practice. A clinical fellowship is a program for physical therapists in an area of the specific focus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abpts.org/Certification/|title=Specialist Certification|last=Mendenhall|first=Keith|website=www.abpts.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical therapists also have the ability to pursue speciality certifications, where they become board certified clinical specialists. Becoming a certified specialist allows the therapist to earn credentials that represents further dedication to patient care. It gives the opportunity for professional growth and positions in leadership and service. This specialization is done by building a broad foundation of professional education then building a skillset related to the particular specialization area. The certifications given in the specific areas are: cardiovascular and pulmonary, clinical electrophysiology, geriatrics, neurology, orthopedics, pediatrics, sports physical therapy, and women's health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Physical therapists can provide various modalities of treatment for the patient. The modalities include: ultrasound, electrical stimulation, traction, joint mobilization, massage, heat, ice, kinesiology taping, and many more. Forms of treatment depends on the therapists preference of treatment and the clinics equipment availability. Based on the patient, specific types of treatment might be better suited. Therapists might also find different modalities not as effective as others. However, some modalities might not be possible due to the clinics restrictions on space and equipment availability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Advanced clinical science degree ==
The "advanced clinical science" doctorate (e.g., DPTSc or DScPT, [[DHSc]], ScDPT) is one of several degrees conferred by academic institutions upon successful completion of a post-professional physical therapist education program. This program is intended to provide an experienced clinician with advanced knowledge, clinical skills, and professional behavior, usually in a specific specialty practice area. These programs typically culminate work that contributes new knowledge to clinical practice in the profession. Completion of these advanced clinical science doctoral programs may include credentialed clinical residencies and lead to ABPTS clinical specialization or other advanced certifications.

== United Kingdom ==
[[Glasgow Caledonian University]] in [[Glasgow]] is the first in the United Kingdom to offer a 3.5 year [https://www.gcu.ac.uk/study/courses/details//index.php/P03131 Doctorate in Physiotherapy] (pre-registration) programme which is the first clinical doctorate which leads to qualification as a Physiotherapist eligible to register with the [[Chartered Society of Physiotherapy|CSP]] and [[Health and Care Professions Council|HCPC]] in the United Kingdom. This programme provides a focus on researcher development as well as professional development within a [[Health and Social Care|health and social care]] context. Some UK universities offer a DPT as a post-professional qualification, but the qualifying degree remains Bachelor or Master of Science in Physiotherapy (with honours). This is offered at the [[University of Sussex]] in [[Brighton]], Nottingham University and Robert Gordon University.

'''Elma Sandford-Morgan''' (23 February 1890 – 1983) was an Australian physician who practised medicine in India and Iraq during the 1920s.

Elma Linton Sandford (later Mrs Sandford-Morgan) was born in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, South Australia]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elma Linton Sandford-Morgan|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn and Harvey, Joy|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Alexander Wallace Sandford]], a businessman and politician, died in 1905.  She was educated at a number of girls schools, before entering [[Cheltenham Ladies' College|Cheltenham Ladies College]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article73742870|title=DR E.

She graduated with her M.D. in 1917.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129004244|title=ABC OF MOTHERCRAFT|date=1930-05-31|work=The News|location=Adelaide|access-date=2017-06-08|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15755823|title=UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY.|date=1917-09-05|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-08|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sandford was appointed a resident medical officer at the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children|Royal Alexandra Hospital]] for Children in Sydney, and she then became senior medical registrar at the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]]. She travelled to England in 1919 to study ophthalmology at the London hospitals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was there that she heard about the urgent need for doctors in India to combat eye disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She worked for a year at the Bhiwani Mission Women's Hospital around 1920, before taking a position in [[Baghdad]] at a hospital for women and children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was in Baghdad, that she met British Army Officer Harry Morgan, and they were married in 1921. She worked in private practice in Baghdad&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4333709|title=WOMEN'S VIEWS AND NEWS.|date=1924-06-06|access-date=2017-06-08|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until their daughter, Rosemary was born in 1922.

The Sandford-Morgans returned to Australia in 1923, and Dr Sandford-Morgan worked mainly in private practice, or for the Public Health Service in Hobart and Sydney. Their son, Gavin was born in 1925. Captain Morgan and Dr Sandford-Morgan separated, and she moved to Adelaide with their children around 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45674460|title=Roundabout|date=1950-11-03|work=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|access-date=2017-06-08|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117230415|title=DR.

== World War II ==
Sandford-Morgan assisted the Royal Australian Air Force Medical Service during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/736099?q=%22dr+elma+sandford-morgan%22&amp;c=people|title=Sandford-Morgan, Elma (1890-1983) - People and organisations|website=Trove|language=en|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed to a parliamentary commission investigating health services in South Australia at the close of the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She wished to take up a position in Europe, and accepted a role as a medical officer at the Commonwealth Immigration camp in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45794379|title=About People|date=1951-12-22|access-date=2017-06-08|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45689834|title=Enjoying Her Job At Migrant Centre|date=1951-03-28|access-date=2017-06-08|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transfer that was offered with this role to a European practice, was denied her as a woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She resigned and sought employment on her own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Sandford-Morgan returned to private practice in Australia, and then worked as a neoplasm registrar at the Anticancer Foundation of the University of Adelaide. She continued working until the age of 74 and thereafter volunteered at the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service until she was 80.

Sandford-Morgan was President of the Medical Women's Society of South Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elma Sandford-Morgan died in 1983. She was survived by her children. She is remembered for her pioneering work as a doctor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8191">'''Empiric therapy''' or '''empirical therapy''' is medical treatment or [[therapy]] based on [[experience]]&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more specifically, therapy begun on the basis of a clinical "educated guess" in the absence of complete or perfect information. Thus it is applied before the confirmation of a definitive [[medical diagnosis]] or without complete understanding of an etiology, whether the [[mechanism (biology)|biological mechanism]] of [[pathogenesis]] or the therapeutic [[mechanism of action]]. The name shares the same [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] with ''[[empirical evidence]]'', involving an idea of practical experience. 

Empiric antimicrobial therapy is directed against an anticipated and likely cause of [[infectious disease]]. It is used when [[antimicrobial]]s are given to a person before the specific [[bacterium]] or fungus causing an [[infection]] is known. Fighting an infection sooner rather than later is important to minimize morbidity, risk, and complications for serious infections like [[sepsis]] and suspected [[bacterial meningitis]]. 

==Empiric antimicrobial therapy==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Empiric antimicrobial therapy is typically [[broad-spectrum]], in that it treats both a multitude of either  [[Gram-positive]] and/or [[Gram-negative]] [[bacteria]],  diverse fungi or parasites respectively. When more information is known (as from a [[blood culture]]), treatment may be changed to a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial which more specifically targets the bacterium or fungus known to be causing disease. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is a fairly sophisticated process which includes considering data such as a person's age, immune status, comorbidities, likelihood for a certain microbial etiology and [[pre-test probability]] for antimicrobial resistance prior to therapy, risk of bad outcomes, and  to name a few.

The advantage of indicating antibiotics empirically exists where a causative pathogen is likely albeit unknown and where [[diagnostic test]]s will not be influential to treatment. In this case, there may be little if any perceived benefit of using what may be costly and inconclusive tests that will only delay treatment of the same antibiotics. The empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases, by selection, the prevalence of bacteria resistant to several antibiotics. However, the delay and expense that would be required to perform definitive species identification in every single clinical case are not affordable, so some degree of [[trade-off]] is accepted on the principle of the benefits outweighing the risk.

==Other than antibiotics==
Another much less common [[word sense|sense]] of the term ''empiric therapy'' involves [[quackery]], and ''empiric'' as a noun has been used as a [[synonym]] of ''quack''.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empiric |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This sense applies when the amount of guessing involved by the clinician transcends so far beyond [[science]] that the [[standard of care]] is not upheld. Whereas prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic to fight a clinically apparent infection as early as possible is entirely prudent and scientific despite the absence of confirmatory cultures, prescribing magic rituals or pseudoscientific schemes is not.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The fact that "acting on practical experience in the absence of theory or complete knowledge" can have both legitimate and illegitimate forms stretches back to long before science existed. For example, in the era of [[ancient Greece]], when medical science as we now know it did not yet exist, all medicine was unscientific and [[traditional medicine|traditional]]; theories of [[etiology]], pathogenetic [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]], and therapeutic [[mechanism of action]] were based on religious, mythologic, or cosmologic ideas. For example, [[humorism]] could dictate that [[bloodletting]] was indicated for a certain disorder because a supposed excess of water could be rebalanced. However, because such theories involved a great deal of fanciful notions, their safety and efficacy could be slim to negative. In the example of bloodletting to correct excess water, the fact that [[fluid balance]] is a legitimate physiologic concern didn't mean that the then-[[state of the art|state-of-the-art]] "understanding" of [[causality|causation]] was well founded overall. In this environment where mainstream medicine was unscientific, a school of thought arose in which theory would be ignored and only practical results would be considered. This was the original introduction of [[empiricism]] into medicine, long before medical science would greatly extend it. {{cn|date=November 2018}}

However, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as biological and medical science developed, the situation had reversed: because the state of the art in medicine was now scientific medicine, those physicians who ignored all etiologic theory in favor of only their own experience were now increasingly quackish, even though in the era of religion-based or mythology-based medicine (the era of [[medicine man|medicine men]]) they might have been, as viewed through today's hindsight, admirably [[rationality|rational]] and in fact [[protoscience|protoscientific]]. Thus as science became the norm, unscientific and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] approaches qualified as quackery.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In the 21st century, the next phase of differentiation on this topic is underway. all clinical practice based on medical science is therefore based on empirical evidence to a large degree, but efforts are underway to make sure that ''all'' of the science on any given medical topic is consistently applied in the clinic, with the best portions of it graded and weighted more heavily. This is the latest cycle in which personal experience (even expert opinion with scientific basis) is not considered good enough by itself. Thus, in [[evidence-based medicine]], the goal is that every clinician will make decisions for every patient with total mastery and [[critical analysis]] of the entire [[scientific literature]] at their fingertips. This is a formidably vast goal to implement operationally (because it is not even possible for one person to master all extant biomedical knowledge on the basis of individual education&lt;ref name="Khosla_2012-12-04"&gt;{{Citation |last=Khosla |first=Vinod |date=2012-12-04 |title=Technology will replace 80% of what doctors do |journal=Fortune |url=http://fortune.com/2012/12/04/technology-will-replace-80-of-what-doctors-do/ |quote=Most doctors couldn’t possibly read and digest all of the latest 5,000 research articles on heart disease. And, most of the average doctor’s medical knowledge is from when they were in medical school, while cognitive limitations prevent them from remembering the 10,000+ diseases humans can get. |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but development of [[health information technology]] such as [[expert system]]s and other [[applications of artificial intelligence#Hospitals and medicine|artificial intelligence in medicine]] is underway in pursuit of it.&lt;ref name="Khosla_2012-12-04"/&gt; In the meantime, until the day when the reality begins to approximate the ideal, it is duly recognized that expert opinion and clinical judgment are still necessary in clinical practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Koppenheffer |first=Michael |title=Guidelines are not gospel |date=January 29, 2015 |url=http://www.advisory.com/research/physician-executive-council/prescription-for-change/2015/01/guidelines-are-not-gospel }}&lt;/ref&gt; because their premature banishment, before their eventual replacement has been fully prepared, amounts to [[scientism]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Erie Stones''' or {{lang|fr|'''pierres Erienes'''}} are rocks used in First Nations (Native American) traditional medicine. Francois Gendron,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gendron, Francois and Jean-Baptiste de Recoles Quelques Particularitez Du Pays Des Hurons En La Nouvelle France, 1660, p7-8&lt;/ref&gt; the French Jesuit surgeon at [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]] mission, first described its use in the 1640s in letters later published in 1660. Gendron described the sources of these stones as being at the base of [[Niagara Falls]] and that a local Native American group settled there and traded this item to other First Nations communities. The ointment created from this rock was said to help the healing of "wounds, fistulas and malignant ulcers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Exactly what the rock was that this ointment was made from has been open to debate since Gendron first described it. He described the rock as a yellowish salt formed from the petrification of foam formed at the foot of Niagara Falls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also debate among historians whether he actually visited the area to collect samples or was supplied with them and a description of their location from Native American traders.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Jury and Jury&lt;ref&gt;Jury, Wilfred and Elsie McLeod Jury Sainte-Marie Among the Huron. Oxford University Press, Toronto. 1954, pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted Gendron’s description as describing calcareous [[tufa]], a rock formed by precipitation from supersaturated limestone deposits. Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, James Erie Stone: A Seventeenth Iroquoian Medicinal Trading Commodity, Kewa 85-2:2-8.&lt;/ref&gt; however, identified it with [[aragonite]], a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, with inclusion of magnesium sulphate and calcium sulphate. Hunter was able to collect samples from below Niagara Falls in 1982. According to him the mineral forms by the seepage of slightly acidic rain water through limestone formation in the Niagara gorge, most notably the [[dolostone]] formation near the top of the Niagara Escarpment. This seepage causes carbonate minerals to dissolve out of the dolostone changing them to a bicarbonate form. Below the dolostone the [[Rochester Shale]] is impenetrable to the seeping water causing it to flow horizontal and emerge and run down the rock face of the gorge. Some of this water evaporates leaving a layer of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[aragonite]] on the rock face. In some areas the accumulation is not much more than a thin film but in others areas he notes it can be four or five centimeters thick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20626">'''Flexibility''' is a [[personality trait]] that describes the extent to which a person can [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with changes in circumstances and think about problems and tasks in novel, creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpc7CJH1-s8C&amp;pg=PA731 |title=Encyclopedia of creativity |volume=1 |chapter=Flexibility |author=Becky Thurston, Mark Runco|isbn=9780122270758 |date=August 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trait is used when stressors or unexpected events occur, requiring a person to change their stance, outlook, or commitment. Flexible personality should not be confused with [[cognitive flexibility]], which is the ability to switch between two concepts, as well as simultaneously think about multiple concepts. Researchers of cognitive flexibility describe it as the ability to switch one's thinking and attention between tasks.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyake|first=A|author2=Friedman, N P |author3=Emerson, M J. |author4=Witzki, A H |author5=Howerter, A |author6= Wagner, T |title=The unity and diversity of executive functions and their contributions to complex "frontal lobe" tasks: A latent variable analysis|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=2000|volume=41|pages=49–100|doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0734|pmid=10945922 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexibility, or '''psychological flexibility''', as it is sometimes referred to, is the ability to adapt to situational demands, balance life demands, and commit to behaviors.

==Measures/assessments==
Due to the different facets of the definition of psychological flexibility, there are many problems when measuring it. There are multiple questionnaires that attempt to do so.

===Acceptance and Action Questionnaire===
The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) was developed in order to measure [[experiential avoidance]]. This test found that higher levels of avoidance were linked to higher levels of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, fears, and a lower quality of life. It also measured avoidant coping and self-deceptive positivity.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Steven|author2=Kirk Strosahl|author3=Kelly Wilson|author4=Richard Bissett|author5=Jacqueline Pistorello|author6=Dosheen Toarmino|author7=Melissa Polusny|author8=Thane Dykstra|author9=Sonja Batten|author10=John Bergan|author11=Sherry Stewart|author12=Michael Zvolensky|author13=Georg Eifert|author14=Frank Bond|author15=John Forsyth|author16=Maria Karekla|author17=Susan McCurry|title=Measuring Experiential Avoidance: A Preliminary Test of a Working Model|journal=The Psychological Record|date=2004|volume=54|issue=4|pages=553–578|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later decided that the AAQ actually measured psychological flexibility, not experiential avoidance.&lt;ref name="Hayesagain"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Steven|title=Acceptance &amp; Action Questionnaire (AAQ) and Variations|url=http://contextualscience.org/acceptance_action_questionnaire_aaq_and_variations|publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used until the AAQ-II was created.

===Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II===
The AAQ-II was developed in order to improve upon the faults of the AAQ. The original AAQ had faults in scale brevity, item wording, and item selection procedures that caused insufficient alpha levels to be obtained in measurements.&lt;ref name="Hayesagain" /&gt; The AAQ-II scores were found to predict many outcomes, including mental health and work absence rates. The AAQ-II also was found to be more psychometrically consistent than the original AAQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=F.W. |author2=S.C. Hayes |author3=R.A. Baer |author4=K.M.

Laboratory measures of flexibility are consistent with how flexible people are in their actual lives. Flexibility measured in laboratory settings even predicted how flexible people will be in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=C.|title=Assessing Coping Flexibility in Real-life and Laboratory Settings: A Multimethod Approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2001|volume=80|issue=5|pages=814–833|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.5.814}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently however, the validity of the AAQ has again been brought into question, primarily by inconsistent results. Recent studies have shown that both versions of the AAQ appear to measure the same thing, which is neuroticism/negative affect rather than experiential avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.beth.2017.08.008 | title=Experiential Avoidance: An Examination of the Construct Validity of the AAQ-II and MEAQ | year=2017 | journal=Behavior Therapy | last1 = Rochefort | first1 = Catherine | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = Austin S. | last3 = Chmielewski | first3 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts on life==

===Parent–child relationships===
Research has shown that the relationship between parent and child distress may be influenced by parenting psychological flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moyer|first=D.N.|author2=E.K. Sandoz|title=The role of psychological flexibility in the relationship between parent and adolescent distress|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|date=2014|doi=10.1007/s10826-014-9947-y|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1406–1418}}&lt;/ref&gt; When parents are psychologically inflexible they cause more stress in their families. A similar study looked at the longitudinal relationship between perceived parenting style and psychological flexibility among students over six years (7th–12th [[Grading in education|grade]]). Results showed that psychological flexibility decreased with age, illustrating that as children grow older they become more set in their thoughts and habits, being less likely to change them due to circumstances. Results also indicated that [[Parenting styles#Authoritarian parenting|authoritarian parenting styles]] predicted low psychological flexibility in children. This demonstrates that parents who over-control their children tend to restrict how well their children cope with stressors in life. Lastly, results showed that children with psychological flexibility in 9th grade were more likely to have decreases in authoritarian and increases in authoritative parenting style later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=K.E. |author2=J. Ciarrochi |author3=P.C. Heaven|title=Inflexible Parents, Inflexible Kids: a 6-year Longitudinal Study of Parenting Style and the Development of Psychological Flexibility in Adolescents|journal=Journal of Youth Adolescence|date=2012|volume=41|issue=8|pages=1053–1066|doi=10.1007/s10964-012-9744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parenting styles#Authoritative parenting|Authoritative parenting styles]] seem to be associated with psychological flexibility in children. Authoritative parents tend to be more warm, fair, and encouraging than other parenting styles which may be why children raised by this style have more psychological flexibility. The children are encouraged to be independent and are supported, so they are able to adjust to situations that do not go as predicted.

===Work environment===
Psychological flexibility has been found to improve [[mental health]] and absence rates.&lt;ref name="bondtheabilityofpsychologicalflexibilityandjobcontrol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=F.W.|author2=P.E. Flaxman|title=The Ability of Psychological Flexibility and Job Control to Predict Learning, Job Performance, and Mental Health|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior Management|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1–2|pages=113–130|doi=10.1300/J075v26n01_05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mediating variable is [[job control (workplace)|job control]], which suggests that people feel they have more psychological flexibility when they have more control over their jobs.&lt;ref name="bondtheinfluenceofpsychologicalflexibilityonworkredesign"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=F.W. |author2=P.E. Flaxman |author3=D. Bunce|title=The Influence of Psychological Flexibility on Work Redesign: Mediated Moderation of a Work Reorganization Intervention|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2008|volume=93|issue=3|pages=645–654|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.3.645|pmid=18457492}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to workers feeling less restricted by what they are allowed to do and more empowered to solve a problem.&lt;ref name="bondtheinfluenceofpsychologicalflexibilityonworkredesign"/&gt; A longitudinal study on psychological flexibility and job control showed that these variables predicted workers' mental health, [[job performance]], and even their ability to learn new software.&lt;ref name="bondtheabilityofpsychologicalflexibilityandjobcontrol"/&gt; The study demonstrates the power of psychological flexibility in the workplace as psychologically flexible workers have better mental health and job performance.&lt;ref name="bondtheabilityofpsychologicalflexibilityandjobcontrol"/&gt; Allowing workers more job control would likely increase work productivity as it would increase the workers' psychological flexibility.&lt;ref name="bondtheabilityofpsychologicalflexibilityandjobcontrol"/&gt; In leadership studies, flexibility, defined as "the ability to get along with different groups and adapt to the demands of many organizations," is one aspect of portability, or the ability to acquire skills and move from one company to the next.&lt;ref name="hbrtheportableleader"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petriglieri|first1=Gianpiero|title=The Portable Leader Is the New "Organization Man"|url=https://hbr.org/2017/08/the-portable-leader-is-the-new-organization-man|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=Harvard Business Review|date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
The ability to cope and be flexible was positively associated with improved psychological health. Flexibility reduced depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kato|first=T.|title=Development of the Coping Flexibility Scale: Evidence for the Coping Flexibility Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2012|volume=59|issue=2|pages=262–273|doi=10.1037/a0027770}}&lt;/ref&gt; An in-depth experiment analyzed the relationship between difficulty identifying and describing feelings (DIDF) and psychological flexibility for men undergoing cancer screenings. Results showed that DIDF and psychological flexibility were reliable predictors of mental health. However, psychological flexibility only predicted mental health when DIDF was involved. Psychological flexibility allowed participants to have a better understanding of the subtleties of pleasant and unpleasant emotions. This understanding allowed participants to identify and describe their feelings better, thus enhancing their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landstra|first=J.B. |author2=J.

Hillman|title=Identifying and Describing Feelings and Psychological Flexibility Predict Mental Health in Men with HIV|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|date=2013|volume=18|issue=4|pages=844–857|doi=10.1111/bjhp.12026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2 year longitudinal study found that psychological flexibility helps with long-term emotional adjustment. People who are better at enhancing and suppressing their expression of emotions are less likely to be stressed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=G.A.|author2=A. Papa |author3=K.

==How to improve==
Improvements can be made to psychological flexibility through training, such as through various forms of [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Leslie S. |authorlink1=Les Greenberg |last2=Rice |first2=Laura North |last3=Elliott |first3=Robert |date=1993 |title=Facilitating emotional change: the moment-by-moment process |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWrOpUO6ku0C&amp;pg=PA76 76] |isbn=0898629942 |oclc=27897484 |quote=Once we attend to our emotional feedback, our survival/[[Actualizing tendency|growth tendency]] ensures that we are constantly attempting to make the decision most advantageous to our well-being in terms of how we currently perceive ourselves and the situation. Thus the growth tendency is constantly pushing the organism toward adaptive flexibility and need satisfaction in a specific context. As will be noted later, therapy is a process of helping the client access and strengthen this tendency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kashdan |first1=Todd B. |last2=Rottenberg |first2=Jonathan |date=November 2010 |title=Psychological flexibility as a fundamental aspect of health |journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=865–878 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.03.001 |pmid=21151705 |pmc=2998793 |quote=We have mentioned empirically based interventions that describe the cultivation of flexibility as a therapeutic aim (for reviews, see Hayes, Follette, &amp; Linehan, 2004). However even when psychological interventions do not explicitly discuss flexibility as an aim of treatment (e.g., behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy), flexibility is such an integral part of psychological functioning that it is almost inevitable that it will in some way be impacted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=Kieran C.

===Acceptance and commitment therapy===
{{Main|Acceptance and commitment therapy}}
The main goal of [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT) is to increase psychological flexibility. ACT is a form of therapy that aims to help people accept unavoidable events, identify actions that will lead to goals, and acknowledge thoughts rather than accepting or disregarding them.&lt;ref name="Bach"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bach|first=P.|author2=S.C. Hayes|title=The Use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to Prevent the Rehospitalization of Psychotic Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=2002|volume=70|issue=5|pages=1129–1139|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.70.5.1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When psychological flexibility was targeted in one study of ACT, there was a stronger reduction in psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fledderus|first=M. |author2=E.T. Bohlmeijer |author3=J. Fox |author4=K. M. G. Schreurs |author5=P. Spinhoven|title=The Role of Psychological Flexibility in a Self-help Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention for Psychological Distress in a Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=2013|volume=51|issue=3|pages=142–151|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six core processes in ACT interventions: acceptance, cognitive defusion, self as context, being present, values, and committed action.&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Boulanger | first = Jennifer L. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = Steven C. | last3 = Lillis | first3 = Jason | authorlink2 = Steven C. Hayes | authorlink3 = Jason Lillis | editor-last = Fisher | editor-first = Gary L. | editor-last2 = Roget | editor-first2 = Nancy A. | title = Acceptance and Commitment Therapy | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment, &amp; Recovery | volume = 1 | pages = 4–7 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | date = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wPJ-39gVHE0C&amp;pg=PT38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Acceptance'' is taught in order to teach people to embrace their emotions, rather than trying to get rid of them.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of acceptance would be when people feel angry and then choose to focus on the anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger to get rid of it. ''Cognitive defusion'' teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of cognitive defusion would be when someone thinks "I am the worst," and then notices the thought for what it is—mere words—perhaps by saying to themselves "I am having the thought that I am the worst". This is in contrast to a [[cognitive therapy]] approach where the person might challenge the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.

''Self as context'' attempts to have people create an awareness of their own experiences without being attached to them.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; This process is done in order to help people let go of specific content and experience themselves.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; ''Being present'' teaches people to directly experience the world by paying attention to the moment and being aware.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of being present would be meditation and mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; 
 
''Values'' teaches people to take actions for chosen qualities.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of this is somebody who chooses to continue to improve on being a father (chosen quality) by reliving painful childhood memories about how his own father parented him (action). The purpose is not to encourage pain, but rather to allow people to deal with pain for a valued choice, such as being a good father).&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; Lastly, ''committed action'' teaches people to make changes in behavior in order for them to reach chosen qualities.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; Committed action involves identifying psychological barriers that will interfere with short, medium, and longer term goals and then working through those barriers in order to reach the goals.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;

'''Fuad Sami Haddad''' ({{lang-ar|فؤاد سامي حداد}}; March 31, 1924 – October 9, 2015) was a [[neurosurgeon]], humanitarian, and writer.  He was born in [[Beirut]] and spent most of his life in [[Lebanon]].

==Personal life and education==

Haddad was born in [[Beirut]]'s Ain El Mraiseh neighborhood. He was raised between here and the Haouz Sa'atyeh (حوز سعتيه) neighborhood. His mother, Lamia Morcos (1896–1994) raised Haddad along with his five siblings. The son of [[Sami Ibrahim Haddad]], a doctor and writer, Haddad's dreams did not fall far from the proverbial tree.&lt;ref name="fsh4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matossian|first=Robert|date=1986|title=Modern Neurosurgical Giants: Fuad Sami Haddad|publisher=Elsevier|page=149-152|isbn=9780444010834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended primary school at the [[Collège Protestant Français]] from 1928 to 1935 and secondary school at the International College of Beirut.&lt;ref name="fsh2"&gt;{{cite website|title=Curriculum Vitae|last1=Haddad|first1=Fuad Sami|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5hzsCxYITGOSnZzN2piWUtLc2c/view?usp=sharing|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received both his Bachelor of Arts in 1944 and his [[M.D.]] in 1948 from the [[American University of Beirut]].&lt;ref name="fsh2"/&gt; Haddad subsequently completed his surgical residency at the [[Orient Hospital]].&lt;ref name="fsh2"/&gt;

He then began his neurosurgery residency under [[Wilder Penfield]] at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] on July 1, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Neuro News: In Memoriam|url=https://publications.mcgill.ca/neuronews/2016/02/25/in-memoriam-4/|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsh4"/&gt; There, he completed fellowships in [[neuropathology]], [[neuro-anatomy]], and [[electroencephalography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Fifty Years Ago|last1=Haddad|first1=Fuad Sami|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wgJLU_6bfa9rzL49daupZtnxrMYEO3HC/view?usp=sharing|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Lebanon in 1955 as "the first neurosurgeon certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery to practice in the Middle East and... the entire Arab world."&lt;ref name="fsh1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hitchon|first1=Patrick|last2=Haddad|first2=Souheil|last3=Afifi|first3=Adel|title=Obituary: Fuad Sami Haddad, 1924–2015|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|date=January 27, 2017|volume=126|issue=4|page=1362-1363|url=http://thejns.org/doi/full/10.3171/2016.10.JNS162349|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he married Aida Nasir, and together they raised six children of their own: Georges, Souheil, Fadi, Nabih, Labib, and Janane—two of whom are practicing neurosurgeons.&lt;ref name="fsh2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Hommage au Dr Fuad Sami Haddad|magazine=L'Orient-Le Jour|last1=Ghossain|first1=Antoine|url=https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/949157/hommage-au-dr-fuad-sami-haddad.html|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Upon his return to Lebanon, Haddad joined the faculty at the [[American University of Beirut]] and served the university until 2012.&lt;ref name="fsh2"/&gt; All the while, he kept a private practice where he "received patients from the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, the Levant, North Africa, Turkey, and Iran."&lt;ref name="fsh1"/&gt; 

The [[Lebanese Civil War]] began in 1975, making it difficult for [[American University of Beirut]] students to pursue a medical residency in the United States of America. Even before this era, Haddad saw a need and filled it with a neurosurgical residency program that remains successful to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=History|url=https://staff.aub.edu.lb/~webneuro/history.html|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, on November 24, 1963, Haddad and his brother, Farid Haddad, were the founding members of the Lebanese Chapter of the American College of Surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=Part I – Origins and Beginnings of the Lebanon Chapter of the American College of Surgeons|url=http://www.facs-lebanon.org/History
|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both contributions to organized medicine in Lebanon marked great successes for practicing and future doctors who survived the war. Even during wartime, Haddad remained in Beirut as the only neurosurgeon serving the 450-bed American University Medical Center.&lt;ref name="fsh4"/&gt; "On a memorable spring weekend in 1976, he had to perform 13 craniotomies in a row for craniocerebral wounds. For 60 long hours he stood in the operating room mending the brain wounds of those unfortunate casualties." &lt;ref name="fsh4"/&gt;

Near the end of the war, Haddad was able to serve as a visiting professor in schools such as the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Iowa]], the [[Cleveland Clinic]], the [[University at Albany, SUNY]], and the [[University of Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="fsh2"/&gt;

Haddad retired on February 1, 2012.&lt;ref name="fsh2"/&gt;

=='Life under Fire'==

In 1988, Haddad was invited to address the 38th Annual Meeting of the [[Congress of Neurological Surgeons]] on the state of neurosurgery in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="fsh3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haddad|first1=Fuad S.|title=Neurosurgery in the Middle East: Life under Fire|journal=Neurosurgery|date=August 1, 1989|volume=25|issue=2|page=303-311|url=https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article/25/2/303/2748498|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haddad explains the differences in disease, as [[tuberculosis]] ravaged much of [[Iran]] while it was far less prominent, and therefore a lower diagnostic priority, in the United States.&lt;ref name="fsh3"/&gt; Additionally, Haddad addresses differences in societal stability, since he had spent much of his career working under fire during the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. He notes how the absence of telephone communication and electricity (at times for two to three weeks) made surgeries and [[post-operative]] care exceptionally difficult.&lt;ref name="fsh3"/&gt;

Haddad then shares that there exist more Lebanese surgeons in [[Sao Paolo]], [[Brazil]] than in Lebanon. Lastly, to defend his reasons for staying in Lebanon while healthcare providers fled, he leaves no room for doubt that his heart, and hands, are dedicated to the people of Lebanon. He finishes his address with a story and a firm commitment to the people of [[Lebanon]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A further example is that of a veiled woman who entered my empty office on one of the worse days of the fighting. I wondered what brought her to me when everybody else, including my own secretary, was looking for shelter from bombs and snipers. Said she, ‘Doctor, I know these are trying days and everything is scarce. I have baked a few loaves of bread and thought you and your family might do with some of them.’ Indeed we had gone without bread for 3 or 4 days, with a family of six children. She offered me three loaves and left. She had walked over 5 miles to bring this bread to me. As long as there are people like these in Lebanon, I will stay to serve them, no matter what the price is, and I am confident that, like the phoenix who rose from his ashes, Lebanon will and shall rise.&lt;ref name="fsh3"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3684">'''HIV/AIDS''' was first detected in [[Canada]] in 1982. In 2014, there were approximately 75,500 (range between 63,400 and 87,600) people living with HIV/AIDS (a prevalence of 212 per 100,000) in Canada. This represents a 9.7% increase from the estimated 68,800  at the end of 2011. It was estimated that 16,020 persons were living with undiagnosed HIV at the end of 2014, representing 21% of all people living with HIV in Canada at that time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/summary-estimates-hiv-incidence-prevalence-proportion-undiagnosed-canada-2014.html|title=Summary: Estimates of HIV incidence, prevalence and proportion undiagnosed in Canada, 2014|last=Canada|first=Public Health Agency of|last2=Canada|first2=Public Health Agency of|date=2015-11-25|website=aem|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Mortality rate|Mortality]] has decreased due to medical advances against HIV/AIDS, especially [[Antiretroviral drug#Combination therapy|highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART).

== Population groups ==
Women have accounted for 27% of new cases and now make up 20% of all cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aids/|title=CBC News In Depth - AIDS|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2008-12-01|date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aboriginal Canadians ===

HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing most rapidly amongst [[aboriginal Canadians]], with 9% of new infections in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aids/|title=CBC News In Depth - AIDS|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2008-12-01|date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A three-country study of HIV diagnoses between 1999 and 2008 showed higher HIV rates from heterosexual contact among aboriginals, especially women, than non-aboriginal people. This suggested a widening epidemic beyond conventional risk groups among aboriginals. The same study showed much higher rates of HIV diagnoses among aboriginal people in Canada than in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akneahr.ciet.org/publications/HIVandAIDS/ HIV and AIDS in Aboriginal Communities].

== Government policy ==

'''Helen Riaboff Whiteley''' (1921-1990) was a [[microbiologist]] who spent most of her research career at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name=seattletimes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910101&amp;slug=1258367|title=Helen R. Whiteley, UW Professor|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2017-06-10|last=Pryne|first=Eric|date=1991-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Whiteley was born in 1921 to Russian parents in [[Harbin, China]]. The family immigrated to the United States in 1924, first settling in Washington and later moving to California. Whiteley studied microbiology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she received her B.S. in 1941. She then earned a master's degree from the [[University of Texas, Galveston]] and her Ph.D. from the [[University of Washington]], where her husband [[Arthur Whiteley]] was at the time an assistant professor of [[zoology]]. After graduating in 1951, Whiteley returned to California and spent two years working for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name=seattletimes /&gt;

==Academic career==
Whiteley returned to the University of Washington in 1953 and became a [[full professor]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=seattletimes /&gt; She held several leadership roles with the [[American Society for Microbiology]], chairing its division of [[physiology]] and its publications board; she served as the society's president in 1976.&lt;ref name=asm&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asm.org/index.php/71-membership/archives/913-presidents-of-the-society|title=Presidents of the Society (1899-present)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Society for Microbiology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiteley also chaired a committee for collaboration in microbiology research between scientists in the US and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=seattletimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=fhl&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhl.uw.edu/facilities-resources/whiteley-center/about-helen-and-arthur-whiteley|title=About Helen and Arthur Whiteley  {{!}}  Friday Harbor Laboratories|website=fhl.uw.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Whiteley's research focused on the [[physiology]] of [[bacteria]]. She is best known for work with colleague [[Ernest Schnepf]] studying [[insecticidal]] [[protein]]s (known as [[Cry protein]]s) foud in the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''.&lt;ref name=seattletimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=fhl /&gt; This work laid the foundation for [[genetically modified organisms]] that [[transgene|transgenically]] express insecticidal proteins.&lt;ref name=nano&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/171127574|title=The evolution of biotechnology : from Natufians to nanotechnology|last=Newell-McGloughlin|first=Martina|last2=Re|first2=Edward|date=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402051494|oclc=171127574}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}}

==Personal life==
Whiteley met her husband Arthur as a student at Berkeley. He held a professorship at the University of Washington when she began her Ph.D. research there. Her research and success at earning research funding have been credited with prompting the university to revise its rules against employing both members of a married couple as faculty.&lt;ref name=seattletimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=fhl /&gt;

Helen died in 1990 at age 69. Years later, Arthur founded the Helen Riaboff Whiteley Center in her honor, which is located at the [[Friday Harbor Laboratories]] and is designed as a working retreat for scientists, scholars and artists.&lt;ref name=center&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fhl.uw.edu/facilities-resources/whiteley-center/|title=Whiteley Center  {{!}}  Friday Harbor Laboratories|website=fhl.uw.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur died after a brief illness in 2013 at age 96.&lt;ref name=fhl /&gt;&lt;ref name=sjj&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sanjuanjournal.com/news/whiteley-era-ends-legacy-lives-on/|title=Whiteley era ends; legacy lives on {{!}} The Journal of the San Juan Islands|date=2013-04-23|work=The Journal of the San Juan Islands|access-date=2017-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jazzercise''' is a dance fitness [[franchising|franchise]] company founded by Judi Sheppard Missett in 1969 and headquartered in Carlsbad, California, United States. 

Jazzercise combines dance, strength, and resistance training with popular music for a full-body workout. The company currently has over 8,300 franchisees worldwide in 32 countries.

==Early history==

Judi Sheppard Missett created Jazzercise in Chicago, Illinois in 1969 as a student at [[Northwestern University]]. She was teaching at a dance studio and noticed her classes had high dropout rates. Realizing students were attending for physical fitness and not to become highly technically proficient in dance, Shepard Missett began to hold "just for fun" classes that began with a jazz warmup. These classes were eventually renamed "Jazzercise."

==Growth and franchising==

Sheppard Missett's family moved to Carlsbad, California, where she taught classes in local rec centers. Jazzercise quickly took off in San Diego and Sheppard Missett trained new instructors herself. Many of those first instructors were in military families, so as they moved around the country, and the world, new populations were continually introduced to the program. Initially using VHS videos, Sheppard Missett was able to train franchisees from a distance and began to sell franchise rights for Jazzercise studios across the country.

==Jazzercise in popular media==
In [[Ron Howard]]'s live-action movie adaptation of ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]],'' the Grinch's schedule has an hour booked for Jazzercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/11/17/2000-11-17_jim_carrey_makes_one_mean_gr.html |accessdate=September 22, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' entitled "Louie Goes Too Far", [[Andy Kaufman]] (playing Vic Ferrari) suggests to Christopher Lloyd (playing Jim) that he take up Jazzercise as a way of meeting beautiful women.

On ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', Bea Arthur (Dorothy) admits taking up Jazzercise in the episodes "The Stan Who Came to Dinner" and "The Audit".

In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "Parasite Lost", the parasitic worms are seen Jazzercising Fry's muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0766131/quotes|title="Futurama" Parasites Lost (TV Episode 2001)|work=IMDb|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'' episode "New Zealand Town" of their second television series features a song called "Fashion is Danger", which is a parody of 1980s music and style, and contains a reference to Jazzercise.

"Jazzercise Instructor" is featured as a job in ''[[The Sims 2]]''.

In the third series of ''[[The Mighty Boosh (series 3)|The Mighty Boosh]]'', Howard Moon goes to Jazzercise classes.

In the ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]] ''episode "[[Bad Reputation (Glee)|Bad Reputation]]", a tape is found of [[Sue Sylvester]] Jazzercising to [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]". In the following season's episode "[[Sexy (Glee)|Sexy]]", [[Holly Holliday]] is shown teaching a jazzercise class in which [[Will Schuester]] participates.

In the ABC hit show ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', Beverly Goldberg is frequently portrayed referencing or stepping to Jazzercise.

On the October 9, 2012 episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', [[Jon Stewart]] references Jazzercise in his opening monologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/411611#i0,p11,d0|title=Watch The Daily Show With Jon Stewart Online - Free at Hulu|work=Hulu|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 alone, Jazzercise has been featured in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/bodies/half-their-size-weight-loss-jazzercise/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a14626590/history-boutique-fitness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Netflix series ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/glownetflix?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lactotropic cell''' (also known as prolactin cell, epsilon acidophil, lactotrope, lactotroph, mammatroph, mammotroph) is a [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the [[anterior pituitary]] which produces [[prolactin]] in response to hormonal signals including [[dopamine]] which is inhibitory and [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] which is stimulatory. Other regulators include [[oxytocin]], [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]].

Prolactin is involved in the maturation of [[mammary gland]]s and their secretion of milk in association with oxytocin, estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and others. Prolactin has numerous other effects in both sexes.

Prolactin cells are [[acidophilic]] by hematoxylin &amp; eosin stains and comprise about 20% of all cells in the anterior pituitary gland.  If these cells undergo [[neoplasm|neoplastic]] transformation, they will give rise to a [[prolactinoma]], a prolactin-secreting [[pituitary adenoma]].

'''Larry Kramer''' (born June 25, 1935) is an American playwright, author, [[film producer]], public health advocate, and [[LGBT rights]] activist. He began his career rewriting scripts while working for [[Columbia Pictures]], which led him to London where he worked with [[United Artists]]. There he wrote the screenplay for the 1969 film [[Women in Love (film)|''Women in Love'']] (1969) and earned an [[Academy Award]] nomination for his work. Kramer introduced a controversial and confrontational style in his novel ''[[Faggots (novel)|Faggots]]'' (1978), which earned mixed reviews and emphatic denunciations from elements within the gay community for Kramer's one-sided portrayal of shallow, promiscuous gay relationships in the 1970s.

Kramer witnessed the spread of the disease later known as [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) among his friends in 1980. He co-founded the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC), which has become the world's largest private organization assisting people living with AIDS. Kramer grew frustrated with bureaucratic paralysis and the apathy of gay men to the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS crisis]], and wished to engage in further action than the social services GMHC provided. He expressed his frustration by writing a play titled ''[[The Normal Heart]]'', produced at [[The Public Theater]] in New York City in 1985. His political activism continued with the founding of the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP) in 1987, an influential [[direct action]] protest organization with the aim of gaining more public action to fight the AIDS crisis. ACT UP has been widely credited with changing public health policy and the perception of [[People With AIDS|people living with AIDS]] (PWAs), and with raising awareness of HIV and AIDS-related diseases.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; Kramer has been a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his play ''[[The Destiny of Me]]'' (1992), and he is a two-time recipient of the [[Obie Award]].

== Early life ==
The younger of two children, Kramer was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and considered an "unwanted child"&lt;ref name=Anemona/&gt; by his Jewish parents, an attorney and a social worker.&lt;ref name="TTC"&gt;{{citation |title=Timeline Theatre Company; The Normal Heart Study Guide |author=Timeline Theatre Company |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-05-30 |url=http://www.timelinetheatre.com/normal_heart/TimeLine_NormalHeart_StudyGuide.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the family moved to Maryland they found themselves in a much lower socioeconomic bracket than that of Kramer's high school peers. Kramer had become sexually involved with a male friend in junior high school, but he dated girls in high school {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}. His father wanted him to marry a woman with money and thus pressed him to become a member of [[Pi Tau Pi]], a Jewish fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer enrolled at [[Yale University]] in 1953, where he had difficulty adjusting. He felt lonely, and earned lower grades than those to which he was accustomed. He attempted suicide by an [[overdose]] of [[aspirin]] because he felt like he was the "only gay student on campus".&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience left him determined to explore his sexuality and set him on the path to fight "for gay people's worth".&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt; The next semester, he had an affair with his German professor&amp;nbsp;– his first requited romantic relationship with a man.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; When the professor was scheduled to study in Europe, he invited Kramer to accompany him, but Kramer opted not to go.

Yale had been a family tradition: Kramer's father, older brother Arthur, and two uncles were alumni.&lt;ref name=Arenson&gt;{{citation |title=Playwright Is Denied A Final Act; Writing Own Script, Yale Refuses Kramer's Millions for Gay Studies |first=Karen W |last=Arenson |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1997 |accessdate=2007-09-23 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EED61539F93AA35754C0A961958260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer enjoyed the [[Yale Glee Club|Varsity Glee Club]] during his remaining time at Yale, and he graduated in 1957 with a degree in English.

=== Early writings ===
According to Kramer, every drama he has written derives from a desire to understand love's nature and its obstacles.&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt; Kramer became involved with movie production at age 23 by taking a job as a [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] operator at Columbia Pictures, agreeing to the position only because the machine was across the hall from the president's office.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he won a position in the story department reworking scripts. His first writing credit was as a dialogue writer for ''[[Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (film)|Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush]],'' a teen sex comedy. He followed that with the 1969 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated screenplay ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'', an adaptation of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s novel. He next penned what Kramer calls "the only thing in my life I'm ashamed of,"{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  the 1973 musical remake of [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'', a notorious critical and commercial failure whose screenplay was based very closely on [[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Capra's film]].   Kramer has said that his well-negotiated fee for this work, skillfully invested by his brother, made him financially self-sufficient.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Kramer then began to integrate homosexual themes into his work, and tried writing for the stage. He wrote ''Sissies' Scrapbook'' in 1973 (later rewritten and retitled as ''Four Friends''), a dramatic play about four friends, one of whom is gay, and their dysfunctional relationships. Kramer called it a play about "cowardice and the inability of some men to grow up, leave the emotional bondage of male collegiate camaraderie, and assume adult responsibilities".&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was first produced in a theater set up in an old [[YMCA]] gymnasium on 53rd Street and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] called the [[Playwrights Horizons]]. Live theater moved him to believing that writing for the stage was what he wanted to do. Although the play was given a somewhat favorable review by ''The New York Times'', it was closed by the producer and Kramer was so distraught that he decided never to write for the stage again, later stating, "You must be a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] to work in the theater and a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] to succeed on its stages."&lt;ref name="Dramatic"&gt;{{citation |title=Women in Love and other Dramatic Writings |first=Larry |last=Kramer |publisher=[[Grove Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-8021-3916-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer next wrote ''A Minor Dark Age'', though it failed to be produced. [[Frank Rich]], in the foreword to a Grove Press collection of Kramer's less-known works, wrote that "dreamlike quality of the writing is haunting" in ''Dark Age'', and that its themes, such as the exploration of the difference between sex and passion, "are staples of his entire output" that would portend his future work, including the 1978 novel ''Faggots.''&lt;ref name=Dramatic/&gt;

=== ''Faggots'' ===
{{main|Faggots (novel)}}

In 1978, Kramer delivered the final of four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of gay men of [[Fire Island]] and Manhattan. In ''[[Faggots (novel)|Faggots]]'', the primary character was modeled on himself, a man who is unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos.&lt;ref name=Yale/&gt; He stated his inspiration for the novel: "I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave."&lt;ref name="marcus196"&gt;Marcus, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: "Are you writing a negative book? Are you going to make it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying."&lt;ref name="marcus196"/&gt;

The novel caused an uproar in the community it portrayed; it was taken off the shelves of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore]] — New York's only gay bookstore — and Kramer was banned from the grocery store near his home on Fire Island.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; On the reception of the novel Kramer says, "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back when I walked by. You know what my real crime was? I put the truth in writing. That's what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met."&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.michaelspecter.com/ny/2002/2002_05_13_kramer.html |title=Larry Kramer, the man who warned America about AIDS, can't stop fighting hard-and loudly |first=Michael |last=Specter |author-link=Michael Specter |periodical=[[The New Yorker]] |date=May 13, 2002 |page=56 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521163823/http://www.michaelspecter.com/ny/2002/2002_05_13_kramer.html |archivedate=May 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Faggots'', however, became one of the best-selling gay novels of all time.&lt;ref name=GLBT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=25 |title=Larry Kramer |periodical=GLBT History Month |accessdate=2007-09-23 |date=October 25, 2006 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=intitle%3ALarry+Kramer&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126174240/http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=25 |archivedate=November 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Reynolds Price]] wrote that the novel's lasting relevance is that "anyone who searches out present-day responses on the Internet will quickly find that the wounds inflicted by ''Faggots'' are burning still".&lt;ref name=Faggots&gt;{{citation |chapter=Introduction by Reynolds Price |first=Larry |last=Kramer |title=Faggots |publisher=[[Grove Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-8021-3691-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kramer was rejected by the people he thought would be laudatory, the book has never been out of publication and is often taught in [[LGBT studies|gay studies]] classes. "''Faggots'' struck a chord," wrote [[Andrew Sullivan]], "It exuded a sense that gay men could do better if they understood themselves as fully human, if they could shed their self-loathing and self-deception...."&lt;ref name=Faggots/&gt;

=== Gay Men's Health Crisis ===
{{main|Gay Men's Health Crisis}}

Initially, while living on Fire Island in the 1970s, Kramer had no intention of getting involved in political activism. There were politically active groups in New York City, but Kramer notes the culture on Fire Island was so different that they would often make fun of political activists: "It was not chic. It was not something you could brag about with your friends&amp;nbsp;... Guys marching down Fifth Avenue was a whole other world. The whole gestalt of Fire Island was about beauty and looks and golden men."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when friends he knew from Fire Island began getting sick in 1980, Kramer became involved in gay activism. In 1981, although he had not been involved previously with gay activism, Kramer invited the "A-list" (his own term) group of gay men from the New York City area to his apartment to listen to a doctor say their friends' illnesses were related, and research needed to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 90—91.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, they named themselves the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) and became the primary organization to raise funds for and provide services to people stricken with [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) in the New York area. Although Kramer served on its first board of directors, his view of how it should be run sharply conflicted with that of the rest of its members. While GMHC began to concentrate on social services for men who were dying, Kramer loudly insisted they fight for funding from New York City. Mayor [[Ed Koch]] became a particular target for Kramer, as did the behavior of gay men, before the nature of how the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) was transmitted was understood.

When doctors suggested men stop having sex, Kramer strongly encouraged GMHC to deliver the message to as many gay men as possible. When they refused, Kramer wrote an essay entitled "1,112 and Counting", printed in 1983 in the ''[[New York Native]]'', a gay newspaper. The essay discussed the spread of the disease, the lack of government response, and apathy of the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;
The essay was intended to frighten gay men and anger them to the point where they would respond to government indifference.  [[Michael Specter]] writes in ''The New Yorker'', "it was a five-thousand-word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in America&amp;nbsp;– officials at the [[Centers for Disease Control]], in Atlanta, researchers at the [[National Institutes of Health]], in Washington, doctors at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], in Manhattan, and local politicians (particularly Mayor [[Ed Koch]])&amp;nbsp;– of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent [[AIDS epidemic]]. The article's harshest condemnation was directed at those gay men who seemed to think that if they ignored the new disease, it would simply go away.&lt;ref&gt;Specter, Michael (May 13, 2002). [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/05/13/020513fa_fact_specter Profiles: Public Nuisance], ''The New Yorker''. Retrieved on December 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer's confrontational style proved to be an advantage, as it earned the issue of AIDS in New York media attention that no other individual could get. He found it a disadvantage when he realized his own reputation was "completely that of a crazy man".&lt;ref name="mass44"&gt;Mass, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer was particularly frustrated by bureaucratic stalling that snowballed in cases where gay but closeted men were the ones in charge of agencies that seemed to ignore AIDS. He confronted the director of a [[National Institute of Health]] agency about not devoting more time and effort toward researching AIDS because he was closeted.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; He threw a drink in Republican fundraiser [[Terry Dolan (activist)|Terry Dolan]]'s face during a party and screamed at him for having affairs with men but using the fear of homosexuality as a reason to raise money for conservative causes.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; He called Ed Koch and the media and government agencies in New York City "equal to murderers". Even Kramer's personal life was affected when he and his lover&amp;nbsp;– also a board member on GMHC&amp;nbsp;– split over Kramer's condemnations of the political apathy of GMHC.&lt;ref name="mass44"/&gt;
&lt;!-- hide until appropriate context can be included &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Dear straight people, Why do you hate gay people so much?"'' Kramer in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in response to Marine general [[Peter Pace]]'s homophobic remarks about gays in the military.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;

Kramer's past also compromised his message, as many men who had been turned off by ''Faggots'' saw Kramer's warnings as alarmist, displaying negative attitudes toward sex. Playwright [[Robert Chesley]] responded to his ''New York Native'' article, saying, "Read anything by Kramer closely, and I think you'll find the subtext is always: the wages of gay sin are death".&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; The GMHC ousted Kramer from the organization in 1983. Kramer's preferred method of communication was deemed too militant for the group.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Normal Heart'' ===
{{main|The Normal Heart}}

Astonished and saddened about being forced out of GMHC, Kramer took an extended trip to Europe. While visiting [[Dachau concentration camp]] he learned that it had opened as early as 1933 and neither Germans nor other nations did anything to stop it. He became inspired to chronicle the same reaction from the American government and the gay community to the AIDS crisis by writing ''[[The Normal Heart]]'', despite having promised never to write for the theater again.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Normal Heart'' is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It addresses a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks is involved in is angered by the bad publicity Weeks' activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, "I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could&amp;nbsp;... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] hold his dying lover played by [[D.&amp;nbsp;W. Moffett]] on stage; Kramer went into the bathroom and sobbed, only moments later to find Davis holding him.&lt;ref name="mass47"&gt;Mass, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The play is considered a literary landmark.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; It contended with the AIDS crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the [[Public Theater]], running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa.&lt;ref name="mass47"/&gt; Actors following Davis who portrayed Kramer's alter ego Ned Weeks included [[Joel Grey]], [[Richard Dreyfuss]] (in Los Angeles), [[Martin Sheen]] (at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] in London), [[Tom Hulce]] and then [[John Shea]] in the West End, [[Raul Esparza]] in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently [[Joe Mantello]] on Broadway at the [[John Golden Theatre|Golden Theater]].&lt;!-- a man who sets out to prove that "the strongest man in the world is the man who stands alone".&lt;ref name="gussow"&gt;{{citation |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70814F9355C0C7B8EDDAD0894DD484D81 |title=Confronting a Crisis with Incendiary Passion |first=Mel |last=Gussow |[[The New York Times]] |date=April 28, 1985 |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Upon seeing the production of ''The Normal Heart'', [[Naomi Wolf]] commented, "No one else on the left at that time&amp;nbsp;... ever used the moral framework that is so much a part of Kramer's voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully.  Conscience, responsibility, calling; truth and lies, clarity of purpose or abandonment of one's moral calling; loyalty and betrayal&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to ''The Tragedy of Today's Gays'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''The New York Times'', [[Frank Rich]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He accuses the governmental, medical and press establishments of foot-dragging in combating the disease—especially in the early days of its outbreak, when much of the play is set—and he is even tougher on homosexual leaders who, in his view, were either too cowardly or too mesmerized by the ideology of sexual liberation to get the story out. "There's not a good word to be said about anyone's behavior in this whole mess", claims one character—and certainly Mr. Kramer has few good words to say about Mayor Koch, various prominent medical organizations, ''The New York Times'' or, for that matter, most of the leadership of an unnamed organization apparently patterned after the Gay Men's Health Crisis.&lt;ref name="frankrich"&gt;{{citation |title=Theater: The Normal Heart by Larry Kramer |url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9C00E3DB1E38F931A15757C0A963948260  |first=Frank |last=Rich |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 22, 1985 |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2014, HBO produced a [[The Normal Heart (film)|film version]] directed by [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] with a screenplay by Kramer. It starred [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Matt Bomer]] (who won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his performance), [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Jim Parsons]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Joe Mantello]], [[Jonathan Groff]], and [[Julia Roberts]].

=== ACT UP ===
{{main|ACT UP}}
In 1987, Kramer was the catalyst in the founding of the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP), a [[direct action]] protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center]] in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay "1,112 and Counting":  "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real trouble. If what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth. How long does it take before you get angry and fight back?"&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first target became the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which Kramer accused in ''The New York Times'' of neglecting badly needed medication for HIV-infected Americans.

Engaging in civil disobedience that would result in many people being arrested was a primary objective, as it would focus attention on the target. On March 24, 1987, 17 people out of 250 participating were arrested for blocking rush-hour traffic in front of the FDA's [[Wall Street]] offices.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinen, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer was arrested dozens of times working with ACT UP, and the organization grew to hundreds of chapters in the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Immunologist [[Anthony Fauci]] states "ACT UP put medical treatment in the hands of the patients. And that is the way it ought to be&amp;nbsp;... There is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. In American medicine there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry.&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; Playwright [[Tony Kushner]] offered his opinion of why Kramer fought so relentlessly: "In a way, like a lot of Jewish men of Larry's generation, the Holocaust is a defining historical moment, and what happened in the early 1980s with AIDS felt, and was in fact, holocaustal to Larry."&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

Two decades later Kramer continued to advocate for social and legal equity for homosexuals.  "Our own country's democratic process declares us to be unequal, which means, in a democracy, that our enemy is you," he wrote in 2007.  "You treat us like crumbs. You hate us. And sadly, we let you."&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kramer20mar20,0,1705133.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |title=Why do straights hate gays? |first=Larry |last=Kramer |periodical=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 20, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Just Say No, A Play about a Farce'' ===
{{main|Just Say No (play)}}
Continuing his commentary on government indifference toward AIDS, Kramer wrote ''Just Say No, A Play about a Farce'' in 1988.  He highlights the sexual hypocrisy in the Reagan and Koch administrations that allowed AIDS to become an epidemic; it concerns a [[First Lady]], her gay son, and the closeted gay mayor of America's "largest northeastern city". Its New York production, starring Kathleen Chalfant, Tonya Pinkens, and David Margulies, was prized by the few who came to see it after its negative review by ''The New York Times''. Social critic and writer [[Susan Sontag]] wrote of the piece, "Larry Kramer is one of America's most valuable troublemakers. I hope he never lowers his voice."{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== ''Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of an AIDS Activist'' ===
{{main|Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of an AIDS Activist}}

First published in 1989, and later expanded and republished in 1994, ''Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of an AIDS Activist'' contains a diverse selection of the nonfiction writings of Larry Kramer focused on AIDS activism and LGBT civil rights, including letters to the editor and speeches, which document his time spent at [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]], [[ACT UP]], and beyond.

The central message of the book is that gay men must accept responsibility for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS (PWA's) and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, "I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount.  By not putting back, you are saying that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all our friends and lovers have amounted to nothing.   I can't believe that in your heart of hearts you feel this way.  I can't believe you want to die.  Do you?"&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Larry, ''Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist''. St. Martin's Press 1994. {{ISBN|0-312-11419-2}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The first publication provides a portrait of Kramer as activist, and the 1994 edition contains commentary written by him that reflects on his earlier pieces and provides insight into Larry Kramer as writer.

Kramer directly and deliberately defines AIDS as a [[Names of the Holocaust|holocaust]] because he believes the United States' government failed to respond quickly and expend the necessary resources to cure AIDS, largely because AIDS initially infected gay men, and, quite soon after, predominantly poor and politically powerless minorities.  Through speeches, editorials, and personal, sometimes publicized, letters to figures such as politician [[Gary Bauer]], former New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]], several ''[[New York Times]]'' reporters, and head of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], [[Anthony Fauci]], Kramer personally advocates for a more significant response to AIDS.  He implores the government to conduct research based on commonly accepted scientific standards and to allocate funds and personnel to AIDS research.  Kramer ultimately states that the response to AIDS in America must be defined as a holocaust because of the large number deaths that resulted from the negligence and apathy that surrounded AIDS in the [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]], and early [[Bill Clinton]] presidencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Larry, ''Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of An AIDS Activist''. St. Martin's Press 1994. {{ISBN|0-312-11419-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Destiny of Me'' ===
{{main|The Destiny of Me}}
''The Destiny of Me'' picks up where ''The Normal Heart'' left off, following Ned Weeks as he continues his journey fighting those whose complacency or will impede the discovery of a cure for a disease from which he suffers. The play opened in October 1992 and ran for one year off Broadway at the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre]] by the [[Circle Repertory Company]].&lt;ref name=TimesDestiny&gt;{{citation |title=The Destiny of Me; Larry Kramer Tells His Own Anguished Story |first=Frank |last=Rich |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 1992 |url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9E0CE7DC1F3CF932A15753C1A964958260  |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]], was a double [[Obie Award]] winner and received the [[Lucille Lortel Awards|Lortel Award]] for Outstanding Play of the Year.  The original production starred [[John Cameron Mitchell]], "a young actor who dominates the show with a performance at once ethereal and magnetic", according to ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer Frank Rich.  Most powerful, Rich wrote, was the thematic question Kramer posed to himself: "Why was he of all people destined to scream bloody murder with the aim of altering the destiny of the human race?"&lt;ref name=TimesDestiny/&gt; Kramer states in his introduction to the play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This journey, from discovery through guilt to momentary joy and toward AIDS, has been my longest, most important journey, as important as—no, more important than my life with my parents, than my life as a writer, than my life as an activist.  Indeed, my homosexuality, as unsatisfying as much of it was for so long, has been the single most important defining characteristic of my life.&lt;ref name=GroveNormal&gt;{{citation |title=The Normal Heart and The Destiny of Me: Two Plays |first=Larry |last=Kramer |year=2000 |publisher=[[Grove Press]] |isbn=0-8021-3692-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Its recent 2002 London [[Finborough Theatre]] production was the No. 1 Critics Choice in ''[[The Evening Standard]]''.&lt;ref name="offwestend"&gt;{{citation |accessdate=2007-09-23 |url=http://www.offwestend.com/index.php/theatres/history/8 |title=Off West End's history of the Finborough Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Tragedy of Today's Gays'' ===
{{main|The Tragedy of Today's Gays}}
''Tragedy'' was a speech and a call to arms that Kramer delivered five days after the 2004 re-election of [[George W. Bush]] that he turned into a book.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/08/AR2005050800988.html |title=The Pessivist; AIDS Activist Larry Kramer, Hoarse From Speaking Truth to Power |first=Jose Antonio |last=Vargas |periodical=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 9, 2005 |accessdate=2007-09-23 |page=C01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer believed that Bush was re-elected largely because of his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], and found it inconceivable that voters would respond so strongly to that issue when there were so many more pressing ones:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Almost 60 million people whom we live and work with every day think we are immoral. "Moral values" was top of many lists of why people supported George Bush. Not [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Not the economy. Not terrorism. "Moral values". In case you need a translation that means us. It is hard to stand up to so much hate.&lt;ref name=Tragedy&gt;{{citation |url=http://hivforumnyc.org/pdf/larrykspeech.pdf |title=The Tragedy of Today's Gays |periodical=[[HIV Forum]] |accessdate=2006-04-22 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The speech's effects were far-reaching, and had most corners of the gay world once again discussing Kramer's moral vision of drive and self-worth for the LGBT community.

Kramer even stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Does it occur to you that we brought this plague of AIDS upon ourselves? I know I am getting into dangerous waters here but it is time. With the cabal breathing even more murderously down our backs it is time. And you are still doing it. You are still murdering each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2004/11/larry_kramer_sp.html|title=Larry Kramer Speech at Cooper Union - Towleroad|date=November 10, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kramer, again, had his detractors from the community.  Writing for [[Salon.com]], Richard Kim felt that once again Kramer personified the very object of his criticism: homophobia.
&lt;blockquote&gt;He recycles the kind of harangues about gay men (and young gay men in particular) that institutions like the ''Times'' so love to print&amp;nbsp;– that they are buffoonish, disengaged [[Peter Pan]]s dancing, drugging and fucking their lives away while the world and the disco burn down around them.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{citation |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/05/07/kramer/index.html |title=Sex panic |first=Richard |last=Kim |periodical=[[Salon.com]] |date=May 7, 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309153835/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/05/07/kramer/index.html |archivedate=March 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''The American People: A History'' ===
Around 1981,&lt;ref name=Nuremberg&gt;Kramer, Larry. [http://www.glreview.com/issues/13.5/13.5-kramer.php "Nuremberg Trials for AIDS".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725041539/http://www.glreview.com/issues/13.5/13.5-kramer.php |date=July 25, 2011 }} ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide''. September–October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer began researching and writing a manuscript called ''The American People: A History'', an ambitious historical work that begins in the [[Stone Age]] and continues into the present. For example, there is information relating to Kramer's assertion that [[Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln was gay]]. In 2002, Will Schwalbe, editor-in-chief of [[Hyperion Books]]&amp;nbsp;– the only man to have read the entire manuscript to that date&amp;nbsp;– said, "He has set himself the hugest of tasks," and he described it as "staggering, brilliant, funny, and harrowing."&lt;ref name=NewYorker/&gt; In 2006, Kramer said of the work, "[It is] my own history of America and of the cause of HIV/AIDS&amp;nbsp;... Writing and researching this history has convinced me that the plague of HIV/AIDS has been intentionally allowed to happen."&lt;ref name=Nuremberg /&gt;

The book was published as a novel by [[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]] in 2015. In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', Dwight Garner wrote, "I wish I could report that ''The American People, Volume 1'' had power to match its scope. It does not. As a work of sustained passion, it is formidable. As a work of art, it is very modest indeed. The tone is talky and digressive; few real characters emerge; one feels lashed to the mast after only 50 pages or so." In the book, Kramer writes that in addition to Abraham Lincoln, [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Franklin Pierce]], [[James Buchanan]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Herman Melville]], and [[Richard Nixon]] were gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/books/review-the-american-people-volume-1-by-larry-kramer-retells-history-with-passion.html|title=Review: ‘The American People, Volume 1’ by Larry Kramer Retells History With Passion|date=March 27, 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/11/were-lincoln-nixon-gay-history-book-divides-america|title=Were Lincoln and Nixon gay?

=== Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies ===
In 1997, Kramer approached [[Yale University]], to bequeath several million dollars "to endow a permanent, tenured professorship in gay studies and possibly to build a gay and lesbian student center."&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt;  At that time, gender, ethnic and race-related studies were viewed warily by academia. The then Yale provost, [[Alison Richard]], stated that gay and lesbian studies was too narrow a specialty for a program in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt; Kramer's rejected proposal read: "Yale is to use this money solely for 1) the study of and/or instruction in gay male literature, by which I mean courses to study gay male writers throughout history or the teaching to gay male students of writing about their heritage and their experience. To ensure for the continuity of courses in either or both of these areas tenured positions should be established; and/or 2) the establishment of a gay student center at Yale. . . ."&lt;ref name=Arenson/&gt;

In 2001, both sides agreed to a five-year trial with seed money of $1 million Arthur Kramer endowed to Yale to finance the ''Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies''. The money would pay visiting professors and a program coordinator for conferences, guest speakers and other events.&lt;ref name=YaleArenson&gt;{{citation |title=Gay Writer And Yale Finally Agree on Donation |first=Karen W |last=Arenson |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EEDF113FF931A35757C0A9679C8B63 |date=April 2, 2001 |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer agreed to leave his literary papers and those chronicling the AIDS movement and his founding of [[GMHC]] and [[ACT UP]] to Yale's [[Beinecke Library]].  "A lot has changed since I made my initial demands," said Kramer. "I was trying to cram stuff down their throat. I'd rather they fashion their own stuff. It may allow for a much more expandable notion of what lesbian and gay studies really is."&lt;ref name=YaleArenson/&gt; The program was closed down by Yale in 2006.

===Later work===
Kramer's novel, ''The American People: Volume 1'', was published in 2015 by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux|FSG]].

== Personal life ==

=== Relationship with his brother ===
{{see also|Arthur Kramer}}

Kramer's relationship with his brother, [[Arthur Kramer]], founding partner of the law firm [[Kramer Levin]], exploded into the public sphere with Kramer's 1984 play, ''[[The Normal Heart]].''  In the play, Kramer portrays Arthur (as Ben Weeks) as more concerned with building his $2 million house in [[Connecticut]] than in helping his brother's cause. Humorist [[Calvin Trillin]], a friend of both Larry and Arthur, once called ''The Normal Heart'' "the play about the building of [Arthur's] house".  Anemona Hartocollis observed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "their story came to define an era for hundreds of thousands of theatergoers".&lt;ref name=Anemona&gt;''Gay Brother, Straight Brother: It Could Be a Play'', Anemona Hartocollis, ''The New York Times'', June 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur, who had been his younger brother's protector against the parents they both disliked, couldn't find it in his heart to reject Larry, but also couldn't accept his homosexuality. This caused years of arguing and stretches of silence between the siblings.  &lt;!-- The rest of this paragraph needs a rewrite --&gt;In the 1980s, Larry wanted Arthur's firm to represent the fledgling [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]], a nonprofit Larry organized. Arthur said he had to clear it with his firm's intake committee. Larry saw this as an evasion—rightly, as Arthur said later.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Larry called for a gay boycott of [[MCI Communications|MCI]], a prominent Kramer Levin client, which Arthur saw as a personal affront. In 1992, [[Colorado]] voters passed [[Romer v. Evans|Amendment 2]], an anti-gay rights referendum, and Arthur refused to cancel a ski trip to [[Aspen]].&lt;ref name=Anemona/&gt;

Throughout their disagreements, they still stayed close. Larry writes of their relationship in ''The Normal Heart'': "The brothers love each other a great deal; [Arthur's] approval is essential to [Larry]."&lt;ref name=NormalHeart&gt;{{citation |title=The Normal Heart |first=Larry |last=Kramer |publisher=Grove Press |year=2000 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Arthur gave Yale a $1 million grant to establish the [[Larry Kramer#Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies|Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies]], a program focusing on gay history.&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/03_04/kramer.html |title=Back in the Fold |first=Mark Alden |last=Branch |periodical=[[Yale Alumni Magazine]] |date=April 2003 |accessdate=2007-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506022013/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/03_04/kramer.html |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer Levin went on to become one of the gay rights movement's staunchest advocates, helping [[Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund]] on such high-profile cases as ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and ''[[Hernandez v. Robles]]'' before the [[New York Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name="hernandezvrobles"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?hubtype=ProBono&amp;id=1173949429824 |title=Conversation with Jeffrey S. Trachtman |first=Thomas |last=Adcock |periodical=[[The New York Law Journal]] |date=March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Kramer retired from the firm in 1996 and died of a stroke in 2008.&lt;ref name=Anemona/&gt;

=== Health ===
In 1988, stress over the closing of his play ''Just Say No'', only a few weeks after its opening, forced Kramer into the hospital after it aggravated a congenital hernia. While in surgery, doctors discovered liver damage due to [[Hepatitis B]], prompting Kramer to learn that he was [[HIV positive]].&lt;ref&gt;Mass, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, at the age of 66, Kramer was in dire need of a [[liver transplant]], but he was turned down by [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]'s [[organ transplant]] list. People living with HIV were routinely considered inappropriate candidates for organ transplants because of complications from HIV and perceived short lifespans. Out of the 4,954 liver transplants performed in the United States, only 11 were for HIV-positive people.&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;France, David (June 11, 2001). "The Angry Prophet Is Dying", Newsweek, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The news prompted ''[[Newsweek]]'' to announce Kramer was dying in June 2001, and the [[Associated Press]] in December of the same year to claim Kramer had died.&lt;ref&gt;Stryker, Jeff (January 8, 2002). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E5DC1439F93BA35752C0A9649C8B63 "Writer Chuckles Over Report of His Demise"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer became a symbol for infected people who had new leases on life due to advances in medicine.  "We shouldn't face a death sentence because of who we are or who we love", he said in an interview. In May 2001, the [[Thomas Starzl|Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], which had performed more transplants for HIV positive patients than any other facility in the world, accepted Kramer on its list.&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt; Kramer received a new liver on December 21, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/healthscience/20011225kramer1225p2.asp|author=Snowbeck, Christopher|title=Man with HIV gets new liver|date=December 25, 2001|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Kramer and his partner, architectural designer David Webster, have been together since 1991. It was Webster's ending of his relationship with Kramer in the 1970s that inspired Kramer to write ''[[Faggots (novel)|Faggots]]'' (1978). When asked about their reunion decades later, Webster replied, "He'd grown up, I'd grown up."&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt; On July 24, 2013 in New York City, Kramer and Webster married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Larry Kramer Is Married in Hospital Ceremony|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/larry-kramer-is-married-in-hospital-ceremony/?smid=tw-share|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=July 25, 2013|first=Patrick|last=Healy|date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence===

Kramer currently lives in [[Manhattan]], near [[Washington Square Park]] in [[Greenwich Village]], and in [[Connecticut]].  Another resident of Kramer's Manhattan residential complex was Kramer's longtime nemesis, [[Ed Koch]].  The two saw each other relatively infrequently, since they lived in separate towers.  When Kramer saw Koch looking at the apartment in 1989, Kramer reportedly told him, "Don't move in here! There are people here who hate you!"  On another occasion, Koch tried to pet Kramer's dog in the building's mail area, and Kramer snatched the dog away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/nyregion/koch-was-a-renter-to-the-end.html | work=The New York Times | first=Elizabeth A. | last=Harris | title=Koch Was a Renter to the End | date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">'''Marlene Behrmann''' (born April 14, 1959) is a [[Professor]] of [[Psychology]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].  She specializes in the [[cognitive neuroscience]] of [[visual perception]], with a specific focus on [[object recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/behrmannlab/|title=CMU - Behrmann Lab - Carnegie Mellon University|last=University|first=Carnegie Mellon|website=www.cmu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Biography==
She received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[speech pathology|speech and hearing therapy]] from the [[University of Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] in 1981; an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[speech pathology]] from the University of Witwatersrand in 1984, and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Psychology]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1991.  From 1991-1993, Behrmann worked in the Departments of Psychology and [[Medicine]] of the [[University of Toronto]], and in 1993, she accepted a position as a faculty member in the Department of Psychology at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where she has remained since.  She has also held an [[adjunct professor]]ship in the Departments of [[Neuroscience]] and [[Speech pathology|Communication Disorders]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] since 1994, and she has served as a [[Visiting Professor]] at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Israel]] in 2000-2001 and the [[University of Toronto]] in 2006-2007.  Behrmann is a member of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at CMU.

==Research==
The major approach she uses in her research is to study the behavior of human [[adults]] who have sustained [[brain damage]] (usually through [[stroke]] or [[head injury]]), which selectively affects their ability to carry out these processes.  Behrmann also conducts [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] studies with brain damaged subjects in order to treat the observed deficits, which also sheds light on the mechanisms underlying visual cognition.

'''Mimetic drift''' describes the flow of [[memes]] across a social group. A typical usage can be seen in the edition of ''The Harrow Technology Report'' dated 22 December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theharrowgroup.com/articles/20031222/20031222.htm "Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went. Most of these are variants on "Anything that can go wrong, will," but as we'll see in a moment, this is correctly referred to as Finagle's Law. The mimetic drift apparent in these mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!"&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was used as the title of a short story by [[science fiction]] author [[Glenn Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/harrison/Cyberpunk/cyberpunk.html Jason Harrison's "Cyberpunk" reading list&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multistage testing''' is an [[algorithm]]-based approach to administering [[Test (student assessment)|tests]]. It is very similar to [[computer-adaptive testing]] in that items are interactively selected for each examinee by the algorithm, but rather than selecting individual items, groups of items are selected, building the test in stages. These groups are called ''testlets'' or ''panels''.&lt;ref&gt;Luecht, R. M. &amp; Nungester, R. J. (1998). "Some practical examples of computer-adaptive sequential testing." ''Journal of Educational Measurement'', '''35''', 229-249. &lt;/ref&gt;

While multistage tests could theoretically be administered by a human, the extensive computations required (often using [[item response theory]]) mean that multistage tests are administered by computer.

The number of stages or testlets can vary. If the testlets are relatively small, such as five items, ten or more could easily be used in a test. Some multistage tests are designed with the minimum of two stages (one stage would be a conventional fixed-form test).&lt;ref&gt;Castle, R.A. (1997). "The Relative Efficiency of Two-Stage Testing Versus Traditional Multiple Choice Testing Using Item Response Theory in Licensure." Unpublished doctoral dissertation.[http://dwb.unl.edu/Diss/RCastle/ReedCastleDiss.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the increasing use of multistage testing, the scholarly journal ''Applied Measurement in Education'' published a special edition on the topic in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Measurement in Education'' edition on multistage testing [http://www.leaonline.com/toc/ame/19/3]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Protective factors''' are conditions or attributes (skills, strengths, resources, supports or [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategies) in individuals, families, communities or the larger society that help people deal more effectively with [[stress (psychological)|stressful events]] and mitigate or eliminate [[risk]] in families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childwelfare.gov/can/factors/protective.cfm A definition of protective factors by a governmental institution for children's welfare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suicideoutreach.org/warning_signs A web page for the prevention of suicide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421041848/http://www.suicideoutreach.org/warning_signs |date=2012-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Preventative Medicine and Health Psychology, Protective Factors refer to any factor that decreases the chances of a negative health outcome occurring.  Conversely, a [[Risk factor]] will increase the chances of a negative health outcome occurring.  Just as statistical correlations and regressions can examine how a range of independent variables impact a dependent variable, we can examine how many Protective and Risk factors contribute to the likelihood of an illness occurring.

==Adoption==

Protective factors include:
*Adoptive parents having an accurate understanding of their adopted children's pre-adoption medical and behavioral problems &lt;ref&gt;Simmel, C. (2007). Risk and protective factors contributing to the longitudinal psycho-social well-being of adopted foster children. Journal of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders,15(4), 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assistance of adoption professionals in the home of adopted children &lt;ref&gt;Reilly, T. &amp; Platz, L. (2004). Post-adoption service needs of families with special needs children : Use, helpfulness, and unmet needs. Journal of Social Service Research 30(4)51-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some risks that adopted children are prone to:&lt;ref&gt;Howe, David. (1997). Parent-reported problems in 211 adopted children : Some risk and protective factors. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 38(4), 401-411.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Self-mutilation
*Delinquency
*Trouble with the law
*Substance abuse
*Thievery

==Medical career==
[[File:Keble College Chapel - Oct 2006.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Keble College, Oxford]]
On leaving [[Liverpool College]], Tallis gained an Open Scholarship to [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he completed a degree in [[animal physiology]] in 1967. He completed his [[MBBS|medical degree]] in 1970 at the University of Oxford and [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London. From 1996 to 2000, he was Consultant Adviser in Care of the Elderly to the Chief Medical Officer. In 1999–2000, he was Vice-Chairman of the Stroke Task Force of the Advisory Group developing the [[National Service Framework]] for Older People. He has been on the Standing Medical Advisory Committee and the Council of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and was secretary of the Joint Specialist Committee of the Royal College on Health Care of the Elderly between 1995 and 2003. He was a member of the Joint Task Force on Partnership in Medicine Taking, established by [[Alan Milburn]], the [[Secretary of State for Health]], in 2001. For three years he was a member of one of the appraisal panels of the [[National Institute of Clinical Excellence]]. He retired in 2006 as Emeritus Professor of [[Geriatric Medicine]] at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Brown [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,1763818,00.html "The ardent atheist",] –  interview with Raymond Tallis in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 April 2006. Retrieved on 21 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical works==
Tallis attacked [[post-structuralism]] in books such as ''Not Saussure'',&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, ''Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory'', Macmillan Press 1988, 2nd ed. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theorrhoea and After''&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, ''Theorrhoea and After'', Macmillan, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected the assumptions of much [[artificial intelligence]] research in his book ''Why the Mind is Not a Computer: A Pocket Dictionary on Neuromythology''.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, ''Why the Mind is Not a Computer: A Pocket Dictionary on Neuromythology'', Imprint Academic, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He denies that our appreciation of art and music can be reduced to scientific terms.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, [http://iai.tv/video/neuroscience-and-the-mystery-of-music/ "Neuroscience and the Mystery of Music"] – How The Light Gets In, 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical writings supply an anthropology that acknowledges what is distinctive – and remarkable – about human beings. To this end he has written a trilogy of books entitled ''The Hand'';&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, ''The Hand: A philosophical inquiry into human being,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; ''I Am: A Philosophical Inquiry into First-Person Being'';&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, ''I Am: A Philosophical Inquiry into First-Person Being'', 2004, Edinburgh University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Knowing Animal''.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Tallis, ''The Knowing Animal: A Philosophical Inquiry into Knowledge and Truth'', Edinburgh University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written extensively about the misuse of scientific language and concepts to explain human experiences.&lt;ref&gt;See Thinking Straight About Curved Space by Raymond Tallis, June 2015, [http://philosophynow.org/issues/108/Thinking_Straight_About_Curved_Space here] accessed 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A course of [[penicillin]] is a regimen, and there are many [[chemotherapy regimen]]s in the treatment of [[cancer]].

== History ==
The work, ''Regimen in Acute Diseases'', attributed to the ancient Greek physician, [[Hippocrates of Cos]], describes the types and usage of medical regimens in his era (400 BCE). This is perhaps the first appearance of the [[terminology|term]].&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates of Cos. ''On Regimen in Acute Diseases'' Francis Adams, trans. 400 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Mark T, "Hippocrates", Great Thinkers of the Western World, HarperCollins Publishers, 1992. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[PubMed]] at the [[US National Library of Medicine]] lists over 220,000 articles using the term "regimen" from 1892 to January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=regimen |title=regimen - PubMed|author=pubmeddev|work=nih.gov|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of medieval medicine, regimen referred to the careful management of habits, diet, and schedule to keep the four [[Humorism|humors]] in equilibrium.  By manipulating the six non-naturals (airs, diet, sleep, exercise, evacuation, and emotion) a person could keep track of their physical and mental wellbeing by attending to regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaguchi|first=N.|year=2010|title=Non-Naturals in Islamic Medicine|url=|journal=Journal of Japanese History of Medicine|volume=56|pages=53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in statistics==
In economic statistics, a regimen refers to the selected goods and/or services priced for the purpose of compiling a [[price index]]. The most well known example is the [[consumer price index]].

[[File:Harvest of peppers at a SOIL experimental garden.jpg|thumb|Harvest of [[capsicum]] grown with excreta-based [[compost]] at an experimental garden in [[Haiti]]]]

'''Reuse of excreta''' (or '''re-use''' or '''use of excreta''') refers to the safe, beneficial use of animal or [[human waste|human excreta]], i.e. [[feces]] (or faeces in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) and [[urine]]. Such beneficial use involves mainly the nutrient, organic matter and energy contained in excreta, rather than the water content (as is the case for [[Reclaimed water|wastewater reuse)]]. Reuse of excreta can involve using it as [[soil conditioner]] or [[fertilizer]] in [[agriculture]], [[gardening]], [[aquaculture]] or [[Horticulture|horticultural]] activities. Excreta can also be [[#Solid fuel, heat, electricity|used as a fuel source]] or as a building material.

Excreta contains resources that can be recovered: plant-available nutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] as well as micronutrients such as [[sulphur]] and [[organic matter]]. These resources which are contained in excreta or in domestic [[wastewater]] ([[sewage]])  have traditionally been used in agriculture in many countries. They are still being used in agriculture to this day, but the practice is often carried out in an unregulated and unsafe manner in developing countries. The WHO Guidelines from 2006 have set up a framework how this reuse can be done safely by following a "multiple barrier approach".&lt;ref name="WHO2006"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of "excreta-derived fertilizers" which vary in their properties and fertilizing characteristics: urine, dried feces, composted feces, [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] (septage), [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]] and animal [[manure]].

Reuse of excreta is the final step of the [[sanitation]] chain which starts with collection of excreta (by use of [[toilet]]s) and continues with transport and treatment all the way to either disposal or reuse.&lt;ref name="compendium"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised Edition)|last = Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbrügg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Background ==

[[Sanitation]] systems that are designed for safe, effective [[Resource recovery|recovery of resources]] can play an important role in a community’s overall [[Environmental resource management|resource management]]. Various technologies and practices, ranging in scale from a single rural household to a city, can be used to capture potentially valuable resources and make them available for safe, productive uses that support human well-being and broader [[sustainability]].

The resources available in wastewater and excreta include water, [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]], [[organic matter]] and energy content.  Reuse of excreta focuses on the nutrient and organic matter content of excreta unlike [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] which focuses on the water content.

The most common type of reuse of excreta is as fertilizer and soil conditioner in agriculture. This is also called a "closing the loop" approach for [[sanitation]] with agriculture. It is a central aspect of the [[ecological sanitation]] approach. An alternative term is also "use of excreta" rather than "[[reuse]]" as strictly speaking it is the ''first'' ''use'' of excreta, not the second time that it is used.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

It can be efficient to combine wastewater and excreta with other [[Biodegradable waste|organic waste]] such as manure, food and crop waste for the purposes of resource recovery.&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C. (2016). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2636 Sanitation, Wastewater Management and Sustainability: from Waste Disposal to Resource Recovery]. Nairobi and Stockholm: United Nations Environment Programme and Stockholm Environment Institute. {{ISBN|978-92-807-3488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reuse options ===

The most common types of excreta reuse, including excreta on their own or mixed with water in the case of domestic wastewater ([[sewage]]), are:&lt;ref name="Andersson" /&gt;
* [[Fertilizer]] and irrigation water in agriculture and horticulture: for example using [[Reclaimed water|recovered and treated water]] for irrigation; using composted excreta (and other organic waste) or appropriately treated [[biosolids]] as [[Organic fertilizer|fertilizer]] and [[soil conditioner]]; using treated source-separated urine as [[Urine#Fertilizer|fertilizer]].
* Energy: for example digesting feces and other organic waste to produce [[biogas]]; or producing combustible fuels.
* Other: other emerging excreta reuse options include producing protein feeds for livestock using [[Hermetia illucens|black soldier fly larvae]], recovering organic matter for use as building material or in paper production.

=== Multiple barrier concept for safe use in agriculture ===
Research into how to make reuse of urine and feces safe in agriculture was carried out in Sweden since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Joensson"&gt;Joensson, H., Richert Stintzing, A., Vinneras, B., Salomon, E. (2004). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/187 Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production]. Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) provided guidelines on safe reuse of wastewater, excreta and greywater.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; The multiple barrier concept to reuse, which is the key cornerstone of this publication, has led to a clear understanding on how excreta reuse can be done safely. The concept is also used in water supply and food production and is generally understood as a series of treatment steps and other safety precautions to prevent the spread of pathogens.

The degree of treatment required for excreta-based fertilizers before they can safely be used in agriculture depends on a number of factors. It mainly depends on which other barriers will be put in place according to the multiple barrier concept. Such barriers might be selecting a suitable crop, farming methods, methods of applying the fertilizer, education and so forth.&lt;ref name="Richert"&gt;Richert, A., Gensch, R., Jönsson, H., Stenström, T., Dagerskog, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/757 Practical guidance on the use of urine in crop production]. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the case of [[urine-diverting dry toilets]] (UDDTs) secondary treatment of dried feces can be performed at community level rather than at household level and can include [[thermophilic composting]] where fecal material is composted at over 50&amp;nbsp;°C, prolonged storage with the duration of 1.5 to two years, chemical treatment with ammonia from urine to inactivate the pathogens, solar sanitation for further drying or heat treatment to eliminate pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Niwagaba, C. B. (2009).

=== Comparison of excreta-based fertilizers to other fertilizers ===
{{Further|Fertilizer|Organic fertilizer}}
[[File:Spinach experiments at the SOIL farm.jpg|thumb|Comparison of [[spinach]] field with (left) and without (right) [[compost]], experiments at the [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] farm in Port-au-Prince, Haiti]]
There is an untapped fertilizer resource in human excreta. In Africa, for example, the theoretical quantities of nutrients that can be recovered from human excreta are comparable with all current fertilizer use on the continent.&lt;ref name="Andersson" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Reuse can therefore support increased food production and also provide an alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is often unaffordable to small-holder farmers.

Mineral fertilizers are made from mining activities and can contain heavy metals. Phosphate ores contain heavy metals such as cadmium and uranium, which can reach the food chain via mineral phosphate fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Kratz, S. (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142857/http://gevleugeldewoorden.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Uran-Tag-download-5.pdf Uran in Düngemitteln] (in German)''.'' Uran-Umwelt-Unbehagen: Statusseminar am 14. Oktober 2004, Bundesforschungsinstitut für Landwirtschaft (FAL), Institut für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply to excreta-based fertilizers which is an advantage.

In intensive agricultural land use, animal manure is often not used as targeted as mineral fertilizers and thus the nitrogen utilization efficiency is poor. Animal manure can become a problem in terms of excessive use in areas of intensive agriculture with high numbers of livestock and too little available farmland.

Fertilizing elements of organic fertilizers are mostly bound in carbonaceous reduced compounds. If these are already partially oxidized as in the compost, the fertilizing minerals are adsorbed on the degradation products ([[humic acids]]) etc. Thus, they exhibit a slow-release effect and are usually less rapidly leached compared to mineral fertilizers.&lt;ref name="SRN"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J.

=== Peak phosphorus ===
{{Further|Peak phosphorus}}
In the case of phosphorus in particular, reuse of excreta is one known method to recover phosphorus to mitigate the looming shortage (also known as "[[peak phosphorus]]") of economical mined phosphorus. Mined phosphorus is a limited resource that is being used up for fertilizer production at an ever-increasing rate, which is threatening worldwide [[food security]]. Therefore, phosphorus from excreta-based fertilizers is an interesting alternative to fertilizers containing mined phosphate ore.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Association (2010).

[[Urine]] is primarily composed of water and [[urea]]. It contains large quantities of [[nitrogen]] (N) (mostly as urea), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved [[potassium]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10643389.2014.1000761 |pmid=26246784 |pmc=4500995 |title=The Characterization of Feces and Urine: A Review of the Literature to Inform Advanced Treatment Technology |journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology |volume=45 |issue=17 |pages=1827–1879 |year=2015 |last1=Rose |first1=C |last2=Parker |first2=A |last3=Jefferson |first3=B |last4=Cartmell |first4=E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nutrient concentrations in urine vary with diet.&lt;ref name="Joensson" /&gt; In particular nitrogen content in urine is related to quantity of protein in the diet: A high protein diet results in high urea levels in urine. Urine's eight main ionic species (&gt; 0.1 meq L−1) are [[cation]]s [[sodium|Na]], [[potassium|K]], [[ammonium|NH4]], [[calcium|Ca]] and the [[anions]], [[chlor|Cl]], [[sulfate|SO4]], [[phosphate|PO4]] and [[HCO3]].&lt;ref name="kirchmann1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirchmann|first=H.|last2=Pettersson|first2=S.|year=1995|title=Human urine - Chemical composition and fertilizer use efficiency|journal=Fertilizer Research|publisher=Springer Nature|volume=40|issue=2|pages=149–154|doi=10.1007/bf00750100|issn=0167-1731|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urine typically contains 70% of the nitrogen and more than half the [[potassium]] found in [[sewage]], while making up less than 1% of the overall volume.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Urine fertilizer is usually applied diluted with water because undiluted urine can [[Fertilizer burn|chemically burn]] the leaves or roots of some plants, particularly if the soil moisture content is low. The dilution also helps to reduce odour development following application. Applying urine as fertilizer has been called "closing the cycle of agricultural nutrient flows" or ecological sanitation or [[ecosan]].

When diluted with water (at a 1:5 ratio for container-grown [[annual plant|annual]] crops with fresh growing medium each season or a 1:8 ratio for more general use), it can be applied directly to soil as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ecosanres.org/PM_Report.htm|title=An Ecological Approach to Sanitation in Africa: A Compilation of Experiences|last=Morgan|first=Peter|year=2004|edition=CD release|location=Aquamor, Harare, Zimbabwe|chapter=10.

The more general limitations to using urine as fertilizer depend mainly on the potential for buildup of excess nitrogen (due to the high ratio of that macronutrient),&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; and inorganic [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s such as [[sodium chloride]], which are also part of the wastes excreted by the [[renal system]]. [[Fertilizer burn|Over-fertilization]] with urine or other nitrogen fertilizers can result in too much ammonia for plants to absorb, acidic conditions, or other [[phytotoxicity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Important parameters to consider while fertilizing with urine include salinity tolerance of the plant, soil composition, addition of other fertilizing compounds, and quantity of rainfall or other irrigation.&lt;ref name="Joensson" /&gt;

It was reported in 1995 that urine nitrogen gaseous losses were relatively high and plant uptake lower than with labelled [[ammonium nitrate]]. In contrast, [[phosphorus]] was utilized at a higher rate than soluble phosphate.&lt;ref name="kirchmann1995" /&gt;

Human urine can be collected with [[sanitation]] systems that utilize [[urinals]] or [[urine diversion]] toilets. If urine is to be collected for use as a fertilizer in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is (in increasing order of costs) by using waterless [[urinals]], [[Urine-diverting dry toilets|urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs)]] or [[urine diversion]] flush toilets.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

The risks of using urine as a natural source of agricultural fertilizer are generally regarded as negligible or acceptable. There are potentially more environmental problems (such as [[eutrophication]] resulting from the influx of nutrient rich effluent into aquatic or marine ecosystems) and a higher energy consumption when urine is treated as part of [[sewage]] in [[wastewater treatment plants]] compared with when it is used directly as a fertilizer resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12926619 |year=2003 |author1=Maurer |first1=M |title=Nutrients in urine: Energetic aspects of removal and recovery |journal=Water science and technology : A journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |last2=Schwegler |first2=P |last3=Larsen |first3=T.

In developing countries the use of raw sewage or [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] has been common throughout history, yet the application of pure urine to crops is rare. Increasingly there are calls for urine's use as a fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Mara Grunbaum [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-urine-is-an-effective-fertilizer Human urine is shown to be an effective agricultural fertilizer], Scientific American, July 2010. Retrieved on 2011-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2011, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] is providing research funding sanitation systems that recover the nutrients in urine.&lt;ref&gt;von Muench, E., Spuhler, D., Surridge, T., Ekane, N., Andersson, K., Fidan, E. G., Rosemarin, A. (2013).

==== Examples ====
* In Tororo District in eastern Uganda - a region with severe [[land degradation]] problems - [[smallholding|smallholder farmers]] appreciated urine fertilization as a low-cost, low-risk practice.  They found it could contribute to significant yield increases. The importance of social norms and cultural perceptions needs to be recognized but are not absolute barriers to adoption of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.070 |title=Turning waste into value: Using human urine to enrich soils for sustainable food production in Uganda |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=96 |pages=290–8 |year=2015 |last1=Andersson |first1=Elina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dried feces ===

Reuse of dried [[feces]] (feces) from [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s (UDDTs) after post-treatment can result in increased crop production through fertilizing effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and improved soil fertility through organic carbon.&lt;ref name="Rieck1" /&gt;

=== Composted feces ===
{{Main|Uses of compost}}
[[File:Cabbage grown in compost.jpg|thumb|[[Cabbage]] grown in excreta-based [[compost]] (left) and without soil amendments (right), [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] in Haiti]]
[[Compost]] derived from [[composting toilets]] (where organic kitchen waste is in some cases also added to the composting toilet), has in principal the same uses as compost derived from other organic waste products, such as [[sewage sludge]] or municipal organic waste. One limiting factor may be legal restrictions due to the possibility that pathogens remain in the compost. In any case, the use of compost from composting toilets in one's own garden can be regarded as safe and is the main method of use for compost from composting toilets. Hygienic measures for handling of the compost must be applied by all those people who are exposed to it, e.g. wearing gloves and boots.

Some of the [[urine]] will be part of the compost, although some urine will be lost via leachate and evaporation. [[Urine]] can contain up to 90 percent of the [[nitrogen]], up to 50 percent of the [[phosphorus]], and up to 70 percent of the [[potassium]] present in human excreta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/en-fighting-urine-blindness-1998.pdf J.O. Drangert, Urine separation systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222023233/http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/en-fighting-urine-blindness-1998.pdf |date=2014-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutrients in compost from a composting toilet have a higher plant availability than the product (dried feces) from a [[urine-diverting dry toilet]].&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;Berger, W. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/878 Technology review of composting toilets - Basic overview of composting toilets (with or without urine diversion).] Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fecal sludge ===
{{Further|Fecal sludge management}}
[[Fecal sludge management|Fecal sludge]] (also called [[septage]]) is defined as "coming from onsite sanitation technologies, and has not been transported through a sewer." Examples of onsite technologies include pit latrines, unsewered public ablution blocks, septic tanks and dry toilets. Fecal sludge can be treated by a variety of methods to render it suitable for reuse in agriculture. These include (usually carried out in combination): dewatering, thickening, drying (in sludge drying beds), [[composting]], pelletization, [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref name="Ronteltap" /&gt;

=== Municipal wastewater ===
{{Further|Reclaimed water}}
[[Reclaimed water]] can be reused for irrigation, industrial uses, replenishing natural water courses, water bodies and [[aquifer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and other potable and non-potable uses. These applications however focus usually on the water aspect, not on the nutrients and organic matter reuse aspect, which is the focus of "reuse of excreta".

When wastewater is reused in agriculture, its nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content may be useful for additional fertilizer application.&lt;ref name="Otoo"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and others has led to guidelines on how reuse of municipal wastewater in agriculture for irrigation and fertilizer application can be safely implemented in low income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=|title=Wastewater irrigation and health : assessing and mitigating risk in low-income countries|date=2010|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=978-1-84407-795-3|edition=London : Earthscan.|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1782|last = Drechsel, P., Scott, C. A., Raschid-Sally, L., Redwood, M., Bahri, A. (eds.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

=== Sewage sludge ===
{{Main|Sewage sludge|Biosolids}}
The use of treated [[sewage sludge]] (after treatment also called "[[biosolids]]") as a [[soil conditioner]] or fertilizer is possible but is a controversial topic in some countries (such as USA, some countries in Europe) due to the chemical pollutants it may contain, such as heavy metals and [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s.

[[Northumbrian Water]] in the [[United Kingdom]] uses two [[anaerobic digestion|biogas plants]] to produce what the company calls "poo power" - using [[sewage sludge]] to produce energy to generate income. [[Biogas]] production has reduced its pre 1996 [[Electricity generation#Turbines|electricity]] expenditure of 20 million [[pounds sterling|GBP]] by about 20% . [[Severn Trent]] and [[Wessex Water]] also have similar projects.&lt;ref name="bbc news"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37981485|title=The firms turning poo into profit|last=|first=|date=16 November 2016|website=|publisher=BBC News Business Section|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sludge treatment liquids ===
{{Further|Sewage sludge treatment}}
Sludge treatment liquids (after [[anaerobic digestion]]) can be used as an input source for a process to recover phosphorus in the form of [[struvite]] for use as fertilizer. For example, the Canadian company Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies is marketing a process based on controlled chemical precipitation of phosphorus in a fluidized bed reactor that recovers struvite in the form of crystalline pellets from sludge dewatering streams. The resulting crystalline product is sold to the [[agriculture]], [[turf]] and [[ornamental plant]]s sectors as fertilizer under the registered trade name "Crystal Green".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ostara.com/nutrient-management-solutions/pearl-process|title = Ostara Nutrient Management Solutions|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = |publisher = Ostara, Vancouver, Canada|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219161148/http://www.ostara.com/nutrient-management-solutions/pearl-process|archivedate = 19 February 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal manure ===
{{Further|Manure}}
Animal dung ([[manure]]) has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for [[farming]], as it improves the soil structure (aggregation), so that it holds more nutrients and water, and becomes more fertile.  Animal manure also encourages soil microbial activity, which promotes the soil's trace mineral supply, improving plant nutrition.  It also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants.

== Health and environmental aspects of agricultural use ==

=== Pathogens ===
[[File:Step 4- Final maturing (beginning) (5012011706).jpg|thumb|Gardeners of Fada N'Gourma in Burkina Faso apply dry excreta after mixing with other organic fertilizer (donkey manure, cow manure) and pure fertile soil, and after maturing for another 2 to 4 months]]

==== Risk management ====
Exposure of farm workers to untreated excreta constitutes a significant health risk due to its [[pathogen]] content. This risk also extends to consumers of crops fertilized with untreated excreta. Therefore, excreta need to be appropriately treated before reuse, and health aspects need to be managed for all reuse applications as the excreta can contain [[pathogens]] even after treatment.

==== Treatment of excreta for pathogen removal ====
The treatment of excreta and wastewater for pathogen removal can take place: 
* at the toilet itself (for example urine collected from [[urine-diverting dry toilets]] is often treated by simple storage at the household level); or 
* at a semi-centralized level for example by [[composting]]; or 
* at a fully centralized level at [[sewage treatment plants]] and [[sewage sludge treatment|sewage sludge treatment plants]].

==== Indicator organisms ====
As an [[indicator organism]] in reuse schemes, [[helminth]] eggs are commonly used as these organisms are the most difficult to destroy in most treatment processes. The multiple barrier approach is recommended where e.g. lower levels of treatment may be acceptable when combined with other post-treatment barriers along the [[sanitation]] chain.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;

=== Pharmaceutical residues ===
Excreta from humans and farmed animals contain [[hormones]] and [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] residues which could in theory enter the food chain via fertilized crops but are currently not fully removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants anyway and can enter drinking water sources via household wastewater (sewage).&lt;ref name=":Winker"&gt;von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/875 Technology review of urine diversion components - Overview on urine diversion components such as waterless urinals, urine diversion toilets, urine storage and reuse systems.] Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the pharmaceutical residues in the excreta are degraded better in terrestrial systems (soil) than in aquatic systems.&lt;ref name=":Winker"/&gt;

=== Nitrate pollution ===
Only a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter.  The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off.&lt;ref name="Nasir"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7814-6_5 |chapter=Eutrophication of Lakes |title=Eutrophication: Causes, Consequences and Control |pages=55–71 |year=2014 |last1=Callisto |first1=Marcos |last2=Molozzi |first2=Joseline |last3=Barbosa |first3=José Lucena Etham |isbn=978-94-007-7813-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to excreta-based fertilizer since it also contains nitrogen. Excessive nitrogen which is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092932 |pmid=18444903 |title=Roots, Nitrogen Transformations, and Ecosystem Services |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |volume=59 |pages=341–63 |year=2008 |last1=Jackson |first1=Louise E |last2=Burger |first2=Martin |last3=Cavagnaro |first3=Timothy R }}&lt;/ref&gt; High application rates combined with the high water-solubility of nitrate leads to increased [[Surface runoff#Agricultural issues|runoff]] into [[surface water]] as well as [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] into [[groundwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=C.

== Other uses of excreta (non fertilizer) ==
Apart from use in agriculture, there are other possible uses of excreta. For example, in the case of fecal sludge, it can be treated and then serve as protein ([[black soldier fly]] process), [[fodder]], fish food, building materials and [[biofuels]] ([[biogas]] from [[anaerobic digestion]], incineration or co-combustion of dried sludge, pyrolysis of fecal sludge, biodiesel from fecal sludge).&lt;ref name="Ronteltap"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Linda |editor1-last=Strande |editor2-first=Mariska |editor2-last=Ronteltap |editor3-first=Damir |editor3-last=Brdjanovic |title=Faecal sludge management: systems approach for implementation and operation |year=2013 |publisher=IWA Publishing |isbn=978-1-78040-472-1 |url=http://www.sandec.ch/fsm_book }}{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersson" /&gt;

===Solid fuel, heat, electricity ===
[[Dry animal dung fuel|Dry animal dung]] is used as a fuel in many countries around the world.

Pilot scale research in Uganda and Senegal has shown that it is viable to use dry feces as for combustion in industry, provided it has been dried to a minimum of 28% dry solids.&lt;ref name="diener"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.04.005 |title=A value proposition: Resource recovery from faecal sludge—Can it be the driver for improved sanitation? |journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling |volume=88 |pages=32–8 |year=2014 |last1=Diener |first1=Stefan |last2=Semiyaga |first2=Swaib |last3=Niwagaba |first3=Charles B |last4=Muspratt |first4=Ashley Murray |last5=Gning |first5=Jean Birane |last6=Mbéguéré |first6=Mbaye |last7=Ennin |first7=Joseph Effah |last8=Zurbrugg |first8=Christian |last9=Strande |first9=Linda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dried sewage sludge can be burned in [[sludge incineration]] plants, and generate heat and electricity (the [[waste-to-energy]] process is one example).

=== Hydrogen fuel ===

Urine has also been investigated as a potential source of [[hydrogen fuel]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.089 |title=Hydrogen production and ammonium recovery from urine by a Microbial Electrolysis Cell |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=4771–8 |year=2014 |last1=Kuntke |first1=P |last2=Sleutels |first2=T.H.J.A |last3=Saakes |first3=M |last4=Buisman |first4=C.J.N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.009 |title=Electrolysis of urea and urine for solar hydrogen |journal=Catalysis Today |volume=199 |pages=2–7 |year=2013 |last1=Kim |first1=Jungwon |last2=Choi |first2=Won Joon K |last3=Choi |first3=Jina |last4=Hoffmann |first4=Michael R |last5=Park |first5=Hyunwoong }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urine was found to be a suitable wastewater for high rate hydrogen production in a [[Microbial electrolysis cell|Microbial Electrolysis Cell]] (MEC).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Biogas ===
{{Further|Biogas}}
Small-scale [[biogas]] plants are being utilized in many countries, including Ghana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejpe.2016.10.004 |title=Feasibility study for biogas integration into waste treatment plants in Ghana |journal=Egyptian Journal of Petroleum |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=695–703 |year=2017 |last1=Mohammed |first1=M |last2=Egyir |first2=I.S |last3=Donkor |first3=A.K |last4=Amoah |first4=P |last5=Nyarko |first5=S |last6=Boateng |first6=K.K |last7=Ziwu |first7=C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.114 |title=Addressing problems at small-scale biogas plants: A case study from central Vietnam |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=112 |pages=2784–92 |year=2016 |last1=Roubík |first1=Hynek |last2=Mazancová |first2=Jana |last3=Banout |first3=Jan |last4=Verner |first4=Vladimír }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2017.08.068 |title=Current approach to manure management for small-scale Southeast Asian farmers - Using Vietnamese biogas and non-biogas farms as an example |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=115 |pages=362–70 |year=2018 |last1=Roubík |first1=Hynek |last2=Mazancová |first2=Jana |last3=Phung |first3=Le Dinh |last4=Banout |first4=Jan }}1&lt;/ref&gt; Larger centralized systems are being planned that mix animal and human feces to produce biogas.&lt;ref name="diener" /&gt; Biogas is also produced during [[sewage sludge treatment]] processes with [[anaerobic digestion]].

=== Food source to produce protein for animal feed ===
Pilot facilities are being developed for feeding [[Hermetia illucens|Black Soldier Fly larvae]] with feces.  The mature flies would then be a source of protein to be included in the production of feed for chickens in South Africa.&lt;ref name="diener" /&gt;

===Building materials===
It is known that additions of fecal matter up to 20% by dried weight in clay bricks does not make a significant functional difference to bricks.&lt;ref name="diener" /&gt;

=== Precious metals recovery ===
A Japanese sewage treatment facility extracts [[Precious metal|precious metals]] from [[sewage sludge]]. This idea was also tested by the US Geological Survey (USGS) which found that the sewage sludge generated by 1 million people contained 13 million dollars worth of precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

== Economic considerations ==
Debate is ongoing about whether reuse of excreta is cost effective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The terms "sanitation economy" and "toilet resources" have been introduced to describe the potential for selling products made from [[human feces]] or [[urine]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=19 September 2017|website=Thompson Reuters Foundation News|access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.toiletboard.org/media/30-Sanitation_Economy_Final.pdf|title=Introducing the Sanitation Economy|last=|first=|publisher=Toilet Board Coalition|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sale of compost  ===
The NGO [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] in [[Haiti]] began building [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s and [[composting]] the waste produced for agricultural use in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Dell'Amore, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/10/111026-haiti-waste-poop-fertilizer-farms-soil-science-environment/ "Human Waste to Revive Haitian Farmland?"], ''The National Geographic'', October 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; SOIL’s two composting waste treatment facilities currently transform over 20,000 gallons (75,708 liters) of human excreta into organic, agricultural-grade compost every month.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Hera, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/going-global/exam-question-inspires-award-winning-entrepreneur-to-launch-social-business-in-haiti/article21555235/ "Haiti Non-Profit Plumbs Solutions to World's Unmet Sanitation Needs"], "The Globe and the Mail", November 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The compost produced at these facilities is sold to farmers, organizations, businesses, and institutions around the country to help finance SOIL’s waste treatment operations.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, S., Preneta, N., Kilbride, A.

== Society and culture ==

=== Policies ===
There is still a lack of examples of implemented policy where the reuse aspect is fully integrated in policy and advocacy.&lt;ref name="SEI2009"&gt;SEI (2009). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1265 Sanitation policies and regulatory frameworks for reuse of nutrients in wastewater, human excreta and greywater] - Proceedings from SEI/EcoSanRes2 Workshop in Sweden. Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; When considering drivers for policy change in this respect, the following lessons learned should be taken into consideration: Revising legislation does not necessarily lead to functioning reuse systems; it is important to describe the “institutional landscape” and involve all actors; parallel processes should be initiated at all levels of government i.e. national, regional and local level); country specific strategies and approaches are needed; and strategies supporting newly developed policies need to be developed.&lt;ref name="SEI2009" /&gt;

=== Regulatory considerations ===
Regulations relating to excreta reuse may hinder export and import of agricultural products.&lt;ref name="Kvarn"&gt;Elisabeth Kvarnström, Linus Dagerskog, Anna Norström and Mats Johansson (2012) [http://www.siani.se/resources/report/nutrient-reuse-solution-multiplier Nutrient reuse as a solution multiplier] (SIANI policy brief 1.1), A policy brief by the SIANI Agriculture-Sanitation Expert Group, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Urine use in organic farming in Europe ====
The [[European Union]] (EU) only allows the use of source separated urine in conventional farming within the EU, but not yet in organic farming. This is a situation that many agricultural experts, especially in Sweden, would like to see changed.&lt;ref name="EcoEngNewsletter1"&gt;{{cite web
|author = Håkan Jönsson|title = Urine Separation&amp;nbsp;— Swedish Experiences|url = http://www.iees.ch/EcoEng011/EcoEng011_F1.html|work = EcoEng Newsletter 1|date = 1 October 2001}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This ban may also reduce the options to use urine as a fertilizer in other countries if they wish to export their products to the EU.&lt;ref name="Kvarn" /&gt;

A '''rosette sampler''' is a device used for [[water]] [[Sample (material)|sampling]] in deep water (such as the [[Great Lakes]] or [[Ocean|oceans]]) in order to investigate about its [[water quality|quality]].

== Description ==
A rosette sampler is made of an assembly of 12 to 36 sampling bottles.&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8415&amp;tid=7342&amp;cid=11375 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, "Rosette Sampler"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each bottle is a [[volume]] that range from a minimum value of 1.2 [[Litre|L]] to a maximum value of 30 L.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; All of them constitutes the rosette sampler and are clustered around a cylinder situated in the center of the assembly,&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; where there is a sensing system called Sea-Bird or [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]], that stands for "Conductivity, Temperature and Depth", although other variables can be measured by modern CTDs (e.g. water [[turbidity]], dissolved [[oxygen]] [[concentration]], [[chlorophyll]] concentration and [[pH]]).&lt;ref name=cee&gt;[http://www.cee.mtu.edu/great_lakes/images2/spotlight_rosette_CDT.html Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Department at Michigan Tech, "CTD and the Rosette samples on Lake Superior"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparatus is attached to a wire rope. A winch on board of the boat unroll the rope during descent and roll up it during the ascent (i.e. at the end of the samples collection). During operations in the ocean, a rosette sampler can approach the seabed at a distance from 1 to 5 m, depending on the particular sea conditions.&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

The opening of each sampling bottle can be automatic (by reaching a certain depth) or manual (by operator, remotely).&lt;ref name=cee/&gt;

== Applications ==
Water sampling is used in general for [[chemical analysis]] and [[ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] assessment.&lt;ref name=jan&gt;[https://www.cefas.co.uk/premiam/publications/post-incident-monitoring-guidelines-subsea-oil-releases-and-dispersant-use/tg01-water-sampling/ Jan Brant, "Collection of water samples"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rosette sampler is preferred to [[Winchester sampler]] for collection of water sampling at depths greater than 50 [[meter|m]].&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

'''sCAR-Fc''' ('''Soluble Receptor Analogue''') is an experimental prophylactic treatment against [[coxsackievirus]] B3 (CVB) infections. Coxsackievirus B3 can cause cardiac damage, eventually resulting in a weakened and enlarged heart that is termed [[dilated cardiomyopathy]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Werk D, Pinkert S, Heim A, etal |title=Combination of soluble coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor and anti-coxsackievirus siRNAs exerts synergistic antiviral activity against coxsackievirus B3 |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=298–306 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19591879 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While many other treatments inhibit viral proliferation in [[myocyte]]s, sCAR-Fc prevents the virus entering the cell by competitively binding to [[coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor]]s (CAR) on the membrane of myocytes.

==Myocarditis==
Coxsackievirus B3 is a single-stranded RNA [[enterovirus]] and a member of the [[picornavirus|''Picornavirdae'']] family.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Goodfellow IG, Evans DJ, Blom AM, etal |title=Inhibition of coxsackie B virus infection by soluble forms of its receptors: binding affinities, altered particle formation, and competition with cellular receptors |journal=J. Virol. |volume=79 |issue=18 |pages=12016–24 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16140777 |pmc=1212587 |doi=10.1128/JVI.79.18.12016-12024.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the virus penetrates the host's systemic circulation via contaminated water or food, it can travel and infect the heart and cause myocarditis. [[Myocarditis]] is an inflammation of the heart, most commonly cause by viral infections. Amongst the viruses capable of causing myocarditis, CVB3 is a common agent identified in inducing cardiac damage. Internalization of the virus into myocytes occurs by binding to coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptors (CAR) located in [[tight junction]]s on cell membranes.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yanagawa B, Spiller OB, Proctor DG, etal |title=Soluble recombinant coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor abrogates coxsackievirus b3-mediated pancreatitis and myocarditis in mice |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=189 |issue=8 |pages=1431–9 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15073680 |doi=10.1086/382598 |url= http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/189/8/1431.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once inside the cytoplasm, the virus can use the host's ribosomal machinery to proliferate and replicate progenies for further infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woodruff JF |title=Viral myocarditis. A review |journal=Am. J. Pathol. |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=425–84 |date=November 1980 |pmid=6254364 |pmc=1903609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive cardiac [[necrosis]] can occur by day three after infection as incubated viruses lyse myocytes, resulting in severe and rapid cardiac decompensation. With loss of cardiac cells increasing progressively, infected individual will experience abnormalities in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, as well as electrical conduction defects manifesting as [[cardiac dysrhythmias]].&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Onyimba JA, Coronado MJ, Garton AE, etal |title=The innate immune response to coxsackievirus B3 predicts progression to cardiovascular disease and heart failure in male mice |journal=Biol Sex Differ |volume=2 |issue= |pages=2 |year=2011 |pmid=21338512 |pmc=3049118 |doi=10.1186/2042-6410-2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[ejection fraction]] decreases substantially.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; The cytolytic destruction of heart cells can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy if not treated appropriately.

The role of the immune system in response to the presence of a virus  has both beneficial and detrimental effects on the cardiac system.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; The arrival of [[natural killer cells]] (NK cells) at the site of infection limits viral proliferation in myocytes. Conversely, while certain cytokines released from immune cells have  protective effects, others such as [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα) have deleterious effects on heart cells. Moreover, peak concentrations of [[T cells]] in the myocardium during days 7-14 play important roles in both viral clearance and immune mediated cardiac damage. T-cells not only lyse and destroy infected myocytes, but due to molecular mimicry, they also destroy normal, healthy cardiac cells, further driving the heart towards dilated cardiomyopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herzum M, Ruppert V, Küytz B, Jomaa H, Nakamura I, Maisch B |title=Coxsackievirus B3 infection leads to cell death of cardiac myocytes |journal=J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=907–13 |date=July 1994 |pmid=7966359 |doi=10.1006/jmcc.1994.1108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism ==
A synthetic and soluble form of CAR (sCAR) has been created to prevent viral infection with CVB3. Attaching Fc domain of [[immunoglobulin]] [[IgG1]] to sCAR (sCAR-Fc) enhances solubility and extends its [[half-life]].&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fechner H, Pinkert S, Geisler A, Poller W, Kurreck J |title=Pharmacological and biological antiviral therapeutics for cardiac coxsackievirus infections |journal=Molecules |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=8475–503 |year=2011 |pmid=21989310 |doi=10.3390/molecules16108475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, once sCAR-Fc binds the virus, [[macrophages]] and other phagocytic immune cells with Fc receptor recognition bind to the sCAR-Fc-viral complex to eliminate the virus. Essentially, sCAR-Fc mimics CAR receptors on cardiac cells, competitively inhibiting viral attachment and entry into myocytes. Decreased lesions in cardiac tissues, reduced cell necrosis, and diminished inflammatory responses are observed in sCAR-Fc treated cells (CITE). This suggests protective effects against myocardial damage by CVB3.
     
Conformational changes in a viral particle (A-particle) with sCAR-Fc-virus binding causing the loss of the virus’ internal [[capsid]] protein, VP4.&lt;ref name="c" /&gt; This irreversible reaction prevents the virus from interacting with cellular receptors (CAR) on cardiac cells, decreasing infectivity of CVB3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milstone AM, Petrella J, Sanchez MD, Mahmud M, Whitbeck JC, Bergelson JM |title=Interaction with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, but not with decay-accelerating factor (DAF), induces A-particle formation in a DAF-binding coxsackievirus B3 isolate |journal=J. Virol. |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=655–60 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15596863 |pmc=538729 |doi=10.1128/JVI.79.1.655-660.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Administration of sCAR-Fc beyond three days after initial exposure to the virus does not have any beneficial effects as cardiac damage is too severe.&lt;ref name="c" /&gt; As such, the use of sCAR-Fc is currently limited to prophylactic treatments.

'''Sports Medicine Australia''' is Australia’s peak national umbrella body for [[sports medicine]] and [[sports science]]. It was established in 1963 as the '''Australian Sports Medicine Federation'''.&lt;ref name=vamplew&gt;{{cite book|last=Vamplew|first=Wray|title=A Healthy Body: the Australian Sports Medicine Federation 1963-1988|year=1989|publisher=Australian Sports Medicine Federation|location=Canberra|isbn=1-8753-3400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current membership includes sports medicine and health professionals, [[sports trainers]], sporting clubs and community members. Its activities cover elite sport to community grass roots sports. It has branches in each Australian state.

==History==
It was formed in 1963 by the amalgamation of the Australian Sports Medicine Association and the Australian and the Australian Federation of Sports Medicine.&lt;ref name=vamplew/&gt; Australian Sports Medicine Federation was established as a result of [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]] medical services. Australian Sports Medicine Federation was a [[New South Wales]] breakaway group of Australian Sports Medicine Federation.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford companion to Australian sport. 2nd ed.|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0195535685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership was originally restricted to medical doctors but now it has been widened to include a range of practitioners including: orthopedic surgeons, sports physicians, doctors,  physiotherapists, optometrists, dentists, podiatrists, dietitians, psychologists, sports scientists, nurses, teachers, academics, soft tissue therapists and chiropractors.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Some of these membership groups have established their own organisations – [[Australasian College of Sports Physicians]], [[Sports Dietitians Australia]],  Exercise and Sports Science Australia, [[Sports Doctors Australia]], [[Australian Physiotherapy Assoctation]] National Sports Physiotherapy Group but work with SMA particularly in relation to joint conferences.

According to Abilities United, over 16% of Americans are considered to have either a physical, developmental, or learning disability.&lt;ref name="Voters with Disabilities"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voters with Disabilities|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/voters-with-disabilities_n_6102132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barriers that 33.7 million persons with disabilities face within the American electoral process include access to polling information, physical access to polls, current and future laws that deal with the topic, and the moral implications regarding the varying levels of both physical and cognitive disabilities and the act of voting.&lt;ref name=voting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/voting/ |title=Voting and People with Disabilities |publisher=Accessiblesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}

==Denotation and categorization==

The term "[[disability]]" has a wide range of connotations and associations. [[Webster's Dictionary]] defines it as:

{{quote|A condition (such as an illness or injury) that damages or limits a person's physical or mental abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability, Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disability}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines it as:

{{quote|A physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford, Disability|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/disability}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] further explores the characterization of "disability" within its Guidance outlines. The Commission outlines three ways in which an individual can demonstrate their disability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"A person may be disabled if he or she has a physical or mental condition that substantially limits a major life activity (such as walking, talking, seeing, hearing, or learning)."
#"A person may be disabled if he or she has a history of a disability (such as cancer that is in remission)."
#"A person may be disabled if he is believed to have a physical or mental impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor (even if he does not have such an impairment)."

Originally signed into law in 1990 and since amended in 2004, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) set a significant precedent in categorizing disability. IDEA outlined 13 distinct categories of disabilities. Though the categories apply under law to individuals between the ages of 3 and 21, they have served as one of the few examples of the federalization of disability categorizations. They include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/wp-content/uploads/repo_items/gr3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Autism]]
#Deaf-Blindness
#[[Deafness]]
#Emotional Disturbance
#[[Hearing Impairment]]
#[[Intellectual Disability]]
#Multiple Disabilities
#Orthopedic Impairment
#Other Health Impairment
#Specific [[Learning Disability]]
#Speech or Language Impairment
#[[Traumatic Brain Injury]]
#Visual Impairment (Including [[Blindness]])

==Political engagement==
Multiple sources report that persons with disabilities comprise one of the most disenfranchised groups within American society.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-08-09/disabled-voters-lack-access-motivation/56922154/1 |title=Study shows voters with disabilities face access barriers – USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Americans with both physical and cognitive disabilities are amongst the least politically engaged members of the electorate. For example, during the 2012 election cycle, 11% fewer persons with disabilities turned out to vote than their nondisabled counterparts.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt; According to a 2013 report penned by Rutgers University professor Lisa Schur, as many as three million more citizens with disabilities would have turned out to vote had they voted at the same rate as non-disabled citizens.&lt;ref name="Voters with Disabilities"/&gt;

==Accessibility to polls==

Voter identification laws greatly impact accessibility to polls for persons with disabilities. As the largest population of citizens without drivers licenses, persons with both physical and cognitive disabilities face the obstacle of strict identification laws at polling places within some states.&lt;ref name="Voters with Disabilities"/&gt; Within stricter states, many disabled persons who do not have physical identification cards are required to submit absentee ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter ID|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/29/this-is-what-its-like-to-try-to-get-a-voter-id-when-youre-disabled-poor-or-dont-drive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] (NCSL) provides a web page with ID requirements for voting in each state, and those with the strictest requirements often present the largest challenges to disabled Americans.&lt;ref name=ncsl-2013&gt;{{cite web

A leading theory that attempts to explain the lack of political engagement within disabled communities deals primarily with access to polling places. In fact, many polling places are considered to be nearly entirely inaccessible to persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name = voting/&gt; To this end, within the past several years, the Federal Election Commission has reported that more than 20,000 polling places across the nation are not fully accessible for disabled individuals, and in 1999, the New York Attorney General fewer than 10% of upstate polling facilities were fully compliant with state and federal laws.&lt;ref name = voting/&gt;

The failure to comply with state and federal laws can manifest itself in many ways, but it typically results in a lack of functional wheelchair ramps, sparse placement of handicapped entrance signs, and generally inaccessible physical voting booths.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt; As a result, resources and physical aides such as "Help America Vote Act"-mandated voting machines are utilized for federal elections and aim to assist persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Voters with Disabilities"/&gt;

One of the most popularly utilized methods of combatting these problems in recent years has manifested itself in the utilization of electronic voting machines. Because "punch card" and "lever" voting machines are often inaccessible to many parts of the disabled community, [[adaptive technology]] has been applied to many traditional devices, and many different kinds of accessible machines have been developed. Legislation like the [[Help America Vote Act]] has required that at least one accessible machine be available at each polling place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/accessibility-and-auditability-electronic-voting}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a [[manual dexterity]] disability is making choices on a [[touchscreen]] with a head dauber. This is an example of [[adaptive technology]] in use.]]

==Contemporary laws protecting suffrage for people with disabilities==

Both state and federal legislatures have enacted thousands of pages of legislation regarding the rights of Americans with disabilities. Several major "landmark" pieces of legislation have served as models.

=== Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act ===

#Passed into law in 1984, the [[Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act]] requires polling places to ensure accessibility for all disabled persons during federal elections.&lt;ref name="ada.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislation for Persons with Disabilities|url=http://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor64292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox U.S. legislation
| shorttitle= Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

| longtitle= An act to establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability
| colloquialacronym= ADA
| enacted by= 101st
| effective date= July 26, 1990}}

=== Americans with Disabilities Act ===
Passed into law in 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (or "ADA") is widely considered to be the first major attempt to define the rights of disabled Americans at a federal level. Signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]], the act prohibits discrimination based on disability. Though the ADA is wide-ranging in scope, it has had many lasting effects on the suffrage of disabled Americans. Some of the most prominent changes that resulted from the legislation included calls for accessibility within polling stations. This effort to increase accessibility has led to the establishment of mandatory accessible parking, passenger drop off areas, and building entrances at polling places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans with Disabilities Act|url=http://www.ada.gov/votingchecklist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Help America Vote Act ===
Passed into law in 2002, the [[Help America Vote Act]] ("HAVA") creates "mandatory minimum standards for states to follow in several key areas of election administration."&lt;ref name="Help America Vote Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Help America Vote Act|url=http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing both federal legislatures with bipartisan support, the Act authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make polling places accessible to persons with disabilities. The legislation has a particularly sharp focus on individuals affected by visual impairments, and requires each polling station to have to at least one disability-accessible voting machine per federal election.&lt;ref name="Help America Vote Act" /&gt; The Act has three main goals:&lt;ref name="Help America Vote Act" /&gt;

#Replace punch-card and lever based voting systems
#Establish the Election Assistance Commission in order to assist with the administration of federal elections
#Establish minimum federal election standards

Critics of the Act claim that its reach should be expanded to more than solely federal elections. While states receive funding for disability-accessible touchscreen electronic voting machines under HAVA, municipalities such as cities and towns do not directly receive funding. As a result, critics claim that the machines are not evenly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rick Malley "HAVA" Case|url=http://homernews.com/homer-news/local-news/2015-10-29/blind-man-files-rights-complaint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Voter Registration Act ===
Passed into law in 1993, the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] attempted to increase the historically low registration rates of minorities and persons with disabilities by requiring both federal and state agencies to assist in voter registration procedures.&lt;ref name="ada.gov" /&gt;

=== Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act ===
Passed into law in 1980, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act protects the rights of persons in jails, publicly operated nursing homes, and institutions for people with psychiatric or developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="ada.gov" /&gt;

=== Voting Rights Act ===
Originally passed into law in 1965 to combat racial discrimination at polling places, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] has recently supported advances of disabled suffrage. Section 208 of the Act allows citizens affected by "blindness, disability, or the inability to read or write" to assign an individual to help cast votes within a ballot box.&lt;ref name="Voting Rights Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting Rights Act|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/statutes-enforced-voting-section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on the assignment of said individual include the voter's employer or agent of their union.&lt;ref name="Voting Rights Act" /&gt;

==Contemporary laws restricting suffrage for people with disabilities==
In some states, people who are deemed [[mentally incompetent]] are not allowed to vote.&lt;ref name="dis1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Kimberly|title=Keeping the 'Mentally Incompetent' From Voting|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/keeping-the-mentally-incompetent-from-voting/263748/|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pan |first1=Deanna |title=Protecting the Voting Rights Of People With Mental Disabilities |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/voting-rights-mental-disabilities/ |accessdate=16 July 2018 |publisher=Mother Jones |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[conservatorship]] process, people can lose their right to vote.&lt;ref name="dis2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands Lose Right To Vote Under 'Incompetence' Laws|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thousands-lose-right-to-vote-under-incompetence-laws_us_5ab25f7ce4b004fe24699810|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre''' (SHSC), known simply as '''Sunnybrook''' or '''Sunnybrook Hospital''', is an [[academic health sciences centre]] located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=history History &amp; Photo Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the largest [[Trauma center|trauma centre]] in Canada and is one of two major trauma centres in Toronto; the other is [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]]. Sunnybrook is a teaching hospital, fully affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]]. 

The hospital is home to Canada’s largest Veterans Centre, located in the in Kilgour wing (K-Wing), and in the George Hees wing (L-Wing) of the hospital. There they care for [[World War II]] and [[Korean War]] veterans. 

In 2015, Sunnybrook scientists were the first in the world to successfully, non-invasively open the blood-brain barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=breaching-blood-brain-barrier|title=Breaching the blood-brain barrier: why it matters|last=|first=|date=|website=Sunnybrook|access-date=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Andy Smith was appointed President &amp; CEO of Sunnybrook in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://sunnybrook.ca/media/item.asp?c=1&amp;i=1556&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sunnybrook Hospital had its origins as the Toronto Military Orthopaedic Hospital at 350 Christie Street, which was also known as the Christie Street Military Hospital and, after 1936, the Christie Street Veterans' Hospital. The [[Collegiate Gothic]] building had originally been the site of the National Cash Register Company Factory in 1913 (by architects Page and Warrington)&lt;ref&gt;http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2012/07/then-and-now-christie-north-tracks&lt;/ref&gt; but was converted for use as a military hospital in 1919 to house soldiers injured during [[World War I]] as well as some veterans disabled in the [[Boer War]] of 1899 to 1902 and the [[Fenian Raids]] of 1866. The influx of disabled soldiers returning from [[World War II]] led to overcrowding and the need for a new hospital.&lt;ref name="christie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Site_of_the_Christie_Street.html|title=Site of the Christie Street Veterans' Hospital Historical Plaque|website=torontoplaques.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original site was demolished in 1981 and replaced by '''Christie Gardens Apartments and Care Facility''' at 600 Melita Crescent.&lt;ref&gt;http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Site_of_the_Christie_Street.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph and Alice Kilgour, a wealthy Toronto couple, purchased 154 acres in the town of [[Leaside|Leaside, Ontario]] and created Sunnybrook farm, where they raised horses and hosted fox hunts. In 1928, after Joseph's death, Alice M. Kilgour donated the Sunnybrook Farm to the City of Toronto in his memory, for use as a public park.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/once-upon-a-city-archives/2016/08/26/once-upon-a-city-from-foxhunts-to-foxholes.html "Once Upon a City: From foxhunts to foxholes"]. ''Toronto Star'', August 28, 2016.  Janice Bradbeer.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the consent of the Kilgour heirs, part of the parkland was transferred to the [[Government of Canada]] to build a hospital for veterans to replace the Christie Street Hospital.  The new building was designed by [[Allward and Gouinlock]] ([[Hugh Allward]] was son of sculptor [[Walter Seymour Allward]] and [[George H. Gouinlock]] is the son of architect [[George Wallace Gouinlock]]). 

The first patient was admitted to '''Sunnybrook Military Hospital''' in September 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=historical-archive|title=Historical Archives - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital officially opened its doors in June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=historical-archive|title=Historical Archives - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christie Street hospital was converted into a senior citizens home named Lambert Lodge.&lt;ref name="christie" /&gt; 

In 1973, Sunnybrook Military Hospital became Sunnybrook Medical Centre, and in 1976 established Canada’s first regional trauma unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=history|title=About Us - History - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1991, The Province of Ontario opened major research facilities to house the rapid growth of research on campus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=history|title=About Us - History - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The hospital merged with [[Women's College Hospital]] and the Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital in June 1998 under the provisions of Bill 51, but Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre was de-amalgamated in April 2006 to create Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the separate Women's College Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=history|title=About Us - History - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2012, Sunnybrook and [[St. John's Rehab Hospital]], which had complementary programs and services, voluntarily merged, providing a continuum of care from acute injury or illness, through to rehabilitation and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=history|title=About Us - History - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Sunnybrook maintains three campuses, with its main campus (Bayview) on Bayview Avenue in [[North York]], the satellite '''Holland Centre''' ([[Orthopedics|orthopaedic]] and [[Arthritis|arthritic]] care) on Wellesley St. E., and [[St. John's Rehab Hospital|St. John's Rehab]] on Cummer Avenue. SHSC became affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]] in 1966.

Rehabilitation research is also conducted through the St. John's Rehab research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/research/content/?page=sri-prog-stjohnsrehab|title=St. John's Rehab Research Program - Sunnybrook Research Institute|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated Community Program===
The Integrated Community Program was established to ensure that the transition from hospital to the next step is one where everyone involved is both informed and engaged. This program also includes Sunnybrook's emergency care

==Heliport==
A helicopter pad {{Airport codes||||CNY8}} is located at the east end of the hospital grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{CFS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunnybrook handles [[Air medical services|air ambulance]] flights with urgent trauma cases from the [[Greater Toronto Area]] where an ambulance run is not possible. Only two other hospitals in Toronto have helipads ([[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] and the [[The Hospital for Sick Children|Hospital for Sick Children]]).

Sunnybrook is planning to build a new helipad on the roof of the building’s M-Wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=helipad|title=Our Future Helipad: Life-Saving Infrasctructure - Sunnybrook Hospital|website=sunnybrook.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Private, for-profit cancer clinic==
Sunnybrook Hospital was the site of Ontario's first private cancer clinic created since the inception of [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. The clinic operated after regular working hours at the hospital, and was owned by Tim McGowan. An investigation by the Auditor General of Ontario revealed that the cost per procedure was $500 greater than in the public sector and that the waiting times did not decrease in the public system as a result of the clinic's creation.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Provincial Auditor General, Special Audit of Cancer Care Ontario. December 13, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicare.ca/main/the-facts/index-on-private-for-profit-health-care Index on Private, For-Profit Health Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121172454/http://medicare.ca/main/the-facts/index-on-private-for-profit-health-care |date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic operated from 2001 until 2003.

== Holland Centre ==
The Holland Centre consists of the Orthopaedic Program located in [[downtown Toronto]]; the Holland Centre Campus is located on 43 Wellesley St. East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=43%20Wellesley%20Street%20East,%20Toronto,%20Ontario,%20M4Y%201H1,%20Canada 43 Wellesley St. East.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holland Orthopaedic and Arthritic Centre was initially founded as the Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital by James E. Bateman and Charles S. Wright II in 1955 based on a charter procured by C. Stewart Wright, an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]]. It merged with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://health.sunnybrook.ca/magazine/spring-2016/holland-centre-history/|title=Celebrating the Holland Orthopaedic &amp; Arthritic Centre's 60th anniversary|date=2016-05-24|work=Your Health Matters|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holland Centre was named as a centre of excellence in [[joint replacement]].

Sunstar's founder, {{ill|Kunio Kaneda|ja|金田邦夫}}, established the Kaneda Keitai Shokai Company in [[Osaka, Japan]] in 1932 as a seller of rubber glue for bicycles. The introduction of metal tubes for packaging of the rubber glue - and later also toothpastes formed the basis for the early success of the business.  The company since has developed into the leading oral care business in Japan with a significant international presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazzoleni|first1=M|title=Effective Management: Practice and Theory of a Successful   Company. The Case of Sunstar|journal=International Journal of Business and Information|date=2006|volume=3|issue=1729-9322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering business also has a leading position for several of its products in Japan and other markets. Group sales exceeded one billion [[United States dollar]]s for the first time in the 1990s and are now at the level of 1.4 billion US dollars per year.

After having been listed on the [[Osaka Securities Exchange]] since 1961, Sunstar undertook a management and employee [[buyout]] of all shares in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazzoleni|first1=M|title=Management realizzato: prassi e teorie di un'azienda di successo. Il caso Sunstar|isbn=9788846470300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership of Sunstar Japan and the other group companies of the Consumer Goods Business was transferred to [[Switzerland]] and the Engineering business to [[Singapore]], in an effort to accelerate [[globalization]].

== History ==
Kunio Kaneda founded Kaneda Keitei Shokai (Kaneda Brother's Company) in 1932 and began the manufacture and sale of rubber glue for bicycles.  Applying the manufacturing technology used in pouring rubber glue into metal-tube containers, the company expanded by packaging [[toothpaste]] into metal tube containers in 1946, when mainstream [[dentifrices]] were still in powder form.  This was the company's first toothpaste, which later formed its core business.  This business grew and led to Sunstar's Oral Care and Health &amp; Beauty businesses, which today emphasize the promotion of oral and whole body health. The company's name, "Sunstar", was derived from the idea of tooth brushing in the morning at sunrise and again at night under starlight.

Meanwhile, the businesses of rubber glue and parts for bicycles developed into a synthetic, chemical adhesive and sealant business for automobile production and construction applications, as well as for motorcycle disc parts such as [[sprockets]] and [[brakes]], namely its vehicle equipment division.

Sunstar continues to promote its further development of businesses in these four fields, after experiencing the following historical milestones:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">[[File:Toric lens surface 2.png|thumb|right|Toric lens surface as  "cap" (top-right) from a torus (here with ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.2&amp;nbsp;''r'').]]
A '''toric lens''' is a [[lens (optics)|lens]] with different [[optical power]] and [[focal length]] in two orientations perpendicular to each other. One of the lens surfaces is shaped like a "cap" from a [[torus]] (see figure at right), and the other one is usually [[Sphere|spherical]]. Such a lens behaves like a combination of a [[spherical lens]] and a [[cylindrical lens]]. Toric lenses are used primarily in [[Glasses|eyeglass]]es, [[contact lens]]es and [[intraocular lens]]es to correct [[astigmatism]].

== Torus ==
{{main|Torus}}
[[File:Superficie tórica.svg|thumb|right|upright|A torus results when a circle with [[radius]] ''r'' rotates around an axis lying in the same plane as the circle (here the ''z'' axis) at a distance ''R'' from the centre of the circle.]]

A torus is the spatial body resulting when a circle with radius ''r'' rotates around an axis lying within the same plane as the circle, at a distance ''R'' from the circle's centre (see figure at right). If ''R''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r'', a ''ring torus'' is produced. If ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r'', a ''horn torus'' is produced, where the opening is contracted into a single point. ''R''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r'' results in a ''spindle torus'', where only two "dips" remain from the opening; these dips become less deep as ''R'' approaches 0. When ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the torus degenerates into a [[sphere]] with radius ''r''.
[[File:Les trois types de tores.PNG|thumb|left|When the major radius ''R'' approaches 0 (here from right to left), the torus becomes a sphere.]]
{{-|left}}

== Radius of curvature and optical power ==
The greatest radius of curvature of the toric lens surface, {{nowrap|''R'' + ''r''}}, corresponds to the smallest [[Optical power|refractive power]], ''S'', given by
:&lt;math&gt; S = \frac{n-1}{R+r} &lt;/math&gt;, 

where ''n'' is the [[index of refraction]] of the lens material. 

The smallest radius of curvature, ''r'', corresponds to the greatest refractive power, ''s'', given by

:&lt;math&gt; s = \frac{n-1}{r} &lt;/math&gt;.

Since {{nowrap|1=''R'' + ''r'' &gt; ''r''}}, {{nowrap|''S'' &lt; ''s''}}. The lens behaves approximately like a combination of a spherical lens with optical power ''s'' and a [[cylindrical lens]] with power {{nowrap|''s'' − ''S''}}. In [[ophthalmology]] and [[optometry]], {{nowrap|''s'' − ''S''}} is called the ''cylinder power'' of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;This is used for correcting astigmatism. In this context, the term ''cylinder'' is based on a mathematical approximation, which is only valid for small corrective powers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that both the greatest and the smallest curvature have a ''circular'' shape. Consequently, in contrast with a popular assumption, the toric lens is ''not'' an [[Spheroid|ellipsoid of revolution]].

=== Light ray and its refractive power ===
[[Ray (optics)|Light ray]]s within the (''x'',''y'')-plane of the torus (as defined in the figure above) are [[Refraction|refracted]] according to the greatest radius of curvature, {{nowrap|''R'' + ''r''}}, which means that it has the smallest refractive power, ''S''.

Light rays within a plane through the axis of revolution (the ''z'' axis) of the torus are refracted according to the smallest radius of curvature, ''r'', which means that it has the greatest refractive power, ''s''.

As a consequence, there are two different refractive powers at orientations perpendicular to each other. At intermediate orientations, the refractive power changes gradually from the greatest to the smallest value, or reverse. This will compensate for the astigmatic aberration of the eye.

== Atoric lens ==
With modern computer-controlled design, grinding and polishing techniques, good vision corrections can be achieved for even wider angles of view by allowing certain deviations from the toric shape. This is called an ''atoric lens'' (literally, non-toric lens).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laramyk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Principles_of_Atoric_Lens_Design.pdf Meister, D.: ''Principles of Atoric Lens Design''], in: ''Lens Talk'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jan. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oculist.net/downaton502/prof/ebook/duanes/pages/v1/v1c051b.html Volk, D.: ''Aspheric Lenses''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312224618/http://www.oculist.net/downaton502/prof/ebook/duanes/pages/v1/v1c051b.html |date=2012-03-12 }}, in ''Duane's Ophthalmology'', chapter 50 (Lippinkott, Wilkins &amp; Williams / Wolters-Kluwer Health, Chicago, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; They are related to toric lenses in the same way that [[aspheric lens]]es are related to spherical lenses.

==Personal life==
Reno is the widow of [[Robert Kennedy (publisher)|Robert Kennedy]] who founded Robert Kennedy Publishing in 1974 with the launch of ''[[MuscleMag International]]'' and was also an accomplished artist and art teacher. Reno and Kennedy met on a school playground where Reno taught Kennedy's daughter. Reno, a mother of three, was getting divorced; and the two started a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=  Isabel |last=Teotonio     |url=https://www.thestar.com/living/health/article/1166712--robert-kennedy-was-a-trailblazer-in-the-fitness-industry |title=Robert Kennedy was a trailblazer in the fitness industry |newspaper=Toronto Star  |date=April 24, 2012   |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy died of cancer on April 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rkpubs.com |title=Robert Kennedy Publishing - Health, Fitness, Nutrition and Lifestyle Books and Magazines |publisher=Rkpubs.com |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kennedy's death Reno assumed the position of publisher and chief executive officer at Robert Kennedy Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastheadonline.com/news/2012/20120416759.shtml |title=Robert Kennedy's publishing legacy handed to wife Tosca Reno |publisher=Masthead Online  |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Umami''''' ({{IPAc-en|u|ˈ|m|ɑː|m|i}}, from {{lang-ja|うま味}}) or '''savory''' taste is one of the five [[Taste#Basic tastes|basic tastes]] (together with [[sweetness]], [[Taste#Sourness|sourness]], [[Taste#Bitterness|bitterness]], and [[Taste#Saltiness|saltiness]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Umami – The Delicious 5th Taste You Need to Master!|url=http://www.molecularrecipes.com/molecular-gastronomy/umami/|work=Molecular Recipes|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torii"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torii K, Uneyama H, Nakamura E | title = Physiological roles of dietary glutamate signaling via gut-brain axis due to efficient digestion and absorption | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 442–51 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23463402 | pmc = 3698427 | doi = 10.1007/s00535-013-0778-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as savory and is characteristic of broths and cooked meats.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/09/umami-fifth-taste|title=Umami: why the fifth taste is so important|author=Fleming, Amy|publisher=The Guardian, London, UK|date=9 April 2013|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7195114/Umami-in-a-tube-fifth-taste-goes-on-sale-in-supermarkets.html |date=9 February 2010 |title=Umami in a tube: 'fifth taste' goes on sale in supermarkets |work=The Daily Telegraph |author=Blake, Heidi |access-date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People taste umami through [[taste receptor]]s that typically respond to [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], which is widely present in meat broths and fermented products and commonly added to some foods in the form of [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).&lt;ref name="nature2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/press_release/nn0200.html |title=Umami taste receptor identified |work=Nature |date=February 2007|access-date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since umami has its own receptors rather than arising out of a combination of the traditionally recognized taste receptors, scientists now consider umami to be a distinct taste.&lt;ref name=torii/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15819485|title= Sweet, Sour, Salty, Bitter ... and Umami|publisher=National Public Radio (NPR), USA|date=5 November 2007|author=Krulwich, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A [[loanword]] from the Japanese {{nihongo||うま味}}, ''umami'' can be translated as "pleasant savory taste".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[wikt:neologism|neologism]] was coined in 1908 by Japanese chemist [[Kikunae Ikeda]] from a [[nominalization]] of ''umai'' ({{nihongo2|うまい}}) "delicious". The compound {{nihongo2|旨味}} (with ''mi'' ({{nihongo2|味}}) "taste") is used for a more general sense of a food as delicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsrae.or.jp/annai/yougo/188.html|title=うま味 (umami)|publisher=Japan Society of Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umamibook.net/what-is-umami|title=What is umami?|publisher=Columbia University Press|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/umami |title=Umami entry in Cambridge Dictionary|publisher=Cambridge University Press |access-date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Scientists have debated whether umami was a basic [[taste]] since Kikunae Ikeda first proposed its existence in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindemann B, Ogiwara Y, Ninomiya Y | title = The discovery of umami | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 843–4 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12438211 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/27.9.843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kean|first1=Sam | name-list-format = vanc |title=The science of satisfaction|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=5|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-science-of-satisfaction|access-date=22 March  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the term ''umami'' was recognized as the scientific term to describe the taste of [[glutamate]]s and [[nucleotide]]s at the first Umami International Symposium in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="umami"&gt;{{cite book |title=Umami: A basic taste  |editor1=Y. Kawamura |editor2=M.R. Kare |publisher=Marcel Dekker  |location=New York| year=1987}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umami represents the taste of the [[amino acid]] [[glutamic acid|L-glutamate]] and 5’-[[ribonucleotides]] such as [[guanosine monophosphate]] (GMP) and [[inosine monophosphate]] (IMP).&lt;ref name="J Nutr 98"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamaguchi S, Ninomiya K | title = Umami and food palatability | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 130 | issue = 4S Suppl | pages = 921S-6S | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10736353 | doi = 10.1093/jn/130.4.921S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be described as a pleasant "[[broth]]y" or "[[meat]]y" taste with a long-lasting, mouthwatering and coating sensation over the tongue.

The sensation of umami is due to the detection of the [[Carboxylate|carboxylate anion]] of [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] in specialized receptor cells present on the human and other animal [[tongue]]s.&lt;ref name="Symposium"&gt;{{cite book | title = International Symposium on Olfaction and Taste, Volume 1170 | editor = Thomas E. Finger | publisher = The Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | location = Hoboken, NJ | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 52 [[peptide]]s may be responsible for detecting umami taste.&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Venkitasamy C, Pan Z, Liu W, Zhao L | title = Novel Umami Ingredients: Umami Peptides and Their Taste | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–23 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27926796 | doi = 10.1111/1750-3841.13576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its effect is to balance taste and round out the overall flavor of a dish. Umami enhances the palatability of a wide variety of foods.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beauchamp GK | title = Sensory and receptor responses to umami: an overview of pioneering work | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 723S-727S | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19571221 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glutamate in acid form (glutamic acid) imparts little umami taste, whereas the [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] of [[glutamic acid]], known as [[glutamate]]s, give the characteristic umami taste due to their ionized state. GMP and IMP amplify the taste intensity of glutamate.&lt;ref name="pmid18827337"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yasuo T, Kusuhara Y, Yasumatsu K, Ninomiya Y | title = Multiple receptor systems for glutamate detection in the taste organ | journal = Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 31 | issue = 10 | pages = 1833–7 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18827337 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.31.1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adding salt to the free acids also enhances the umami taste.&lt;ref name="Lioe"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lioe HN, Selamat J, Yasuda M | title = Soy sauce and its umami taste: a link from the past to current situation | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = R71-6 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20492309 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01529.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monosodium [[L-aspartate]] has an umami taste about four times less intense than MSG whereas [[ibotenic acid]] and [[tricholomic acid]] (likely as their salts or with salt) are claimed to be many times more intense.&lt;ref name="Lioe"/&gt;

[[Glutamic acid|Glutamate]] has a long history in cooking.&lt;ref name=Lehrer07&gt;{{cite book |last = Lehrer |first = Jonah |authorlink = Jonah Lehrer |title = [[Proust was a Neuroscientist]] |publisher = [[Mariner Books]] |year =2007|doi = |isbn = 978-0-547-08590-6 |ref=Lehrer07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermented fish sauces ([[garum]]), which are rich in glutamate, were used widely in ancient Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smriga M, Mizukoshi T, Iwata D, Sachise E, Miyano H, Kimura T, Curtis R |title=Amino acids and minerals in ancient remnants of fish sauce (garum) sampled in the "Garum Shop" of Pompeii, Italy |journal=[[Journal of Food Composition and Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=442–446 |date=August 2010 |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; fermented barley sauces ([[murri (condiment)|murri]]) rich in glutamate were used in medieval [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]] and [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] cuisine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/01/food/fo-34730|title=Rot of Ages|last=Perry|first=Charles| name-list-format = vanc |date=1 April 1998 |work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fermented [[fish sauce]]s and [[soy sauce]]s have histories going back to the 3rd century in China. In the late-1800s, chef [[Auguste Escoffier]], who opened restaurants in Paris and London, created meals that combined umami with salty, sour, sweet and bitter tastes.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; He did not know the chemical source of this unique quality, however.

Umami was first scientifically identified in 1908 by [[Kikunae Ikeda]],&lt;ref name=ikeda02&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ikeda K | title = New seasonings | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 847–9 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12438213 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/27.9.847 }} (partial translation of {{cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | name-list-format = vanc | title=New Seasonings[japan.] | journal=Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo | year= 1909 | volume=30 | pages= 820–836}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura E | title = One hundred years since the discovery of the "umami" taste from seaweed broth by Kikunae Ikeda, who transcended his time | journal = Chemistry, an Asian Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 1659–63 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21472994 | doi = 10.1002/asia.201000899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of the [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. He found that [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] was responsible for the palatability of the broth from ''[[kombu]]'' seaweed. He noticed that the taste of ''kombu'' ''[[dashi]]'' was distinct from sweet, sour, bitter, and salty and named it ''umami''.&lt;ref name=Kean/&gt;

Professor Shintaro Kodama, a disciple of Ikeda, discovered in 1913 that [[Katsuobushi|dried bonito flakes]] contained another umami substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kodama S |journal=Journal of the [[Chemical Society of Japan]]|title=On a procedure for separating inosinic acid|volume=34|page=751|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the ribonucleotide IMP. In 1957, Akira Kuninaka realized that the ribonucleotide GMP present in [[shiitake]] mushrooms also conferred the umami taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuninaka A |journal=Journal of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan|title=Studies on taste of ribonucleic acid derivatives|volume=34|pages=487–492|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kuninaka's most important discoveries was the [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect between ribonucleotides and glutamate. When foods rich in glutamate are combined with ingredients that have ribonucleotides, the resulting taste intensity is higher than would be expected from merely adding the intensity of the individual ingredients.

This synergy of umami may explain various classical [[foodpairing]]s: Japanese make ''dashi'' with ''kombu'' seaweed and dried bonito flakes; the Chinese add [[Chinese leek]] and [[Chinese cabbage]] to chicken soup, as do Scots in the similar Scottish dish of [[cock-a-leekie soup]]; and Italians combine [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]] on tomato sauce with mushrooms.

==Properties==
Umami has a mild but lasting aftertaste associated with salivation and a sensation of furriness on the tongue, stimulating the throat, the roof and the back of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi Food Rev 98"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Yamaguchi S |title=Basic properties of umami and its effects on food flavor |journal=Food Reviews International |volume=14 |issue=2&amp;3 |pages=139–176 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1080/87559129809541156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J Med Invest"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uneyama H, Kawai M, Sekine-Hayakawa Y, Torii K | title = Contribution of umami taste substances in human salivation during meal | journal = The Journal of Medical Investigation | volume = 56 Suppl | issue = supplement | pages = 197–204 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 20224181 | doi = 10.2152/jmi.56.197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By itself, umami is not palatable, but it makes a great variety of foods pleasant, especially in the presence of a matching aroma.&lt;ref name="Edmund Rolls"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rolls ET | title = Functional neuroimaging of umami taste: what makes umami pleasant? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 804S-813S | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19571217 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other basic tastes, umami is pleasant only within a relatively narrow concentration range.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi Food Rev 98" /&gt;

The optimum umami taste depends also on the amount of salt, and at the same time, low-salt foods can maintain a satisfactory taste with the appropriate amount of umami.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi 84"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Yamaguchi S, Takahashi|title=Interactions of monosodium glutamate and sodium chloride on saltiness and palatability of a clear soup|journal=[[Journal of Food Science]] |volume=49 |pages=82–85 |year=1984 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1984.tb13675.x |last2= Takahashi |first2= Chikahito }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that ratings of pleasantness, taste intensity, and ideal saltiness of low-salt soups were greater when the soup contained umami, whereas low-salt soups without umami were less pleasant.&lt;ref name="Roininen 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roininen K, Lähteenmäki L, Tuorila H | title = Effect of umami taste on pleasantness of low-salt soups during repeated testing | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 953–8 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8873274 | doi = 10.1016/0031-9384(96)00098-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study demonstrated that using [[fish sauce]] as a source of umami could reduce the need for salt by 10&amp;ndash;25% to flavor such foods as [[chicken broth]], [[tomato sauce]] or coconut [[curry]] while maintaining overall taste intensity.&lt;ref name="huynh"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huynh HL, Danhi R, Yan SW | title = Using Fish Sauce as a Substitute for Sodium Chloride in Culinary Sauces and Effects on Sensory Properties | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = S150-5 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26613570 | doi = 10.1111/1750-3841.13171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160202143938.htm|title=A new alternative to sodium: Fish sauce|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=2 February 2016|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some population groups, such as the elderly, may benefit from umami taste because their taste and smell sensitivity is impaired by age and medication. The loss of taste and smell can contribute to poor nutrition, increasing their risk of disease.&lt;ref name=AmJClinNutr09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto S, Tomoe M, Toyama K, Kawai M, Uneyama H | title = Can dietary supplementation of monosodium glutamate improve the health of the elderly? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 844S-849S | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19571225 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence exists to show umami not only stimulates appetite, but also may contribute to [[satiety]].&lt;ref name="masic"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masic U, Yeomans MR | title = Umami flavor enhances appetite but also increases satiety | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 532–8 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24944058 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.113.080929 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/100/2/532.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foods rich in umami components==
Many foods that may be consumed daily are naturally rich in umami components.&lt;ref name=fleming/&gt; Glutamate in the form of [[inosinate]] comes primarily from meats whereas [[guanylate]] comes primarily from vegetables. Mushrooms, especially dried [[shiitake]], are sources of umami flavor from guanylate. Smoked, or fermented fish are high in inosinate, and [[shellfish]] in [[adenylate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_U0ZBQAAQBAJ|title=Umami: Unlocking the Secrets of the Fifth Taste|authors=Ole G. Mouritsen, Klavs Styrbaek|date=22 April 2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=023116890X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11, 52, 110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/hidden-secrets-umami|title=Put the science of umami to work for you|author=Paul Adams|publisher=Popular Science, Bonnier Corporation|date=24 November 2015|access-date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, umami taste is common to foods that contain high levels of [[glutamic acid|L-glutamate]], [[inosine monophosphate|IMP]] and [[guanosine monophosphate|GMP]], most notably in [[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[Curing (food preservation)|cured meats]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], [[vegetable]]s (e.g., ripe [[tomato]]es, [[Chinese cabbage]], [[spinach]], [[celery]], etc.) or [[green tea]], and fermented and aged products involving bacterial or yeast cultures, such as [[cheese]]s, shrimp pastes, [[fish sauce]], [[soy sauce]], [[nutritional yeast]], and yeast extracts such as [[Vegemite]] and [[Marmite]].&lt;ref name=fleming/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajeb P, Jinap S | title = Umami taste components and their sources in Asian foods | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 778–91 | year = 2015 | pmid = 24915349 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2012.678422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many humans' first encounter with umami components is [[breast milk]].&lt;ref name=JAmCollNutr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agostoni C, Carratù B, Boniglia C, Riva E, Sanzini E | title = Free amino acid content in standard infant formulas: comparison with human milk | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 434–8 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10963461 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2000.10718943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains roughly the same amount of umami as broths.

There are some distinctions among stocks from different countries. In ''[[dashi]]'', L-glutamate comes from sea ''[[kombu]]'' (''Laminaria japonica'') and inosinate from dried bonito flakes (''[[katsuobushi]]'') or dried sardines (''[[niboshi]]'').

==Taste receptors==
Most [[taste bud]]s on the tongue and other regions of the mouth can detect umami taste, irrespective of their location. The [[tongue map]] in which different tastes are distributed in different regions of the tongue is a common misconception. [[Biochemical]] studies have identified the [[taste receptor]]s responsible for the sense of umami as modified forms of [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4|mGluR4]], [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1|mGluR1]] and [[Taste receptor|taste receptor type 1 (T1R1 + T1R3)]], all of which have been found in all regions of the tongue bearing taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudhari N, Landin AM, Roper SD | title = A metabotropic glutamate receptor variant functions as a taste receptor | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–9 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10649565 | doi = 10.1038/72053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson G, Chandrashekar J, Hoon MA, Feng L, Zhao G, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = An amino-acid taste receptor | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6877 | pages = 199–202 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11894099 | doi = 10.1038/nature726 | bibcode = 2002Natur.416..199N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Gabriel A, Uneyama H, Yoshie S, Torii K | title = Cloning and characterization of a novel mGluR1 variant from vallate papillae that functions as a receptor for L-glutamate stimuli | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 30 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl | pages = i25-6 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15738140 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/bjh095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review corroborated the acceptance of these receptors, stating, "Recent molecular biological studies have now identified strong candidates for umami receptors, including the heterodimer T1R1/T1R3, and truncated type 1 and 4 metabotropic glutamate receptors missing most of the N-terminal extracellular domain (taste-mGluR4 and truncated-mGluR1) and brain-mGluR4."&lt;ref name="Symposium"/&gt;

Receptors mGluR1 and mGluR4 are specific to glutamate whereas T1R1 + T1R3 are responsible for the synergism already described by Akira Kuninaka in 1957. However, the specific role of each type of receptor in taste bud cells remains unclear. They are [[G protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs) with similar signaling molecules that include [[G protein]]s beta-gamma, [[PLCB2]] and [[Inositol triphosphate|PI3]]-mediated release of [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from intracellular stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinnamon SC | title = Taste receptor signalling - from tongues to lungs | journal = Acta Physiologica | volume = 204 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–68 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21481196 | pmc = 3704337 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02308.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium activates the selective cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 5 ([[TRPM5]]) that leads to membrane [[depolarization]] and the consequent release of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[secretion]] of [[neurotransmitter]]s including [[serotonin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pérez CA, Huang L, Rong M, Kozak JA, Preuss AK, Zhang H, Max M, Margolskee RF | title = A transient receptor potential channel expressed in taste receptor cells | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 1169–76 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12368808 | doi = 10.1038/nn952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Cook B, Wu D, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways | journal = Cell | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–301 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12581520 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00071-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dando R, Roper SD | title = Cell-to-cell communication in intact taste buds through ATP signalling from pannexin 1 gap junction hemichannels | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 587 | issue = Pt 24 | pages = 5899–906 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19884319 | pmc = 2808547 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.180083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roper SD | title = Signal transduction and information processing in mammalian taste buds | journal = Pflügers Archiv | volume = 454 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–76 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17468883 | pmc = 3723147 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-007-0247-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veligonda Project''' is an under construction irrigation project located in [[Prakasam district]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irrigation.cgg.gov.in/OngMaj/Veligonda.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh / Ongole News : Project details |publisher= Irrigation dept, Govt. of A.P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed, the project will provide irrigational facilities to 459,000 Acres and drinking water to 1.5 million people in 29 Mandals of fluorine and drought affected areas in [[Prakasam district]], [[Nellore district]] and [[Kadapa district]] by diverting 43.5 TMC of floodwater of [[Krishna River]] from foreshore of Srisailam Reservoir near Kollamvagu and proposed to store in Nallamalasagar Reservoir.
The water for the project is drawn through two 18.8&amp;nbsp;km long tunnels across Nallamala hills. The project has been renamed to Poola Subbaiah irrigation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/08/01/stories/2005080105540400.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh / `Velugonda' to be named after Poola Subbaiah |publisher=The Hindu |date=2005-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/work-on-veligonda-project-resumes/article4546486.ece |title=The Hindu: Work on Veligonda project resumes |publisher=TheHindu.com |date=2013-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction includes two parallel tunnels of 18.8&amp;nbsp;km with 9.2 m and 7 m internal diameter and 21.6&amp;nbsp;km Flood flow canal for the water transmission system linking with Srisailam Reservoir up to Guntur-Kurnool road. The project is being implemented by double shielded tunnel boring machine to make the tunnel without disturbing wildlife in the [[Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therobbinscompany.com/en/case-study/veligonda |title=Double Shield bores Water Transfer Tunnel beneath Indian Tiger Sanctuary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of progress of the project==
As of June 2018, 15.2 &amp;nbsp;km of tunnel digging had been completed for the first tunnel, and 10.8&amp;nbsp;km had been completed for the second tunnel.

==Expected completion==
Only a little progress has been made in the past few years by contractors citing the equipment problems and payment issues with government. Re-tendering of incomplete works is being done by terminating earlier contracts for both tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sakshi.com/news/andhra-pradesh/golmal-veligonda-project-tenders-1079190 | title=Re-tendering of Veligonda balance works| accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of first phase works are not expected before December 2019.

Water supply and sanitation in Colombia has been improved in many ways over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to [[improved sanitation]] increased from 67% to 82%, but access to [[improved water source]]'s increased only slightly from 89% to 94%.&lt;ref name="JMP" /&gt; In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate. For example, only 73% of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality&lt;ref name="rojas"&gt;{{cite conference

== Overview ==

A comprehensive sector policy, introduced in 1994, aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest parts of the country where utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs.  This same policy has been pursued and refined by different consecutive governments.&lt;ref name="en breve"&gt;{{cite journal

Other features of the sector are the existence of some large, well-performing public companies; a strong and stable participation by the local private sector in service provision; and some well-performing community-based organizations in peri-urban areas.

Recently, the government of [[Álvaro Uribe]] has initiated a number of complementary policies to accelerate increases in access to water and sanitation services, such as the strengthening of the roles of [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] in the governance of the sector, a program for marginal urban neighborhoods and an increase in investments for wastewater treatment.&lt;ref name="minambiente"&gt;{{cite web

== Access ==

In 2015, in Colombia 91% of the population had access to "improved" water, 97% and 74%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were still around 4 million lacking access to "improved" water. Regarding sanitation, 81% of the population had access to "improved" sanitation, 85% and 68%, in urban and rural areas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/colombia/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Colombia|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==

In addition to issues of service coverage, Colombia’s water and sanitation sector faces issues of [[Water supply#Service quality|service quality]]. However, service quality has improved considerably over the last fifteen years. The biggest cities tend to offer better service quality than smaller towns and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Drinking water quality.'' According to a survey of the ''Superintendencia de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios'' (SSPD) or Superintendency for Residential Public Services in 2004, 72% of the users had water of potable quality.&lt;ref name="rojas" /&gt; In some cases, the [[water supply]] system’s pressure is not adequate, increasing the risk of bacterial contamination.

''Sewerage.'' Sewage collection systems do not have sufficient hydraulic capacity to handle wastewater flows, especially in poor neighborhoods, which results in [[combined sewer overflow]]s and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s.

''Wastewater treatment''. In 2006, 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent some kind of treatment.&lt;ref name="SSPD report, p. 26" /&gt; The remaining 75% is discharged without any treatment, contaminating a significant part of the natural water resources.

== History ==

The water and sanitation sector in Colombia underwent one cycle of centralization and decentralization within the past several decades. Since the enactment of a comprehensive new sector policy in 1994, various governments have pursued the same set of basic policies, including targeted transfers to municipalities, private sector participation, regulation, cost recovery and a system of cross-subsidies.

=== Centralization (1950s to late 1980s) ===
In the first half of the 20th century, municipalities were responsible for the provision of basic water and sanitation services in Colombia. In 1950, similar to many other countries, a centralized system was adopted and the ''Instituto de Fomento Municipal'' (INSFOPAL) or Municipal Development Institute was created. 
''Empresas Departamentales de Acueducto y Alcantarillado'' (ACUAS) or Departmental Water and Sewerage Companies were created, consisting of the departments, the municipalities and INSFOPAL, which took care of managing and maintaining the infrastructure of the member communities. In that way, investment at the national level was channelled into this important area of public health.

In 1976, within the framework of a change in sector policies, the ACUAS were transformed into Empresas de Obras Sanitarias (EMPOS) or Sanitary Works Companies at the regional or municipal level,&lt;ref name="acuavalle"&gt;{{cite web

However, some municipalities kept the responsibility for service provision at the local level and created municipal companies. The most notable case are the [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]] (EPM), a municipally owned multi-sector utility created in 1955.

At the national level, the water sector institutionally depended on the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="idb"&gt;{{cite web

=== Decentralization (late 1980s to 1993) ===
In the 1980s, the sector was in crisis, characterized by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality in most of the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL at the end of the 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.&lt;ref name="Arboleda" /&gt;

=== New financing system and public-private partnerships (1994-2006) ===
The two liberal governments of [[César Gaviria]] (1990-1994) and [[Ernesto Samper]] (1994-1998) pursued a policy of economic opening and business [[Modernization theory|modernization]]. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest parts of the country where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president [[César Gaviria]]’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues to be pursued to today despite several changes of governments.&lt;ref name="REDI, p.6" /&gt;

In 1995, the first water and sanitation concession in Colombia was given to a mixed public-private company in the city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], followed by a second concession in [[Barranquilla]] in 1996 and more concessions in the next years. In 2002, the government launched a program of business modernization to introduce private sector participation also in small and medium-sized municipalities, leading to significant improvements in quality and efficiency of service provision in some municipalities.&lt;ref name="en breve" /&gt; Drinking water use has decreased by 25% between 1996 and 2001.  Tariff increases and the inclusion of low income users who did not have access to piped water before influenced this trend.&lt;ref name="REDI p. 7"&gt;{{cite web

=== Creation of a Vice-Ministry for Water and Sanitation and Departmental Plans (since 2006) ===
The government of [[Álvaro Uribe]] wants to rapidly increase coverage, overtaking the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s for the sector and to improve service quality, especially in small towns and rural areas, which have the highest requirement of service improvement.

At the end of 2006, a [http://www.minambiente.gov.co/contenido/categoria.aspx?catID=88 Vice-Ministry for Water and Sanitation] was created.&lt;ref name="ley 142" /&gt; It has initiated four new programs:
* [http://www.minambiente.gov.co/contenido/contenido.aspx?catID=539&amp;conID=215 Departmental Water and Sanitation Plans]
* [http://www.minambiente.gov.co/contenido/categoria.aspx?catID=110 ''Programa de Saneamiento para Asentamientos''] (SPA) or Sanitation Program for Settlements within the framework of an Integral Quarter Improvement Program
* [http://www.minambiente.gov.co/contenido/contenido.aspx?catID=111&amp;conID=230 Municipal Waste Water Sanitation Program (SAVER)] to increase the rate of treated municipal water
* [http://www.minambiente.gov.co/contenido/contenido.aspx?catID=112&amp;conID=231 Handwashing Program]
* [http://www.minambiente.gov.co//contenido/contenido.aspx?catID=1326&amp;conID=8280 Water Storage campaign]

The Departmental Water and Sanitation Plans program provides such services as planning and harmonizing resources and has regional systems of service provision at the level of each department of the country. The program was first implemented in four departments which have some of the most difficult conditions: [[Sucre]], [[Department of Córdoba|Córdoba]], [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]] and [[La Guajira]]. The program also aimed to overcome the sector’s fragmentation into many small utilities to benefit from economies of scale.&lt;ref name="minambiente"/&gt; In 2010 30 Departmental Plans were completed and published, covering almost all of the country's 32 departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vice Ministerio de Agua y Saneamiento|title=Plan Departamental para el Manejo Empresarial de los servicios de Agua y Saneamiento - Por departamento|url=http://www.minvivienda.gov.co/contenido/contenido.aspx?catID=967&amp;conID=4278|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 2011, the responsibility for water supply and sanitation, and with it the Vice-Ministry, was transferred to the newly created Ministry of Housing, Cities and Territories. As of August 2012, the Vice-Ministry's website made no more reference to the Departmental Water and Sanitation Plans. The handwashing program, the SPA and SAVER were still in place. In addition, two new programs were started:

* A "water culture" (Cultura del Agua) program that combats apathy and lack of interest concerning water utilities, promotes water reuse and the protection of watersheds, and fights water losses, illegal connections and the non-payment of water bills.
* A "transparent water" program to ensure greater visibility and a wider implication of various stakeholders in water projects, especially during an early stage of implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Viceministerio de Agua y Saneamiento|title=Programas|url=http://www.minvivienda.gov.co/contenido/contenido.aspx?catID=89&amp;conID=3419|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
[[Image:Co-map.png|350px|thumb|A map of Colombia.]]
The current responsibilities and policies in the water and sanitation sector in Colombia are primarily defined in the 1991 constitution and in Law 142 of 1994 (''Ley de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios'' or Public Housing Services Law)&lt;ref name="ley 142" /&gt;

=== Policy and regulation ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:COLPES20000.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
The Vice-Ministry of Water and Sanitation, created in October 2006 within the Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development is in charge of setting sector policy. This sector policy is defined in the framework of national policy established by the ''Departamento Nacional de Planificación'' (DNP) or National Planning Department.

Responsibility for regulating water services is vested in two separate institutions at the national level.  The ''Comisión de Regulación de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Básico'' (CRA) or Potable Water and Basic Sanitation Regulatory Commission defines criteria for efficient service provision and sets the rules for tariff revision, but is not in charge of controlling the application of these rules.  The latter is the responsibility of the ''Superintendencia de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios'' (SSPD) or Superintendency for Residential Public Services, a multi-sector regulatory agency.&lt;ref name="OPS" /&gt;

The Government aims at improving the performance of the water and sanitation sector through: (1) strengthening the regulatory framework; (2) implementing technical assistance programs; (3) providing financial support to promote modernization and efficient management as well as to subsidize the poor; and (4) rationalizing the institutional framework at the national level to improve coordination in the sector. The government also supports private sector participation in the sector.&lt;ref name="rojas" /&gt;

=== Service provision ===
Colombian municipalities are responsible for “ensuring that their inhabitants are given domestic services of water supply and sanitation in an efficient way by public companies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |last=República Colombiana

In rural areas and some marginal urban areas, communal water boards also offer water supply services.&lt;ref name="ley 142" /&gt;

Over the last few years, the number of companies has increased and the direct service provision by municipalities has decreased. To simplify the process of changing suppliers' ownership structure, municipal utilities were transformed into public stock corporations, which allow private sector participation without a further change of the legal status. In 2006, 53% of all suppliers were public companies, the remainder being direct municipal suppliers (15%), private companies (12%), official companies, which are companies that are not specialized in water and sanitation (13%), mixed companies (6%) and authorized organizations (1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The sector is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation which makes it difficult to realize [[economies of scale]], according to a World Bank study. To solve this problem, the creation of regional companies has been suggested.&lt;ref name="REDI, p.6" /&gt;

==== Urban areas ====

Most Colombian cities - including the three largest ones, Bogota, Medellin and Cali - are served by public utilities. However, the private sector also plays an important role, including 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies in 2004 out of 1,500 urban service providers.&lt;ref name="SUI" /&gt;

===== Public utilities =====
[[Image:Edificio EPM(2)-Medellin.JPG|thumb|240px|The headquarters of [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]] in [[Medellín]].]]

Some of Colombia's larger cities are home to well-performing public utilities, some of them providing multiple services, others being specialized in water and sanitation only. The [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]] or Public Companies of [[Medellín]], is a municipally owned multi-sector utility in charge of water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, electricity generation and distribution as well as local telecommunications in Medellín and its surrounding areas.

Another multi-sector utility is the Empresas Municipales de [[Cali]] ([http://www.emcali.com.co/ Emcali]), which provides fixed line local telecoms, Internet, potable water, sewage and electricity services to some 600,000 clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The capital of Colombia, [[Bogotá]], is served by a water and sanitation utility, the ''Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogotá'' ([http://www.acueducto.com.co/wpsv61/wps/portal EAAB]).

===== Private sector participation =====
{{Main|Water privatization in Colombia}}
[[Image:Bocagrande Cartagena.JPG|300px|thumb|Cartagena]]
Private sector participation in Colombia's water and sanitation sector has been much more stable than in some other Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, private water concessions in Buenos Aires, Argentina, many other cities in [[Water supply and sanitation in Argentina|Argentina]], as well as in La Paz and Cochabamba, [[Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia|Bolivia]], were terminated before their term expired&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, there were 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies in Colombia, including large, medium and small companies.&lt;ref name="SUI" /&gt; Private sector involvement in the Colombian water sector began in 1995 in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], with support from the [[World Bank]]. The most important examples are in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Santa Marta]], [[Tunja]], [[Montería]], [[Palmira, Colombia|Palmira]], [[Girardot, Cundinamarca|Girardot]], and [[Riohacha]]. Operators are to a large extent Colombian. Overall performance of utilities with private sector participation has improved, in some cases spectacularly, and some – such as Barranquilla – have had impressive successes in expanding coverage to the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Small towns and peri-urban areas ====
In some smaller towns and peri-urban areas, there are examples of successful provision of water supply and sanitation services by community organizations and regional companies, which in some cases set an example in terms of community empowerment, transparency and accountability.

An example of a regional association is Acuavalle S.A. ESP, which provides drinking water and sanitation to 582,000 inhabitants in 33 municipalities of the [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca department]]. It was founded as a non-profit public limited company in 1959. The shareholders of the company are the Valle del Cauca department, the ‘’Corporación Autónoma regional del valle del Cauce’’ and 33 municipalities, which are served by the utility.&lt;ref name="acuavalle" /&gt;

Another example, is the ''Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca'' (Water Board La Sirena) in the southwestern outskirts of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance and in some cases in construction works. In this way, in the last 3&amp;nbsp;years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Another example is the ''Asociación Acueducto de Río Negro de Popayán'', which was formed 10&amp;nbsp;years ago integrating 10 supply systems, supplying 7,000 residential connections. The association is preparing its own water treatment plant and preparing to install meters with the aid of the Colombian organization ''Asociados en Desarrollo Rural'' (ADR) or Associates in Rural Development and the United States Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==== Rural areas ====
Coverage in rural areas is unusually low, given the level of economic development and sector development. Using a broad definition of access, based on the [[WHO]] definition of an [[improved water source]], access in rural areas in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in [[Water supply and sanitation in Honduras|Honduras]] - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in [[Water supply and sanitation in Ecuador|Ecuador]], also a poorer country than Colombia.

In addition to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the ''Sistema General de Participaciones'' or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution or program at the national level which offers technical assistance to the 12,000 rural community organizations. Law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to the departments, but these have not carried out the task in a satisfactory way so far.

The 2002 ''Inventario Sanitario Rural'' (ISR) or Rural Sanitary Register confirms that situation. Only 21% of the rural community organizations were considered able to carry out maintenance and only 10% to commercially operate the service. Only 32% issued bills and only 10% used metering. In 2005, the government defined guidelines for basic water supply and sanitation policy in rural areas to increase coverage and improve quality in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition a GIS study published in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Jim|title=Water quality laboratories in Colombia: A GIS-based study of urban and rural accessibility|journal=Science of the Total Environment|date=1 July 2014|volume= 485–486|page=Pages 643–652|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented that for many rural areas the time needed to drive to water testing labs than is longer than the sample is viable.

== Innovative approaches ==

Since 1994 Colombia has pioneered many innovative approaches for basic service provision in general and for water supply and sanitation in particular.

Some of them were introduced at the national level, while others were initiated in one city or region. Notable innovations at the national level are the introduction of two autonomous economic regulatory agencies (one, CRA, to develop and fine-tune regulatory tools in the water and sanitation sector, and another one, SSPD, to implement them in across all basic services) in 1994; the introduction of [[:es:Estrato socio-económico|socio-economic strata]] as a basis for spatially differentiated tariffs, also in 1994; and the spatial aggregation of municipal service providers in small towns at the departmental level to benefit from economies of scale since 2006, with strong support from the national government.

A notable innovation initiated by a city or a region is the creation of mixed public-private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in Cartagena, followed by Barranquilla and other Northern and Central cities and towns. Another innovation is an association of community-based organizations (CBOs) providing water supply in rural and peri-urban areas in the departments of [[Valle del Cauca Department|El Valle]], [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]] in Southwestern Colombia. It began in the late 1990s with the assistance of the Universidad del Valle in [[Cali]] in order to protect and recover source watersheds and to strengthen the CBOs' capacity to administrate, operate and maintain their water systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwptoolbox.org/index.php?option=com_case&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=43 Global Water Partnership: Colombia-The association of community organizations and Integrated Water Resources Management], without date&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Colombia boasts one of the oldest and largest multi-utilities in Latin America, [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]] (EPM), created in 1955.

== Efficiency ==
The average level of [[non-revenue water]] (physical and economic losses) in Colombia in 2006 is estimated to be 49%.&lt;ref name="SSPD report, p. 26" /&gt; This level is higher than the Latin American average (approximately 40%) and the regulatory goal of 30%. In the past, the national average of non-revenue water was estimated 40% in 2001, which is almost the same as in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs ===
The Colombian tariff system is defined in the ''Ley de Servicios Públicos'' or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The tariff system aims at reconciling the achievement of cost recovery with the protection of the poor. The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The base tariff of each service provider has to be adjusted by law for different geographic areas within the city, each assumed to correspond to one socio-economic class, according to adjustment factors that are specified by law. This system of area-based tariffs is supposed to provide cross-subsidies from more affluent to poorer users. Every municipality has defined geographic areas that each correspond to one of the six socio-economic classes. Class 1 represents the lowest income group while class 6 stands for the highest. As per 2007, the tariff adjustment factors were the following:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
! Class
! Tariff adjustment factor
|-
| 1
| 30%
|-
| 2

| 3
| 85%
|-
| 4
| 100%
|-
| 5
| 120%
|-
| 6
| 120%
|}

There are many more citizens who live in areas corresponding to classes 1–3 than those who live in the areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6. For example, in Bogotá 73% of the population live in zones of classes 1–3, whereas only 10% live in zones classified as 5 and 6. Consequently, the tariff system permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Between 1990 and 2001, the average tariff for water and sanitation in Colombia increased from US$0.32/m3 to US$0.81/m3, equivalent to an increase of 153%.&lt;ref name="World Bank" /&gt; In 2006, the average monthly bill for residential customers was about US$6.80 for water supply and US$4.60 for sanitation services.&lt;ref name="SSPD p. 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peso 2006" /&gt;

'''Free basic water'''. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two important cities in Colombia make a basic amount of water (''Minimo Vital de Agua Potable'') available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters for a family of four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns.&lt;ref name=Gomez&gt;{{cite web|last=José Antonio Gómez|title=Sobre mínimo vital de consumo de agua.|url=http://www.senadorgomez.cl/2011/10/18/sobre-minimo-vital-de-consumo-de-agua/|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SWITCH training|title=Mínimo Vital de Agua Potable en el Municipio de Medellín|url=http://www.switchtraining.eu/fileadmin/template/projects/switch_training/files/Case_studies/Spanish/SWITCH_EstudioMedellinColombia_esp.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=El Espectador|title=Estratos 1 y 2 en Bogotá tendrán rebaja en servicio de agua|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/articulo-326848-estratos-1-y-2-bogota-tendran-rebaja-servicio-de-agua|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment ===
Between 1995 and 2003, US$3.4 billion (7,965 billion Colombian pesos&lt;ref&gt;1 Colombian Peso = US$0.0004255, (12/31/2004)&lt;/ref&gt;) were invested in the sector, of which 16% were financed by the private sector. Since 1998, private financing increased from almost zero to become a significant share of the total investment. Furthermore, despite a drop in 2001, investment in the sector has increased since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;The figures were calculated on the basis of data obtained from the Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development; the general national budget; budgets allocated through the public hearings (''audiencia pública'') process; and a business modernization program called the [http://www.american.edu/TED/pacifico.htm ''Plan Pacífico'' program], resources of the ''fondo nacional de regalías'', transfers established by Law 715, the [http://www.superservicios.gov.co/ SSPD], private utilities and a survey about the investment climate.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, not clear if this forecast uses all the sources of funding included in the estimate of past investment, so figures may not be comparable.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development announced in May 2008 that US$5.2&amp;nbsp;million (9.2&amp;nbsp;billion Colombian pesos&lt;ref&gt;1 Colombian Peso = US$0.0005700 (2008-05-01)&lt;/ref&gt;) will be spent in order to facilitate the construction of facilities in areas without access to drinking water. The national government will control the destination of the resources and guarantees transparency in the whole spending process. According to the minister, Colombia should already have reached full drinking water coverage, given the past investments in the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=== Financing ===

According to the ministry, the investments were mainly financed through three sources: self-financing, funding by the national government and charges for the extraction of petroleum and carbon.

A World Bank study estimates an investment of US$411m in 2004, which was financed as follows:

* US$108m (26%) by companies through self-financing
* US$249m (61%) by state funding through SGP
* US$49m (12%) by ''Corporaciones Autónomas Regionales'' (CAR) or Regional Autonomous Corporations
* US$5m (1%) by other sources&lt;ref name="REDI, p. 65" /&gt;

According to the report, the average annual transfers from the national government to the municipalities for water supply and sanitation (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. A certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The CAR receive property tax, electric power utilities, environmental charges for extracting water and charges for discharging waste water.

== External cooperation ==

The main external cooperation partners for the Colombian water and sanitation sector are the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF).

=== World Bank ===

The World Bank supports the sector through dedicated water and sanitation projects, as well as through water and sanitation components in other, broader projects.

The '''Xerox murders''' was an incident of [[mass murder]] that occurred on November 2, 1999, in a [[Xerox Corporation]] building in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], [[United States]].  Service technician '''Byran Koji Uyesugi''' shot at eight people; wounding seven fatally (six co-workers and his supervisor). This was the worst mass murder in the history of [[Hawaii]].

==The shooting==
At 8:00 in the morning, Byran Koji Uyesugi, a service technician working at Xerox, opened fire inside the building with a semi-automatic pistol, killing his supervisor and six co-workers, and fired in the direction of another co-worker who fled the building.  The eighth person escaped without injury.

After the shooting, Uyesugi fled in a company van, and by mid-morning, he was found sitting in the van near the Hawaii Nature Center in Makiki, above downtown Honolulu. He held a standoff with police that lasted for five hours, during which he brandished a pistol, read magazines and smoked cigarettes. Adding to the tension of the standoff, the Hawaii Nature Center was hosting thirty-five local school children, who were trapped inside without food or water. Uyesugi surrendered to police at approximately 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Hawaii-Aleutian time zone|HST]].

==Uyesugi==
Born in Honolulu in 1959, Byran Koji Uyesugi grew up in the [[Nuuanu]] neighborhood. While attending [[President Theodore Roosevelt High School|Roosevelt High School]], Uyesugi was a member of the school's Army [[JROTC]] chapter and the school's rifle team. Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble. According to his brother Dennis, Uyesugi crashed their father's car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in 1977; he was never the same.&lt;ref name="StarBulletinJump"&gt;{{cite web|author=Donnelly, Christine|title='77 crash changed Uyesugi says defense attorney|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/11/09/news/story1.html#jump|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=1999-11-09|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyesugi had been employed by Xerox as a technician since 1984. Among his hobbies was raising and breeding [[goldfish]] and ''[[koi]]'', which he would sell to local pet stores. He had an extensive collection of firearms. At the time of the murders he had as many as 25 guns registered in his name, dating to 1982. Police also took eleven handguns, five rifles and two shotguns from Uyesugi's father.&lt;ref name="CrimeLab"&gt;{{cite web |author=Katherine Ramsland|title=Psychiatry, the Law, and Depravity: Profile of Michael Welner, M.D. Chairman, The Forensic Panel|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/welner/5.html|work=TruTV Crime Laboratory|publisher=Turner Broadcasting|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to testimony from Uyesugi's father, Hiroyuki, Uyesugi was normal until he started working for Xerox in 1984. In 1988, Byran started to complain that he had a poking sensation in his head.&lt;ref&gt;Barayuga, Debra; Tswei, Suzanne (May 26, 2000).

After being transferred to another workgroup, Uyesugi began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen. They had difficulty dealing with him. Former co-workers who knew him reported the other members of his team allegedly ostracized him, making him feel isolated and withdrawn.  Uyesugi reportedly made threats against other co-workers' lives. In 1993, he was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation and anger management courses after he kicked in and damaged an elevator door. Uyesugi was arrested for third-degree criminal property damage.&lt;ref name="CrimeLab"/&gt; Co-workers told Dr. [[Michael Welner]], chairman of the Forensic Panel and the [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] who interviewed Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly talking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he to be fired.&lt;ref name="CrimeLab"/&gt;  He complained that his co-workers were engaged in patterns of harassment, back-stabbing behavior, and spreading of rumors.&lt;ref name="CourtroomSummary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Courtroom Summary|url=http://www.forensicpanel.com/Courtroom_Summary.ppt|accessdate=2013-01-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220122/http://www.forensicpanel.com/Courtroom_Summary.ppt|archivedate=2007-09-27|first=Michael|last=Welner|date=2000-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period leading up to the shootings, [[Xerox]] management had become increasingly committed to phasing out the type of photocopier that Uyesugi serviced. He resisted learning the replacement machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi's manager insisted on November 1, 1999 that he would begin training the next day. In his interview with Dr. Michael Welner, who examined Uyesugi when the defendant brought an insanity defense, Uyesugi said he had believed that if he refused to take the training, management would fire him. He told Dr. Welner, "I decided to give them a reason to fire me."&lt;ref name="CourtroomSummary" /&gt;

==Trial and incarceration==
Forty-year-old Byran Uyesugi's month-long trial began on May 15, 2000. He was charged with one count of murder in the first degree (count 1), seven counts of murder in the second degree (counts 2-8), and one count of attempted murder in the second degree (count 9).&lt;ref name="StarBulletinTop"/&gt; Prior to the close of the trial, counts 2-8 were merged into count 1.

The [[Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu]] [[Peter Carlisle]] and Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys Christopher Van Marter and Kevin Takata represented the State of Hawaii. Criminal Defense Attorneys Jerel Fonseca and Rodney Ching of the law firm Fonseca &amp; Ching represented Uyesugi.

Uyesugi pleaded [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. [[Park Dietz]] and Dr. [[Daryl Matthews]] testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]], but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a [[schizophrenic]], he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong.&lt;ref name="StarBulletin2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge's leave to delay trial for one week|url=http://starbulletin.com/2000/06/02/news/story2.html|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|author=Suzanne Tswei|date=2000-06-02|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2000, the [[jury]] rejected the insanity defense, finding Uyesugi guilty on count 1 for the seven murders and count 9 for the attempted murder.  On August 8, 2000, Judge Marie N. Milks sentenced Uyesugi to life without the possibility of parole for count 1 and life with the possibility of parole on count 9, with the sentences to run consecutively. The court also ordered Uyesugi to pay $500 in restitution and $70,000 to the crime victim compensation fund.&lt;ref name="HonoluluAdvertiser2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uyesugi appeal likely to fail|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Jul/01/ln/ln04a.html|work=Honolulu Advertiser|author=Tanya Bricking|date=2001-07-01|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii does not have the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name="HonoluluAdvertiser2001"/&gt; The parole board later ordered Uyesugi to serve a minimum term of 235 years in prison, the longest ever ordered for a Hawaii inmate.&lt;ref name="Parole"&gt;{{cite web| title=Burglar gets life plus 120 years|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/02/20/news/story9.html|work=Honolulu Star Bulletin|author=Debra Barayuga|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Uyesugi appealed his convictions.&lt;ref name="HonoluluAdvertiser2001" /&gt; In 2002, the State of Hawaii Supreme Court upheld Uyesugi's conviction.&lt;ref name="HonoluluAdvertiser2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=2 murder convictions upheld|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Dec/27/ln/ln05a.html

|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Xerox and the hospital that examined Uyesugi settled a civil lawsuit brought by the families of the shooting victims. They believed that both parties had failed to take preventive action based on what they said were clear signs of Uyesugi's mental instability.&lt;ref name="CivilSettlement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Families of Uyesugi victims in confidential settlement of lawsuit|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2005/Jan/28/ln/ln30p.html|work=Honolulu Advertiser|author=Ken Kobayashi|date=2005-01-28|accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 10, 2017, Uyesugi was incarcerated at the [[Saguaro Correctional Center]] in [[Eloy, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii SAVIN|url=https://www.vinelink.com/#/home/site/50000| accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Xerox vacated the premises at 1200 N. Nimitz Highway after the shooting. This facility was vacant until 2004, when the producers of the TV show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' built a [[sound stage]] there to film indoor scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veitch|first=Kristin|title=Lost Secrets Found!|url=http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Kristin/Archive2004/041016.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022003942/http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Kristin/Archive2004/041016.html|archivedate=22 October 2014|publisher=[[E!
