'''1271 Avenue of the Americas''' is a 48-story [[office building]] located in [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]]. It opened in 1959 as the '''Time &amp; Life Building''', designed by architect [[Wallace Harrison]], of [[Harrison &amp; Abramovitz|Harrison, Abramovitz, and Harris]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/timelife.pdf |format=PDF |title=TIME &amp; LIFE BUILDING : Landmarks Preservation Commission |website=Nyc.gov |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
1271 Avenue of the Americas was the first of four in Rockefeller Center designed by Harrison, Abramovitz, &amp; Harris on the west side of Sixth Avenue. Harris served as the building's project manager and was responsible for overall planning. The Time &amp; Life Building was the first expansion of Rockefeller Center west of the [[Avenue of the Americas]].

Construction on the Time-Life Building's steelwork started in April 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Time-Life Building Gets First Steel | work=The New York Times | date=1958-04-04 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/04/04/82682657.pdf | access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the structure topped out in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Time-Life Building Tops Out at 587-Ft. With a Yule Tree | work=The New York Times | date=1958-11-25 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/11/25/82217749.pdf | access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of the building was laid in June 1959, after the building's structure had been completed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CORNERSTONE SET FOR SKYSCRAPER; Copper Box at Time and Life Building on 6th Ave. Gets Data of Century at Fete | work=The New York Times | date=1959-06-24 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/24/80587375.pdf | access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first tenants began moving into the tower in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=TIME'S TENANTS BEGIN MOVING IN; Finishing Touches Are Put on 48-Story Structure, Rising 587 Feet | website=The New York Times | date=1959-12-22 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/22/archives/times-tenants-begin-moving-in-finishing-touches-are-put-on-48story.html | access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air rights]] were purchased from the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] to the west. The Roxy was torn down in 1960 to erect an office tower connected to the Time &amp; Life Building.

The building is clad in green glass and features column-free floors of {{convert|28000|sqft|m2}}. Large murals by [[Josef Albers]] and [[Fritz Glarner]] adorn its lobby, which integrates a serpentine patterned sidewalk design found on the sidewalks of [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Copacabana Beach]] with the adjacent sidewalk,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; a salute to its location on The Avenue of the Americas.

[[Time Inc.]], the publisher of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[House &amp; Home]]'', and ''[[Architectural Forum]]'' magazines initially occupied 21 floors. [[CNN]]'s ''[[American Morning]]'' was based there from 2002 to 2006. The ground floor studio is now occupied by the studio of [[SportsNet New York|SportsNet New York and]] [[CNBC]] ''[[Squawk Box]]''.

In July 2002, the building's ground floor interior was made an interior landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2119.pdf|title=Time &amp; Life Building|website=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, [[Time Inc]] announced that the company was planning to leave the Time &amp; Life Building for the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] complex in lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-22/time-inc-to-move-to-lower-manhattan-s-brookfield-place |title=Time Inc. to Move to Lower Manhattan’s Brookfield Place |website=Bloomberg.com |date=2014-05-22 |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hemisphere Club===
The Hemisphere Club, a members-only restaurant during the day, was located atop the building on the 48th floor; in the evenings it opened to the public as the ''Tower Suite''. The restaurant was operated by Restaurant Associates, which also operated [[The Four Seasons Restaurant]], La Fonda del Sol, [[The Rainbow Room]], The Forum of the Twelve Caesars, and later [[Windows on the World]]. The Hemisphere Club closed some time after 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danovich |first=Tove |url=http://www.eater.com/2012/4/30/6591447/the-hemisphere-club-tower-suite-on-mad-men |title=The Hemisphere Club / Tower Suite on Mad Men |website=Eater.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Fonda del Sol===
La Fonda del Sol was a Latin American–themed restaurant opened in the Time &amp; Life Building's lobby by Joseph Baum in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;"Latin-American Zest on Midtown Menu," New York Times, December 9, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; It featured bright, colorful, whimsical interiors designed by [[Alexander Girard]] and furniture by [[Charles Eames]]. It closed in 1971 and was replaced with a [[Fidelity Investments]] branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eamesdesigns.com/library-entry/everyday-is-like-sunday/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403192452/http://eamesdesigns.com/library-entry/everyday-is-like-sunday/ |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time-Life Chairs===
In addition to furniture for the La Fonda del Sol restaurant, [[Charles Eames]] designed iconic chairs for the offices of Time Incorporated which have become known as Time-Life Chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/executive-seating/eames-executive-chairs.html |title=Eames Executive - Executive Chair |publisher=Herman Miller |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eames designed them as a favor to [[Henry Luce]], who had allowed Eames to use photos from the Time-Life archives for the pavilion he designed at the 1959 [[American National Exhibition]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwr.com/product/eames-executive-chair-vicenza-leather.do |title=Eames Executive Chair - Design Within Reach |website=Dwr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairs remain in production and popular to this day, manufactured by Herman Miller of Zeeland, MI, though the original design with four legs at the base has been revised to include a fifth leg, referred to as a 5 star-base, for stability and to meet updated codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Executive-Chair |title=Eames Executive Chair - Executive Chairs - Chairs - Herman Miller Official Store |website=Store.hermanmiller.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
* Starting in Season 4 of the television series ''[[Mad Men (season 4)|Mad Men]]'', the fictional headquarters of the advertising agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (changed in Season 6 to Sterling Cooper &amp; Partners) is located in Suite 3750 of the Time &amp; Life Building (on the 37th floor). In a fifth-season episode, "[[At the Codfish Ball]]", the characters eat at the Tower Suite. The agency's offices also prominently feature Eames Time-Life Chairs. On March 23, 2015, [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], the network on which ''Mad Men'' airs, unveiled a bench in front of the building which features a sculpture of the iconic black silhouette of lead character [[Don Draper]] in the show's opening credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Renner |first=Eric |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/23/amc-unveils-draper-bench-outside-new-yorks-time-life-building |title=AMC unveils 'The Draper Bench' outside New York's Time-Life Building |website=EW.com |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Time &amp; Life Building features prominently in the 2013 film version of ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', which depicts in part the publication of the last issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life'']] magazine.

'''Abraham Asscher''' (19 September 1880 – 2 May 1950) was a [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] businessman from Amsterdam, a politician, and a leader of his community who attained notoriety for his role during the [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)#German occupation|German occupation of the Netherlands]] (1940–1945).

==Early career==
Asscher’s grandfather founded the Asscher Diamond Company (now the [[Royal Asscher Diamond Company]]) in 1854, but it was Abraham and his brother Joseph who built its international fame. In 1907 the brothers opened a new factory at 127 Tolstraat in Amsterdam and soon they received a request from King [[Edward VII of Great Britain]] to cleave the legendary [[Cullinan Diamond]], the largest rough gem-quality diamond ever found.

==Public service==
Asscher translated his growing success in business into political and community involvement. In 1917, he took up a seat on the Provincial Council of North Holland for the ''[[Liberale Staatspartij]]'' (Liberal State Party). And in the 1930s, he became a leader and spokesman of the Dutch Jewish community. He served as the President of the nation’s central Jewish organization, the ''Nederlandsch-Israëlitsch Kerkgenootschap'' (Dutch Jewish Congregation).

Therefore, when in 1933 Jewish refugees began to flee in numbers to the Netherlands from the Nazi regime in Germany, it was Asscher, along with Professor {{Ill|David Cohen (historian)|lt=David Cohen|nl|David Cohen}}, who established (with government cooperation) the ''{{Ill|Comité voor Bijzondere Joodsche Belangen|nl}}'' (Committee for Special Jewish Affairs - CBJB). An offshoot of the CBJB, the ''Comité voor Joodsche Vluchtelingen'' ([[Committee for Jewish Refugees (Netherlands)|Committee for Jewish Refugees]] - CJV), was formed to provide direct service to the refugees. The CJV provided advice and, as needed, financial support to the refugees, and worked to facilitate the emigration of refugees away from continental Europe. David Cohen was the chair of the CJV for most of its eight years of existence. Both of these committees were dissolved by Germany in 1941, and their responsibilities transferred to a Jewish Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dan |last=Michman |title=The Committee for Jewish Refugees in Holland, 1933-1940 |work=Yad Vashem Studies |volume=XIV |location=Jerusalem |date=1981 |pages=205–232}} No online access.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jewish Council==
It was in this context (see [[Netherlands in World War II]]) that the Nazi occupiers later, on February 12, 1941, ordered Asscher and Cohen to head up a new {{Interlanguage link multi|Joodse Raad voor Amsterdam|nl|Joodse Raad voor Amsterdam|de|Judenrat Amsterdam}}; the only example of a [[Judenrat|Jewish Council]] in the German occupations of Western Europe. The first meeting was held at the Asscher Brothers headquarters in Tolstraat. The ''Joodse Raad'' had to mediate the occupation government’s orders to the Dutch Jewish community and, beginning in July 1942, to help organize the selection of Jewish deportees from the Netherlands to the work camps.

In September 1943, most of the remaining staff of the ''Joodse Raad'', including Asscher were deported. Asscher, like most deported Dutch Jews, initially went to the [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] camp in the Drenthe province in the east of the country. From there, the Nazis transported him to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] concentration camp.

==Postwar==
Asscher survived his imprisonment at Bergen-Belsen and returned to Amsterdam after the conclusion of the war. Aside from historian {{Interlanguage link multi|David Cohen (historian)|nl|David Cohen|de|David Cohen (Historiker)|lt=David Cohen}}, who also survived [[Theresienstadt]] concentration camp, all other members of the Jewish Council perished, including the Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam [[Lodewijk Sarlouis]].  The Dutch government instituted investigations against Asscher and his colleague David Cohen into charges of collaboration. A ''Joodsche Eereraad'' (Jewish Council of Honor or Community Tribunal) was also established to investigate wartime collaboration charges on behalf of the Jewish community. It was particularly concerned with activity after August 15, 1942; a point from which, according to the accusers' post-war perspective, it was considered obvious that the ''Joodse Raad'' was assisting in a mass-murder of Dutch Jews in German-occupied Poland’s Nazi extermination camps.  However, what was obvious to either Jews or non-Jews in the Netherlands at the time is a matter of considerable historical controversy. The Nazi occupiers went to great lengths to conceal the fate of deported Jews from the Dutch population, including Dutch Jews and the Joodse Raad.

In 1947 the Council of Honor ruled to exclude Asscher and Cohen from ever holding public office in the Dutch Jewish Community. By then, Asscher—deeply wounded by what he saw as unjust charges leveled against him—had left the Community. When Asscher died in 1950 in accordance with his wishes he was not buried in a Jewish cemetery, but instead at the [[Zorgvlied (cemetery)|Zorgvlied cemetery]].  However, in the same year, due to constant protests and appeals, the Jewish community tribunal after reconsidering the charges reversed and annulled its decree to exclude both Asscher and Cohen from official posts in the Jewish community, exonerating them completely.  The Dutch government, taking its cue from the Jewish community, dropped all charges of its own the year following.&lt;ref&gt;See Ibid., p. 270, also Jozeph Michman, "The Controversy Surrounding the Jewish Council of Amsterdam," in ''Patterns of Jewish Leadership in Nazi Europe, 1933-1945''; Proceedings of the Third Yad Vashem International Historical Conference, edited by Y. Gutman and C. J. Haft, (Jerusalem, 1979), pp. 235-258, summarized in Idem, "Asscher, Abraham," in ''The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', edited by Yisrael Gutman (New York: Macmillan, 1990), Vol. 1: pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Abraham Asscher has been officially exonerated of all charges, even if it came too late for him to know about it.

==Legacy==
The actions of Asscher and the ''Joodse Raad'' during the German occupation were and are a controversial topic. Hans Knoop, in his history of the ''Joodse Raad'', came to this conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“They issued deportation notices and urged the Jews in ''Het Joodsche Weekblad'' to obey these summons to the letter…Cohen declared after the war that ‘thanks to our efforts no Jew suffered from hunger in occupied Holland.’ That is the case. But thanks to Asscher and Cohen the deportation of the Jews in the Netherlands achieved a greater measure of perfection and efficiency than anywhere else in occupied Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in: {{cite book |last1=Dwork |first1=Deborah |first2=Robert-Jan |last2=van Pelt |chapter=The Netherlands |editor1-last=Wyman |editor1-first=David S. |title=The World Reacts to the Holocaust |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |date=1996 |page=59 |isbn=9780801849695 |oclc=34514061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course, such accusations benefit from a hindsight that the leaders of the Jewish Council in The Netherlands did not have.  [[Jacob Presser]]’s groundbreaking history of the Holocaust in the Netherlands, ''Ondergang'' (lit. ''Destruction''; published in English as ''The Destruction of Dutch Jews'', or ''Ashes in the Wind: The Destruction of Dutch Jews''), also criticized Asscher and Cohen, while balancing this with a defense of their good intentions and courageous attempts within the realities of their own perceived situation, to lessen Nazi measures. Presser stated firmly that: "No one has accused the two Presidents and the Jewish Council" of being collaborators in the strict sense of being "corrupt and immoral willing tools" of the Nazis, much less as partisans for them, as were the Dutch Nazis, Quislings, Petains and Francos, but the accusations after the war rather were about the degree to which they as victims had naively or mistakenly, despite their best efforts to preserve as much as they could, conceded too much to Nazi pressures to collect together and help to transport the Jewish community to unknown destinations in "the East."&lt;ref&gt;Presser, p. 271; for a strong criticism of Presser's account of the Jewish leaders as conceding too much to their critics and not putting enough weight on the leaders' courageous attempts to resist Nazi measures, see the review of Presser's book by Henriette Boas in ''Commentary Magazine'', January, 1970.  Also see Dwork and Van Pelt, pp. 62-64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Presser, acknowledging that they sought to preserve as many as possible of the Jewish community by haggling numbers deported down as far as possible, even adds,"The Jewish Council played for time.  Was that wrong?  ... Even the most unselfish people would surely have hesitated to shelter and hide Jews if they had known that their self-sacrifice would drag out over so many long years.  And it has been said that had the war in fact ended in 1942 the Jewish community would have built a monument to Asscher and Cohen, as the brave and resourceful leaders by whose hands Dutch Jewry was saved."&lt;ref&gt;Presser, pp. 272-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leni Yahil]], in her ''The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry'', writes sympathetically of them: "While Visser's opposition to cooperation [of any kind whatsoever] with the Germans bespoke a political orientation," (he had led a rival Jewish "Coordination Committee" that the Nazis had disbanded, which had urged that the Jewish community resist any cooperation with the Nazis and only address itself to the Dutch government, which, according to Yahil "ignored the fact that the heads of the Dutch administration were now carrying out orders issued by the Germans"), "Asscher and especially Cohen invoked the humanitarian principle and believed it was necessary to negotiate with the Germans in order to mitigate the suffering of the Jews through intercession on their behalf.  Thus, they essentially held to the approach that had been employed prior to the war to obtain aid for the refugees, except that now they were tending to the Jewish community as a whole."  &lt;ref&gt;[[Leni Yahil]], ''The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 227; Yahil has clarified further, in her "Methods of Persecution: A Comparison of the 'Final Solution' in Holland and Denmark," ''Scripta Hiereosolymtana'' (Jerusalem) 23 (1972), 279-300, the restraints and real pressures limiting the options of the Jewish Council in The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the company that Asscher and his brother had brought to international fame and prominence was awarded the Royal title by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands; it is now known as ''Koninklijke Asscher Diamant Maatschappij'' (Royal Asscher Diamond Company). Abraham’s grandson, Edward Asscher, is the current President of the Company.
His great-grandson [[Lodewijk Asscher]] is the current Dutch Minister of Social Affairs and Employment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">'''Active ageing''' ('''active aging''' in the [[United States of America|US]]) is a concept recently deployed by the [[European Commission]], the [[World Health Organization]], and used also in [[Human Resource Management]]. This concept evokes the idea of longer activity, with a higher retirement age and working practices adapted to the age of the employee. It also extends to the social engagement of the elderly in the collectivity.
[[File:Egypte louvre 105.jpg|thumbnail|Two men practicing [[Tahtib]], one of them lost his hair, indicating advanced age, on an [[ostraca]] from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Louvre]]]]

== Demographic changes ==
Europeans demography shifts towards an elder population with lower [[birth rates]]. This will have repercussions on the European economy as less and less active people will support the social costs of health-care and pension of those who stopped working.
The EU-Commission has fixed 2 targets for 2010:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/fr/europe-sociale/vieillissement-actif-travailleurs-emettent-reserves/article-164437{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Euractiv.com&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Stockholm targets of 2001, which intend to reach 50% higher employment of elder people between 55 and 64.
# The Barcelona targets of 2002, which intend to progressively augment of 5 years the age of retirement in order to prolong the professional life of elder people.

== Theoretical background ==
The concept of active ageing was originally inspired by the work of Robert Havighurst on [[activity theory]], according to which elders' well-being relies on them staying active in later life; from this point of view, staying active is key to successfully ageing.&lt;ref&gt;Silke van Dyk, Stephan Lessenich, Tina Denninger et Anna Richter (2014). The Many Meanings of “Active Ageing”. Confronting Public Discourse with Older People’s Stories, Recherches sociologiques et anthropologiques 44(1): 97-115&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current understandings ==
At the end of the 20th century organizations such as the OECD and the International Labour Organization used the concept to address the challenges faced by the labour market: lengthening of retirement, maintaining the elderly in employment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Thibauld Moulaert, Sylvie Carbonnelle et Laurent Nisen (2014). Le vieillissement actif dans tous ses éclats, Presses Universitaires de Louvain.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the World Health Organization (WHO) gave a new twist to the concept by emphasising the prevention of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2002). Active Ageing: A policy framework, http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/active_ageing/en/&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] platforms are in the process of being developed. &lt;ref&gt;Sammon, David, et al. "Special issue on IS/IT Applications for the Support of Older People." International journal of medical informatics 82.11 (2013): 1035-1036.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was then extended to elders being engaged in their communities (e.g. through volunteering) and their family. From this point of view an elder should optimize his or her health in order to benefit his or her own life as much as enrich the collectivity. Critics condemn the normativity of this model as [[Successful ageing|"successfully" ageing]] in which elders have to stay active and be involved in activities recognized as beneficial without taking into account their heterogeneous life courses.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Katz (2013). Active and Successful Aging. Lifestyle as a Gerontological Idea, Recherches sociologiques et anthropologiques 44(1): 33-49&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10533">The '''Associated Whistleblowing Press''' (AWP) is a [[not-for-profit]] information agency based in Brussels, Belgium, dedicated to the defense of human rights by promoting transparency, freedom of information and speech, whistleblowing and investigative journalism, conceived as a global network made up of cooperative local platforms and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civic.mit.edu/blog/shidash/associated-whistleblowing-press-interview |title=Associated Whistleblowing Press interview |publisher= MIT Center of Civic Media |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, the initiative aims to work in a decentralized network structure, with local platforms that deal with local information, contexts and actors in a ''"from the roots upward model"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awp.is/?page_id=11 |title=Associated Whistleblowing Press &amp;#124; Network |publisher=Awp.is |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories produced will then be published on the project's multilanguage newsroom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whistle.is |title=Newsroom |publisher=W H I S T L E .Is |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/deed.en_GBAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs |title=Creative Commons — Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported — CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The team consists of collaborators spread all around the world, led by two editors, [[Pedro Noel]] and [[Santiago Carrion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://owni.eu/2012/09/04/the-associated-whistleblowing-press/ |title=The Associated Whistleblowing Press » OWNI.eu, News, Augmented |publisher=Owni.eu |date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decentralized platforms==
In a strategy to amplify the social effect of dennouncing on crimes and corruption, the Associated Whistleblowing Press is building whistleblowing platforms oriented to different communities as well as precise issues or problematic subjects, establishing networks with local and international media and civil society organizations.
The platforms created to precise contexts are intended to achieve specific goals in transparency, publishing restricted or censored material of political, scientific, ethical, diplomatic or historical significance. Rumor, opinion, stories and other kinds of first hand accounts or material that is publicly available elsewhere will not be accepted. Materials which violate individual privacy will not be accepted unless they speak up on violations and abuses that affect the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://awp.is/data.html|title=Data management, privacy policies and terms of use}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ljost===
On September 30, 2012, the AWP launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030008/https://ljost.is/ Ljost],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Shine-A-Light |title=The Reykjavík Grapevine Features / Shine A Light |language=is |publisher=Grapevine.is |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2012-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110045010/http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Shine-A-Light |archive-date=2012-11-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; its first local whistleblowing platform in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. Internet pioneer Guðmundur Ragnar Guðmundsson, [[Birgitta Jónsdóttir]], a [[member of parliament]] of [[Alþingi|Althing]], the Icelandic parliament, representing the [[Pirate Party Iceland]] and investigative journalist Jon Bjarki have all collaborated with the creation of the platform.
Ljost.is a website which allows Icelandic citizens to send information proving abuse or corruption in a safe and anonymous way. The platform is a network of journalists, researchers and media agencies dedicated to analyzing and publishing leaked content to make governments and corporations accountable for their actions by bringing them into light.
According to the Associated Whistleblowing Press, the main objective moving Ljost platform is to restore the media as an active player for truth and justice in Iceland, believing transparency as the best way to increase social accountability of local governments and corporations for their actions. AWP members believe that for journalists, researchers and media activists, this is a powerful way to lead people to take action against repression, abuse of power, censorship, social inequality and corporate greed in Icelandic society.
On December 30, 2013, Ljost published the Glitnir Files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ljost.is/Glitnir.html|title=GLITNIR FILES Records of 2008 Icelandic economic collapse|publisher=AWP|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leak that brings into public account detailed information identifying Glitnir bank’s biggest borrowers and stakeholders as well as relevant track of some its shares movements during 2007/2008 and evidence that a handful of individuals and companies with strong connections to Glitnir's central shareholders borrowed large amounts of cash from the bank, often with insufficient underlying collateral.

===Filtrala===
On April 23, 2014, the AWP launched [https://filtrala.org/ Filtrala],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sánchez|first=Juan Luis|title=eldiario.es, medio colaborador de la nueva herramienta de filtraciones anónimas Filtrala|url=http://www.eldiario.es/redaccion/eldiarioes-colaborador-herramienta-filtraciones-Filtrala_6_252034807.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=el diario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Renzenbrink|first=Tessel|title=The Associated Whistle-Blowing Press launches Spanish leak site|url=http://www.techthefuture.com/technology/the-associated-whistle-blowing-press-launches-spanish-leak-site/|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=techthefuture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; its first local whistleblowing platform in Spain.
The name of the project literally means “leak it”. It was launched in collaboration with four Spanish media organizations – La Marea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Nace ‘Filtrala’, el portal de los documentos secretos|url=http://www.lamarea.com/2014/04/23/filtrala/|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=lamarea}}&lt;/ref&gt; eldiario.es,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanches|first=Juan Luiz|title=Nace Filtrala: eldiario.es, medio colaborador|url=http://www.juanlusanchez.com/archivos/2014/04/23/nace-filtrala-eldiario-es-medio-colaborador/|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=el diario}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diagonal (newspaper)|Diagonal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Franco|first=Marta|title=Deposite usted sus informes secretos aquí|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/saberes/22677-deposite-usted-sus-informes-secretos-aqui.html|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=Diagonal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=COLABORAMOS CON LA NUEVA HERRAMIENTA DE FILTRACIONES ANÓNIMAS FÍLTRALA|url=http://www.revistamongolia.com/mongolia-colabora-con-la-nueva-herramienta-de-filtraciones-anonimas-filtrala/|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=Mongolia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427080734/http://www.revistamongolia.com/mongolia-colabora-con-la-nueva-herramienta-de-filtraciones-anonimas-filtrala/|archive-date=2014-04-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; –, two Catalan media organizations – Crític, [[La Directa]] – along with the Comisión Anticorrupcíon de la Red Ciudadana Partido X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partidox.org/filtrala/|title=Red Ciudadana Partido X|publisher=Partido X|accessdate=7 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426112709/http://partidox.org/filtrala/|archive-date=2014-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was created to serve Spanish society in a way that anyone can send safe and anonymous information that denounces crimes, corruption, abuse and infraction from individuals, corporations or institutions. It is part of the international network of AWP and it is settled in Belgium for its recognition in law ensurement of press freedom, informants protection and journalism protection.
The main objective is to amplify revealed information in a mediatic, civil and legal level. Through the Platform the Spanish society has a citizen mechanism to fight against corruption and abuse with the aim of a social regeneration based mainly in social justice.

==Submission system==

AWP uses [[GlobaLeaks]] software to manage on-line submissions of sensitive materials and obligates its users to use the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity system through a '[[tor hidden service]] only' platform. (Furthermore, AWP is a member of [[torservers.net]], a network of nonprofits which specializes in the general establishment of Tor exit nodes via workshops and donations.)&lt;ref name="TorServers.net Members"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-heart-torserversnet |date=2016-12-03|title=Tor at the Heart: Torservers.net|last=Steele |first=Sharon |authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each node is in charge of managing a virtual dropbox, analyzing any information received, transforming it into news stories and coordinating within a local and international network of media and organizations before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/09/alternative-to-wikileaks-arises-in-iceland/|title=IPS – Alternative to Wikileaks Arises in Iceland &amp;#124; Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data management policies==
The analysis of all submissions consists of two main steps. First of all a thorough investigation will be done into what are normally very large files in variable formats (such as emails or internal memos) in order to locate relevant information. This information will later be put into context, explaining actors, motives and consequences in relation to the organizations or people in question.
When publishing the results as news, the AWP will work closely with as many trustworthy media partners and activists as they can in order to reach the largest audience possible. The dissemination process will also be amplified thanks to the Internet and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://awp.is/data.html|title=Data Management Policies|publisher=AWP|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Charles Schwab Corporation''' is a [[bank]] and [[brokerage firm]], based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. It was founded in 1971 by [[Charles R. Schwab]] and is one of the [[list of largest banks in the United States|largest banks in the United States]] as well as one of the largest brokerage firms in the United States. The company provides services for individuals and institutions that are [[investing online]]. The company offers an [[electronic trading platform]] for the purchase and sale of [[financial securities]] including [[common stock]]s, [[preferred stock]]s, [[futures contract]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[option (finance)|options]], [[mutual funds]], and [[fixed income]] investments. It also provides [[Margin (finance)|margin]] lending, and cash management services, as well as services through [[registered investment adviser]]s.

==Current operations==
Schwab operates in four main divisions: investing, wealth management, banking, and trading. As of December 31, 2017, the company had 10.755 million active client brokerage accounts, with $3.362 trillion in assets.&lt;ref name=10K2017/&gt; The company operated 345 [[branch (banking)|branches]] in 46 states, as well as a branch in each of Puerto Rico and London.&lt;ref name=10K2017/&gt;

==History==
In 1963, [[Charles R. Schwab]] and two other partners launched ''Investment Indicator'', an investment newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/04/11/schwab-icon-of-the-small-investor/2070573/| title=Icons: Schwab still roots for the small investor| first=John| last=Waggoner| newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe. In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries. In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Og1VaPhkwwC| title=Charles Schwab: How One Company Beat Wall Street and Reinvented the Brokerage Industry| first=John| last=Kador| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | date=November 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] allowed for negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a [[discount brokerage]]. In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1980, Schwab established the industry's first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000. In 1981, Schwab became a member of the [[NYSE]], and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000.

In 1983, [[Stephen McLin]] purchased the company for [[Bank of America]] for $55 million. In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load [[mutual fund]]s. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company from Bank of America for $280 million.&lt;ref name=selling&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/03/business/bank-america-is-selling-schwab-unit-to-founder.html| title=Bank America Is Selling Schwab Unit to Founder| first=Lawrence M.| last=Fisher| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=February 3, 1987| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the company acquired Mayer &amp; Scweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers' orders without sending them to an exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/business/company-news-charles-schwab-in-an-acquisition.html| title=COMPANY NEWS; Charles Schwab In an Acquisition| newspaper=The New York Times| date=June 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/22/business/schwab-unit-agrees-to-pay-200000-fine.html| title=Schwab Unit Agrees to Pay $200,000 Fine| agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | newspaper=The New York Times| date=October 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schwab-affiliate-mayer--schweitzer-to-be-renamed-schwab-capital-markets-lp-72588517.html| title=Schwab Affiliate Mayer &amp; Schweitzer to Be Renamed Schwab Capital Markets, L.P.| publisher=Charles Schwab|

In 1993, the company opened an office in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1995, the company acquired The Hampton Company, founded by Walter W. Bettinger, who became CEO of Schwab in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.pionline.com/article/19951109/ONLINE/511090703/charles-schwab-acquired-the-hampton-co-a-defined-benefit-and-defined| title=Charles Schwab acquired The Hampton Co., a defined benefit and defined| publisher=Pensions &amp; Investments Online| date=November 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Schwab purchased [[U.S. Trust]] for $2.73 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/14/business/schwab-to-pay-2.73-billion-for-us-trust.html| title=Schwab to Pay $2.73 Billion For U.S. Trust| first=Patrick| last=McGeehan| newspaper=The New York Times| date=January 14, 2000| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, less than a year after the acquisition of U.S. Trust, the U.S. Trust subsidiary was fined $10 million in a bank secrecy law case. It was ordered to pay $5 million to the New York State Banking Department and $5 million to the Federal Reserve Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/business/us-trust-is-fined-10-million-in-bank-secrecy-law-case.html| title=U.S. Trust Is Fined $10 Million in Bank Secrecy-Law Case| first=Michael| last=Brick| newspaper=The New York Times| date=July 14, 2001| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2006, Schwab announced an agreement to sell U.S. Trust to [[Bank of America]] for $3.3 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/bank-of-america-markets-equity-cx_jl_1120markets12.html| title=Bank of America To Buy U.S. Trust| first=Josh| last=Lipton| work=[[Forbes]]| date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal closed in the second quarter of 2007.

In November 2003, Schwab announced the $345 million acquisition of [[SoundView Technology Group]] to add [[equity research]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schwab-to-acquire-soundview-technology-group-73081817.html| title=Schwab to Acquire SoundView Technology Group| publisher=Charles Schwab Corporation| via=PR Newswire| date=November 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/20/business/company-news-schwab-to-buy-soundview-for-321-million.html| title=Schwab To Buy Soundview For $321 Million| agency=Bloomberg L.P.| newspaper=The New York Times| date=November 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab's right-hand man, shared the CEO title with the company's founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company's board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck's removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10%, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26% decline in revenue from customer stock trading.

After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had "lost touch with our heritage", and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck's fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck's removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab.&lt;ref name=down&gt;{{cite news| title=Charles Schwab steps down as CEO of his brokerage| accessdate=January 24, 2018| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2008/07/charles-r-schwa.html| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008.

; Schwab YieldPlus Fund

This fund was named as one of the decade's top ten fund disasters for the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Decade's 10 Worst Fund Disasters| url=http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/fund-observer/2009/12/30/the-decades-10-worst-fund-disasters| last=Silverblatt| first=Ron| date=December 30, 2009| journal=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "In written materials and in conversations with customers, some Schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the fund's characteristics, risk and diversification, and continued to represent YieldPlus as a relatively low-risk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Between Sept. 1, 2006, and Feb. 29, 2008, Schwab sold over $13.75 billion in shares of YieldPlus to customers, which accounted for approximately 98 percent of the amount Schwab customers invested in ultra short-term bond funds. During this time period, Schwab's solicited sales of YieldPlus totaled approximately $3.36 billion, approximately 40 percent of which were to customers 65 years of age or older. Schwab collected approximately $17.5 million in fees from sales of the fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title=FINRA Orders Schwab to Pay $18 Million to Investors for Improper Marketing of YieldPlus Bond Fund| url=http://www.finra.org/newsroom/2011/finra-orders-schwab-pay-18-million-investors-improper-marketing-yieldplus-bond-fund| date=January 11, 2011| publisher=[[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From June 2007 through June 2008, the total return on Schwab's YieldPlus fund was -31.7% when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses. These large losses occurred because Schwab's YieldPlus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by Schwab. It was instead an ultra long bond fund. YieldPlus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid, long-term, private label mortgages. It also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities. In doing so, Schwab's fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its SEC filings and marketing materials. YieldPlus' long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to 2007. Unfortunately, the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in 2007 and 2008. 
YieldPlus's heaviest reported losses occurred in early 2008, yet Schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund's holdings and therefore its NAV ...The YieldPlus fund made large, risky investments in long maturity structured products, such as subprime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities ("RMBS") that were inconsistent with the SEC's definition of an ultra short bond fund. Schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher  yield and only slightly more risk. Such a claim would be incorrect for a typical, conventionally managed ultra short bond fund, but was especially false when made by Schwab on behalf of the YieldPlus fund. In its marketing materials, Schwab compared returns on the YieldPlus fund to returns on the Lehman Short U.S. Treasury 9-12 month index. The Treasury securities included in the Lehman index have no credit risk, are highly liquid and have short maturities. The holdings of the YieldPlus fund generally shared none of these attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Charles Schwab YieldPlus Risk| url=http://www.slcg.com/pdf/workingpapers/Schwab%20YieldPlus.pdf| first1=Geng| last1=Deng| first2=Craig| last2=McCann| first3=Edward | last3=O'Neal| publisher=Securities Litigation &amp; Consulting Group| year=2010| accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

YieldPlus had $1.1 billion of investor losses, including losses by the founder himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/business/14norris.html| title=At Schwab, Unkept Promise To Investors| newspaper=The New York Times| first=Floyd| last=Norris| date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwab closed the YieldPlus funds in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Schwab shuttering beleaguered YieldPlus funds| first=Kathleen| last=Pender| date=June 24, 2011| url=http://blog.sfgate.com/pender/2011/06/24/schwab-shuttering-beleaguered-yieldplus-funds/| newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the company acquired The 401(k) Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schwab-announces-acquisition-of-the-401k-company-57225027.html| title=Schwab Announces Acquisition of the 401(K) Company| publisher=Charles Schwab Corp| via=PRNewswire| date=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 22 of the following year, Walter W. Bettinger, the previous [[chief operating officer]], was named chief executive, succeeding the company's namesake. Charles R. Schwab remained [[executive chairman]] of the company and said in a statement that he would "continue to serve as a very active chairman."&lt;ref name=down/&gt;

In 2011, the company acquired OptionsXpress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110831007072/en/Schwab-Completes-Acquisition-optionsXpress| title=Schwab Completes Acquisition of optionsXpress| publisher=Charles Schwab Corp| via=[[Business Wire]]| date=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also acquired Compliance11, Inc., a provider of compliance software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111116005867/en/Schwab-Completes-Acquisition-Compliance11| title=Schwab Completes Acquisition of Compliance11, Inc.| publisher=Charles Schwab Corp| via=Business Wire| date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, it expanded again by acquiring ThomasPartners, an [[asset management]] firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121015005686/en/Schwab-Announces-Agreement-Acquire-Thomas-Partners| title=Schwab Announces Agreement to Acquire Thomas Partners| publisher=Charles Schwab Corp| via=Business Wire| date=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
In 2004, Charles Schwab chose [[Havas Worldwide]] (then called Euro RSCG) as its full-service [[advertising agency]]. In February 2013, Schwab hired [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] (CP+B) as its lead creative agency with Havas Worldwide remaining to create ads for ActiveTrader and optionsXpress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/charles-schwab-completes-creative-search-147124| title=Charles Schwab Completes Creative Search: Crispin outstrips Fallon for lead role|last=Beltrone| first=Gabriel| journal=AdWeek| date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[Adweek]] reported on marketing material created by CP+B for Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-meet-charles-schwabs-new-intelligent-nonhuman-pitchman-163418| title=Ad of the Day: Meet Charles Schwab's New Intelligent, Nonhuman Pitchman: CP+B builds embodiment of the company's robo-adviser| last=Gianatasio| first=David| journal=AdWeek| date=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2005, the company launched a series of television ads featuring the slogan ''Talk to Chuck'' by Euro RSCG and directed/animated by [[Bob Sabiston]]'s [[Rotoshop|Flat Black Films]]. "Talk to Chuck" ads appeared in print media, online, billboards, and branch offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/ad_report_card/2005/12/money_toons.html| last=Stevenson| first=Seth| title=Money Toons: The distinctive animated ads from Charles Schwab| publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blog post in [[The Wall Street Journal]] described the ads as effective because they included a single memorable phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/08/06/why-talk-to-chuck-was-a-great-ad/| title=Why 'Talk to Chuck' Was a Great Ad| last=Higgins| first=Michelle Perry| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| date=August 6, 2014| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan ''Own Your Tomorrow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130612005401/en/Charles-Schwab-Launches-New-Campaign-Celebrating-Spirit| title=Charles Schwab Launches New Campaign Celebrating the Spirit of Engagement| publisher=Charles Schwab Corp| via=Business Wire| date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schwab Charitable Fund==
'''Schwab Charitable Fund''' is a [[donor advised fund]] which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names. Professionally-managed accounts are only available through independent investment advisors working with Schwab Advisor Services, a business segment of The Charles Schwab Corporation. It accepts contributions of real estate, private equity or other non-cash assets via a charitable intermediary, with proceeds of the donation transferred to a donor-advised account upon liquidation. This intermediary considers donations on a case-by-case basis, with a typical requirement that assets be valued at $250,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170710005264/en/Schwab-Charitable-Facilitates-1.5-Billion-Grants-Fiscal| title=Schwab Charitable Facilitates More Than $1.5 Billion in Grants in Fiscal Year 2017| publisher=Charles Schwab Corp| via=Business Wire| date=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar job titles include: ''chief people officer'', ''chief personnel officer'', ''executive vice president of human resources'' and ''senior vice president of human resources''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maura|first=Ciccarelli|title=Trust at the Top|url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=533342772|publisher=Human Resource Executive Online|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/about/board-of-directors|title=HR Policy Association Board of Directors Roster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles and responsibilities of a typical CHRO can be categorized as follows: workforce strategist, organizational and performance conductor, HR service delivery owner, [[corporate governance|compliance and governance]] regulator, and coach and adviser to the senior leadership team and the board of directors. CHROs may also be involved in board member selection and orientation, [[executive compensation]], and [[succession planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 21st Century Chief Human Resource Officer |url=http://www.hrmguide.com/general/chro.htm |date=2006-04-04 |work= |publisher=''[[Deloitte]]'' |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magdata.lrp.com/MAGDATA/servlet/DataServlet?fname=07012008Extra_CHROChallengesAndStrategies.pdf|title=The Chief Human Resources Officer: Key Challenges &amp; Strategies for Success|last=|first=|date=2008-06-27|work=|publisher=[[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|Cornell University Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, functions such as communications, facilities, public relations and related areas may fall within the scope of the CHRO role. Increasingly, CHROs report directly to chief executive officers and are members of the most senior-level committees of a company (e.g., executive committee or office of the CEO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/documents/ces_research/changing_chro_role_2016.pdf|title=The Changing Chief Human Resources Officer Role|last=Wright|first=Patrick|date=|website=|publisher=University of South Carolina Darla Moore School of Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of the profession ==

The role of the CHRO has evolved rapidly to meet the human capital needs of organizations operating across multiple regulatory and labor environments.  Whereas CHROs once focused on organizations human resources in just one or two countries, today many oversee complex networks of employees on more than one continent and implement workforce development strategies on a global scale.  CHROs are especially important now in helping companies navigate the workforce issues associated with expanding into emerging markets, and in developing labor policies to suit different regions of the world while preserving a company’s core culture.

The strategic role of the CHRO has also expanded as workforces are increasingly composed of knowledge workers, and companies require better systems to compete for scarce high-skilled workers.  Rather than focusing exclusively on human resource issues and service delivery, CHROs must concentrate on creating strong talent pipelines to both enhance organizational decision-making and secure future growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boudreau|first=John W.|title=Beyond HR: The New Science of Human Capital|year=2007|publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing|author2=Peter M. Ramstad}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These changes in the business landscape have required the CHRO to heighten the focus on talent, capabilities and company culture.

== Responsibilities ==

According to an annual survey conducted by the largest industry group for CHROs, the HR Policy Association in the United States, top CHRO concerns over the years fall roughly into three broad categories: talent, capabilities, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/downloads/2017/2011-03-02%20CHRO%20Report%20FINAL%20(no%20cover%20page).pdf|title=Principal Chief Human Resource Officer Concerns|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talent ===
Talent management includes building the quality and depth of talent, including a focus on succession and leadership/employee development.  In a separate survey of over 200 U.S. and European CHROs, University of South Carolina professor Patrick Wright&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moore.sc.edu/facultyresearch/faculty.aspx?faculty_id=200]&lt;/ref&gt; found that nearly all participants cited 'talent' as the top priority on their CEO's agenda for HR.&lt;ref&gt;cipositions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hueslid|first=Mark |author2=Richard Beatty |author3=Brian Becker|title=The Strategic Logic of Workforce Management|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=December 2005|pages=110–117|url=http://www.markhuselid.com/pdfs/articles/2005%20Huselid-Beatty-Becker%20HBR%20Paper.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capabilities ===
Managing corporate capabilities includes dealing with rapid changes in technology,  globalization, and the increasingly complex  external context of government regulations and public policy (impacting union and employee relations, executive compensation, health care, retirement programs, health and safety, etc.).

The key capabilities required are expected to vary by company based on business strategy and the competitive global environment.  Adapting to new technologies and sources of information and communications are essential to success for all companies.  Other capabilities the HR function must help the company develop include: managing the external context, managing a multi-generational workforce, adapting to change, and operating effectively in different cultures and business structures.

=== Culture ===
Cultural issues include organizational change, agility, social networking, ethics and values, innovation, customer focus, [[employee engagement]], diversity and inclusiveness, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/downloads/2017/2011-03-02%20CHRO%20Report%20FINAL%20(no%20cover%20page).pdf|title=Principal Chief Human Resource Officer Concerns 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human resources function has a leadership role in helping shape the culture of the company.  Ensuring that the values of the company are communicated and understood at all levels, providing clarity as to the expected behavior of all employees and the development of a high performance culture are important aspects of the CHRO role.  When an employee’s behavior is inconsistent with the values of the company, the human resources function is responsible for ensuring that such situations are dealt with fairly.  The HR function also helps the organization establish and maintain high levels of employee engagement and commitment.

Increasingly, companies are relying on external partners, joint-ventures, as well as merged and acquired companies as sources of innovation, capabilities and growth.  Establishing a culture that is supportive of such external partnerships is an area where the HR function plays an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/f5Ks|title=Functional Responsibilities of the CHRO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing the findings of a recent study of HR leaders, Randy MacDonald, former CHRO for IBM, indicated that the three key workforce gaps CHROs cite as the biggest opportunities for HR are: 
* Cultivating creative leaders who can more nimbly lead in complex, global environments
* Mobilizing for greater speed and flexibility producing significantly greater capability to adjust underlying costs and faster ways to allocate talent 
* Capitalizing on collective intelligence through much more effective collaboration across increasingly global teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-935.ibm.com/services/c-suite/chro/study/|title=Working Beyond Borders: Insights from the Global Chief Human Resource Officer Study|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IBM Corp.|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path to becoming a CHRO ==

The CHRO is the top HR position, but those who attain this role arrive there by working in a variety of functions both within the HR function and other functional and leadership roles both inside their company and across industries and employers.  In a 2011 survey of top HR leaders, roughly two-thirds of CHROs indicated they worked outside HR at some time in their career.  There is also significant movement between companies with only 36% of US CHROs gaining their position through internal promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpolicy.org/commentary/blog/the-sorry-state-of-chro-succession-9393|title=The Sorry State of CHRO Succession|last=Wright|first=Patrick|date=|work=View From the Top|publisher=HR Policy Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of HR experience, one survey indicated that the most common area of functional experience for CHROs is talent management; the next most common experience is [[compensation and benefits]], followed by organizational culture.  Current CHROs have had broader functional experience in HR than their predecessors and are less likely to have had experience in labor relations than past CHROs.

== Job description ==

Two recently published books about the CHRO profession, ''The Talent Masters: Why Smart Leaders Put People Before Numbers'', by Bill Conaty and [[Ram Charan;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Chief Human Resource Officer, Defining the Role of Human Resource Leaders'' by Pat Wright, offer insights into the profession from its leading practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470905344.html|title=The Chief HR Officer: Defining the New Role of Human Resource Leaders|last=Wright|first=Patrick|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perennial top priority for CHROs is talent management.  In ''The Chief Human Resource Officer, Defining the Role of Human Resource Leaders'', Eva Sage-Gavin, former CHRO for the Gap emphasizes this point saying, "... at the end of the day, you and your team are the experts at talent management and must be able to understand and identify good versus great talent… Identifying critical positions, the great attributes needed to fill them, and prioritizing recruiting strategies accordingly was the key to success, whether I was working with engineers, apparel designers, or international operations management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470905344.html|title=The Chief HR Officer|last=Wright|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Kevin Cox, CHRO for American Express, argues that "Great CHROs (and great CEOs) understand that talent needs to be developed in thoughtful, but not incremental, ways.  Getting the balance right between ‘stretch’ and ‘in over her head’ isn’t easy, but it is vital to the success of a world-class talent strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|title=The Chief HR Officer|pages=74|asin=0470905344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CHRO helps the company build sustainable competitive advantage through the selection and development of top talent that possess capabilities that help differentiate the company from its competitors.  Conaty and Charan emphasize this point in ''Talent Masters'' by noting that “Only one competency lasts. It is the ability to create a steady, self-renewing stream of leaders. Money is just a commodity. Talent supplies the edge. We can’t put it any better than Ron Nersesian, the head of Agilent Technologies’ Electronic Measurement Group: ‘Developing people’s talent is the whole of the company at the end of the day. Our products all are time- perishable. The only thing that stays is the institutional learning and the development of the skills and the capabilities that we have in our people.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leading CHROs emphasize additional aspects of HR leadership, such as delivering results with a global team – a major challenge identified by Hugh Mitchell, CHRO for Royal Dutch Shell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – and developing and communicating an [[employee value proposition]] that will differentiate the company in its efforts to attract and retain the caliber of talent needed to achieve its business objectives, as emphasized by Michael Davis, former CHRO for General Mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Masters-Leaders-People-Numbers/dp/0307460266|title=The Talent Masters|last=Conaty and Charan|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commercial use of space''' is the provision of goods or services of [[Commerce|commercial value]] by using equipment sent into [[Earth orbit]] or [[outer space]]. Examples of the commercial use of space include [[satellite navigation]], [[satellite television]] and commercial [[satellite imagery]]. Operators of such services typically contract the [[List of spacecraft manufacturers|manufacturing of satellites]] and their [[launch service provider|launch]] to private or public companies, which form an integral part of the space economy. Some commercial ventures have long-terms plans to exploit natural resources originating outside Earth, for example [[asteroid mining]]. [[Space tourism]], currently an exceptional activity, could also be an area of future growth, as new businesses strive to reduce the costs and risks of [[human spaceflight]].

The first commercial use of outer space occurred in 1962, when the [[Telstar 1]] satellite was launched to transmit television signals over the Atlantic Ocean. By 2004, global investment in all space sectors was estimated to be [[United States dollar|$]]50.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SPACE A Report on the Industry |publisher=[[Defense Technical Information Center]] |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA449454 |year=2005 |last=Romano |first=Anthony F. |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2010, 31% of all space launches were commercial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Also|Timeline of private spaceflight}}

The first commercial use of satellites may have been the [[Telstar 1]] satellite, launched in 1962, which was the first privately sponsored space launch, funded by [[AT&amp;T]] and [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]. Telstar 1 was capable of relaying television signals across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and was the first satellite to transmit live television, [[telephone]], [[fax]], and other data signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Telephone a Star |url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/nat_geo_telstar_ocr.pdf |author=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=May 1962 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1962-029A |title=Telstar 1 |author=[[NASA]] |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] developed the [[Syncom 3]] satellite, a [[geosynchronous]] [[communications satellite]], leased to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. Commercial possibilities of satellites were further realized when the Syncom 3, orbiting near the [[International Date Line]], was used to telecast the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games]] from [[Tokyo]] to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NASA-SP-93"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf |title=Significant Achievements in Space Communications and Navigation, 1958-1964|year=1966|work=NASA-SP-93|publisher=NASA|pages=30–32|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1964-047A |title=Syncom 3 |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1960 and 1966, NASA launched a series of early [[weather satellites]] known as [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite]]s (TIROS). These satellites greatly advanced [[meteorology]] worldwide, as satellite imagery was used for better forecasting, for both public and commercial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=TIROS |url=https://science.nasa.gov/missions/tiros/ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ecosys/cdroms/AVHRR97_d1/avhrr2.htm |title=The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR): A Brief Reference Guide |first=David A. |last=Hastings |author2=William J.

On April 6, 1965, the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] placed the [[Intelsat I]] [[communications satellite]] geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic Ocean. Intelsat I was built for the [[Communications Satellite Corporation]] (COMSAT), and demonstrated that satellite-based communication was commercially feasible. Intelsat I allowed for near-instantaneous contact between [[Europe]] and [[North America]] by handling television, telephone and fax transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/satcomhistory.html |title=Communications Satellites: Making the Global Village Possible |first=David J. |last=Whalen |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.intelsat.com/about-us/history/intelsat-1960s.asp |title=Intelsat's Satellite Communication Highlights from the 60's |publisher=[[Intelsat]] |accessdate=16 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045321/http://www.intelsat.com/about-us/history/intelsat-1960s.asp |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Soviet Union]] launched the [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]] satellite, which provided television signals across [[Russia]], and started the first national [[satellite television]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Communication satellites |first=Donald H. |last=Martin |publisher=AIAA |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-884989-09-4 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sputnik and Russia's Outer Space Activities |first=Vladimir |last=Putkov |date=April 2007 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |url=http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2661.pdf |publisher=[[United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727192746/http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2661.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the 1972 [[Anik (satellite)|Anik A]] satellite, launched by [[Telesat Canada]], allowed the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] to reach [[northern Canada]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/376/anik_a/anik_a.html |title=The World's First National Synchronous Communications Satellite |publisher=[[Boeing Company]] |year=2011 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108183450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/376/anik_a/anik_a.html |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ANIK The World's First Domestic Synchronous Communication Satellite |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/anik/anik_about.html |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space transportation==

{{see also| Point-to-point sub-orbital spaceflight}}
[[File:Delta IV Medium Rocket DSCS.jpg|thumb|150px|Delta IV Medium launch carrying DSCS III-B6]]
The commercial [[space transportation]] industry derives the bulk of its revenue from the launching of satellites into the Earth’s orbit. Commercial launch providers typically place private and government satellites into [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and [[geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO). In 2002, commercial space transportation generated 6.6 billion dollars, which made up 6% of the total gross of commercial space activities.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence supports these figures.|date=May 2011}}

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has licensed four commercial [[spaceports]] in the United States: the Virginia Space Flight Center/[[Wallops Flight Facility]], [[Kodiak Launch Complex]], Spaceport Florida/[[Kennedy Space Center]]/[[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], and the California Spaceport/[[Vandenberg AFB]]. Launch sites within [[Russia]] and [[China]] have added to the global commercial launch capacity. The [[Delta IV]] and [[Atlas V]] family of launch vehicles are made available for commercial ventures for the United States, while Russia promotes eight families of vehicles. The three largest Russian systems are the [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]], [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], and [[Zenit (rocket)|Zenit]].{{Citation needed|reason=There is no evidence behind these companies usage of commercialized space.|date=May 2011}}

Between 1996 and 2002, 245 launches were made for commercial ventures while government (non-classified) launches only total 167 for the same period. Commercial space flight has spurred investment into the development of an efficient [[reusable launch vehicle]] (RLV) which can place larger payloads into orbit. Several companies such as [[SpaceX]] and [[Blue Origin]] are currently developing new RLV designs.

In the [[United States]], Office of Commercial Space Transportation (generally referred to as [[FAA/AST]] or simply AST) is the branch of [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) that approves any commercial [[rocket]] launch operations&amp;mdash;that is, any launches that are not classified as [[model rocket|model]], amateur, or "by and for the [[government]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/ | title = FAA - Office of Commercial Space Transportation | publisher = FAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Satellites and equipment ==
;Satellite manufacturing
Commercial satellite manufacturing is defined by the United States government as satellites manufactured for civilian, government, or [[non-profit]] use. Not included are satellites constructed for military use, nor for activities associated with any [[human space flight]] program. Between the years of 1996 and 2002, satellite manufacturing within the United States experienced an annual growth of 11 percent. The rest of the world experienced higher growth levels of around 13 percent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

;Ground equipment manufacturing
Operating satellites communicate via receivers and transmitters on Earth. The manufacturing of satellite [[ground station]] communication terminals (including [[VSAT]]s), mobile [[satellite telephones]], and home television receivers are a part of the ground equipment manufacturing sector. This sector grew through the latter half of the 1990s as it manufactured equipment for the satellite services sector. Between the years of 1996 and 2002 this industry saw a 14 percent annual increase.{{Citation needed|reason=A source is needed to validate this stated increase in industry growth.|date=May 2011}}

;Transponder leasing
Businesses that operate satellites often lease or sell access to their satellites to data relay and [[telecommunication]] firms. This service is often referred to as transponder leasing. Between 1996 and 2002, this industry experienced a 15 percent annual growth. The United States accounts for about 32 percent of the world’s transponder market.{{Citation needed|reason=This figure is not supported by any resources.|date=May 2011}}

== Subscription satellite services ==

In 1994, [[DirecTV]] debuted [[direct broadcast satellite]] by introducing a signal receiving dish 18inches in diameter. In 1996, [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] started in [[Malaysia]] with the launch of the [[MEASAT]] satellite. In November 1999, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act became law, and local stations were then made available in satellite channel packages, fueling the industry’s growth in the years that followed. By the end of 2000, DTH subscriptions totaled over 67 million.{{Citation needed|reason=Another figure with unsupported claims.|date=May 2011}}

[[Satellite radio]] was pioneered by [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]. XM’s first satellite was launched on March 18, 2001 and its second on May 8, 2001.&lt;ref name="kbonsor"&gt;Kevin Bonsor, [http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/satellite-radio.htm “How Satellite Radio Works,”] [[HowStuffWorks]].

==Satellite navigation==

[[File:Magellan GPS Blazer12.jpg|thumb|right|Magellan GPS receiver in a marine application.]]
A [[satellite navigation]] system is a system of [[satellite]]s that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. It allows small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]/[[elevation]]) to high precision (within a few metres) using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] by [[radio]] from [[satellite]]s. The signals also allow the electronic receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a [[Satellite navigation|global navigation satellite system]] ('''GNSS''').

==Commercial recovery of space resources ==
{{see also|Asteroid mining}}
[[File:Asteroidmining.jpg|thumb|250px|Artist's concept of asteroid mining]]
Commercial recovery of space resources is the exploitation of raw materials from [[asteroid]]s, comets and other space objects, including [[near-Earth object]]s.&lt;ref name="April 2012"&gt;{{cite news | title = Plans for asteroid mining emerge | date = 24 April 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17827347 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minerals and volatiles could be [[Mining|mined]] then used in space for [[in-situ resource utilization|in-situ utilization]] (e.g. construction materials and rocket propellant) or taken back to [[Earth]]. These include [[gold]], [[iridium]], [[silver]], [[osmium]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[rhenium]], [[rhodium]], [[ruthenium]] and [[tungsten]] for transport back to Earth; [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[manganese]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[aluminium]], and [[titanium]] for construction; water and oxygen to sustain astronauts; as well as hydrogen, ammonia, and oxygen for use as rocket propellant.

There are several commercial enterprises working in this field, including [[Planetary Resources]] and [[Deep Space Industries]].

==Regulation ==
Beyond the many technological factors that could make space commercialization more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of [[private property]], the difficulty or inability of individuals in establishing [[property rights]] in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for both human habitation and commercial development.&lt;ref name=tna2012fall/&gt;

Since the advent of [[space technology]] in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against.  In particular, the making of [[Sovereign state|national]] [[Land claim|territorial claims]] in [[outer space]] and on [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] has been specifically proscribed by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which had been, {{asof|2012|lc=y}}, ratified by all spacefaring nations.&lt;ref name="tna2012fall"&gt;{{cite journal

In November 25, 2015 President Obama signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (H.R. 2262) into law. The law recognizes the right of U.S. citizens to own space resources they obtain and encourages the commercial exploration and utilization of resources from asteroids. According to the article § 51303 of the law:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetaryresources.com/2015/11/president-obama-signs-bill-recognizing-asteroid-resource-property-rights-into-law/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=
A United States citizen engaged in commercial recovery of an asteroid resource or a space resource under this chapter shall be entitled to any asteroid resource or space resource obtained, including to possess, own, transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource obtained in accordance with applicable law, including the international obligations of the United States}}

The '''Conference of Montreal''' is an annual economic event organized by the [[International Economic Forum of the Americas]] (IEFA) since 1995.

==Mission==
The Conference of Montreal is a [[not-for-profit organization]] engaged to heightening knowledge and awareness of the issues concerning [[economic globalization]], with a particular emphasis on the relations between the Americas and other continents.&lt;ref name=lapresse&gt;[http://librairie.lapresse.ca/livres/global-economy-1406.html Global Economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference works to foster exchanges of information and to promote free discussion on major current economic issues. It also facilitates meetings between world leaders to encourage international discourse by bringing together heads of state, the private sector, international organizations and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Beauséjour, Martin. "La personnalité de la semaine : Gil Rémillard et Nicholas-Philippe Rémillard". La Presse [Montréal] June 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrif.gouv.qc.ca/en/salle-de-presse/communiques/2014/2014_06_12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ledevoir.com/economie/actualites-economiques/441807/forum-economique-international-desameriques-
la-grande-traversee-de-l-atlantique&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference brings together 200 speakers and more than 4,200 people from across the globe every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/economie/20150608-francophonie-economique-mythe-realite/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diariolasamericas.com/147_economia/3115462_la-conferencia-de-montreal-discutira-este-ano-los-cambios-tras-la-crisis-de-2008.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Conference of Montreal was founded in 1995, by [[Gil Rémillard]], at a time when the globalization of the economies was beginning to emerge at an increased rate.&lt;ref name=lapresse /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://montrealgazette.com/business/international-economic-forum-wants-to-put-montreal-on-the-map?__lsa=c696-99d6&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of communism, the success of the "[[Uruguay round]]" in 1989, the creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1994 and the beginnings of [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the world was ready to construct a global market that would benefit to every countries. A desire emerged to create an independent international forum in Montreal, to identify and discuss the impact of all these developments on the global economic system. A first conference was organized on June 20–22, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Le Cour, Rudy. "Montréal comme porte d'entrée du continent". La Presse [Montréal] June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEFA now hosts four annual events: the Conference of Montreal, the [[Toronto Global Forum]] (founded in 2007), the [[World Strategic Forum]], held in Miami (founded in 2011), as well as the Conference of Paris (founded in 2017).&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, Jeff. "Strategic Forum ends four-year run in county". The Palm Beach Post [Palm Beach] April 9, 2014 p.B6&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Conference of Montreal will celebrate its 25th Anniversary edition under the theme "''Embracing Change",'' and will reiterate its position among the most important international economic forums, connecting world leaders for twenty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;Desrosiers, Eric. "La Conference de Montréal gagne en popularité". Le Devoir [Montréal] May 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contract law in [[Saudi Arabia]]''' is governed by the conservative [[Hanbali]] school of [[Sharia Law]], which adopts a fundamentalist and literal interpretation of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Jan Michiel (2010). ''Sharia Incorporated: A Comparative Overview of the Legal Systems of Twelve Muslim Countries in Past and Present''. p. 167. {{ISBN|978-90-8728-057-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any contract that is not specifically prohibited under [[Sharia]] law is legally binding, with no discrimination against foreigners or non-Muslims.

The Hanbali school is the most liberal among the four [[Sunni]] schools with respect to the freedom of persons to contract.&lt;ref name="P. Nicholas"&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the degree of freedom of contract is governed by the prohibitions in the Quran, and two distinctive doctrines in Sharia law: ''[[riba]]'' ([[usury]]) and ''gharar'' (speculation).

Unlike other Sharia law jurisdictions, Sharia law remains [[uncodified]] in Saudi Arabia due to the strong literalist view of the Hanbali school. There is also no established case reporting in the courts. This has led to much uncertainty and variation in court decisions. Despite being the world's 11th easiest economy to do business in, Saudi Arabia ranks 140th out of 183 economies in terms of enforcement of contracts. (see below: [[#Appendix|Appendix]])

In 2007, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] initiated legal reforms to modernise the courts and codify Sharia law in Saudi Arabia. The [[ulama]], the religious body, approved a codification of Sharia law in 2010, and a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents was published on January 3, 2018. (see below: [[#Legal_Reform|Legal Reform]])

==Sources of Law in Saudi Arabia==
Saudi Arabia is principally governed by [[Sharia Law]], with royal decrees playing a complementary role.

=== Four Sources of Sharia Law ===
The Hanbali school of law acknowledges the following sources of law:

[[File:Hand written Quran in Saudi Arabia.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Hand written Quran in Saudi Arabia]]
#The Quran is a sacred book which contains the divine revelations made to the Prophet by God (Allah), and is the foundation for Sharia law.&lt;ref name ="H. Patrick Glenn"&gt;{{citation|author=H. Patrick Glenn|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|location=United States.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Quran does deal with legal matters, but instead, sets out the goals and aspirations of Muslims, and the general accepted conduct and way of living.
#The [[Sunnah|Sunna]] (meaning "habitual practice" or "trodden path"&lt;ref name = "Bryant W"&gt;{{Citation
 | last=Seaman | first=Bryant W
 | title=Islamic Law and Modern Government: Saudi Arabia Supplements the ''Shari'a'' to Regulate Development
 | journal=Columbia Journal of Transnational Law
 | volume=18 | year=1979–1980 | pages=413–481
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the other primary source of law. It contains the explanations of the Quran and records the sayings, deeds, and approved practices by the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Bryant W" /&gt;
#''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) is a secondary source of law. There are however, conflicting interpretations as to the meaning of consensus. The conservative Hanbali school prevailing in Saudi Arabia asserts that a legally binding consensus only arises from agreement of the Prophet and his Companions, and not the universal agreement of Muslim authorities today.&lt;ref name="H. Patrick Glenn" /&gt;
# ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy) is another secondary source of law. Forms of analytical reasoning are categorised as law.&lt;ref name="H. Patrick Glenn"/&gt;
Both ''ijmas'' and ''qiyas'' constitute ''[[fiqh]]'', Islamic jurisprudence based upon scholar opinions amassed over the years.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"&gt;{{citation|author=Gayle E. Hanlon|chapter=International Business Negotiations in Saudi Arabia|editor=James R Silkenat, Jeffrey M. Aresty &amp; Jacqueline Klosek eds.|title=The ABA Guide to International Business Negotiations|edition=3rd|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|year=2009|pages=851–229 of 918|isbn=978-1-60442-369-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulations (''lai'hah'') and Ordinances (''nizma'') ===
Ordinances (''nizam''), consisting of royal decrees which address modern legal issues and bureaucratic matters, is another source of law.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"/&gt; These royal decrees by the King supplement ''fiqh''.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"/&gt; Royal decrees are considered subordinate to Sharia law as only religious law is considered "law" under Sharia law.&lt;ref name="Childress"&gt;{{citation|author=Carol Lee Childress|title=Saudi-Arabian Contract Law: A Comparative Perspective|journal=St. Thomas L. F.|year=1990|page=70 of 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts will apply ''fiqh'' over ''nizam'' if the legal issue is already considered in Sharia law, or if ''nizam'' conflicts with Sharia law.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt;

Other forms of regulations (''lai'hah'') including Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars,&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub3507_1.pdf|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia|author= |date=May 2010 |work= |publisher= Latham &amp; Watkins LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt; are likewise subordinate to Sharia law.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt; While contract law is generally governed under Sharia law, many areas of modern business and commercial activities are not considered under Sharia law and are hence governed by the applicable regulations.&lt;ref name="International Lawyer"&gt;{{citation|author=Jeanne Asherman|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia: The Contemporary Application of Islamic Law|journal=International Lawyer|year=1982|pages=321–337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia also abides by international treaties, which are approved by royal decree. One such example is Royal Decree No.11, dated 16 Rajab 1414, corresponding to 30 December 1993, which declared Saudi Arabia's ascension to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Formation of Contract==

[[File:Types of contracts table.png|thumb|750 px|center|Types of contracts at sharia law.&lt;ref name="islamicfinance-102-110"&gt;{{citation|author=Frank E. Vogel and Samuel L. Hayes|title=Islamic Law and Finance Religion Risk and Return|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2006|pages=102–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A contract of sale (''bay’'') can be concluded for the exchange of anything regarded as a commodity or property (''mal'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=H. Gibb and K. Kramer|title=Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam |edition=57 |date=1961}} Marriage and employment agreements are also concluded by contract.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are certain things that are not included as ''mal'' under Sharia and therefore cannot be the subject of a sale.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"&gt;Gibb and Kramer, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; These include: pigs, alcohol, and animals not ritually slaughtered. In accordance to the [[Quran]], there are two exceptions to contract formation: the taking of interest (''riba''), and the use of speculative contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb and Kramer, p. 56. The Quran also prohibits games of chance (''maisir'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on conclusion of the contract of sale are stricter than the rules in most modern legal systems. Conclusion of the contract must take place at the same transaction as offer and acceptance.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"/&gt; Furthermore, there is a right of withdrawal of the offer even after acceptance.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"/&gt;

At [[common law]], auctions, advertisements, displays of goods on shelves, tenders and the like are treated as mere invitations to create an offer. In contrast, Sharia law recognises these as valid offers (''Ijab'') which, upon being accepted (''Qabul''), will become binding by law upon the parties involved in the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mohd Ma'sum Billah|title=Applied Islamic Law of Trade and Finance, A Selection of Contemporary Practical Issues, Third Edition|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] Asia|year=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a statement with the description and price of goods constitutes an offer, and a display of goods with the price similarly is an offer.&lt;ref&gt;Billah, p. 11 and 19. {{citation|author=Liaquat Ali Khan Niazi|title=Islamic Law of Contract|location=Lahore|year=1990|page=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, advertisers can specify that the advertisement is only an invitation to treat.&lt;ref&gt;Billah, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offer &amp; Acceptance===
[[File:Offer Table 2.png|thumb|left|280 px|As opposed to common law, many commercial actions are offers at sharia law.&lt;ref name="Billah, pp. 10-19"&gt;Billah, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the common law, offer and acceptance are among the vital ingredients of a contract in Islamic law. An offer is a proposal, which leads to an agreement when there is an acceptance of the offer. If there is an acceptance, the offeror is bound by law to perform his promise. The offeror has no right to revoke his offer after its acceptance and he must be prepared to complete his promised accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Furmston|title=Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston's Law of Contract, 12th Edition|location=London.|publisher=[[Butterworths]]|year=1991|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement of an offer has to be made in the past tense (''Sighatul-Madhi'') to be constituted as a valid offer in Sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;For example the seller saying, "I sold".&lt;/ref&gt; Making the statement in past tense signifies the seller's intention of making a valid offer which is capable of being accepted by the buyer. Once the offer has been accepted, the seller has no right to revoke his offer. If he does revoke his offer, it will be considered a breach of promise on his behalf, which is a great sin in Islam as it encourages rivalry and mischief among the people.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Quran, Chapter 2:177, 61:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike common law, Saudi Arabian law requires acceptance to be made before the parties attempting to contract physically part.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, The Maslaha (Public Interest) and 'Illa (Cause) in Islamic Law, 12 N.Y.U. J. Int'l. &amp; Pol. 213 (1979), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terms must also be stated for a Saudi Arabian contract to be enforceable. These include: the items involved, quantity, price, parties and how payment will be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J. Schacht|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law 21|year=1964|page=147.}} In contracts that involve hire and lease, the period of time must be definite.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consideration===
The concept of consideration implies the bargain, or value given in return for value received. Islamic law, unlike common law, does not require consideration.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt; A contract in Saudi Arabia is a bond between the parties and God, hence, the element of consideration is deemed superfluous.

===Defects of Consent – Vitiating Factors===

Similar to common law, defects of consent will prevent the formation of a valid agreement.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt; Vitiating factors include mistake, misrepresentation, duress&lt;ref&gt;Under the Hanbali school of Sharia law, both declared and undeclared intentions of the parties must be free from duress. The key is that duress must be justified.{{Citation

and undue influence...

== Limitations on Enforceability of Contracts ==
Not all contractual arrangements are condoned in Sharia law. Unless a term is positively allowed by revelation ("in the book of God"), it is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;"Any stipulation not in the Writ of God is void [''batil'']." This is often termed the 'Barira' ''hadith''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Sharia law rarely discusses the idea of contractual freedom outside the standard contract types.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Hamid, "Islamic Law of Contract or Contracts," ''Journal of Islamic and Comparative Law'' 3:1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it provides for situation where standard contracts can be altered or combined. There are specific prohibitions raised by other ''hadiths'', some important ones prohibiting a loan and a sale, two sales in one, and a sale of what one does not have.&lt;ref&gt;"Illicit are a loan and a sale [''salay wa-bay''], or two stipulations in a sale, or sale of what you do not have.": Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi; "The Messenger of God forbade two sales in one [''bay'atayn fi bay'a'']": Ibn Hanbal, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stipulations are divided into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Sanhuri, 3:134-172.&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Condition (''ta’liq'')||conditioning of contract on a future event
|-
|Concomitance (''iqtiran'')||varying the terms of the contract
|-
|Extension (''idafa'')||delaying the beginning of a contract until a future time
|}
If the court finds stipulation a void, the contract itself may or may not be void- results vary casuistically.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, concomitant stipulations that coincide with or contradict an entailment of the contract,&lt;ref&gt;Such as, for example, a buyer paying the price and the seller transferring full title.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a stipulation that a buyer must never resell the object, are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combinations of contracts conditioned on each other are open to many objections, because they confuse the price of the individual contracts and obstruct meting out fair remedies for breach, thereby opening a door to ''riba'' and ''gharar''. There are two major types of contracts that are prohibited in Islamic law: contracts involving usury or uncertainty.

===''Riba'' (Usury)===
The Quran forbids ''[[riba]]'' in the strongest terms.&lt;ref&gt;"Devour not usury [''riba''], doubled and re-doubled..." [3:130]. See also the Quran at 2:275-79 and 4:161.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Riba'' is an unjustified enrichment and the principle encompasses a total ban on the charging of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Childress, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usurious transactions were classified into three classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohammed|first=Noor|title=Principles of Islamic Contract Law|journal=Journal of Law and Religion|year=1988|volume=6|issue=1|pages=119|jstor=1051062|publisher=Journal of Law and Religion, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|''ribaal-fadl''||unlawful excess in exchange of counter values in a contemporaneous transaction
|-
|''riba al-nasi'a''||unlawful gain by deferring the completion of exchange of counter values
|-
| ''ribaal-jahilya''||exemplified by the lender asking the borrower at maturity date if he will settle the debt or increase it by charging interest
|}

''Riba al-fadl'' and ''riba al-nasi'a'' apply to the exchange of two precious metals (gold or silver) and four commodities (wheat, barley, dates and salt), based on the Prophet's tradition. It was further extended by analogy to the products of these six articles if their present or future exchange could have the smell or taint of ''riba''. Islamic law did not permit exchange of unequal values of these articles and by analogy to a variety of their products. These articles happened to be the basic necessities of life and were a convenient means of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Noor Mohammed, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Promises for future performance were forbidden if goods comprised these articles as the transactions were suspected to contain ''riba''.&lt;ref&gt;N.A. Saleh, ''Unlawful Gain &amp; Legitimate Profit in Islamic Law'', 12-13 (1986), p.14-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of ''riba'' has continued to be revised under the changing economic setting. By the turn of the century, the leading Islamic scholars Abduh and Rida held the view that ''riba al-Jahilya'' was forbidden but it could be deemed lawful under extreme necessity, and that ''riba al-fadl'' and ''riba al nasi'a'' are under a rebuttable presumption of prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban against interest rates has been circumvented by both parties pretending that a greater amount was lent or that the difference between loan and debt is actually a commission rate.&lt;ref&gt;N. Anderson, Law Reform in the Muslim World 6 (1976), p. 100. If the former fiction is used, the contract will reflect the greater amount, while the extra money in the second method will be looked upon as a commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gharar'' (Speculation)===
Gambling is another type of transaction condemned in the Quran.
:Intoxicants, games of chance [''maysir''], [worship of] idols, and [divination by] arrows are but an abomination, Satan's handiwork...&lt;ref&gt;Quran, 5:90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sunna takes this prohibition much further; it not only condemns gambling but also sales of ''gharar'' (peril, risk or hazard).&lt;ref&gt;The term ''gharar'' does not appear in the Quran. Etymologically related words meaning 'delusion' do appear.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Messenger of God forbade the 'sale of the pebble' [''hasah'', sale of an object chosen or determined by the throwing of a pebble] and the sale of ''gharar''.

Besides this, other transactions which are conditioned on uncertain events are also prohibited. Lack of knowledge about the existence or nonexistence of the subject matter, or concerning its quality, quantity, or date of performance, was held to trigger ''gharar''.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing refinement of the doctrine has been narrowed down to the presence or absence of uncertainty about future performance and not to the existence or non-existence of the subject matter at the time of contract. If the nonexistent article or subject matter is certain to be delivered or performed at a future date the prohibition of ''gharar'' does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 52-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies for Breach of Contract==
Rescission is allowed under specific circumstances, such as when the seller fails to perform; the merchandise is defective or the quantity incorrect; the quality of service inferior; or when unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;N. Coulson, Commercial Law in the Gulf States 9 (1984), pp. 65-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Islamic law, remedies for contract are restricted to direct and actual damages.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide" /&gt; The courts will not recognize economic loss of chance, interest, potential profits and other speculative awards that would normally might be given. Specific performance and injunctive relief are likewise generally unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Halon, p. 908.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Courts also preclude consequential damages based on anticipated profits.&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{citation|author=David J. Carl|title=Islamic Law in Saudi Arabia: What Foreign Attorneys Should Know|journal=George Washington Journal of International Law and Economics|year=1991–1992|pages=131–170 at 162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, contracts involving relationships over time such as continuous supply of goods will not attract full liability if wrongfully terminated.&lt;ref name="Carl"/&gt; Courts would only award reparations for immediate damages.&lt;ref name="Carl"/&gt;

Islamic law fixes the relationship of contracting parties to any object involved in the contract as to liability for loss or damage. A party holds the object either as a 'trustee' (''amin'') or as a 'guarantor' (''damin''). A trustee is not liable at all for injury to the object, unless shown to be in breach of trust. A ''damin'', however, bears the same risk of loss as an owner. If an object is destroyed through an act of God or force majeure, the guarantor has no recourse.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures and Prerequisites of Contract Enforcement==
Enforcing of a contract consists of three main stages:
[[File:Procedure of Contract Enforcement in Saudi Arabia.jpg|300px|thumb|Procedure of Contract Enforcement]]

=== Filing and Service ===

The plaintiff is to ask the defendant for compliance with the contract before filing his summons with the court. Before admitting a plaintiff's summons, a judge will examine it for formal requirements. The summons will be then delivered to a summoning officer for service of process on defendant.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

=== Trial and Judgment ===

The defendant files a written defense in answer to the plaintiff's claim. The judge will then set a deadline for the plaintiff to answer the defendant's answer with a written pleading. A pre-trial conference will be held where the judge will discuss procedural issues with the parties. At trial, merits of the case will be argued, and cross examination of witnesses, if any, will take place. After receiving the judgment, the plaintiff is to formally notify the defendant of the judgment. The defendant will then be given a choice to appeal before a certain deadline.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

=== Enforcement of Judgment ===

The plaintiff approaches a court enforcement office or private bailiff to request for an enforcement order. The defendant will be requested to voluntarily comply with the judgment. For contracted debt, the judge will call for a public auction for the property to be sold after the attachment of the defendant’s movable goods. The proceeds of the public auction are distributed to various creditors according to rules of priority.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

==Enforcement of Foreign Law Contracts==
Foreign law contracts are generally enforceable so long as they conform to Sharia law.&lt;ref name="ICLG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iclg.co.uk/khadmin/Publications/pdf/3834.pdf|title=The International Comparative Legal Guide to: International Arbitration 2010 |author=Alan Sfeir and Joe Tirado |year=2010 |work= |publisher= Global Legal Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus contracts deemed to be usury&lt;ref name="islamicfinance-72"&gt;{{citation|author=Frank E. Vogel and Samuel L. Hayes|title=Islamic Law and Finance Religion Risk and Return|location=Netherlands.|publisher=[[Koninklijke Brill NV]]|year=2006|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or dealing with gambling or risk&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt; would not be enforceable. Courts and judicial committees in Saudi Arabia also do not recognise the doctrine of conflict of laws.&lt;ref name="ICLG" /&gt; Hence any action based on a foreign law contract can be submitted to the courts even if there are express choice of law provisions.&lt;ref name="ICLG" /&gt;

===Enforcement of Foreign Judgments and Arbitral Awards===
The Board of Grievances, a statutory tribunal&lt;ref name="saudilegal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/19_law.html|title=Saudi Arabian Law Overview|author= |date=|work= |publisher= Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; separate from the Sharia courts, is empowered to hear requests for the enforcement of foreign judgments&lt;ref name="BOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/country-information/laws/Board_of_grievances_law.aspx|title=Law of the Board of Grievances, Royal Decree No. M/51, 17 Rajab 1402 [10 May 1982]|publisher=Information Office of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arbitral awards.&lt;ref name="saudilegal"/&gt; Article 6 of the Rules of Pleadings and Procedures of the Grievances Board provides that an applicant seeking to enforce foreign judgments or arbitral awards must prove that:&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://update.legal500.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=470&amp;Itemid=93|title=Enforcing Foreign Judgments and Foreign Arbitral Awards in Saudi Arabia|author=Alan Sfeir and Joe Tirado |date=June 2004 |work= |publisher= Legal500.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the judgment or award is not contrary to Sharia law or public policy; and
#the applicant proves reciprocity of enforcement ''ie'' that a Saudi judgment or award would be accepted and enforced in the applicant’s country.

Firstly, the judgment or award must not be contrary to Sharia law or public policy; it must not offend the Sharia principles of ''riba'' and ''gharar''. Judgments or awards involving conventional insurance, speculative loss of chance, interest and potential profits would not be recognized.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt;

The applicant must also show that a judgment or award by the Saudi Courts would be reciprocally enforced in the applicant’s country. In the past, the Board has declined to accept a legal opinion by a foreign lawyer or a letter from the UK government stating that foreign judgments would generally be enforced in the UK.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt; This second requirement applies in the absence of any bilateral or multilateral agreement relating to the reciprocal enforcement of decisions.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; Despite being a signatory to regional reciprocity agreements&lt;ref&gt;The 1983 Arab Convention on Judicial Co-operation and the 1995 Protocol on the Enforcement of Judgments Letters Rogatory, and Judicial Notices.{{cite web |url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/19_law.html|title=Saudi Arabian Law Review|author= |date=|work= |publisher= Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an international convention on the enforcement of arbitral awards,&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 following the Royal Decree No.11 dated 16 Rajab 1414. {{cite web |url=http://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub3507_1.pdf|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia|author= |date=May 2010 |work= |publisher= Latham &amp; Watkins LLP|page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision to enforce such foreign judgements or awards is subject to compliance with Sharia law and public policy.

==Legal Reform==
[[File:King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|120 px|King Abdullah has sought to implement various legal reforms since his accession to the throne.&lt;ref name="Billah, pp. 10-19"/&gt;]]

'''Edward Vassallo Hartford''' (May 28, 1870 - June 30, 1922) was the founder and President of the Hartford Suspension Company who perfected the automobile [[shock absorber]].&lt;ref name=cyclopaedia/&gt; The middle son of [[The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company|A&amp;P]] owner [[George Huntington Hartford]] and Marie Josephine Ludlum, Edward was the only son not involved in day-to-day operations of the food chain. However, starting in 1903, he was Secretary of the A&amp;P corporation and along with his brothers George and John, he was also one of the three trustees who controlled the company's stock after his father died.&lt;ref name=levinson&gt;{{cite book | last = Levinson | first = Marc | title = The Great A&amp;P and the struggle for small business in America | publisher = Hill and Wang | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-8090-9543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Hartford was married to Henrietta Guerard Pollitzer (January 4, 1881 - June 3, 1948) and had two children: Josephine Hartford O'Donnell Bryce (August 20, 1902 - June 8, 1992) and [[Huntington Hartford]] (April 18, 1911 - May 19, 2008).&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Avis | title = The Story of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company | publisher = Arcadia | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7385-1038-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Christian Scientist]], he refused to see a doctor and died at age 51.&lt;ref name=levinson /&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Gordon Bennett 1904.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The winner of the 1904 Gordon Bennett competition in Germany equipped with Truffault-Hartford shock absorbers.]]Edward was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]]. His father, George Huntington Hartford (1832–1917), owned the [[Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company]]. When Edward was eight, his father was also elected mayor of his community.  He graduated from [[Orange High School (New Jersey)|Orange High School]] and entered [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=cyclopaedia&gt;Wilson, James Grant; and Fiske, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qVQ_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA493 "Hartford, Edward Vassallo"], ''Appleton's cyclopædia of American biography, Volume 8'', p. 493 ff. D. Appleton and company, 1918. Accessed November 13, 2017. "HARTFORD Edward Vassallo, engineer and inventor, b. in Orange N. J., 28 May, 1870, son of George Huntington and Josephine (Ludlum) Hartford.... acquirement of an education in the Orange high school, Seton Academy, and Stevens Institute claimed the attention of Edward V. Hartford until he reached the age of nineteen, when, owing to poor health, he abandoned his studies and entered upon his business career in the office of The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company."&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he turned down his father's offer to join the firm and traveled for a few years in France and India.&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt;  

Edward was fascinated by early automobiles, which were simply traditional wagons or carriages with primitive engines. While the springs were adequate at the lower speeds of horse-drawn vehicles, they proved dangerous at higher speeds because they continued to bounce after hitting an uneven surface, potentially causing the vehicle to veer out of control. Early bicycles had a similar problem.&lt;ref name=cyclopaedia /&gt;

[[File:Andre Hartford friction disk shock absorber (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Truffault-Hartford shock absorber]]
In 1899, Edward was in France at a bicycle race where the winning bicycle was equipped with an early shock absorber built by J. Truffault. Hartford bought the rights to the device and perfected its design. In 1904, he established the Hartford Suspension Company and located the firm on Hudson Street in New York City. That year, a car built by [[Richard-Brasier]] equipped with Truffault-Hartford shock absorbers won the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)]] in Germany, helping to establish a reputation for the new device. In 1908, the factory was moved to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] next to the A&amp;P headquarters. Edward continued to develop new features for automobiles.  In 1910, he received a patent for an electric starter and the next year for an electric brake.&lt;ref name=cyclopaedia /&gt;

In 1901, Hartford married Henrietta Guerard Pollitzer (1881–1948), a socialite whose mother was descended from an old Charleston, South Carolina family.  Edward and Henrietta lived on Park Avenue where they were prominent in New York society. They had two children: Josephine Hartford O'Donnell Bryce (1902–1992) and [[Huntington Hartford]] (1911–2008). After Edward's company moved to Jersey City, the family moved to [[Deal, New Jersey]], a wealthy community on the shore. Edward was an exceptional violinist and active in sports, including golf, ice skating, and yachting.&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt; In 1920, he received a patent for a "scientific putter". A Christian Scientist, he refused to see a doctor and died at age 51.&lt;ref name=levinson /&gt;  

Now a wealthy widow, Henrietta moved with her children to [[Newport, Rhode Island]] where she ultimately purchased Seaverage, next to the [[Rough Point]] mansion owned by [[Doris Duke]]. In 1937, she married an Italian aristocrat, Guido Pignatelli (1900–1967), [[Prince of Belmonte]], who was only two years older than her daughter. In addition to Newport, the couple lived at "Wando Plantation", her mansion in South Carolina, in Washington, D.C., and at Melody Farm in [[Wyckoff, New Jersey]] where she died in 1948.&lt;ref name="Astor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrsastor.com/2008_05_01_archive.htm |title=Mrs. Astor and the Gilded Age |publisher= |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2011-12-26 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edward and Henrietta's granddaughter, Nuala O'Donnell, married Senator [[Claiborne Pell]] of Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt;

'''Export restrictions''',  or a '''restriction on exportation''', are limitations on the quantity of [[good (economics)|goods]] [[export]]ed to a specific country or countries by a Government.

An export restriction may be imposed:
* To prevent a shortage of goods in the domestic market because it is  more profitable to export
* To manage the effect on the domestic market of the importing country, which may otherwise impose [[Dumping (pricing policy)|antidumping duties]] on the imported goods
*As part of [[foreign policy]], for example as a component of [[trade sanction]]s
*To limit or restrict arms or dual-use items that may be used in proliferation, terrorism, or nuclear, chemical, or biological warfare.
*To limit or restrict trade to embargoed nations.

In the United States, the [[Export Administration Regulations]] are issued by the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]) for all items except munitions.  The [[Department of State]] has the responsibility of overseeing export of defense and military-related articles as per the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] or ITAR.

A '''financial centre''' is a broad term the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] define as encompassing:{{efn|name="imf"|The IMF definition, and examples, from June 2000.&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"/&gt;}} International Financial Centres (IFCs), such as [[New York City]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]]; Regional Financial Centres (RFCs), such as [[Boston]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Sydney]]; and [[Offshore Financial Centre]]s (OFCs), such as [[The Cayman Islands]], [[Dublin]], and [[Singapore]].{{efn|"Offshore" does not refer to the location of the OFC (i.e. many FSF–IMF OFCs, such as Luxembourg and Hong Kong, are located "onshore"), but to the fact that the largest users of the OFC are nonresident (i.e. the users are located "offshore").}}

IFCs, and many RFCs, are full–service financial centres with direct access to large capital pools from banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and listed capital markets, and are major [[Global city|global cities]].  OFCs, and also some RFCs, tend to specialise in tax-driven services, such as corporate tax planning [[BEPS]] tools, tax–neutral vehicles,{{efn|name=tax|''Tax–neutral'' is a term that OFCs use to describe legal structures where the OFC does not levy any taxes, duties or VAT on fund flows into, during, or exiting (e.g. no withholding taxes) the vehicle.  Major examples being the Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)]], and the Cayman Islands SPC.}} and [[shadow banking]]/[[securitization]], and can include smaller locations (e.g. Luxembourg), or city-states (e.g. Singapore). The IMF notes an overlap between RFCs and OFCs (e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore are OFCs and RFCs). Since 2010, academics consider OFCs synonymous with [[tax havens]].{{efn|This is since circa 2010, after the post 2000 [[IMF]]–[[OECD]]–[[Financial Action Task Force|FATF]] initiatives on common standards, regulatory compliance, and banking transparency, which had significantly weakened the regulatory attraction of OFCs over IFCs and RFCs.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="missing profits"/&gt;}}

==Definitions==

===FSF–IMF approach===

In April 2000, the [[Financial Stability Forum]] ("FSF"),{{efn|The FSF is a group consisting of major national financial authorities such as finance ministries, central bankers, and international financial bodies}} concerned about OFCs on global financial stability produced a report listing 42 OFCs.&lt;ref name="FSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0004b.pdf?page_moved=1|title=Report from the Working Group on Offshore Centres|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]|date=5 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2000, the IMF published a working paper on OFCs, but which also proposed a taxonomy on classifying the various types of global financial centres, which they listed as follows (with the description and examples they noted as typical of each category, also noted):&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm|title=Offshore Financial Centers: IMF Background Paper|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=23 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

| International Financial Centre ("IFC").  Described by the IMF as being large international full–service centres with advanced settlement and payments systems, supporting large domestic economies, with deep and liquid markets where both the sources and uses of funds are diverse, and where legal and regulatory frameworks are adequate to safeguard the integrity of principal–agent relationships and supervisory functions. IFCs generally borrow short–term from non–residents and lend long–term to non–residents. In terms of assets, London is the largest and most established such centre, followed by New York, the difference being that the proportion of international to domestic business is much greater in the former. Examples cited by the IMF were: London, New York and Tokyo;

| Regional Financial Center ("RFC"). The IMF noted that RFCs, like IFCs, have developed financial markets and infrastructure and intermediate funds in and out of their region, but in contrast to IFCs, have relatively small domestic economies.  Examples cited by the IMF were: Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg;

| Offshore Financial Centre ("OFC"). The IMF noted that OFCs are usually smaller, and provide more specialist services, however, OFCs still ranged from centres that provide specialist and skilled activities, attractive to major financial institutions, and more lightly regulated centres that provide services that are almost entirely tax driven, and have very limited resources to support financial intermediation. The IMF listed 46 OFCs in 2000, the largest of which was Ireland, the Caribbean (includes the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands), Hong Kong, Singapore and Luxembourg.

}}

The IMF noted that the three categories were not mutually exclusive and that various locations could fall under the definition of an OFC and an RFC, in particular (e.g. Singapore and Hong Kong were cited).&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"/&gt;  

===Rationale for OFCs===
{{see also|Offshore financial centre}}

The IMF noted that OFCs could be set up for ''legitimate purposes'' (listing various reasons), but also for what the IMF called ''dubious purposes'', citing tax evasion and money–laundering.  In 2007, the IMF produced the following definition of an OFC: ''a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy''.&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf|title=Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition|author=Ahmed Zoromé|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|quote=IMF Working Paper 07/87|date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FSF annual reports on global shadow banking use the IMF definition to track the OFCs with the largest financial centres relative to their domestic economies.&lt;ref name="FSF1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P050318-1.pdf|title=Global Shadow Banking and Monitoring Report: 2017|date=5 March 2018|quote=Jurisdictions with the largest financial systems relative to GDP (Exhibit 2–3) tend to have relatively larger OFI [or Shadow Banking] sectors: Luxembourg (at 92% of total financial assets), the Cayman Islands (85%), Ireland (76%) and the Netherlands (58%)|page=30|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers Figure 3 Network of ownership flows between countries.jpg|thumb|[[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]: Mapping the links between financial centres]] 

Progress from 2000 onwards from [[IMF]]–[[OECD]]–[[Financial Action Task Force|FATF]] initiatives on common standards, regulatory compliance, and banking transparency, has reduced the regulatory attraction of OFCs over IFCs and RFCs. Since 2010, academics considered the services of OFCs to be synonymous with [[tax havens]], and use the term OFC and tax haven interchangeably (e.g. the academic [[Tax haven#Tax haven lists|lists of tax havens]] include all the FSF–IMF OFCs).&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ie/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1716&amp;context=articles|title=Treasure Islands|page=103-125|author=[[James R.

In this paper, I will use the expression “tax haven” and “offshore financial center” interchangeably (the list of tax havens considered by Dharmapala and Hines (2009) is identical to the list of offshore financial centers considered by the Financial Stability Forum (IMF, 2000), barring minor exceptions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, a study by the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s CORPNET group, broke down the definition of an OFC into two subgroups, [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]:&lt;ref name="xx"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Javier Garcia-Bernardo|author2=Jan Fichtner|author3=Frank W. Takes|author4=Eelke M. Heemskerk | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06322-9 | volume=7 | issue=6246 | title=Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network | journal=[[Scientific Reports]], [[Nature Publishing Group]] | date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  24 Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a disproportionate amount of value disappears from the economic system (e.g. the traditional [[tax havens]]).
*  5 Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions through which a disproportionate amount of value moves toward Sink OFCs (e.g. the corporate–focused [[tax haven]]s)&lt;br&gt;(Conduits are: Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore and Ireland)

Sink OFCs rely on Conduit OFCs to re–route funds from high–tax locations using [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tax planning tools, which are encoded, and accepted, in the Conduit OFC's extensive networks of global bilateral [[tax treaties]].  Because Sink OFCs are more closely associated with traditional tax havens, they tend to have more limited treaty networks and access to global higher–tax locations.

==Rankings==

Prior to the 1960s, there is little data available to rank financial centres.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|1}} In recent years many rankings have been developed and published. Two of the most relevant are the ''Global Financial Centres Index'' and the ''Xinhua–Dow Jones International Financial Centres Development Index''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web|author1=Yoshio Okubo, Vice Chairman, Japan Securities Dealers Association|title=Comparison of Global Financial Center|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/about/pifs/symposia/japan/2014-japan/2014-japan-us-concept-papers.html|website=Harvard Law School, Program on International Financial Systems, Japan–U.S. Symposium|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major IMF OFCs===
{{see also|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}

These centres appear in all FSF–IMF lists of OFCs and, bar the Caribbean OFCs of the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda, represent all the major OFCs.  Some also appear as RFCs in various lists, particularly Hong Kong, and Singapore.  They also appear on most [[tax haven#Tax haven lists|lists of major tax havens]], and on lists of the largest [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] in the world.

* '''Amsterdam'''. Amsterdam is well known for the size of its pension fund market. It is also a centre for banking and trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The financial and business sector in the Amsterdam metropolitan area.|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/~/media/PDF/FD%20Brochure.pdf|publisher=Amsterdam Business|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amsterdam was a prominent financial centre in Europe [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815)#Merchant capitalism|in the 17th and 18th centuries]] and several of the innovations developed there were transported to London.&lt;ref name=Roberts2008 /&gt;{{rp|24}}  In June 2017, a study publilshed in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the world's largest [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFC]], a term use to describe the re-routing of fund flows to tax havens.&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/25/netherlands-and-uk-are-biggest-channels-for-corporate-tax-avoidance|title=Netherlands and UK are biggest channels for corporate tax avoidance|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/07/the-netherlands-is-worlds-biggest-conduit-to-offshore-tax-havens-research/ | title=The Netherlands is world’s biggest conduit to offshore tax havens: research|publisher=Dutch News NL| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major IMF RFCs===

In some lists, RFCs such as Paris, Frankfurt, Chicago, and Shanghai appear as IFCs, however, they do not appear in all lists.  They are certainly major RFCs.

* '''Frankfurt'''. Frankfurt attracts many foreign banks which maintain offices in the city. It is the seat of [[Deutsche Börse]], one of the leading stock exchanges and derivatives markets operators, and the [[European Central Bank]], which sets the monetary policy for the single European currency, the [[euro]]; in addition, in 2014 the European Central Bank took over [[Single Supervisory Mechanism|responsibility for banking supervision]] for the 18 countries which form the [[Eurozone]].

Trading of equities, derivatives and fixed income securities are linked through the Madrid-based electronic Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System (SIBE), handling more than 90% of all financial transactions. Madrid ranks fourth in European equities market capitalisation, and Madrid's Stock Exchange is second in terms of number of listed companies, just behind New York Stock Exchange (NYSE plus NASDAQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Documents/research-2011/The%20value%20of%20europes%20international%20financial%20centres%20to%20the%20EU%20economy.pdf|title=Value of EU's Financial Centres|author=Europe Economics|publisher=City of London Corporation and TheCityUK|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a financial centre, Madrid has extensive links with Latin America and acts as a gateway for many Latin American financial firms to access the EU banking and financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The value of Europe’s international financial centres to the EU economy|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Pages/value-europes-international-financial-centres-to-eu.aspx|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=City of London and TheCityUK|author=Europe Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

The birth of the VOC is often considered to be the official beginning of corporate-led globalization with the rise of modern corporations (multinational corporations in particular) as a highly significant socio-politico-economic force that affect human lives in every corner of the world today. As the first company to be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on an official [[stock exchange]]), the VOC was the first company to issue [[stock]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to the general public. With its pioneering features, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for modern [[corporation]]s (large-scale [[business enterprise]]s in particular). It was the first precursor to modern [[multinational corporation]]s.
* The establishment of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (or [[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser]] in Dutch), the world's first official [[stock exchange]],{{efn|The concept of the [[exchange (organized market)|bourse]] (or the [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]) was 'invented' in the medieval [[Low Countries]], most notably in predominantly Dutch-speaking cities like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]], before the birth of formal stock exchanges in the 17th century. From Flemish cities the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'börse', etc. In Britain, too, the term 'bourse' was used between 1550 and 1775, eventually giving way to the term 'royal exchange'. Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a [[stock exchange]] in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch capital markets in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose – a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by corporations – or a stock exchange as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Larry (2005).

Curott: "Business ventures with multiple shareholders became popular with ''commenda'' contracts in medieval Italy (Greif, 2006, p. 286), and Malmendier (2009) provides evidence that shareholder companies date back to ancient Rome. Yet the title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, where an active secondary market in company shares emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621. Other companies existed, but they were not as large and constituted a small portion of the stock market (Israel [1989] 1991, 109–112; Dehing and 't Hart 1997, 54; dela Vega [1688] 1996, 173)."&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch were the firsts to use a fully fledged capital market (including the [[bond market]] and stock market) to finance public companies (such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]). This was a precedent for the global [[securities market]] in its modern form. In the early 1600s the VOC established an [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|exchange in Amsterdam]] where VOC stock and bonds could be traded in a [[secondary market]]. The establishment of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] ([[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser]]) by the VOC, has long been recognized as the origin of modern-day stock exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Larry (2005). “Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company,”, in ''The Origins of Value: The Financial Innovations that Created Modern Capital Markets'', Goetzmann &amp; Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165–175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petram, Lodewijk: ''The World's First Stock Exchange: How the Amsterdam Market for Dutch East India Company Shares Became a Modern Securities Market, 1602–1700''.

''Death of a Reserve Currency'', Atlanta Fed Working Paper 2014-17&lt;/ref&gt; Lucien Gillard calls it the ''European guilder'' (''le florin européen''),&lt;ref&gt;Gillard, Lucien: ''La Banque d'Amsterdam et le florin européen au temps de la République néerlandaise, 1610-1820''.

The model of the Wisselbank as a [[state bank]] was adapted throughout Europe, including the [[Bank of Sweden]] (1668) and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).

In many respects, the 17th-century Dutch financial innovations helped shape the foundations of modern-day financial system of the world,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Steele Gordon|Gordon, John Steele]]: ''[[The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000|The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power, 1653–2000]]''. (Scribner Book Company, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0684832876}}). As [[John Steele Gordon]] (1999) noted, "Although many of the basic concepts had first appeared in Italy during the Renaissance, the Dutch, especially the citizens of the city of Amsterdam, were the real innovators. They transformed banking, stock exchanges, credit, insurance, and limited-liability corporations into a coherent financial and commercial system."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goetzmann, William N.; Rouwenhorst, K. Geert (2008). ''The History of Financial Innovation'', in ''Carbon Finance, Environmental Market Solutions to Climate Change''.

As Goetzmann &amp; Rouwenhorst (2008) noted, "The 17th and 18th centuries in the Netherlands were a remarkable time for finance. Many of the financial products or instruments that we see today emerged during a relatively short period. In particular, merchants and bankers developed what we would today call [[securitization]].

By the early 1800s, [[London]] officially replaced Amsterdam as the world's leading financial centre. In his book ''Capitals of Capital'' (2010), Youssef Cassis argues that the decline and fall of Amsterdam, as the world's foremost financial capital, was one of the dramatic events in history of [[global finance]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassis, Youssef (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

London and [[Paris]] were the world's only prominent financial centers throughout most of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Cassis2005 /&gt;{{rp|1}} After 1870, [[Berlin]] and [[New York City|New York]] grew to become major financial centres mainly serving their national economies. An array of smaller international financial centers found [[market niche]]s, such as Amsterdam, [[Brussels]], [[Zurich]], and [[Geneva]]. London remained the leading international financial center in the four decades leading up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|74–75}}&lt;ref name="Cameron &amp; Bovykin 1991" /&gt;{{rp|12–15}} Since then, London and New York have developed leading positions in different activities and some non-Western financial centres have grown in prominence, notably [[Tokyo]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].

====Rise of Asian centres====

{{See also|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}

In [[Asia]], Tokyo emerged as a major financial centre in the 1980s as the Japanese economy became one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref name=Cassis2005 /&gt;{{rp|1}} Hong Kong and Singapore developed soon after leveraging their links with London and Britain.&lt;ref name=Wojcik2011 /&gt;{{rp|10–11}}&lt;ref name=Independent20170821/&gt; In the 21st century, other centres have grown including Toronto, Sydney, Seoul and Shanghai. Dubai has become a  centre for finance in the [[Middle East]], including for [[Islamic finance]]. The rapid rise of [[India]] has enabled Mumbai to become an emerging financial centre.  Linked to the rise of these new IFCs, has seen the rise of "partner OFCs" (offshore tax-havens to which funds are routed), such as Taiwan (a major [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFC]] for Asia, and 7th largest global Sink OFC), Mauritius (a major [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFC]] for S.E Asia, especially India, and Africa, and the 9th largest global Sink OFC).

The private nationwide financial system in China was first developed by the [[Shanxi merchants]], with the creation of so-called "draft banks". The first draft bank [[Rishengchang]] was created in 1823 in [[Pingyao]]. Some large draft banks had branches in Russia, Mongolia and Japan to facilitate the international trade. Throughout the nineteenth century, the central Shanxi region became the de facto financial centres of Qing China.  With the fall of Qing Dynasty, the financial centers gradually shifted to [[Shanghai]], mainly due to its geographical location at the estuary of the Yangtze river, and the control of customs in China. After the establishment of People's Republic of China, the financial centres in China today are [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen]].

A '''general incorporation law''' allows [[corporation]]s to be formed without a [[charter]] from the [[legislature]]. It also refers to a law enabling a certain type of corporation, such as a [[railroad]], to exercise [[eminent domain]] and other special rights without a charter from the legislature.

==United States==
List of early general incorporation laws:
* [[North Carolina]], 1795 
* [[Massachusetts]], 1799
* [[New York (state)|New York]], 1811: [[Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811]]
* [[Connecticut]] in 1837.

===Railroads===
*[[Ohio]]: May 1, 1852
*[[New Jersey]]: April 2, 1873 (breaking the [[Camden and Amboy Rail Road]]'s monopoly and allowing for the [[National Railway]] project)

== United Kingdom ==
The UK required a legislative charter for incorporation until passage of the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].

'''Henry Lim Bon Liong''' is the chief executive officer of [[Sterling Paper Group of Companies]], [[S.P. Properties, Inc.]], [[SL Agritech Corporation]] and was a member of the governing council of the [[Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources Research and Development|Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry, and Natural Resources Research and Development]] (PCARRD) from 2005 to 2007. He studied at St. Jude Catholic School.

==Early life==
Born to Maria Co Chiao Ti Lim and Lim Seh Leng, he belongs to one of the migrant Chinese families in the [[Philippines]]. They lived in a one-room apartment without a toilet and they cannot speak any Tagalog. Through his father's determination, they were given Filipino citizenship. His father founded Sterling Bookbinding with Sterling Family Photo Album as its main product. This bookbinding business flourished into Sterling Paper Products Enterprises in 1961, with school and office supplies aside from photo albums as products. In 1976, Lim Seh Leng died and Henry as the eldest, took over the business.

==As an Entrepreneur==
Through Henry's management, the business expanded.  More products were introduced and retail outlets were established.

He also ventured into real estate  business, creating S.P. Properties, Inc. and the latest of which is the production of hybrid rice, through the establishment of SL Agritech Corporation in September 2006. SL Agritech Corporation aims to solve the insufficiency of rice supply in the Philippines. It is now the number one distributor of hybrid seeds throughout the Philippines and has now expanded to exporting rice to a number of countries including but not limited to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Madagascar.

'''Hossein Hedayati''' is an [[Iran]]ian [[Tycoon|business tycoon]] who most notably purchased [[Steel Azin F.C.]] and invested into [[Persepolis F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianleague.com/the-news/1-latest-news/7162-gahar-was-transformed-into-steel-azin.html |title=Gahar was transformed into Steel Azin |publisher=PersianLeague.com |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
Hedayati gained popularity among a large group of [[Football (soccer)|football]] fans in Iran, after joining the board of directors at [[Persepolis F.C.]] which saw him invest large sums of money into the Persian giants. He is also the owner of [[Steel Azin F.C.]], since 2007. While always a controversial figure for his unknown background, there has never been a doubt about his influence on Iranian football. After his takeover of [[Ekbatan FC]] he transformed a struggling [[Azadegan League]] side, into a dominant force in the [[Persian Gulf Cup]]. That team also included [[Ali Karimi]] who was often the cause of trouble at the club. Following a dispute with the then team [[CEO]], Sardar Hajilou, Ali Karimi was punished for an indefinite time. Hedayati did not want to kick him out of the club due to their friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/news/14/asia/2010/08/15/2072098/steel-azin-fc-sack-midfielder-ali-karimi-for-refusing-to Aug 15, 2010 6:00:00 PM]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually though, the player's contract was terminated, but the clubs downfall continued. The Ali Karimi ordeal was only a small issue at a club which was known for causing a media stir and six weeks before the end of the season, a team which included players like [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]] was relegated from the [[Persian Gulf Cup]].

His investments were seen as advertisement and sort of an audition, before a looming privatization of [[Persepolis F.C.]]. It never materialized though, and he soon left the board of directors, sighting "strategic differences" with fellow members. [[Steel Azin F.C.]] was later relegated from the premier league. Often dubbed as the "Abramovich of Iran", Hedayati, purchased [[Malavan F.C.]] in 2012, but gave up control before the season was over. During the same year, he made a takeover bid for [[Gahar Zagros F.C.|Gahar Zagros]], which caused for controversy, as he would become the owner of two teams in the same league. He later withdrew the offer. He is still regarded as one of the top candidates to take over [[Persepolis FC]] should it become available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7988">[[File:Localizaciones España Almería.svg|thumb|300px|Location of the province of Almeria (Spain).]]
The [[intensive agriculture]] of the [[province of Almeria]], [[Spain]], is a model of agricultural exploitation of high technical and economic yield based on the rational use of water, sanding, use of plastic [[greenhouse]]s, high technical training and high level of employment of Inputs, on the peculiar characteristics of the environment.

Although this area of Spain is sometimes known as the “market garden” of Europe, it is responsible for the hidden practice of the slave labour of thousands of migrant African migrant workers.

Another unknown fact is that for many years the discarded  plastic sheeting from the hundreds of square kilometres of greenhouses has been dumped on adjacent land. This plastic slowly breaks down into minute particles and ends up in the Mediterranean where it pollutes the waters and aquatic life and ironically gets into the human food chain.

==History==
[[File:Almeria-Invernaderos.jpg|thumb|300px|''Campo de Dalías'' satellite image and its "plastic sea" formed by greenhouses.]]
The first greenhouse was built in 1963 and the technique was extended by the ''Campo de Dalías'' or ''Poniente Almeriense'' and later by the ''Campo de Níjar'', in the east. The use of [[polyethylene]] as a substitute for glass had already been tested in the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Catalonia]] before. The plastic was spread over wooden posts or metal structures and secured by wire. The transparent plastic intensifies the heat and maintains the humidity. This allows harvests to be harvested one month earlier than in the open field and more ahead than in other regions, starting harvesting in December and allowing the plant growth of the autumn-winter plantings until March, doubling and sometimes tripling the number of harvests.

===Commercial evolution===
In February 2010 a new certification regulation of the N brand of [[AENOR]] for fruits and vegetables for fresh consumption came into force. This regulation describes the control system of the [[ISO]] 155 standard. This mark guarantees to customers that the products comply with quality protocols that include good agricultural practices, respect for the environment, traceability and social measures. The fulfillment of the norm covers almost all the requirements that the great European distribution demands to the producers of fruits and vegetables. These standards are homologated with the [[GLOBALGAP]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: “Entra en vigor un nuevo reglamento de certificación”, Redaction, February 7, 2010, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from EXTENDA (Andalusian Agency for Foreign Promotion), the value of exports of fruit and vegetables in 2012 amounted to 1,914.1 million euros, a growth of 9.7% compared to 2011. Fresh vegetables and vegetables contributed 1,665.5 million. There were 359 exporting companies, 222 regular. These sales accounted for 47.3% of the total of the autonomous community. Among the client countries are Germany, 29.7% of the total, France, 15%, the Netherlands, 13.1%, the United Kingdom, 11.3%, and Italy, 7.2%. They are followed by Poland, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. According to the same source, in the first six months of 2013 sales totaled 1,600 million euros, 14.6% more than the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: “Almería suma la mitad de exportaciones andaluzas de frutas y hortalizas frescas”, by Antonio Fernández, August 26, 2013, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January and October 2013, the province exported more than 12.8 million kilos of live plants and cut flowers, 18.4% more than in the same period of 2012. The turnover amounted to almost 18.7 million euros, 56% more. Exports of ornamental plants accounted for more than 17.8 million euros, an increase of 59% over the same period in 2012. The main buyers are France, with 59.6% of the plants, Germany, with a 14.2%, and the Netherlands, with 10.6%. They are followed by Belgium, Portugal, Italy, United Kingdom, United States and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Diario La Voz de Almería: “Francia y Holanda, principales clientes de plantas ornamentales”, Redaction, January 13, 2014, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The specialization of farmers by a single product is increasingly observed, as is the concentration of gender marketing in a few large firms. The largest companies such as Agroponiente, Unica Group, CASI, Alhóndiga La Unión, Agroiris and Vicasol account for 35% of the market share in 2015.

==Integrated pest control==
In agriculture, integrated pest management (IPM) or integrated pest control (IPC) is understood as a strategy that uses a variety of complementary methods: physical, mechanical, chemical, biological, genetic, legal and cultural for control of pests. These methods are applied in three stages: prevention, observation and application. It is an ecological method that aims to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides and minimize the impact on the environment. There is also talk about ecological pest management (EPM) and natural pest management.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency, "Pesticides and Food: What Integrated Pest Management Means."&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 2015, 60% of the area devoted to horticultural crops in the province used biological pest control techniques. The percentages are higher in some fundamental crops like pepper, 100%, and tomato, 85%. In all, some 26600 hectares of protected horticulture use these techniques, when in 2006 they were only used in about 129.

The Regional Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Andalusian Government is launching a plan (Compromiso Verde or Green Commitment) in 2016 to expand the area to 100%. For the Regional Government, this is the model that should extend the distances with traditional crops and leave a definitive patent that Almeria produces with more quality, more traceability and more food security than any:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...guarantees the quality and improves the positioning of our products in international markets, increases the profitability of farms, enhances respect for the environment and minimizes the presence of insect vectors of viruses and favors the correct management of pests."

The '''International Chamber of Commerce''' ('''ICC'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Chambre de commerce internationale'') is the largest, most representative business organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc.asp International Chamber Of Commerce (ICC) Definition]. Investopedia (2011-04-21). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Its 6 million members in over 100 countries have interests spanning every sector of private enterprise.

ICC has three main activities: rule setting, dispute resolution, and policy advocacy. Because its member companies and associations are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in countless thousands of transactions every day and have become part of international trade.

A world network of national committees in over 100 countries advocates business priorities at national and regional level. More than 3,000 experts drawn from ICC’s member companies feed their knowledge and experience into crafting the ICC stance on specific business issues.

ICC supports the work of the [[United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], and many other intergovernmental bodies, both international and regional, such as [[G20]]&lt;ref&gt;https://iccwbo.org/global-issues-trends/global-governance/g20/&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of international business. ICC was the first organization granted [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and UN Observer Status &lt;ref&gt;https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/un-general-assembly-grants-observer-status-international-chamber-commerce-historic-decision/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The International Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1919 to serve world business by promoting trade and investment, open markets for goods and services, and the free flow of capital. The organization's international secretariat was established in [[Paris]] and the ICC's [[International Court of Arbitration]] was created in 1923.

ICC's first chairman was 20th-century French [[Alexandre Ribot#Ribot's 4th Ministry, 9 June 1914 – 13 June 1914|Minister of Finance]] Etienne Clémentel. 

== Membership ==
There are two ways to become a member of ICC:&lt;ref&gt;How to join ICC?, accessed Jan 27, 2011 on {{cite web |url=http://www.iccwbo.org/id19698/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225024056/http://www.iccwbo.org/id19698/index.html |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Through affiliation with an ICC national committee or group.

2. By direct membership with the ICC International Secretariat when a national committee/group has not yet been established in the country/territory.

==Governing bodies ==

===World Council===

ICC's supreme governing body is the World Council, consisting of representatives of national committees. The World Council elects ICC’s highest officers, including the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, each of whom serves a two-year term. The Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the Honorary Chairman (the immediate past Chairman) provide the organization with high-level world leadership. They play an important role in ICC section.

===Executive Board===
Strategic direction for ICC is provided by its executive board, consisting of up to 30 business leaders and ex-officio members. It is elected by the World Council on the recommendation of the Chairmanship. Meeting three times a year, the Executive Board oversees the establishment of ICC’s strategic priorities and the implementation of its policies.

===International Secretariat===
The ICC International Secretariat, based in Paris, is the operational arm of ICC. It develops and carries out ICC’s work programme, feeding business views into intergovernmental organizations on issues that directly affect business operations. The International Secretariat is led by the Secretary General, who is appointed by the World Council.

===National Committees===
In 92 of the world’s nations, members have established formal ICC structures called national committees. In countries where there is no national committee, companies and organizations such as chambers of commerce and professional associations can become direct members.

===Finance Committee===
The Finance Committee advises the Executive Board on all financial matters. On behalf of the Executive Board, it prepares the budget and regularly reports to the board. It reviews the financial implications of ICC activities and supervises the flow of revenues and expenses of the organization.

== Dispute Resolution Services ==
ICC's administered dispute resolution services help solve difficulties in international business. ICC Arbitration is a private procedure that leads to a binding and enforceable decision.

The International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce steers ICC Arbitration and has received over 21,000 cases since its inception in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;ICC Booklet "Rules of Arbitration and Rules for a Pre-Arbitral Referee Procedure", P. 7, France 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, the Court's workload has considerably expanded.

The Court's membership has also grown and now covers 85 countries and territories. With representatives in North America, Latin and Central America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, the ICC Court has significantly increased its training activities on all continents and in all major languages used in international trade.

ICC Dispute Resolution Services exist in many forms:

*Arbitration is a flexible and efficient dispute resolution procedure leading to binding and final decisions subject to enforcement worldwide.
*Mediation is a flexible technique, conducted privately and confidentially, in which a neutral facilitator helps parties to seek a negotiated settlement of their dispute.
*Dispute boards are independent bodies designed to help resolve disagreements arising during the course of a contract.
*Expertise is a way of finding the right person to make an independent assessment on any subject relevant to business operations.
*DOCDEX provides expert decisions to resolve disputes related to documentary credits, collections and demand guarantees, incorporating ICC banking rules.

== Policy and business practices ==
ICC policies, rules and standards are prepared by specialized working bodies. Normal procedure requires policy statements first to be adopted by a commission, in consultation with national committees, and then approved by the Executive Board, before they can be regarded as official and public ICC positions.

Commissions examine major policy issues of interest to world business. Each national committee (NC) or group may appoint delegates to represent it at meetings. Officers are appointed by the Chairman and Secretary General in consultation with NCs. Meetings of commissions are normally held twice a year.

Task forces are constituted under the various commissions for a limited period to undertake specific projects and report back to their parent commission. Some task forces may include representatives of more than one commission.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/policy/id3237/index.html ICC Policy and Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice ===
In September 2011, the International Chamber of Commerce introduced the newly revised consolidated ICC Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice, along with a dedicated website, www.codescentre.com, to guide advertising and marketing professionals around the globe. This Code sets ethical standards and guidelines for businesses using today’s rapidly changing technology, tools and techniques to market products and services. Developed by experts from all sectors of industry and all regions of the world, the code’s purpose is to protect consumers by clearly setting out guidelines for responsible marketing.

The Code is structured in two main sections—General Provisions and Chapters. The General Provisions section contains fundamental principles and other broad concepts that apply to all marketing in all media. Code Chapters are detailed and apply to specific marketing areas, including: Sales Promotion, Sponsorship, Direct Marketing, Digital Media and Environmental Marketing Claim.

== World Chambers Federation ==
In 1951, ICC established the [http://www.iccwbo.org/wcf%20 World Chambers Federation] (WCF), formerly the International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce. WCF is the unique global forum uniting the worldwide network of more than 12,000 chambers of commerce and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/about-icc/organization/world-chambers-federation/ World Chambers Federation | Organization | About ICC | ICC - International Chamber of Commerce&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to facilitate the exchange of best practice and the development of new global products and services for chambers, and foster international partnerships between chambers and other stakeholders to help local businesses grow.&lt;ref&gt;World Chambers Federation introduction. USCIB, 2013 http://www.iccwbo.org/chamber-services/world-chambers-congress/about-the-congress/&lt;/ref&gt; WCF is a non-political, non-governmental body, with its membership comprising local, regional, national, bilateral and transnational chambers of commerce, as well as public-law and private-law chambers.

WCF was established by ICC and its chamber members following a resolution at the conclusion of the World Congress of Chambers of Commerce (Rome 1950). At its inaugural committee meeting held in Paris in December 1950, WCF was to be first known as the International Information Bureau of Chambers of Commerce. As its role expanded and grew during the 1960s, its name changed to become the International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce and by June 2001, it became known as the World Chambers Federation.

With a history spanning over 400 years, chambers today exist in almost every country and business community around the world. Chambers of Commerce and Industry can be defined as:
* multi-sector organizations that accept members without sectorial restrictions
* not pursuing political goals (i.e., they do not participate in elections or nominate candidates for political positions)
* acting as a voice for the business community (i.e., they advocate for business and promote legislation that is advantageous to business) 
* facilitating the role of chambers of commerce as local business support agencies
* Administering the international guarantee chain of [[ATA Carnet]]s, the Customs document allowing the duty-free and tax-free temporary import of goods 
* Improving the capacity of chambers in issuing [[certificates of origin]], including the management of an International CO chain 
* World Chambers Network – a website platform with services including a Global Chamber Directory, Business Opportunities Promotion Service ChamberTrust Business Accreditation Programme
* Chamber Professional and institutional development services

WCF also organizes the [http://www.iccwbo.org/chamber-services/world-chambers-congress/about-the-congress/ World Chambers Congress] every two years in a different region of the world. The Congress is the only international forum for chamber leaders and professionals to share best practices, exchange insights, develop networks, address the latest business issues affecting their communities, and learn about new areas of innovation from chambers around the world.

During the Congress, WCF also announces the winners of [http://www.iccwbo.org/training-and-events/competitions-and-awards/world-chamber-competition/ World Chambers Competition], the only global awards program to recognize the most innovative projects undertaken by chambers of commerce and industry from around the world.

== Training and Events ==
Staged all over the world, ICC events range from large topical conferences to training sessions for small groups. These smaller courses share ICC’s expertise on commercial arbitration and dispute resolution mechanisms as well as ICC's trade tools including Incoterms® rules, uniform customs and practice for documentary [[letter of credit]] (UCP) and international contracts.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/events/id8684/index.html ICC Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220846/http://www.iccwbo.org/events/id8684/index.html |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ICC Publications ==
ICC Publications is the publishing arm of the International Chamber of Commerce providing business with essential resources in three broad categories: ICC rules and guidelines, practical commentaries, and reference works. The content of ICC’s publications is derived from the work of ICC commissions, institutions and individual international experts.

ICC publishes mainly for international lawyers, arbitrators, [[banker]]s, traders and students  covering topics such as international banking, international trade reference and terms, law and [[arbitration]], [[counterfeiting]] and fraud and model commercial contracts. The best known publications, [[Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits]] and [[Incoterms]]®, have been translated into more than 30 languages.

ICC offers its publications not only in the traditional paper format, but also in electronic format, [[eBook]]s, on the ICC Store.

== ICC Commercial Crime Services ==

ICC Commercial Crime Services (CCS) provides the world business community with a centralized commercial crime-fighting body. It draws on the worldwide resources of its members in the fight against commercial crime on many fronts.

From its base in London, and comprising three distinct bureaux, CCS operates according to two basic principles: to prevent commercial crime and to investigate and help prosecute criminals involved in commercial crime.

The specialized divisions of CCS are:
*International Maritime Bureau
*Financial Investigation Bureau
*Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau
*FraudNet

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc-ccs.org/ Commercial Crime Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special projects and initiatives ==

===Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy===

ICC established BASCAP to take a leading role in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy.

BASCAP unites the global business community to more effectively identify and address intellectual property rights issues and petition for greater commitments by local, national and international officials in the enforcement and protection of IPR.

The work of BASCAP aims to:
*Increase both awareness and understanding of counterfeiting and piracy activities and the associated economic and social harm
*Compel government action and the allocation of resources towards improved IPR enforcement
*Create a culture change to ensure intellectual property is respected and protected

BASCAP speaks out on the damage caused by counterfeiting and piracy, including:
*Harm to the economy, loss of employment prospects
*Danger to consumer health and safety
*Loss of innovation and poor quality products
*Financial links to organized crime
*Erosion of technology transfer

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/bascap/id1127/index.html BASCAP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713212029/http://www.iccwbo.org/bascap/id1127/index.html |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business Action to Support the Information Society===

ICC set up BASIS (Business Action to Support the Information Society) in mid-2006 to
speak out on a wide range of critical issues, including:
*Internet governance matters such as data protection, privacy, security, and the technical management and coordination of the Internet
*liberalization of the telecoms market
*entrepreneurship
*innovation
*ICTs as tools for development

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/basis/ BASIS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713152255/http://www.iccwbo.org/basis/ |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICC Business World Trade Agenda===

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), in partnership with the Qatar Chamber, launched the ICC Business [http://www.iccwbo.org/global-influence/world-trade-agenda/ World Trade Agenda] initiative in March 2012 to provide private sector leadership in shaping a new multilateral trade policy agenda. The aim of this initiative is ultimately to drive World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral trade talks out of an 11-year deadlock and "beyond Doha".

The World Trade Agenda is a strong business-led initiative to bolster rules-based trade. The WTO lends its support to this initiative by engaging business to provide recommendations to advance global trade negotiations.

The World Trade Agenda aims to:
*Define multilateral trade negotiation priorities for business
*Help governments set a trade policy agenda for the 21st century that contributes to economic growth and job creation
*Find answers to the current economic crisis and drive more effective trade talks
*Set concrete recommendations to advance global trade negotiations
*Sound the alarm on protectionism
*Gather input and validation from the global business community on trade agenda priorities and recommendations for achieving a Doha victory

Since its launch, the World Trade Agenda initiative has organized consultations with CEOs and senior executives in all major regions of the world to gather input and validation of its recommendations. These business priorities were released during the ICC World Trade Agenda Summit on 22 April 2013 in Doha.

The Agreement on Trade Facilitation was finally adopted at the WTO's 9th Ministerial Conference on 7 December 2013. It was the first major agreement on trade facilitation to have been reached since the creation of the WTO.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/global-influence/world-trade-agenda About | ICC World Trade Agenda Initiative | ICC - International Chamber of Commerce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120140306/http://www.iccwbo.org/global-influence/world-trade-agenda/ |date=2012-11-20 }}. Iccwbo.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICC and the United Nations===

Since 1946, ICC has held top-level consultative status with the United Nations and a close working relationship with its specialized agencies. The current ICC Permanent Representative to the UN is Andrew Wilson. On 21 December 2016 the International Chamber of Commerce was granted Observer status by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the basis of General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/71/156)&lt;ref name="UN_ARES71156"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/156 United Nations General Assembly, Session 71, Resolution 156, '''Observer status for the International Chamber of Commerce in the General Assembly'''], accessed 25 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2016, ICC was granted Observer Status by 193 members of the UN General Assembly. ICC took up its position as Observer to the General Assembly on 1 January 2017.

== ICC Research Foundation ==

The ICC Research Foundation (ICCRF) was established in 2010 by ICC to commission independent research that contributes to public knowledge, education and debate on the benefits of global trade and investment. The research projects funded by the ICCRF and conducted by leading international researchers and organizations, contribute to the following aims: 
*Demonstrate how employment and growth flow from an expansion of international trade and investment
*Establish that a multilateral approach is particularly beneficial to that end
*Document how protectionism works against the public interest by eroding employment, sustainable growth and the market economy
*Promote a deeper understanding by policymakers, the media and the public at large of the benefits of global trade and investment

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/iccrf/id30984/index.html ICC Research Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706101245/http://www.iccwbo.org/iccrf/id30984/index.html |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC Research Foundation is governed by a board of trustees, who include Cherie Nursalim and Gerard Worms.[http://www.iccrf.org/people.html]

The report viewed Universities as enterprises not unlike a factory, and in which students were the customer.{{Fact|date=July 2009}} Concomitantly, academics were viewed less as a self-governing group seeking to expand knowledge and more as shop-floor deliverers of education, subject to performance indicators. Organizational-functions, similarly, were viewed as need dedicated managers, with transfer of these roles from academics to these managers.

'''Oscar Benjamin Cintas y Rodriguez''', (31 Mar 1887 in [[Sagua la Grande, Cuba]] &amp;ndash; 11 May 1957 in New York City, N.Y.) was a prominent [[sugar]] and [[railroad]] [[magnate]] who served as [[Cuba]]’s [[ambassador]] to the [[United States]] from 1932 until 1934.

==Career==
He was educated in London and became director of the [[Ferrocarriles de Cuba|Cuban Railroad Company]]’s [[sugar mill]]s in [[Punta Alegre]], [[Jatibonico]] and [[Jobabo]]. He was president of Railroad Equipment of Brazil and Argentina, director of the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] and the [[American Locomotive Company]] and had business interests in Europe.

===Collector===
As a patron of the arts and with the advice of the legendary [[Alfred H. Barr Jr.]], Cintas assembled a collection of [[Old Masters]] and modern paintings that was once considered among the best in [[Latin America]]. In 1940, he lent one of the pieces from the collection, [[Rembrandt]]’s ''[[Portrait of a Rabbi on a Wide Cap]]'', to the "Masterpieces of Art" exhibition at the New York [[World’s Fair]].

'''Bliss Copy'''&lt;br&gt;
Cintas also collected manuscripts and his acquisitions included the only first edition of [[Cervantes]]’ ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and the fifth and final manuscript of [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s "[[Gettysburg Address]]", once owned by the family of [[Alexander Bliss|Col. Alexander Bliss]], and known as the "[[Gettysburg Address#Bliss copy|Bliss copy]]". Cintas’ purchase of the manuscript, for $54,000, in 1949, set a record at the time for the sale of a document at a public auction. Cintas' properties were claimed by the [[Fidel Castro|Castro government]] after the Cuban Revolution in 1959, but Cintas, who died in 1957, willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, provided it was kept at the [[White House]], to where it was transferred in 1959. The manuscript, the only one to which Lincoln added his signature, is exhibited in the [[Lincoln Bedroom]] of the White House.

===Death and estate===
Before his death, Cintas entrusted the administration of his estate, including his art collection, to The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], N.A., with Ethan Alyea serving as legal counsel. With the help and encouragement of [[David Rockefeller]], Alyea named a blue ribbon board of trustees to carry out Cintas’ wishes for a foundation. Early members of the board included Theodore Rousseau (curator of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), Porter A. McCray (director of the International Program at New York’s [[Museum of Modern Art]]) and [[A. Hyatt Mayor]] (curator of prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art).

==CINTAS Foundation==
The foundation’s original name, the Cuban Art Foundation, was changed in 1962 to honor its founder. The Cintas' legacy has fostered the development of Cuban artists, promoting the professional development of these artists and the continuity of Cuban traditions in art. Cintas' foresight has resulted in more than 300 fellowships and grants to creative writers, architects, composers, visual artists and filmmakers, many of whom have later achieved national and international renown. The roster of Cintas fellows is a testament to the talent and creativity of the Cubans and their direct descendants who have live throughout the world. The Cintas Foundation is the oldest entity in the United States dedicated to the support of Cuban artists.

In addition to the fellowships, the CINTAS Foundation oversees two major art collections in the United States and sponsors exhibitions curated from these collections. The CINTAS Fellows collection is composed of works donated by the fellows in appreciation of the CINTAS fellowship. It has grown to be the largest body of Cuban art outside Cuba and continues to grow regularly.

The CINTAS Foundation awards fellowships annually to creative artists of Cuban lineage.

The CINTAS Foundation was established with funds from the estate of Cintas. CINTAS Fellowships acknowledge demonstrated creative accomplishments and encourage the development of creative artists in architecture, literature, music composition and the visual arts. Past recipients include the Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist [[Oscar Hijuelos]], the playwright [[Maria Irene Fornes]], painters Carlos Alfonzo and [[Emilio Falero]], the photographer [[Andres Serrano]], the architect [[Andrés Duany]], the poet [[Silvia Curbelo]], sculptors [[María Elena González]] and [[Rafael Consuegra]], as well as the composer [[Orlando Jacinto Garcia|Orlando Garcia]].

'''Patrick Corrigan''', [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 9 September 1932), is an Australian businessman, art collector, jazz enthusiast and philanthropist.

== Early life ==
Corrigan was born at Hangkow (now [[Hankou]], part of the city of [[Wuhan]]), central China, to British parents Leonard and Amelie (née Wolnizer) Corrigan. Leonard Corrigan worked for the shipping conglomerate [[Jardine Matheson]], one of the original Hong Kong trading houses or [[Hong (business)|Hongs]].

In 1935 the Corrigan family moved to Tientsin (now [[Tianjin]]), northern China. On 30 July 1937, Tientsin fell to Japan during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but was not occupied entirely as the Japanese continued to respect [[Concessions in Tianjin|foreign concessions]] until 1941, when the United States entered the [[Second World War]]. Following rumours of Japan's imminent entrance into the War, the local British authorities encouraged evacuation of its citizens and the Corrigan family decided to seek refuge in Australia.

Corrigan and his mother were granted a travel permit and left mainland China ahead of his father aboard the SS Fausang,&lt;ref&gt;Ship's history available at ''Clydebuilt database'', [http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=15716] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which was captured in the [[Battle of Hong Kong]] on 8 December 1941, the same day as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Corrigan and his mother subsequently spent four years in the [[Stanley Internment Camp]] during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]]. Corrigan has reflected on his life at this time: &lt;blockquote&gt;the movie ‘[[Empire of the Sun (film)|''Empire of the Sun'']]' almost duplicates my life in the camp. I was the same age as the boy … and we did things that you see in 'Empire of the Sun' … we used to go under the barbed wire and steal vegetables from the Japanese vegetable garden and come back … it's just amazing, it's like watching yourself when you watch that movie.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Early Life" paragraph 21, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Japanese surrender in 1945, they were liberated by Australian Navy [[minesweeper]] personnel. Corrigan's father had also been interred in a POW camp on mainland China, near Beijing, and was liberated after the surrender.

After the end of World War II the Australian government established the Federal [[Department of Immigration]]. The early policies of [[post-war immigration to Australia]] favoured British and Baltic nationals. In 1946, Corrigan and his mother sailed to Australia on the [[SS Tamaroa|SS ''Tamaroa'']]&lt;ref&gt;Ship's history available at ''New Zealand Maritime Index'', [http://www.nzmaritimeindex.org.nz/izsearchvessels.php?hit=1&amp;name=TAMAROA] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; along with other liberated military POWs, and the family was finally reunited.

As [[displaced person]]s the family resided in a migrant hostel&lt;ref&gt;''National Archives of Australia'', "Migrant hostels in New South Wales, 1946–78" [http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs170.aspx] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in [[St Marys, New South Wales|St Mary's, Sydney]] until their immigration paperwork was finalised. Having lost his place at Sydney's Cranbrook High School due to the war, Corrigan and his family moved initially to Springwood where he attended the [[Blue Mountains Grammar School]]. He completed his Intermediate Certificate examination&lt;ref&gt;''NSW Government: Education and Communities'', "Government Schools of NSW from 1848", [http://www.governmentschools.det.nsw.edu.au/examinations.shtm] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 at the age of 15, after which he left school to take up employment at a [[Unilever]] subsidiary.

On 19 September 1950 Corrigan joined the [[Royal Australian Naval reserve]] and served three years.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Australian Naval Reserve Certificate of Service, Official Number S/10895 (Corrigan personal papers)&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted Australian citizenship in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Australia Certificate of Registration as an Australian Citizen, dated 26 August 1960, Certificate No. C (1) 4702 (Corrigan personal papers)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Corrigan is married to Barbara Lawrence and has four children: David, Kylie, Joel (deceased 1996), Ryan, and two grandchildren.

== Business career ==
Corrigan left school in 1948 at the age of fifteen to work for a [[Unilever]] subsidiary where he was employed as a junior clerk in a freight subdivision. In a 2012 interview Corrigan reflected that he's "been stuck with it ever since".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Andrew, "At Home with Patrick Corrigan", ''The Sun-Herald'', 24 June 2012, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; His career in freight forwarding has often led to confusion with stevedore magnate Chris Corrigan, the former CEO of [[Patrick Corporation]]. They are unrelated, and when quizzed on this point Corrigan is always keen to point out that he is the "poorer one".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Andrew, "At Home with Patrick Corrigan", ''The Sun-Herald'', 24 June 2012, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Corrigan became general manager of the Sydney customs brokering firm J N Campbell Customs Pty Ltd. He remained with the company until 1967, when he established his own freight forwarding and clearance company, Corrigan's Customs Agency Pty Ltd for a $2 registration fee and a $1,000 bank loan.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Business" paragraph 1, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, Corrigan's freight forwarding and clearance companies specialised in shipping fashion, textiles and auxiliary machinery for clients such as Kolotex Pty Ltd, Hilton Pty Ltd and Mark Foys Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;''Fashion News Reel'', December 1969 – January 1970&lt;/ref&gt; as well as yachts, which reflected his personal interest in water sports. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Corrigan's companies also brokered the import/export of works of art for commercial exhibitions, as well as book and records for clients such as Hamlyn Pty Ltd, which coincided with the development of his collecting interests in these areas.

Corrigan's Customs Agency Pty Ltd changed its name to Corrigan's Express Pty Ltd in 1970, expanding its operations and profile with the opening of a large $90,000 freight clearance centre near Sydney airport&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Commercial News and Shipping List'', 24 August 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and accreditation by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), membership of which was highly vetted and usually restricted to airlines.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mirror'', 10 December 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it was reported in the press that Corrigan's successfully imported the largest ever painting to Australia – ''American Dream'', an 80 x 18&amp;nbsp;ft work by Brett Whiteley weighing 2.5 tons – for exhibition at Bonython Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Commercial News and Shipping List'', 25 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 he also co-founded the firm Express Livestock Pty Ltd, which specialised exclusively in animal cargo.&lt;ref&gt;"Staying Afloat in the Noah's Ark Business", ''Daily Commercial News and Shipping List'', 27 May 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan's Express was sold to the British conglomerate Mitchell Cotts &amp; Co Ltd in 1972 and Corrigan remained as chairman until 1983, when he was recruited to establish the local arm of Swiss company, [[Panalpina]], which specialised in forwarding and logistics services. In 1987 Panalpina became the number one IATA accredited agent in NSW.&lt;ref&gt;"The Winning Edge for Global Business Awards', ''National Business Bulletin'', October 2000, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Corrigan founded a new company, Pace Express, and became its executive chairman. In its first year the company achieved the top ranking for export freight forwarding by the IATA,&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, Mary, "Keeping Pace", ''Cargo Clan'', Vol 15, No 2, 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; which stemmed from its logistics initiatives in the fresh fruit market. In 1989 the company won the Governor of Victoria Export Awards&lt;ref&gt;''Export Victoria'', "Governor of Victoria Export Awards", {{cite web |url=http://export.business.vic.gov.au/funding-and-assistance/governor-of-victoria-export-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111053708/http://export.business.vic.gov.au/funding-and-assistance/governor-of-victoria-export-awards |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; for significant achievement by a new exporter, and was also named the Exporter of the Year for Transport and Associated Services in the Export Council of Australia's Premier's NSW Export Awards.&lt;ref&gt;''NSW Government: Trade and Investment'', "Premier's NSW Export Awards 2012", [http://www.business.nsw.gov.au/networking-and-events/awards/export-awards] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time any company had won both major awards in one year and the first time a freight forwarder had won either.&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, Mary, "Keeping Pace", ''Cargo Clan'', Vol 15, No 2, 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Pace Express was acknowledged by the IATA as being the first Australian agent to receive a settlement of more than $2 million for freight forwarding billing in a single month.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 18 February 1993, signed by IATA Director of Agency Services (Area 3), John Louis Malkowski, et al. (Corrigan personal papers)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Pace Express was acquired by the American company Air Express International and Corrigan was appointed as director.

In 1998 Corrigan joined VIP Airfreight as chairman, a company that made its mark specialising in handling perishables. In 2000 Corrigan was awarded the Export Council of Australia's prestigious Export Hero award, which recognises and congratulates "the champions of Australia's export community having contributed to building modern export enterprises and helping to further develop a uniquely Australian export culture".&lt;ref&gt;''Export Council of Australia'', "Australian Export Hero Awards", [http://www.export.org.au/eca/awards/australian-export-heroes-awards/intro] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan was chairman and co-owner of Century Freight (2006–2009).&lt;ref&gt;Century Freight company profile: [http://centurycustoms.com.au/aboutus.html] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan is chairman of UBI Logistics, which was established in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;UBI Logistics company profile: {{cite web |url=http://www.au.gotoubi.com/home.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140220051115/http://www.au.gotoubi.com/home.html |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and holds two public company non-executive directorships: Flagship Investments Ltd&lt;ref&gt;Flagship Investments Ltd company profile: [http://www.flagshipinvestments.com.au/overview.asp] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and Global Masters Fund Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Global Masters Fund Ltd company profile: {{cite web |url=http://www.globalmastersfund.com.au/About.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125094741/http://globalmastersfund.com.au/About.aspx |archivedate=25 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other business interests ===
At various periods concurrent with his business career in the freight industry, Corrigan's personal interests in art and books has led him to take on commercial ventures in these fields [also see section on art and book publishing].

During the 1980s Corrigan was a partner in the Bonython Meadmore Gallery (BMG) in Sydney and Adelaide.

From 1987 to 2002 Corrigan was a director and partner in Woollahra Art Removals, which was acquired by International Art Services. Corrigan is chairman of Corrigan's Art Express,&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan's Art Express company profile:{{cite web |url=http://corrigansartexpress.com/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228213529/http://corrigansartexpress.com/about |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; a division of UBI Logistics.

In 2012 he acquired Better Read Than Dead, a large independent bookstore in Sydney's vibrant multi-cultural neighbourhood of Newtown,&lt;ref&gt;Better Read Than Dead company profile: [http://www.betterread.com.au/discount-books/welcome-to-brtd.do] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; for which he is co-director.

== Collecting activities ==

=== Books ===
Australian art and books were the focus of Corrigan's early collecting interests, born from his shipping company's activities freighting for Bonython Galleries and Paul Hamlyn Books. Corrigan developed friendships with artists he met in the [[Art &amp; Australia]] offices of Hamlyn publisher Kevin Weldon. He began to seriously acquire works of art in the early 1970s and by late that decade Corrigan's collecting was supported by a scholarly Australian art book collection, which began with the purchase of his first book in 1974.

Corrigan's art book collection was sold to [[James Hardie|James Hardie Industries]] in 1979, and he remained a consultant to the collection for the next nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Stitz, Charles (ed.), ''Australian Book Collectors'', Bread Street Press, Bendigo, 2010, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; It became the core of a donation to the State Library of Queensland in 1988, which is now known as the James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts&lt;ref&gt;''State Library of Queensland'', "James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts",[http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/art-design/hardie] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and which has been described as "Australia's definitive fine arts collection".&lt;ref&gt;Giese, Diana, "The James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts", ''National Library of Australian News'', September 1993, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This collection includes several important 'firsts' in Australian art publishing:
* ''Australian Art'', March 1888 – first Australian art magazine
* ''A Consideration of the Art of Ernest Moffitt'' by Lionel Lindsay, 1899 – first Australian art book published
* ''Night Fall in the Ti-tree'' by Violet Teague, 1905 – first Australian art book with relief prints
* ''The Art of Frederick McCubbin'' by James MacDonald, 1916 – first Australian art book with colour plates
* ''The Art of John Kauffmann'', 1919 – first Australian art book on photography
* ''Margaret Preston, Recent paintings'', 1929 – first portfolio of Australian prints issued in a limited, signed edition. This was also the artist's own copy, with extra material

=== Lindsay Collection ===
Corrigan continues to support the State Library of Queensland with donations to the Library of Australian Fine Art, along with major donations of other material. His most notable donation was the collection of letters and manuscripts by the artist Norman Lindsay and his family, which was valued in the late 1990s at well over $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Robyn, “Norman Lindsay Unplugged”, ''Aussie Post'', December 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Lindsay Collection of Pat Corrigan, donated 1992–1997, is one of the largest donations ever made by an individual to an Australian library.&lt;ref&gt;''State Library of Queensland'', "Lindsay Collection of Pat Corrigan", [http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/art-design/lindsay] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes published and unpublished material relating to the Lindsay family and, importantly, significant material purchased from Harry Chaplin's collection,&lt;ref&gt;Stitz, Charles (ed.), ''Australian Book Collectors'', Bread Street Press, Bendigo, 2010, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; a friend and bibliographer of the family.

=== Manuscripts ===
Alongside the Lindsay Collection donation, Corrigan also collected manuscripts and other material and original works of art by other artists, which were subsequently also donated to the State Library of Queensland. These include:
* Pixie O'Harris – books, correspondence, original artworks, photographs, bookplates and ephemera
* Sidney Nolan – correspondence, photographs and news clippings
* Correspondence from Australian artists including George Lambert, J.J. Hilder, Julian Ashton, Margaret Preston
* Correspondence to bookplate collector John Gartner
* Collection of material by Christian Waller including bookplates, sketch book, ''The gates of Dawn'' with original linocut and ten proof pages
* Two cartoons for stained glass windows by Christian Waller
* Twenty photographs of Australian artists by Greg Weight
* The collection of forty-five private press books published by the Queensberry Hill Press
* Three Giuseppe Romeo artist's books

In addition, Corrigan has donated personal correspondence with artists he has supported over the years, including many of those assisted over twelve years as patron of the National Association for the Visual Arts Visual and Craft Artists' Grant Scheme. [see section on philanthropy]

===Australian exhibition catalogues===
Corrigan has also donated a major collection of Australian art exhibition catalogues, invitations and journals to the Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art. Known as ''The Patrick Corrigan Collection of Australian Exhibition Catalogues'', the collection comprises over 800 items dated 1889–2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art'', "The Patrick Corrigan Collection of Australian Exhibition Catalogues" {{cite web |url=http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/research/library/collections/special_collections/the_patrick_corrigan_collection_of_australian_exhibition_catalogues |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140328005937/http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/research/library/collections/special_collections/the_patrick_corrigan_collection_of_australian_exhibition_catalogues |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include:

* ''Roland Wakelin &amp; Thea Proctor'', Festival Exhibition, Armidale, 1964
* ''Exhibition of Pictures by Mrs E. Phillips Fox'', Anthony Hordern's Fine Art Gallery, Sydney, 1913
* ''Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings of New Guinea by Captain Ivor Hele'', Official War Artist, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, 1945
* ''Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by George W. Lambert'', The Fine Art Society's Gallery, Melbourne, 1921

=== Bookplates ===
An interest in art and books also led to Corrigan collecting artist [[bookplate]]s, which he acquired over a twenty-year period between 1975 and 1995, following the acquisition of the collection of John Lane Mullins (1857–1939), an avid enthusiast and supporter who had commissioned the first Australian pictorial bookplate.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Dictionary of Biography'',"John Lane Mullins", [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mullins-john-lane-7680] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s he acquired the bookplate collection of the late Harry Muir, founder of Adelaide's [[Wakefield Press (Australia)|Wakefield Press]].

Described as "the most comprehensive collection of bookplates by Australian artists ever amassed",&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Michael, "Hunting and Gathering … and Giving", ''LOOK'', Magazine of the Art Gallery Society of NSW, 2011, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pat Corrigan Collection of Australian Artists' Bookplates'', comprising five thousand plates and related objects, including original artwork, transitional states of the plate and original blocks, was donated to the Art Gallery of New South Wales&lt;ref&gt;''Art Gallery of New South Wales'', "Archives at the Art Gallery of NSW", [http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/research/archives/] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995, valued at $750,000.

Corrigan has also made significant bookplate donations to the National Gallery of Australia (1983), Powerhouse Museum, Sydney (2009), the State Libraries of Queensland and Victoria (which included original works of art and publications on bookplates), the Fryer Library University of Queensland (2002) and regional art galleries at Benalla (2004), Bendigo (2001), Castlemaine (1999), the Gold Coast and Lismore (2006), Maitland and MacKay (2005), Orange and Toowoomba, and New England (2001).

Corrigan also supported artists through bookplate commissions for his family. In this context, he introduced the concept of Ex Libris to many artists who would not otherwise have been represented in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "The Bookplate Artists", paragraph 2, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan's family commissions included bookplates by: Earle Backen (1927–2005), William Rubery Bennett (1893–1987), Peter Shearwin Chapman (born 1937), John Coburn (1925–2006), L. Roy Davies (1897–1979), Brian Dunlop (1938–2009), Joel Elenberg (1948–1980), Allan Allman Gamble (1907–2001), Bruce Goold (born 1948), Peter Vernon Hickey (born 1943), Robert Jacks (born 1943), Peter Kingston (born 1943), Alun Leach-Jones (born 1937), David van Nunen (born 1952), Pixie O’Harris (1903–1991), David Lloyd Preston (born 1948), Lloyd Frederic Rees (1895–1988), Irena Justina Sibley (1944–2009), Blake Lawry Twigden (born 1945), Brett Whiteley (1939–1992) and James Willem Willbrant (born 1950).

In his book on Corrigan's collections and commissions of bookplates, Robert Littlewood describes Corrigan's focus on Ex Libris bookplates as having “significant impact in the marketplace … on the aesthetic direction of contemporary bookplates; and … influenced curatorial consciousness and activity in relation to this aspect of the Book Arts”.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Philanthropy", paragraph 2, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, in particular, is borne out in a recent article published by the magazine of the National Library of Australia, which featured several of the Corrigan family's bookplates.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Reeder, Stephanie, “The intimate and idiosyncratic bookplate”, ''The National Library Magazine'', 22 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 exhibition of the New Australian Bookplate society, Corrigan was credited amongst a small and select group as rekindling Australia's interest in the art.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Mark Ferson, President, New Australian Bookplate Society, ''SHARP: [[Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing]]'', "Bookplated Old and New", [http://www.sharpweb.org/event/exhibition-new-australian-bookplate-society/] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian art and photography ===
Corrigan has collected Australian art from around 1970 when his company, Corrigan's Express, started freighting works of art and books. Through connections made at the offices of Hamlyn Books' publication Art in Australia, he met artists such as John Coburn, Brett Whiteley, Pro Hart and Neil Taylor, and collectors such as Neil Balnaves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Balnaves Foundation'', [http://www.balnavesfoundation.com/biography] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His first purchase was a Paddington street (Sydney) scene by Ric Elliot.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Alison, "Pat Corrigan, Sophisticated Beggar", ''Art Market Report'', No.12 Winter 2004,pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt; Of his approach to collecting, Corrigan has stated that he has bought works by artists and then sold them to friends for the same price, just to spread the word.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Jill, "Art of Sharing", ''LOOK'', Magazine of the Art Gallery Society of NSW, July 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan also constantly deaccessions from his collection through donations to public institutions. Since 1986 he has donated over one thousand works to more than forty-five Cultural Gift Recipients nationwide.

Artists whose works Corrigan has collected include [[Christian Thompson (artist)|Christian Thompson]], Grace Cossington Smith, Charles Blackman, Arthur Boyd, Alun Leach-Jones, Colin Lanceley, Brett Whiteley, Lloyd Rees, John Olsen, Rosalie Gascoigne, John Beard, Ben Quilty, Noel McKenna, Susan Norrie, Ken Whisson, Robert Klippel, John Coburn, Janet Laurence, Clement Meadmore, Tim Storrier, Gordon Bennett and Michael Zavros.

Corrigan's photography collection includes works by Tracey Moffatt, Bill Henson, Christian Thompson, Max Dupain, Olive Cotton, Mervyn Bishop, Harold Cazneaux, Mark Kimber, Robert McFarlane, Selina Ou, Roger Scott, Caleb Carter, Geoff Carter, Greg Weight, Jon Lewis, Graham McCarter, Lewis Morley, David Moore, Robyn Stacey, Anne Zahalka, Patricia Piccinini, Simryn Gill, Deborah Paauwe and [[Polixeni Papapetrou]].

Corrigan's enthusiasm for collecting art is paralleled with his enthusiasm for sharing it with the broader public. His total collection is estimated to be around two thousand works and at the time of publication of his third book on his Indigenous art collection (2015) he had over six hundred and fifty works on long-term loan to multiple public institutions and universities in states where he has residences. These institutions include [[Bond University]], the University of Technology, University of NSW Art &amp; Design,&lt;ref&gt;"Supporter Patrick Corrigan AM, ''UNSW Art &amp; Design'' [https://www.artdesign.unsw.edu.au/whats-on/news/patrick-corrigan-am] Retrieved 31 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and SBS Television in Sydney (NSW), as well as Monash University and [[Asialink]] in Melbourne (VIC) and the Australian National University (ACT).

Corrigan's donations to Bond University's Medical School are now being publicly showcased in The Corrigan Walk,&lt;ref&gt;''Bond University'', "The Corrigan Walk" [https://bond.edu.au/alumni-partners/community/indigenous-initiatives/corrigan-walk-art-tour] Retrieved 11 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; an on-campus guided tour of a selection of the donations and 400-strong works in the loan collection, led by indigenous students.&lt;ref&gt;Shaya Laughlin, Shaya, "Go walkabout to gaze at art", ''Gold Coast Bulletin'', 3 August 2013, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

At any given time, Corrigan also has works pending and/or already on loan to public exhibitions around the country.

== Art and book publishing ==
Corrigan's love of art and books led him to venture into publishing, in tandem with his freight business interests. He supported Richard Griffin (1937–1991), the Sydney bookseller, publisher and owner of Gryphon Press, with financial guarantees for the publication of his Private Press' limited edition art books on the work of Brett Whiteley: ''Zoo'' (1979), ''Another Way of Looking at Vincent Van Gogh'' (1983) and ''Native Rose'' (1986), which was based upon [[Ernest Giles]]'s story of his explorations in Central Australia. Each book contained an original print by the artist. His company, Southern Cross Books, also published ''Carmen'' by Prosper Mérimée, with illustrations by Lionel Lindsay (1984). He also supported Port Jackson Press for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Robert, "Business", paragraph 3, ''Bookplates for Pat Corrigan &amp; Family'', Douglas Stewart Fine Books, Melbourne, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan continues to support independent publications through sponsorship, the most recent being ''Brushes with History: Masters of Watercolour'', produced by the Australian Watercolour Institute in March 2015 to celebrate its ninetieth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Watercolour Institute'', [http://www.awi.com.au/home/index.aspx], Retrieved 25 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan's printmaking ventures date to the same period. He shared an office/studio/gallery with Storrier for three years in Sydney's Rushcutters Bay, during which time he met many leading Australian artists. Over the course of this period Corrigan published Tim Storrier's limited edition 'Time Site Suite' (1981), which was a portfolio of seven lithographs, colour photographs and mixed media works in a limited edition of sixty. Corrigan also published a suite of hand coloured etchings titled 'Birds from a Woollahra Garden' by Blake Twigden (1982), and produced four silkscreen prints and the soft ground etching, 'Bay at Northwood' (1984) by Lloyd Rees.

In a period in the late 1980s Corrigan was also part owner of Craftsman House and was instrumental in the publication of books on the work of several artists: ''Colin Lanceley'' (1987), ''Lloyd Rees, An Artist Remembers'' (1987), ''Point to Point, the Art of Tim Storrier'' (1987), ''John Coburn, Paintings'' (1988), and ''Alun Leach-Jones'' (1988).

== Philanthropy ==
In addition to major donations of art, books and material heritage collections to public institutions [see Collecting Activities section], Corrigan has donated more than one thousand works of art to over forty-five regional galleries, cultural institutions and charitable organisations across the country.

In addition, Corrigan was instrumental in the expansion of loans to the Gallery's ''Evandale Sculpture Walk'', a sculpture park on the gallery's grounds on the site of the old Evandale farm.&lt;ref&gt;Scarlett, Ken, "Beg, borrow (or steal?)", ''Australian Art Review'', November 2006 – February 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan has also applied his influence to secure philanthropic donations for [[Bond University]], which was recognised by an Honorary Doctorate conferred in 2007.

'''Student scholarships'''

Corrigan has initiated and funded many philanthropic causes to support the career possibilities of artists, musicians and Indigenous students with scholarships and grant programs.

Corrigan initiated the ''Mitchell Cotts Art Awards'', City Art Institute (now [[UNSW Art &amp; Design|College of Fine Arts]], Sydney) in 1982, which bestowed two annual awards to the value of $10–15,000 enabling young artists to continue their studies and to travel to broaden their experience.

In 1997 Corrigan inaugurated the ''Pat Corrigan Travelling Art Scholarship'' for painting students at Sydney's [[National Art School]]. The inaugural winner was Alan Jones, who referenced the importance of this support in his artist's statement for his 2013 [[Archibald Prize]] entry, a portrait of Patrick Corrigan called "Corro".&lt;ref&gt;''Art Gallery of NSW'', "Archibald Prize 2013, Alan Jones:Corro", [http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2013/29375/] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997 Corrigan has also been principal sponsor of the National Art School's annual photographic prize (the Joel Corrigan Memorial Photography Award), which is awarded to third year graduates in the medium.

Corrigan is Co-Patron of the [[National Association for the Visual Arts]] along with [[Janet Holmes à Court]] and supported an artists' grant scheme bestowed in his name from 1990–2005.&lt;ref&gt;''National Association for the Visual Arts Ltd'', "Patrons", [https://www.visualarts.net.au/nava/patrons] Retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Over this time he donated $12,500 per annum to support a program that subsidised exhibition costs for more than 1,000 emerging artists and craftspeople. In 2012/2013, an exhibition of work of art by select recipients of the grant called ''Inspiring artists: recipients of the Pat Corrigan Artists' Grant'' was held at Maitland Regional Art Gallery (NSW).&lt;ref&gt;''Inspiring artists: recipients of the Pat Corrigan Artists' Grant'', Maitland Regional Art Gallery (NSW), 2013, [http://mrag.org.au/exhibition/inspiring-artists-recipients-of-the-pat-corrigan-artists-grant/] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memorabilia'''

Corrigan's interest in sailing stimulated his interest in America's Cup [[Souvenir|memorabilia]]. Corrigan's lifelong interest in memorabilia is very broad, leading to more than 500 collections of diverse material. Most notable among these is his collection of signed photographs by famous stars, including Lauren Bacall, Sophia Loren, Mickey Rooney and Tony Curtis. This collection was donated to the Maitland Regional Art Gallery and was the subject of the exhibition ''Signed and Famous'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;''Maitland Regional Art Gallery'', "Past Exhibitions", ''Signed and Famous'', 27 January–26 February 2012, [http://mrag.org.au/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/] Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jazz'''

Corrigan's love of jazz dates to 1945, after arriving in Sydney following his release from the internment camp when he heard the radio for the first time in years. He credits getting hooked on jazz through the likes of Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman and Frank Sinatra.&lt;ref&gt;ARCH, Magazine of Bond University, QLD, Winter 2012, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; "There was a blackout on news, so when I came here I had not heard music for years ... the next thing I knew, I had a collection of [[Gramophone record|78s]]. I ended up with 7,000 of them".&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Katrina, "Mastering the Art of Collecting", ''The Financial Review'', 12 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, which was augmented by magazines such as ''[[Down Beat]]'' and ''[[Metronome Magazine|Metronome]]'', along with jazz biographies (many signed by luminaries such as Duke Ellington), was donated to the [[National Film and Sound Archive]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, known as the National Film and Sound Archive Unit of the National Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrigan stated that jazz "galvanised my love of the arts"&lt;ref&gt;''ARCH'', Magazine of Bond University, QLD, Winter 2012, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and this mix of interests found expression in philanthropic support for a series of concerts under the banner, "Jazz at the Gallery", held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales over the past five years, and the "Flights of Jazz" series of three concerts in 2002. In September and October 2013 he teamed up with Deloitte to support two concerts for the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales' "Resonate" series.&lt;ref&gt;"All that Jazz", ''LOOK'', Magazine of the Art Gallery society of NSW, August 2013, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Presidential Committee on Young Generation (PCYG)'' is an advisory board that is directly affiliated to the president of the [[Republic of Korea]]. It is led by '''Minwoo Nam, head of the Korea Venture Business Association and CEO of Dasan Networks'''.  The committee, established on July 13, 2013, advises the President on Young Generation (YG) issues such as job creation, communications with the YG, and policy making.

== Basis of the Establishment ==
Presidential decree on the establishment of the PCYG [https://archive.is/20131007062858/http://inglaw.moleg.go.kr/PS/lbicInfoR.do?dataType=LBIC&amp;lbPmtStpCd=700104&amp;lbicId=2000000017675&amp;lsCls=LS2&amp;orderLbPmtSts=&amp;orderLsCls=&amp;orderLsNm=&amp;orderMgtDt=&amp;orderOfi=&amp;orgCd=&amp;orgClsCd=OFI&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;searchAncYy=&amp;searchLsNm=&amp;selLMn=&amp;topMn=02]

== General ==
The committee was formed to strengthen communications between the government and the young generation (YG), to make policy-making processes for the YG more effective. The government has defined the YG as those aged between 19~39.  The major role of the committee, is to advise the president about policy-making issues on the YG. Having ‘Field, People, and Collective Labour’ as its main theme for the operation, the committee also takes a role as a mediator between the government departments throughout the policy-making processes related to YG issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://young.go.kr PCYG Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The PCYG has two divisions; the ''committee board'' and the ''working group''. The committee board consists of 24 members, including nineteen civilian and five governmental members. The members include young leaders with wide experience in various fields, including young entrepreneurs, international volunteers and mentoring activities.  The committee board has three sub-committees, whose titles are shown in the organizational structure on the right-hand side. The working group is divided into the two teams, ‘policy team’ and ‘communications team.’
[[File:PCYG Organization.jpg|thumb|organizational structure of the PCYG]]

== Operative Functions ==
The PCYG functions in the following three areas;
# Job creation: discovering jobs in public/private sectors, building young generation-friendly business environment, sponsoring international job searching (K-Move)
# YG Policy Development: mediating YG policy fragmented throughout the government departments, supporting government projects related to the YG
# Communications/nurturing the YG: online and offline communications, encouraging innovation, nurturing programs such as mentoring&lt;ref&gt;(Korean) 위클리 공감 No.220 (12 Aug. 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation process ===
The PCYG collects voices from the YG in various fields and discusses the raised issues. It then gathers opinions from the government departments on the issues and mediates between them to report to the president. After the reports, it monitors policy practices executed by the departments and receives feedback from them.

== Address ==
Presidential Committee on Young Generation
12th floor, KT Building, Sejong-roh 100, Jongno-gu, Seoul.

'''RFM''' is a method used for analyzing [[customer]] value. It is commonly used in [[database marketing]] and [[direct marketing]] and has received particular attention in [[retail]] and professional services industries.&lt;ref&gt;Fader, P. S., Hardie, B. G., &amp; Lee, K. L. (2005). RFM and CLV: Using iso-value curves for customer base analysis. Journal of Marketing Research, 42(4), 415-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

RFM stands for the three dimensions:
*'''R'''ecency – ''How recently did the customer purchase?''
*'''F'''requency – ''How often do they purchase?''
*'''M'''onetary Value – ''How much do they spend?''

Customer purchases may be represented by a table with columns for the customer name, date of purchase and purchase value. One approach to RFM is to assign a score for each dimension on a scale from 1 to 10. The maximum score represents the preferred behavior and a formula could be used to calculate the three scores for each customer. For example, a service-based business could use these calculations:

* Recency = the maximum of "10 – the number of months that have passed since the customer last purchased" and 1
* Frequency = the maximum of "the number of purchases by the customer in the last 12 months (with a limit of 10)" and 1
* Monetary = the highest value of all purchases by the customer expressed as a multiple of some benchmark value 

Alternatively, categories can be defined for each attribute. For instance, Recency might be broken into three categories: customers with purchases within the last 90 days; between 91 and 365 days; and longer than 365 days. Such categories may be derived from business rules or using data mining techniques to find meaningful breaks.

Once each of the attributes has appropriate categories defined, segments are created from the intersection of the values. If there were three categories for each attribute, then the resulting matrix would have twenty-seven possible combinations (one well-known commercial approach uses five bins per attributes, which yields 125 segments). Companies may also decide to collapse certain subsegments, if the gradations appear too small to be useful. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).  Identifying the most valuable RFM segments can capitalize on chance relationships in the data used for this analysis.  For this reason, it is highly recommended that another set of data be used to validate the results of the RFM segmentation process.
Advocates of this technique point out that it has the virtue of simplicity: no specialized statistical software is required, and the results are readily understood by business people. In the absence of other targeting techniques, it can provide a lift in response rates for promotions.

Customer segments containing [[weighted RFM]] scores and [[demographic]] data in the same clusters conclude stronger and more accurate [[association rules]] to understand the [[customer behavior]] and [[customer value]].&lt;ref&gt;Peiman Alipour Sarvari, Alp Ustundag, Hidayet Takci , (2016),"Performance evaluation of different customer segmentation
approaches based on RFM and demographics analysis", Kybernetes, Vol. 45 Iss 7 pp. -

==Variations==

'''RFD''' – '''Recency, Frequency, Duration''' is a modified version of RFM analysis that can be used to analyze consumer behavior of viewership/readership/surfing oriented business products. (For example, amount of time spent by surfers on [[Wikipedia]])

'''RFE''' – '''Recency, Frequency, Engagement''' is a broader version of the RFD analysis, where ''Engagement'' can be defined to include visit duration, pages per visit or other such metrics. It can be used to analyze consumer behavior of viewership/readership/surfing oriented business products. (For example, amount of time spent by surfers on Wikipedia)

'''RFM-I''' – '''Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value – Interactions''' is a version of RFM framework modified to account for recency and frequency of marketing interactions with the client (e.g. to control for possible deterring effects of very frequent advertising engagements).&lt;ref&gt;Tkachenko, Yegor. Autonomous CRM Control via CLV Approximation with Deep Reinforcement Learning in Discrete and Continuous Action Space. (April 8, 2015). arXiv.org: https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01840&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RFMTC''' – '''Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, Time, Churn rate''' an augmented RFM model proposed by I-Cheng et al. (2009). The model utilizes Bernoulli sequence in probability theory and creates formulas that calculate the probability of a customer buying at the next promotional or marketing campaign. The model has been implemented&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/it21208/RFMTC-Implementation-Using-the-CDNOW-dataset&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/it21208/RFMTC-Using-the-Blood-Transfusion-Dataset&lt;/ref&gt; by Alexandros Ioannidis for datasets such as the Blood Transfusion and CDNOW data sets.

'''Robert Goodloe Harper''' (January 1765{{spaced ndash}}January 14, 1825), a [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], was a member of the [[United States Senate]] from [[Maryland]], serving from January 1816 until his resignation in December of the same year.  He also served in the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] (1790–1795), the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[South Carolina]] (1795–1801), and in the [[Maryland State Senate]]. He is best remembered for the phrase, "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/804.html 804. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (1746–1825). Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations. 1989&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with the [[XYZ Affair]].  The town of [[Harper, Liberia]] is named after him.

== Early life ==
Harper, the fifth child and first son of Jesse Harper (1733 – ?) and Emily Diana Goodloe (1734–1788) was born near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] in January 1765 and moved with his parents to Granville, North Carolina around 1769.  He received his early education at home and later attended grammar school.  At the age of fifteen, Harper joined a volunteer corps of Cavalry and served in the [[Continental Army|American Revolutionary Army]].  He made a surveying tour through [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] in 1783, and graduated from the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) in 1785.  He studied law in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], teaching school at the same time, and was admitted to the bar in 1786.  He commenced practice in the Ninety-Sixth District of South Carolina, moving back to Charleston, S.C. in 1789.

On May 7, 1800, Harper married Catherine Carroll in Anne Arundel Co, Maryland, the daughter of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles &amp; Mary (Darnall) Carroll]].

Robert had a least 4 children with Catherine: 
**Charles Carroll Harper, m. Charlotte Hutchinson Cheffelle
**Richard Caton Harper
**Robert Goodloe Harper, Jr
**Emily Louisa Harper, m. William Clapham Pennington.

== Political career in South Carolina ==
Harper was a member of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] from 1790 until 1795, at which time he was elected from South Carolina to the [[3rd United States Congress|Third Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Alexander Gillon]].  He was reelected to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Congresses but was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1800 to the Seventh Congress, serving as a U.S Representative from February 9, 1795 to March 1801.  While in Congress, he was the chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]] in the Fifth and Sixth Congresses.  Harper was one of the managers appointed by the House of Representatives in 1798 to conduct the impeachment proceedings against [[William Blount]].

== Political career in Maryland ==
Harper moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and engaged in the practice of law. He consorted with the men of the mob riots of Baltimore against the British in June 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maryland History In Prints 1743–1900|author=Laura Rich|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[War of 1812]], attaining the rank of major general.  He assisted in organizing the Baltimore Exchange Co. in 1815 and was a member of the first board of directors.  He then became a member of the [[Maryland State Senate]], and was later elected from Maryland to the [[United States Senate]] for the term beginning March 4, 1815, serving from January 1816 until December 1816, when he resigned.  He was an unsuccessful [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1816|1816 election]]. He also received one electoral vote for Vice President in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1820|1820 election]].

== Retirement ==
Harper traveled extensively in Europe in 1819 and 1820.  He took a prominent part in the ceremonies on the occasion of [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]’s visit to Baltimore in 1824.  He died in Baltimore on January 14, 1825, and was initially interred in the family burial ground on his estate, Oakland in Roland Park, and later reburied in [[Greenmount Cemetery]] in Baltimore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12971">'''Roberto Vignati''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman who gained prominence in 2014 when it was revealed that his firm Bioart SA had been selected by the Argentinian government to act as the sole intermediary in exports of [[rice]] and [[corn]] to [[Venezuela]], and that it had made inordinate profits on the arrangement. 

Media in both countries noted that Vignati enjoyed close ties to the administration of Argentinian President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and that, prior to the export deal, which had gone into effect in 2013, his firm had been involved only in the retail sale of [[fertilizer]] and seeds.

==Early life and education==
Vignati is from the town of Arteaga in the department of Caseros, province of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]. 

''Clarín'' has stated that according to some sources, Vignati's father fought on the [[Juan Peron|Peronist]] left in the 1970, and Vignati used that fact to win the friendship of Planning Minister [[Julio De Vido]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web| title =Argentina: vinculan a hija de Chávez en escándalo de corrupción | work =Reportero 24| date =Jul 7, 2014| url =http://www.reportero24.com/2014/07/argentina-vinculan-a-hija-de-chavez-en-escandalo-de-corrupcion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Bioart SA===
Bioart SA was founded in 2009, but did not register as a grain wholesaler until November 2013. On paper, its owners were Vignati's sisters María Isabel and María Eugenia, but he was the company's public representative.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; 

Vignati traveled to [[Caracas]] in February 2013 with Julio De Vido, Argentina's Minister of Planning, with the intention of offering the use of silos owned by Marisa, a firm in Arteaga owned by Vignati's mother's family. The apparent result of the visit, however, was that Bioart became a central player in grain export deals that would attract a great deal of criticism. 

In May 2013, Argentina and Venezuela signed an agreement for the export of 80,000 tons of unprocessed rice. The governor of Entre Rios, [[Sergio Urribarri]], said at the time that the sales would be carried out by rice farmers themselves, without intermediaries.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; He promised that the price charged to Venezuela would yield a profit, but the Pan Am Post later commented that “what rice producers did not know...was that the 'profitability'...would actually be for the middlemen, and not Argentina’s rice producers.”&lt;ref name=panam&gt;{{cite web| last =Estrada| first =Marcela| title =Chávez’s Daughter Caught in Argentina’s Corruption Scandal| work =Panam Post| date =Jul 9, 2014| url =http://panampost.com/marcela-estrada/2014/07/09/chavezs-daughter-caught-in-argentinas-corruption-scandal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged “middlemen” in the report were Vignati and his siblings, whose firm, Bioart SA, was granted sole permission by the Argentinian government to export rice to Venezuela. The firm ended up exporting the grain at an approximately 30% profit.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The directors of Fedenar, the national federation of Argentinian rice producers, warned in October 2013 of Bioart's intrusion in negotiations with Venezuela for rice exports. In January 2014, Fedenar filed complaints about Bioart's involvement, to no avail, with Argentinian Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich and Agriculture Minister Carlos Casamiquela. A complaint to Argentina's Ministry of Domestic Trade, which grants export permits, also had no effect. Later in January, Fedenar appealed to Urribarri, who promised to bring up the issue with President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner; but nothing came to fruition.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Fedenar complained that Bioart was not even a rice producer, questioning how a firm founded five years ago with no rice and corn export experience could gain such a lucrative deal.&lt;ref name=panam/&gt;

In March 2014, the rice sector reacted with “astonishment” at Bioart's role in the export of rice. On June 16, 2014, 27,500 tons of rice, worth over U.S. $16 million, were shipped from the port of San Pedro.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

In accordance with agreement with the Argentinian government, Bioart also had handled the export of more than 40,000 tons of corn to Venezuela at prices that were almost 80% higher than market value. The first shipment of corn took place on February 28, 2014, only fifteen days after Vignati met with María Gabriela Chávez, the daughter of Hugo Chávez, at the Argentinian embassy in Caracas. A second corn shipment took place on April 15, 2014.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Ecuador===
Vignati was involved in an agricultural development project in [[Ecuador]] that began in September 2010 with talks involving senior officials in that country's government. Vignati's business representative in Ecuador, Gaston Duzac, told Ecuador's Minister of Production, Santiago Leon, that the initiative had been developed by Vignati's family firm Marisa, which Duzac identified as a subsidiary of Agroexportadora SA. The latter firm is officially owned by Jorge Bulgarelli, a lawyer who has longtime personal and business connections with the Vignati family. Duzac received an $800,000 loan from the Ecuadoran state bank, [[Cofiec]], for which he turned out to have no guarantees; when Ecuadoran courts began to investigate the loan, they discovered that Duzac had fled the country with the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Roberto Vignati| work =Poderopedia| url =http://www.poderopedia.org/ve/personas/Roberto_Vignati}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Escándalo en otro negocio de la empresa vinculada a De Vido| work =Agro Meat| url =http://www.agromeat.com/151852/escandalo-en-otro-negocio-de-la-empresa-vinculada-a-de-vido}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business activity==
Vignati owns several other businesses. Caisa SRL sells agricultural supplies in Cruz Alta, a town near Arteaga. Inarg SA, a silo and machinery manufacturing firm, was established in April 2014. Rosart Desarollo SA, a real-estate firm, was founded in June 2014. In Bell Ville, Vignati owns a stud farm called Juan Antonio, which has over 40 thoroughbred race horses. In addition, as of July 2014, Vignati was still managing a sports club in Arteaga.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Political activities==
In addition to having expressed “deep admiration” on social networks for Néstor and Cristina Kirchner as well as for [[Hugo Chávez]],&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Vignati participated in the 2013 presidential campaign of [[Nicolas Maduro]] of Venezuela.&lt;ref name=andes&gt;{{cite web| title =Empresa chavista ahora podrá vender 50.000 tn de maíz| work =Los Andes| date =Sep 8, 2014| url =http://www.losandes.com.ar/article/empresa-chavista-ahora-podra-vender-50-000-tn-de-maiz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of corruption==
On July 7, 2014, ''Clarín'' published a long article in which it revealed that Bioart SA, which it described as “a dubious company with ties to power,” had been exporting rice and corn from Argentina to Venezuela at intentionally inflated prices in accordance with a deal arranged by the Argentinian government. ''Clarín'' also noted the involvement in the deal of [[María Gabriela Chávez]], Julio De Vido, and Argentina's ambassador to Venezuela, [[Carlos Cheppi]]. ''Clarín quoted'' the Cámara de Industriales Arroceros de Entre Ríos, a rice-growers' group, as saying that the Bioart deal was benefiting “a few entrepreneurs” in Argentina while hurting many other Argentinians. According to ''Clarín'', the rice industry was “furious” over the deal, under which they were paid a far lower rate for rice sold to Venezuela than their counterparts in Uruguay and Brazil.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

''Clarín'''s July 7 report identified Vignati as the “visible face” of Bioart, and said that he traveled often to Venezuela, had top connections with politicians, and had experienced significant financial gain.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;  

Clarín's revelations attracted widespread attention. De Vido rejected all accusations of corruption, denying that Bioart S.A or any Vignati family members had any business connections to him. He continued also denying any connection to the Venezuelan government.&lt;ref name=panam/&gt;
 
The Spanish daily ''El Mundo'' reported that María Gabriela Chávez, owing to her apparent role in arranging the Bioart rice deal, had been dubbed the “queen of rice” on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Las redes sociales bautizan a la hija de Chávez como la 'reina del arroz'| work =El Mundo| date =Jul 16, 2014| url =http://www.elmundo.es/america/2014/07/16/53c6712722601d1b7a8b4583.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Clarín'' reported on July 28, 2014, that although the selection of Bioart as the sole intermediary in the sale of rice to Venezuela could be considered an instance of anti-competitive practices, as defined by the National Commission for Protection of Competition (CNDC), that organization was not likely to criticize the arrangement, because the president of the CNDC, [[Ricardo Napolitani]], is a close friend of Vignati's and has been referred to as an obedient servant of the Kirchner dynasty. Indeed, far from criticizing Vignati, Napolitani was his “protector,” ''Clarín'' was told by one source. Clarín also noted links between Vignati and other individuals in the Kirchner circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Longoni| first =Matias| title =Negocios con Venezuela: señalan a un abogado vinculado a Zannini| work =Clarin| url =http://www.clarin.com/edicion-impresa/Negocios-Venezuela-senalan-vinculado-Zannini_0_1183081693.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption charges===
In mid July 2014, opposition Venezuelan legislators [[Abelardo Díaz]] and [[Homero Ruíz]] filed corruption and fraud charges with the Public Prosecutor of Caracas in connection with Vignati's inflated prices.&lt;ref name=andes/&gt; They presented the Prosecutor with evidence of “unbridled corruption” and influence peddling in Vignati's sale not only of rice and corn but also of agricultural machinery, power plants, and black beans to Venezuela. The legislators pointed out that Bioart had only five employees in 2012 and that, until its role in grain sales to Venezuela, had officially been involved only in the retail sale of fertilizer and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Consignaran nuevas evidencias de corrupción en la importación de alimentos desde Argentina| work =La Nacion| date =Jul 18, 2014| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ve/politica/consignaran-nuevas-evidencias-de-corrupcion-en-la-importacion-de-alimentos-desde-argentina/| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141205232445/http://www.lanacion.com.ve/politica/consignaran-nuevas-evidencias-de-corrupcion-en-la-importacion-de-alimentos-desde-argentina/| archivedate =2014-12-05| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislators also asked the prosecutor to investigate María Gabriela Chávez and former Food Minister [[Felix Osorio]] and to ask for Cheppi to be recalled as ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Vinagradoff| first =Ludmila| title =En Venezuela piden investigar sospechosas ventas de arroz| work =Clarin| date =Jul 10, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/Venezuela-investigar-sospechosas-ventas-arroz_0_1172882817.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2014, ''Clarín'' reported that Vignati was not only exporting rice and corn to Venezuela at highly inflated prices, but had also acted as an intermediary in the export of agricultural machinery from Argentina to Venezuela, via Bioart SA and another firm, Acoplados El Grillo. ''Clarín'' noted that El Grillo, based in Arrecifes, was officially owned by Jorge Bulgarelli, the lawyer of María Eugenia Vignati, and that Roberto Vignati had earlier been involved with Bulgarelli in his ultimately scandalous effort to do business in Ecuador. ''Clarín'' also pointed out that Ricardo Rodriguez Miranda, president of Pedro Camejo, a company created by Chávez in 2007 to further Venezuela's agricultural mechanization, had known Vignati since 2008, when Rodriguez had worked for another Venezuela state company, Legumes Alba SA, and had approved contracts with Marisa, the silo firm owned by Vignati's mother's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Longoni| first =Matias| title =De arroz a maquinaria agrícola: negocios turbios con Venezuela| work =Clarin| date =Jul 28, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/maquinaria-agricola-negocios-turbios-Venezuela_0_1183681668.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirchner ties===
On September 8, 2014, ''Los Andes'' reported that three people who knew Roberto Vignati said he had been awarded the role as grain-sales intermediary due to his close family ties with the Kirchners. ''Los Andes'' further noted that despite the controversy, Bioart had received “official permission to export another boatload of corn” to Venezuela. The precise amount of the new shipment would be 46,957 tons; the price was not made public.&lt;ref name=andes/&gt;

'''Roy Villareal Señeres''' (July 6, 1947 – February 8, 2016) was a Filipino statesman and diplomat who [[Roy Señeres presidential campaign, 2016|initially ran]] in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 Philippine presidential election]] under the [[Partido ng Manggagawa at Magsasaka]] party before withdrawing on February 5, 2016, three days before his death. Señeres was elected as a member of the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] representing the OFW Family Club party-list in the 2013 general elections. He is the father of former congressman [[Christian Señeres]].

==Biography==
Roy Señeres was born on July 6, 1947 in [[Mambusao]], [[Capiz]] to Federico Señeres and Lourdes Villareal. They formerly resided in the [[Compostela Valley]] and [[Davao del Norte]], but eventually moved to [[Butuan]]. Roy studied at the Primary Butuan Elementary School, Butuan Central Elementary School, and Agusan National High School. He later earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] in 1967 and a [[Bachelor of Laws]] at [[San Beda College]] in 1971. He passed the [[bar exam]] the same year.&lt;ref name= "coffee" &gt;
[http://business.inquirer.net/51989/roy-v-seneres-the-envoy-is-a-coffee-magnate Roy Señeres: The envoy is a "coffee magnate"], ''[[The Philippine Daily Inquirer]].'' March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a columnist of the tabloid, [[Pilipino Star Ngayon]]. His column is entitled ''Amba's Briefs''.

==Political career==
Señeres chaired the [[National Labor Relations Commission (Philippines)|National Labor Relations Commission]] of the [[Department of Labor and Employment]] from 2002 to 2005. During the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections, 2013|2013 elections]], he won a seat in the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] as the representative of the OFW Family Club party-list.&lt;ref name= "coffee" /&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
He served as a labor attaché in [[Abu Dhabi]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] from 1983 to 1989. During his tenure as a labor attaché, his residence served as a refuge for [[Overseas Filipino Workers]] (OFW) who fled from their employers. This would lead to the establishment of the first Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) center in the Emirati city.&lt;ref name=kalyeserye&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamora|first1=Fe|title=Señeres uses ‘Kalyeserye’ style in campaign|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/746265/seneres-uses-kalyeserye-style-in-campaign|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Señeres was instrumental in the handling of the case of [[Sarah Balabagan]], an OFW who was on death row in the [[UAE]] for stabbing her male employer. The OFW justified her deed as an act of self-defence against rape. Through his reported connections with the [[Al Nahyan family|royal family of Abu Dhabi]], he helped secure a pardon for the migrant worker, having convinced the UAE authorities that Balabagan was only 15 years old and not 22 as indicated in her falsified passport.&lt;ref name=kalyeserye/&gt;

Señeres first bared his intention to run for the Philippine Presidency on October 20, 2014, during the launch of his Respect our Security of Employment (ROSE) movement in [[Butuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/10/20/se-eres-bares-presidential-plans/|title = Señeres bares presidential plans|work = Manila Standard Today|first = Alvin T.|last = Guanzon|date = 2014-10-20|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was mostly involved in labor issues having been an Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates overseeing the plight of [[Overseas Filipino Workers]] in the gulf state including the case of [[Sarah Balabagan]]. He was also the chairman of [[National Labor Relations Commission (Philippines)|National Labor Relations Commission]].

Señeres' bid was the subject of humor during meetings in the Philippine House of Representatives, as it was viewed as a "stunt" by fellow congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seneres' presidential bid, a center of jokes|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fil&amp;sl=tl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abante.com.ph%2Fnews%2Fnat%2F35840%2Fpagtakbong-president-ni-se-eres-sentro-ng-biruan.html|website=Abante.com (Translated)|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Señeres was chided that he needed first to run a serious nationwide campaign (i.e. senatorial) to have a chance of winning the Philippine presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pagtakbong president ni Señeres, sentro ng biruan (In Filipino)|url=http://www.abante.com.ph/news/nat/35840/pagtakbong-president-ni-se-eres-sentro-ng-biruan.html|website=Abante|accessdate=October 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010015930/http://www.abante.com.ph/news/nat/35840/pagtakbong-president-ni-se-eres-sentro-ng-biruan.html|archivedate=October 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Señeres subsequently expressed his hope that he would not be declared a "[[nuisance candidate]]" by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Comelec]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/10/08/1508519/ofw-party-list-rep-run-president?nomobile=1 OFW party-list rep to run for president], ''[[Philippine Star]]''. October 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Señeres expressed the possibility that the then-incumbent [[Davao City]] mayor [[Rodrigo Duterte]] would be his substitute candidate should Duterte become a [[Consistent life ethic|pro-life advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/545866/news/nation/seneres-open-to-allowing-duterte-as-substitute-candidate|title=Señeres open to allowing Duterte as substitute candidate|publisher=GMA News Online|last=Archangel|first=Xianne|date=25 November 2015|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Señeres later refused to substitute for Duterte and criticized the latter's inevitable decision to pursue the presidency, and claimed that Duterte should have endorsed and supported him instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seneres not giving way to Duterte|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/11/26/1526039/seneres-not-giving-way-duterte|website=Inquirer|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2015, he launched the National Headquarters of the [[Partido ng Manggagawa at Magsasaka]] for his presidential campaign in [[Las Piñas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/seneres2016/photos/a.130872340607643.1073741828.123027141392163/141043779590499/?type=3&amp;theaterhttps://www.facebook.com/seneres2016/photos/a.130872340607643.1073741828.123027141392163/141043779590499/?type=3&amp;theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Señeres said that he was neither expecting nor soliciting campaign resources from big business firms. He noted that other candidates were using private jets and helicopters owned by mall owners, and claimed that those candidates became beholden to those who provided them such transport.&lt;ref name=kalyeserye&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamora|first1=Fe|title=Señeres uses ‘Kalyeserye’ style in campaign|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/746265/seneres-uses-kalyeserye-style-in-campaign|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his campaign method which he dubbed as a ''[[Kalyeserye]]'' style of approach, Señeres organized small meetings in streets and publicly accessible places such as parking lots. He said that the primary audience for his campaign were contractual employees of big shopping malls.&lt;ref name=kalyeserye/&gt;

Despite these initiatives, however, citing a failing health condition due to his long-standing bout with diabetes, Señeres finally decided to withdraw his presidential bid on February 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/761927/roy-seneres-withdraws-from-presidential-race|title=Roy Señeres withdraws from presidential race|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=February 5, 2016|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign political positions===
====Labor====
Señeres campaigned against [[Temporary work|contractualization]] which he described as illegal under the [[Labor Code of the Philippines|Labor Code]]. He went further to say that major shopping malls were those mostly responsible for the practice of contractualization.&lt;ref name=urged&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential bet Señeres urges business leaders to stop contractualization|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/544038/news/nation/presidential-bet-seneres-urges-business-leaders-to-stop-contractualization|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=GMA News|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that contractuals do not receive labor benefits and neither are given security of tenure. In the context of contractual workers employed in shopping malls, he argued that billions of pesos that would have been given to them as benefits (such as the [[13th month pay]]) are utilized by their employers to build more malls in the country and abroad.&lt;ref name=kalyeserye/&gt;

Alleging that the government is avoiding the issue, he said that he decided to run for president because he can't make executive orders if he stays in Congress, adding that he would direct the [[Department of Labor and Employment]] to implement the law against contractualization if he is elected.&lt;ref name=urged/&gt;

He promised [[permanent employment]] to both workers in the private and government sectors.&lt;ref name=kalyeserye/&gt;

====Capital punishment====
Señeres cast himself as a "pro-life" candidate, disagreeing with then-Presidential candidate [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s opinion that drug lords and syndicate minions deserve the death penalty, which the former described as "pro-death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frialde|first1=Mike|last2=Calica|first2=Aurea|last3=Alquitran|first3=Non|title=Señeres not giving way to Duterte|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/11/26/1526039/seneres-not-giving-way-duterte|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rodrigo Duterte====
Señeres was critical of Duterte, stating "irreconcilable differences" with the latter. He described himself as "pro-life" and diametrically described Duterte as "pro-death". However, it was reported by the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' that two Supreme Court justices, [[Jose Catral Mendoza]] and Bienvenido Reyes, pressured Señeres to withdraw from the presidential election in favor of Duterte in a meeting of fraternity brothers in [[Pasig]] on December 4, 2015. The four are part of the [[Lex Talionis]] fraternity which was founded in [[San Beda College]]. Seneres denied the newspaper report a week later, saying that he discussed other matters with the justices, and that two other lawyers in attendance were those who offered the possibility of Duterte substituting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roy Señeres denies backing out of presidential race for Duterte|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/746042/roy-seneres-denies-backing-out-of-presidential-race-for-duterte|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
In October 2015, Señeres revealed that he would vote for either [[Grace Poe]] or [[Miriam Defensor-Santiago]], his presidential competitors, rather than for himself, to "bring back the 'old custom' of [[chivalry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chivalry’s not dead: Señeres picks Poe, Miriam over self for president|url=http://politics.com.ph/chivalrys-not-dead-seneres-picks-poe-miriam-over-self-for-president-heres-why/|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=Politiko|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Shortly after withdrawing his bid for presidency due to health reasons, Señeres suffered a [[cardiac arrest]] and was admitted to the [[intensive care unit]] of the [[St. Luke's Medical Center]] in [[Taguig]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seneres dies of cardiac arrest|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/v1/02/08/16/seneres-dies-of-cardiac-arrest|accessdate=February 8, 2016|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]]|date=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which according to his sister-in-law was triggered by his diabetes. On February 8, 2016, in an interview with [[DZMM]], his eldest son RJ said that Señeres died from his cardiac arrest that morning while at the intensive care unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hegina|first1=Aries Joseph|last2=de Jesus|first2=Totel|title=Roy Señeres Sr.; 68|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/762518/roy-seneres-68|accessdate=February 8, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Señeres was 68 years old and was survived by his wife and their six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roy Señeres dies of cardiac arrest|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/02/08/Roy-Se%C3%B1eres-dies-of-cardiac-arrest.html|accessdate=February 8, 2016|work=[[CNN Philippines]]|publisher=[[Nine Media Corporation]]|date=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Señeres withdrew from the presidential race. However his certificate of withdrawal was not accepted since the law mandates that the candidate must file the document personally. Señeres died shortly after he backed out from the elections. In case of death, substitution is allowed provided that a member of the same party of and has the same surname of the candidate concerned.&lt;ref name="pmpsub"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Depasupil|first1=Wiliam|title=PMP can name substitute for Señeres|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/pmp-can-name-substitute-for-seneres/243908/|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=The Manila Times|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2016, Señeres daughter, Hannah filed a motion to the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] stating that he would not be substituted saying that it was among of his last wishes. Señeres was also said to refuse to endorse any of the five remaining presidential candidates. On the same day, an earlier motion was filed by Partido ng Manggagawa at Magsasaka to declare Señeres' presidential candidate slot vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Señeres's last wish: No substitute candidate|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/02/09/1551336/seneress-last-wish-no-substitute-candidate|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apolonia Comia-Soguilon, a lawyer and member of the party since 1995 was touted by Señeres' party to be Señeres' substitute candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Señeres' party to field nuisance candidate as presidential bet substitute|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/02/09/Comelec-ballot-printing-Roy-Seneres-substitute-Apolonia-Soguilon.html|accessdate=10 February 2016|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married to Minnie Seneres with 7 children: Jay Thomas, Christian, Roy Jr. (RJ), Monique, Hannah, Hazel, Christopher. RJ and Hannah are the first and second nominees of OFW Family Club party-list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/uploads/Archives/RegularElections/2016NLE/Resolutions/res10061.pdf|title=Resolution No. 10061|publisher=''[[Commission on Elections]]''|accessdate=February 24, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307131014/http://www.comelec.gov.ph/uploads/Archives/RegularElections/2016NLE/Resolutions/res10061.pdf|archivedate=March 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5190">The '''Second Company Law Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32012L0030:EN:NOT 2012/30/EU] (sometimes also called the "Capital Directive") is a [[European Union Directive]] concerning the capital requirements of public companies that operating within the [[European Union]]. A number of its provisions have become increasingly controversial since its enactment in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31977L0091:EN:NOT 77/91/EEC]&lt;/ref&gt; as many rules for the [[Capital maintenance|maintenance and alteration of capital]] have been abandoned within EU member states, particularly regarding the use of [[minimum capital]] (currently set at €25,000), and the accounting concept of nominal share value. Nevertheless, a large number of its rules are still seen as essential for the protection of creditors, to attempt to forestall insolvency.

*art 9, shares should be paid up to at least 25% of their nominal value
*arts 10-13, if shares are bought with assets, rather than cash, they must be independently valued
*art 17, distributions below subscribed capital not allowed
*art 18, shareholders must return money if the must have known of an infringement
*art 19, a meeting must be called if there is a serious capital loss

(2) "Member States may decide not to apply the first sentence of point (a) of Article 21(1) and Articles 34, 35, 40, 41, 42 and 43 to companies incorporated under a special law which issue both capital shares and workers' shares, the latter being issued to the company's employees as a body, who are represented at general meetings of shareholders by delegates having the right to vote."
*art 46, principle of equal treatment of shareholders
*arts 47-50, final transitional and temporal provisions

==Court of Justice decisions==
The Directives provisions on freedom of establishment had determined that minimum capital was a disproportionate means to achieve the aim of protecting creditors. These decisions have only been made in relation to national laws regarding private companies, and not yet the EU Directive itself. It is unclear to what extent it would be regarded as compatible with the TFEU.

'''Sociedade Anónima Desportiva''' ("Public limited sports company") is a special type of [[public limited company]] ([[S.A. (corporation)|SA]]) in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decreto Lei nº 10/ 2013, 25 January|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01800/0050500509.pdf|work=Official publisher of Assembly Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decreto Lei 67/97, 3 of April|url=http://www.dre.pt/pdf1s/1997/04/078A00/14891493.pdf|work=Official publisher of Assembly Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sociedades desportivas|url=http://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Paginas/Desporto_Sociedadesdesportivas.aspx|work=parlamento.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new legal status was introduced in the early 1990s to improve financial management and transparency in [[sports clubs]]. Many Portuguese [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs add the suffix '''S.A.D.''' to the end of their official name.

==Early life and education==
Suzy Welch was born Suzanne Spring in 1959 to parents Phyllis and Bernard Spring in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5976/index2.html |title=If You Knew Suzy |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2002-05-06 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1903597/bio|title=Suzy Welch|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; She was primarily raised in New York and New England. Welch attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Harvard]] and [[Radcliffe College]], and [[Harvard Business School]], from which she graduated as a [[Baker Scholar]], in the top five percent of her class.

==Career==
Welch started her career as a reporter with the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' and then with the [[Associated Press]]. After business school, she worked for several years at [[Bain &amp; Company]], a [[management consulting]] firm based in [[Boston]]. She was later named editor-in-chief of the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''. She has written a novel, and authored and edited numerous books and articles dealing with leadership, organizational change, and human resource management.

In early 2002, Welch was forced to resign from the ''Harvard Business Review'' after admitting to an affair with the then-married [[Jack Welch]], the former chief executive officer of [[General Electric]], while preparing an interview with him for the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= DePaulo|first1=Lisa  |date= May 6, 2002 |title=If You Knew Suzy... |journal=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' |publisher=[[Primedia]] |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5976/index.html |accessdate= October 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair was brought to the attention of the ''Review'' by Jane Welch, Welch's wife at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheelah Kolhatkar |url=http://www.observer.com/2004/04/suzy-wetlaufer-preparing-to-be-neutron-jackie/ |title=Suzy Wetlaufer Preparing To Be ‘Neutron Jackie’ |publisher=Observer |date=2004-04-19 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Welch and Jane Welch divorced and he then married Suzy Welch. Suzy Welch had the interview pulled before it appeared in the ''Business Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suzy Welch |author=Katherine M. Gray |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/6/5/suzy-welch-when-suzy-r-welch/ |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date= |accessdate=April 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with her husband, Jack Welch, Suzy has co-authored several best-selling books including, ''Winning'', its companion volume, ''Winning: The Answers'', and, most recently, ''The Real Life MBA: Your No-BS Guide to Winning the Game, Building a Team and Growing Your Career.'' Jack and Suzy also wrote "''The Welch Way''", a weekly column on business and career challenges that appeared in ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' magazine from 2005 to 2009 and was published in 45 newspapers across the world by ''[[The New York Times]]'' Syndicate. Together, they also founded [[Jack Welch Management Institute]], an online MBA program.

She has written about [[work–life balance]] and other cultural issues for publications including ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. In addition, she has been a commentator on television programs including ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', ''[[Morning Joe]]'', ''[[Your World With Neil Cavuto]]'', and ''[[Power Lunch]]''.

[[image:Thehundredyearlie cover.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Hundred Year Lie'', hardback edition]]
'''''The Hundred Year Lie: How Food And Medicine Are Destroying Your Health''''' (2006) is a book by [[investigative journalist]] [[Randall Fitzgerald]] that examines the rise of the local and global influence of the United States [[Food industry|food]] and [[Chemical industry|chemical]] industries, and argues that they have, over the last century, altered, affected and damaged the lives of millions of people in the United States by introducing synthetic chemicals into the mainstream food chain.

==Summary==

The book covers a wide range of topics related to the central issue. It starts by describing the myths that the public believes, that toxicity health issues are 'someone else's problem', and then goes on to talk about what is known to the scientific and chemical communities, and charts the history of the cover-up of chemicals in relation to human health, and the level of business made from this by the chemical companies.

The book then goes on in detail about the dangers of [[food additives]], the toxic threats of the processed food humans and animals currently eat, and how this chemical contamination has now affected the water that people drink, and how this has brought on increased biological changes, genetic mutations and newly discovered and increasing illnesses and diseases, in both human and animals.

The book ends with a discussion on Western and Eastern medical approaches and philosophies, a focus on alternative medicine and eating healthily, avoiding synthetic foods, and a practical guide on how to detoxify one's body.

The '''Waldorf Astoria New York''' is a luxury hotel in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The hotel has been housed in two [[New York City Preservation Commission|historic landmark]] buildings in New York. The first, bearing the [[Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)|same name]], was built in two stages, as the Waldorf Hotel and the Astoria Hotel, which accounts for its dual name. That original site was situated on [[Astor family]] properties along [[Fifth Avenue]], opened in 1893, and designed by [[Henry J. Hardenbergh]]. It was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the [[Empire State Building]]. The present building, at 301 [[Park Avenue]] between 49th and 50th Streets in [[Midtown Manhattan]], is a 47-story {{convert|190.5|m|abbr=on}} [[Art Deco]] landmark designed by architects [[Schultze and Weaver]], which was completed in 1931. The current hotel was the world's tallest hotel from 1931 until 1963, when it was surpassed by Moscow's [[Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow|Hotel Ukraina]] by {{convert|7|m}}. An icon of glamour and luxury,{{Sfn|Flippin|2011|p=34}} the current Waldorf Astoria is one of the world's most prestigious and best known hotels.{{sfn|Bernardo|2010|p=40}}  [[Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts]] is a division of Hilton Hotels, and a portfolio of high-end properties around the world now operate under the name, including in New York City.

From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained international renown for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it played a significant role in world politics and the [[Cold War]], culminating in the controversial [[World Peace Council#History#Wroclaw 1948 and New York 1949|World Peace Conference of March 1949]] at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. [[Conrad Hilton]] acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by [[Lee Jablin]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the [[Anbang Insurance Group]] of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.

The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as the [[Cole Porter]] Suite, the Royal Suite, named after the [[Edward VIII|Duke]] and [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess of Windsor]], the [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] Suite and the [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] Suite. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the [[White House]]. It was the residence of [[Herbert Hoover]] from his retirement for over 30 years, and [[Frank Sinatra]] kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine, a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, named after British explorer Sir [[Harry Johnston]], is the home of the [[Rob Roy (cocktail)|Rob Roy]] and the [[Bobby Burns (drink)|Bobbie Burns]] cocktails.

==Name==
The name of the hotel is ultimately derived from the town of [[Walldorf]] in Germany, the ancestral home of the prominent [[German-American]] [[Astor family]] who originated there.{{sfn|Emmerich|2013|p=7}} The hotel was originally known as the Waldorf-Astoria with a single hyphen, as recalled by a popular expression and song, "Meet Me at the Hyphen". The sign was changed to a [[double hyphen]], looking similar to an [[equals sign]], by Conrad Hilton when he purchased the hotel in 1949.&lt;ref name="Edwardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edwardianpromenade.com/new-york-city/the-waldorf-astoria/ |title=The Waldorf-Astoria |publisher=Edwardianpromenade.com |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double hyphen visually represents "Peacock Alley", the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today.{{sfn|Schwartz|2009|p=103}} The use of the double hyphen was discontinued by parent company Hilton in 2009, shortly after the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2009/2/10/23247/0103/hotels/Waldorf_Astoria_Drops_the_Equals_Sign_We%27d_Barely_Noticed |title=Waldorf Astoria Drops the Equals Sign We'd Barely Noticed |publisher=HotelChatter |date=February 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel has since been known as the Waldorf Astoria New York, without any hyphen, though this is sometimes shortened to the Waldorf Astoria.

===Original buildings===
{{main|Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)}}

The original hotel started as two hotels on [[Fifth Avenue]] built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]] in the German Renaissance style,{{sfn|Hirsh|1997|p=61}} was opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]] had his mansion.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/about-the-waldorf/hotel-history.html |title=Hotel history |publisher=Waldorfnewyork.com |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original hotel stood {{convert|225|ft}} high, with a frontage of about {{convert|100|ft}} on Fifth Avenue, with an area of {{convert|69475|ft2}}.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=132}} The original hotel was described as having a "lofty stone and brick exterior", which was "animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets".{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=11}} William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor]], had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor [[George Boldt]], who owned and operated the [[Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]], a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling "a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord".{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=204}} Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.

At first, the Waldorf appeared destined for failure. It was originally a laughing stock with its high number of bathrooms and was known briefly as "Boldt's Folly" or "Astor's Folly",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Waldorf-Astoria to give way to office |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/40562832/?terms=1895+Waldorf+astoria |newspaper=[[Lincoln Evening Journal]] |date=December 21, 1928 |page=13 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=Lincoln, Nebraska}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hotel World Known |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/79054253/?terms=1893+Waldorf |newspaper=[[New York Tribune]] |date=February 3, 1918 |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=New York, New York}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, George Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children on its opening day. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. The ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid five dollars for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1604499/waldorf_astoria_history/ |title=Anger, Spite Tint History of the Waldorf |author=Bishop, Jim |date=January 26, 1958 |page=2 |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=Salt Lake City, Utah}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became a major success, earning $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period.{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=204}}

William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but with Boldt's assistance, Waldorf's cousin, [[John Jacob Astor IV]], persuaded his mother to move uptown. On November 1, 1897, John Jacob Astor IV opened the 17-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site, and leased it to Boldt.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley. Peacock Alley was constructed to connect the two buildings,{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=21}} and the hotel subsequently became known as the "Waldorf-Astoria", the largest hotel in the world at the time.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/11/15/waldorf.shooting.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |work=CNN |title=Guard shot during robbery attempt at Waldorf-Astoria |date=October 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202259/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/11/15/waldorf.shooting.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON017.htm |title=The Waldorf Astoria |publisher=''New York Architecture'' |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent "wealthy upper crust" of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city.{{sfn|Bernardo|2010|p=40}}{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=8}} The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family".{{sfn|Cashman|1988|p=373}} It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms.&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/pdf/tisch/HotelFactSheet.pdf |title=Hotel fact sheet |publisher=[[New York University]] School of Professional Studies |year=2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was "the guest is always right",{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=18}} became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, [[Oscar Tschirky]], known as "Oscar of the Waldorf", ''[[maître d'hôtel]]'' from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland 10 years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf, and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} He authored ''The Cookbook by Oscar of the Waldorf'' (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as [[Waldorf salad]], [[eggs Benedict]], and [[Thousand Island dressing]], which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book ''Peacock Alley'' that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who "composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees".{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} In 1902, Tschirky published ''Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria'', a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as [[Buffalo Bill]], and spoke at length about the planning for the [[Panama Canal]] that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1564072/the_voice_of_broadway_by_guest/ |title=The Voice of Broadway |author=Tschirsky, Oscar |date=October 5, 1937 |page=6 |newspaper=The Bee |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=Danville, Virginia}}

The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, [[Louise Kehrer Boldt]], was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the ''New York Herald Tribune'' cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 were spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck, and blue raspberries.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=32}} One article that year claimed that at any one time, the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=High Life in Gotham |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/13481242/?terms=1899+Waldorf+astoria |newspaper=[[Indiana Weekly Messenger]] |date=September 20, 1899 |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=Indiana, Pennsylvania}}

In 1919, restaurateur [[Louis Sherry]] announced an "alliance" with the Waldorf-Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E3DE1338EE32A25754C0A9639C946896D6CF |title=Sherry's To Move May 17; Fifty-Eighth Street Plan Modified by 'Prohibition and Bolshevism' |work=The New York Times |date=May 17, 1919 |page=28 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point, ownership of [[Louis Sherry Inc.]] was significantly vested in "Boomer-duPont interests", a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf-Astoria, and [[T. Coleman du Pont]]. Upon his death that year, William Waldorf Astor was reputed to have been worth £200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth £10 million.{{Sfn|Klein|2005|p=25}} On the evening of November 15, 1926, the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] broadcast its inaugural program from the grand ballroom of the old Waldorf-Astoria.

The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the [[Hotel Astor (New York City)|Hotel Astor]] (1904), [[The St. Regis Hotel|the St. Regis]] (1904), [[The Knickerbocker Hotel (Manhattan)|the Knickerbocker]] (1906), and the [[Savoy-Plaza Hotel]] (1927).{{Sfn|Blanke|2002|p=121}} By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the [[Empire State Building]] and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;{{clear left}}

===Current building===

====Early years and international politics====
The idea of a new Waldorf-Astoria hotel was based on the concept that a large, opulent hotel should be available in New York for distinguished visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929, as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the [[New York Central Railroad]], which had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1595881/new_waldorf_built/ |title=From Depths of Debt Rose Pinnacle of Hostelry |page=14 |date=January 28, 1958 |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |author=Bishop, Jim |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=Salt Lake City, Utah}}

The new building opened on Park Avenue, between East 49th and East 50th streets, on October 1, 1931. It was the tallest and largest hotel in the world at the time,{{sfn|Korom|2008|p=422}} covering the entire block.

Like the original hotel, from its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained worldwide renown for its glamorous dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes. Author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Waldorf Astoria as "comparable to great national institutions" and a "living symbol deep within our collective consciousness".{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=259}} It had the "greatest banquet department in the world" at the time according to restaurateur [[Tom Margittai]], with the center of activity being the Grand Ballroom.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=215}} On August 3, 1932, some 200 people representing the "cream of New York's literary world" attended the Waldorf Astoria to honor [[Pearl S.

The hotel played a considerable role in the emerging [[Cold War]] and international relations during the postwar years, staging numerous events and conferences. On March 15, 1946, [[Winston Churchill]] attended a welcoming dinner at the hotel given by Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], 10 days after making his famous [[Iron Curtain]] speech,{{Sfn|Harbutt|1988|p=3}} and from November 4 to December 12, 1946, the [[Big Four Conference]] was held in [[Jørgine Boomer]]'s apartment on the 37th floor of the Towers between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the future of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|pp=176, 185}} On November 24, 1947, 48 prominent figures of the [[Hollywood film industry]], including various film executives such as [[Louis B. Mayer]] of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Spyros Skouras]] of [[20th Century Fox]], [[Albert Warner]] of [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Eric Johnston]], the head of the [[Association of Motion Picture Producers]], met at the Waldorf Astoria and discussed what would become the [[Waldorf Statement]], banning people with Communist beliefs or tendencies from the Hollywood film industry.{{sfn|Bresler|2004|p=169}} The statement was a response to the [[contempt of Congress]] charges against the so-called "[[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten|Hollywood Ten]]".

On June 21, 1948, a press conference at the hotel introduced the [[LP record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marmorstein, Gary |title=The Label: The Story of Columbia Records |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; From March 27 to 29, 1949, the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, also known as the Waldorf World Peace Conference, was held at the hotel to discuss the emerging [[Cold War]] and the growing divide between the US and the Soviet Union. The conference came at time when deep anti-Communist sentiment and suspicion of the Soviet Union existed in the United States, following the [[Berlin Blockade]] and the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|Czechoslovak ''coup d'état'']] the previous year.{{sfn|Porter|2010|p=149}} The event was organized by the struggling [[American Communist Party]], but was sponsored by many individuals who were not Stalinists, such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Aaron Copland]], with the intention of promoting peace.{{Sfn|Sorin|2002|p=109}} The conference was attended by the likes of Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], composer and pianist [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], and writer [[Alexander Fadeyev (writer)|Alexsander Fadeyev]]. Tension mounted during the controversial event, and culminated when Shostakovich, in front of a crowd of some 800 people, launched a scathing attack on western civilization, remarking, "a small clique of hatemongers was preparing world public opinion for the transition from cold war to outright aggression".{{Sfn|Carroll|2006|p=25}} The event was picketed in a counterattack by anti-Stalinists running under the banner of [[America for Intellectual Freedom]], and prominent individuals such as [[Irving Howe]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], [[Robert Lowell]], and [[Norman Mailer]] publicly denounced Stalinism at the hotel.{{Sfn|Sorin|2002|p=109}} In 1954, Israeli statesman and archaeologist [[Yigael Yadin]] met secretly with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] Archbishop [[Mar Samuel]] in the basement of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to negotiate the purchase of four [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] for [[Israel]]. The scrolls were kept in a vault at the Waldorf-Astoria branch of New York's [[Chemical Bank]].

Sukenik disguised himself as an Arab to travel to the city.  He was allowed to examine the scrolls and to take a small fragment of one for testing.  When he made the trip back to Bethlehem to purchase them the next day, he found that the dealer had been pressured into selling them to the Syriac Orthodox Church. Archbishop Mar Samuel offered to sell them to Sukenik for US$125,000; before the transaction could take place, Mar Samuel's life was threatened and he fled to the United States.  Sukenik died in 1953 without further word about the whereabouts of the scrolls.&lt;ref name=scrolls/&gt;

In 1954, a classified ad appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offering to sell the four scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b-i.forbesimg.com/peterjreilly/files/2013/06/wall_street_journal2.jpg |title=Classified ad offering the sale of the four Dead Sea Scrolls |year=1954 |journal=The Wall Street Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119223149/http://b-i.forbesimg.com/peterjreilly/files/2013/06/wall_street_journal2.jpg |archivedate=January 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yigael Yadin, the son of Professor Sukenik, was visiting the United States when the ad appeared and someone brought it to his attention.

====April in Paris Ball====
{{main|April in Paris Ball}}
[[File:Elsa Maxwell Marilyn Monroe April in Paris Ball 1957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marilyn Monroe]] with organizer [[Elsa Maxwell]] at the 1957 April in Paris Ball]]
The [[April in Paris Ball]] was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve [[France–United States relations|Franco–American relations]], to share cultures, and to help provide assistance to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=226}} It was established by [[Claude Philippe]], the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by [[socialites]].{{sfn|Time Inc|1960|p=90}} [[Elsa Maxwell]] was given the primary responsibility in organizing it.{{sfn|Avery|2010|p=50}} It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because "Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring, he would make it in October".{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=225}} After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the [[Hotel Astor]] in 1960, the [[Seventh Regiment Armory]] in 1961, and other venues.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=235}}

The ball was designed to cater for "very, very high-class people" according to Vaccaro.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}} Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes, and even cars.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}} In the 1960 event, prizes given included a [[Ford Thunderbird]] car, a [[chinchilla]] coat, a [[Renault Dauphine]], a TV [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]] system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags, and a pedigreed poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=235}} Every guest was said to have gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes was given out.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}} Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from taxes, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the [[American Cancer Society]], with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people was paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated, "We charge the most, give the most, and make the most – it's a success formula".{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=226}} Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}}
[[File:Marlene Dietrich April in Paris Ball 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marlene Dietrich]] at the April in Paris Ball in 1959]]
The Paris Ball became a notable event in the annual calendar during the 1950s, with one early show featuring a "three-hour spectacular of five tableaux, directed by [[Stuart Chaney]]", [depicting] a 12th-century scene of troubadours at the court of [[Eleanor of Aquitane]], [[Henry VIII]]'s meeting at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], [[Louis XIV]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and a fashion show of 40 creations by [[Dior]], [[Jacques Fath|Fath]], [[Pierre Balmain|Balmain]], [[Desses]], and [[Givenchy]]".{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=226}} French stars [[Juliette Greco]], [[Jean Sablon]], [[Beatrice Lillie]], [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] and many others were flown over for the ball. The 1957 event was attended by some 1300 guests, including the [[Edward VIII|Duke]] and [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess of Windsor]], Senator [[John F. Kennedy]], his wife, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]], who paid $100 each and donated $130,000 to charities.{{sfn|Time Inc|1957|p=201}}{{sfn|King|2011|p=427}} The following year, the ballroom was decorated with {{convert|30|ft}} high chestnut trees, earning US$170,000 for charities.{{sfn|Time Inc|1958|p=137}}  The final ball to be hosted in the hotel was held on April 10, 1959, with the main theme being the Parisian circus of the 18th century. Genuine circus costumes from the period were flown over from France, and the ball was attended by [[Marlene Dietrich]], who performed two [[Maurice Chevalier]] songs, wearing a top hat, trousers, a waistcoat, and white gloves.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=230}}

===Later history===
On May 6, 1963, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' celebrated its 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event was attended by some 1500 celebrities,{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=254}} including General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Jean Monnet]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Joe Louis]], [[David O. Selznick]], Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], [[Edward Kennedy]], [[Henry Ford II]], and many others.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=218}}  In 1968, British rock band [[The Who]] checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with the staff of the Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash up front. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where their luggage was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on [[Keith Moon]], claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their room off the hinges with his cherry bombs and retrieved their luggage, which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life.{{Sfn|Fletcher|2010|p=376}} However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Induction at the Waldorf on January 17, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-who/1990/waldorf-astoria-hotel-new-york-ny-7bd43670.html |title=The Who Setlist at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony No. 5 |publisher=Setlist.fm |accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the opening of the hotel in 1931, hotelier [[Conrad Hilton]], almost bankrupt at the time, reportedly cut out a photograph of the hotel from a magazine and wrote across it, "The Greatest of Them All".{{Sfn|Dana|2011|p=227}} He acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949.{{sfn|Taraborrelli|2014|p=118}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stanley Turkel |title=A New Waldorf Against The Sky |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles08/waldorf-astoria-17.shtml |work=Old and Sold |year=1931 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] finally bought the hotel outright in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/waldorf-astoria-new-york-NYCWAWA/about/legacy.html |title=New York Luxury Hotels &amp; 5 Star Vacations &amp;ndash; The Waldorf Astoria New York Legacy |publisher= |accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria continued to play an important role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, a "20-car motorcade, with eight shotgun-toting police marksmen aboard in bullet-proof vests" brought Palestinian [[Fatah]] party leader [[Farouk Kaddoumi]] to the Waldorf from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52975820/?terms=Waldorf+Astoria |title=Motorcade |date=November 13, 1974 |newspaper=San Antonio Express |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |location=San Antonio, Texas}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waldorf was on red alert, and [[German Shepherd]] sniffer dogs were brought in prior to his arrival to look for possible bombs. Fifteen suites of the hotel were reserved for the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) delegation.

The old Waldorf Hotel, built at a reported cost of about US$5million, opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]] had previously built his mansion.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The hotel stood {{convert|225|ft}} high, about {{convert|50|ft}} lower than the Astoria, with a frontage of about {{convert|100|ft}} on Fifth Avenue, and a total area of {{convert|69475|ft2}}.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=132}} It was a German Renaissance structure, designed by [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]],{{sfn|King|1893|p=218}} with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms, and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants, with laundry facilities on the upper floors.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=13}} ''The New York Times'' proclaimed the hotel a palace after it opened in 1893.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=11}}

The exterior featured loggias, balconies, gables, groups of chimneys, and tiled roofs.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}  One of the chief features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes, and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic-tile floor and a coffered ceiling.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=13}}  The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=13}} Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which was used as a reception room for women. It contained 18th-century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of [[Marie Antoinette]], and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling [[Delmonico's]] and [[The Sherry-Netherland|Sherry's]].{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=15}} It was modeled after the grand salon in [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|King Ludwig]]'s [[Nymphenburg Palace|palace]] at [[Munich]], with satin hangings, upholstery, and marble pillars, all of pale green, and [[Frank Crowninshield|Crowninshield]]'s frescoes.&lt;ref name=nationalacademy.org&gt;{{cite web |title=Frederick Crowninshield 1845&amp;ndash;1918 |url=http://www.nationalacademy.org/collections/artists/detail/1388/ |publisher=National Academy Museum |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empire style|Empire]] in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters opposite them were of [[mahogany]], with [[ormolu]] work in the panels.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room and the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 [[Sevres]] plates with European portraits.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=22}}

The old Astoria Hotel, opened in 1897, was situated on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Henry J. Hardenbergh.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; With dimensions of {{convert|99|x|350|ft}}, its height, from the floor of the sub-basement, which was {{convert|33|ft}} below the street level, to the roof-line, was about {{convert|270|ft}}, or about {{convert|240|ft}} above the street-level. It was 16 stories in height, including the four stories in the roof.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The building was constructed of stone, marble, and brick, with a steel skeleton frame and modern fireproof interior construction,{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} and was embellished with "French Second Empire Mansard-roofed towers with iron-work cresting as well as Austrian Baroque onion-domes over corners turrets".{{Sfn|Lashley|Lynch|Morrison|2007|p=102}} There were 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms, with miles of corridors, vestibules and balls.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}

The main corridor ran the entire length of the building from east to west. To the left of it was the Astor Dining Room, fronting on Fifth Avenue, which measured {{convert|50|x|92|ft}}. Great care was taken with it to faithfully reproduce the original dining room of the mansion, three floors above where it had stood,{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=24}} with all of the original paneling, carpeting, drapery, and fireplace mantel and Italian Renaissance pilasters and columns, carved of marble from northern Russia.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms, decorated in the Italian style, {{convert|88|x|57|ft}}. On the first floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, {{convert|87|x|102|ft}}, looking out on 34th Street, finished in the style of the [[Hôtel de Soubise]], with a blue, gray, and gold color scheme.  The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms, and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. The ballroom, in the Louis XIV style, has been described as the ''[[pièce de résistance]]'' of the hotel, measuring {{convert|65|ft}} by {{convert|95|ft}} and {{convert|40|ft}} (three stories) in height.{{Sfn|Lashley|Lynch|Morrison|2007|p=102}} It had a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts, and featured tints of ivory-gray and cream in its design.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} On the hotel's top floor was the roof garden, enclosed on all sides by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}{{clear left}}

''Travel America'' stated: "To linger in the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf-Astoria is to step back in time. Your trip down memory lane is a flashback to the glamor days of the 1930s, when this [[Art Deco]] masterpiece was the tallest hotel in the world and the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mink, Randy |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91561919.html |title=The Waldorf-Astoria: the great gray dowager of Park Avenue personifies New York City at its best.

That area was developed by building atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, with buildings like the Waldorf Astoria using "air rights" to the space above the tracks.&lt;ref name="Chapter 6: Historic Resources"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/esa_docs/eafiles06/06%20Historic%20Resources.pdf |title=Chapter 6: Historic Resources |publisher=[[East Side Access]] Project, mta.info |pages=6–7 |accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building opened on October 1, 1931. The 47-story {{convert|190.5|m|abbr=on}} hotel was the tallest and largest hotel in the world, and remained so for a number of years.{{sfn|Korom|2008|p=422}} 
{{convert|1585|ft3}} of black marble was imported from Belgium, {{convert|600|ft3}} of Brech Montalto and {{convert|260|ft3}} of Alps Green arrived from Italy, and some 300 antique mantles were brought in to furnish it;{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=53}} 200 railroad cars brought some {{convert|800000|ft3}} of limestone for the building's facing, 27,100 tons of steel for the skeleton superstructure, and {{convert|2595000|ft2}} of terra cotta and gypsum block. The towers are brick-faced, which led many to believe that the builders ran out of money.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=53}}

Peacock Alley, a 300-ft-long corridor lined with amber marble, connects the two hotel buildings. Gilded, women of the times would enjoy walking along it and admiring themselves in the mirrors. In 1931,  as many as 36,000 people reportedly were walking down it on any given day.{{Sfn|Lashley|Lynch|Morrison|2007|p=102}} The Peacock Alley restaurant of the Waldorf took its name from the alley.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=130}}

The hotel had its own [[railway platform]], [[Track 61 (New York City)|Track 61]], that was part of the [[New York City Subway]], and was connected to the [[Grand Central Terminal]] complex. The platform was used by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[James Farley]], [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], and [[Douglas MacArthur]], among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of [[American Locomotive Company]]'s new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, [[Filene's]] and the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] also staged a fashion show on the platform.&lt;ref name=brennanjoe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/gct61.html |title=Grand Central Terminal, Waldorf-Astoria Platform |year=2002 |author=Brennan, Joseph |publisher=[[Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An elevator large enough for Franklin D.

Such is the architectural and cultural heritage of the hotel that tours are conducted of the hotel for guests.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; [[Frommer's]] has cited the hotel as an "icon of luxury", and highlights the "wide stately corridors, the vintage Deco door fixtures, the white-gloved bellmen, the luxe shopping arcade", the "stunning round mosaic under an immense crystal chandelier", and the "free-standing Waldorf clock, covered with bronze relief figures" in the main lobby. They compare the decor of the rooms to those of an English country house, and describe the corridors as being wide and plush-carpeted, which "seem to go on forever".{{Sfn|Flippin|2011|p=34}}

The lobby floor contains the room registration and cashier desks, the Empire Room and Hilton Room, the private Marco Polo Club, the Wedding Salon, Kenneth's Salon, the Peacock Alley lounge and restaurant, and Sir Harry's Bar.

The hotel has three main restaurants, ''Peacock Alley'', ''The Bull and Bear Steak House'', and ''Oscar's Brasserie'', as well as a secondary restaurant, the Japanese ''Inagiku''. At its peak in the late 1940s, the hotel once had nine restaurants.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=210}} ''Peacock Alley'', situated in the heart of the lobby, features an Art Deco design with gilded ceilings and includes a main restaurant, a bar and lounge, and three private dining salons. It is known primarily for its fish and seafood dishes.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; Sunday Brunch is particularly popular with locals and features over 180 gourmet dishes divided into 12 themed displays, with cuisine ranging from lobster and oysters to Belgian waffles, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes to hollandaise sauces.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; ''The Bull and Bear Steak House'' is furnished in richly polished mahogany in the English Regency style,{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=200}} and has a "den-like" atmosphere,{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=8}} and is reportedly the only restaurant on the East Coast which serves 28 days prime grade USDA Certified Angus Beef.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; It has won awards from the [[National Restaurant Association]] and ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=199}} Between 2007 and 2010, the restaurant was the filming location for ''[[Fox Business Happy Hour]]'', presented live between 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;pm. The ''Bull and Bear Bar'' is based on the original Waldorf Astoria Bar, which was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, such as [[Diamond Jim Brady]], [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Bat Masterson]].&lt;ref name="Dining"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/the-towers/dining.html |title=Dining |publisher=Waldorfnewyork.com |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the bar are bronze statues of a bull and a bear, which represent the successful men of [[Wall Street]]. The ''Inagiku'', meaning the "rice chrysanthemum",{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=211}} serves contemporary Japanese cuisine. The restaurant opens for lunch on weekdays and cocktails and dinner in the evenings. Designed by [[Henry Look]] of San Francisco, the restaurant has four "distinctly different" rooms, including one which represents an old Japanese farmhouse, and the Kinagu Room, resembling a Japanese temple.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=211}} Guests have the option to reserve private orthodox [[tatami]] rooms.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

[[File:Waldorfsalat.jpg|thumb|right|The classic Waldorf Salad]]

''Oscar's Brasserie'', overlooking Lexington Avenue in what was once a Savarin restaurant, is designed by [[Adam Tihany]].&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; The restaurant takes its name from Oscar Tschirky (Oscar of the Waldorf) and serves traditional American cuisine, with many dishes based upon his cookbook which have gained world renown, including the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island dressing, and Veal Oscar.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=121}} The [[Waldorf salad]]—a salad made with [[apple]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[celery]], [[grapes]], and [[mayonnaise]] or a mayonnaise-based dressing—was first created in 1896 at the Waldorf by Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/Waldorf_Salad.htm |title=The History of Waldorf Salad |work=Kitchen Project |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original recipe, however did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in ''The Rector Cook Book'' in 1928. Tschirky was also noted for his "Oscar's Sauce", which became so popular that it was sold at the hotel.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=24}} Another of the hotel's specialties was red velvet cake, which became one of its most popular desserts.{{sfn|Fine|Turner|2001|p=10}}

''Sir Harry's Bar'' is one of the principal bars of the hotel, situated just off the main lobby. It is named after British Sir [[Harry Johnston]] (1858–1927). In the 1970s the bar was renovated in a "plush African safari" design to honor Johnston, a notable explorer of Africa, with "zebra-striped wall coverings and carpeting, with bent-cane furnishings".{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=121}} It has since been redecorated back to a more conservative design, with walnut paneling and leather banquettes, and featured a {{convert|23|ft}} by {{convert|8|ft}} ebony bar as of the early 1990s.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=211}} [[Frank Sinatra]] frequented ''Sir Harry's Bar'' for many years. In 1991, while drinking at ''Sir Harry's'' with [[Jilly Rizzo]] and [[Steve Lawrence]], he was approached by a fan asking for an autograph. Sinatra responded, "Don't you see I'm on my own time here? You asshole. What's wrong with you?" The fan said something which angered Sinatra, who lunged at the fan, and Sinatra had to be restrained.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}

===Cocktail books===

[[Albert Stevens Crockett]], the hotel's veteran publicist and historian, wrote his first cocktail book "Old Waldorf Bar Days" in 1931 during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] and the construction of the current hotel on Park Avenue. It was an homage to the original hotel and its famous bar and clientele. The book contains Crockett's takes on the original hand-written leather bound book of recipes that was given to him at the time of the closure by bartender Joseph Taylor. This edition was never reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Crockett | first=A.S. | title=Old Waldorf Bar Days: With the Cognomina and Composition of Four Hundred and Ninety-one Appealing Appetizers and Salutary Potations Long Known, Admired and Served at the Famous Big Brass Rail; Also, a Glossary for the Use of Antiquarians and Students of American Mores | publisher=Aventine Press | year=1931 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T38MAAAAYAAJ | access-date=2017-12-03 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Crockett wrote a second book, "The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book", in response to the repeal of the [[Volstead Act]] and the end of the Prohibition era. He edited out most of the text from the first book. Drawing from his experiences as a travel writer, Crockett added nearly 150 more recipes, the bulk of which can be found in the "Cuban Concoctions" and "Jamaican Jollifers" chapters. These books became reference books on the subject of pre-Prohibition cocktails and its culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Crockett | first=A.S. | title=The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book: With Amendments Due to Repeal of the XVIIIth ; Giving the Correct Recipes for Five Hundred Cocktails and Mixed Drinks Known and Served at the World's Most Famous Brass Rail Before Prohibition, Together with More Than One Hundred Established Formulas for Cocktails and Other Beverages, Originated While Prohibition was in Effect ; the Whole Flavored with Dashes of History Mixed in a Shaker of Anecdote and Served with a Chaser of Illuminative Information | publisher=A.S.

In 2016, the long-time hotel bar manager of Peacock Alley and La Chine, [[Frank Caiafa]], added a completely new edition to the canon. Caiafa's "The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book" includes all of the recipes in Crockett's books; many of the hotel's most important recipes created since 1935; and his own creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Caiafa | first=F. | title=The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book | publisher=Penguin Random House, LLC | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-14-312480-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erYBDAAAQBAJ | access-date=2017-12-03 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Simonson | first=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Simonson | title=The Waldorf’s Cocktail Bible, Remixed | website=The New York Times | date=2013-03-07 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/dining/waldorf-astoria-bar-book-cocktails.html | access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was nominated for a [[James Beard Foundation Award]] for Best Beverage Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 2017 James Beard Award Nominees | website=James Beard Foundation | date=2017-03-15 | url=https://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/the-2017-james-beard-award-nominees | access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable books with connections to the hotel include "Drinks" (1914) by Jacques Straub, a wine steward and friend of Oscar Tschirky who had written about the first hotel's notable recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Straub | first=Jacques | title=Drinks | publisher=Hotel Monthly Press | year=1914 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMg6AQAAMAAJ | access-date=2017-12-03 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tschirky himself compiled a list of 100 recipes for his own book "100 Famous Cocktails" (1934), a selection of favorites from Crockett’s books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tschirky | first=O. | title=100 Famous Cocktails: The Romance of Wines and Liquors, Etiquette, Recipes | publisher=Kenilworth Press | year=1934 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaZBAQAAMAAJ | access-date=2017-12-03 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, hotel publicist Ted Saucier wrote "Bottoms Up" in 1951, consisting of a compendium of popular, national recipes of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Saucier | first=T. | title=Ted Saucier's Bottoms Up &amp;#91;With Illustrations by Twelve of America's Most Distinguished Artists&amp;#93; | publisher=Martino Fine Books | year=2011 |edition=2nd | isbn=978-1-891396-65-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UxZBYgEACAAJ | access-date=2017-12-03 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 100th anniversary of the hotel in 1993, one publication wrote: "It isn't the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But when it comes to prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as [[Cary Grant]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and [[Chris Evert]].

The viceroy of China, [[Li Hung Chang]] stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=21}} Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including [[Shahanshah]] of Iran and [[Empress Farah]], King [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid of Denmark]], [[Princess Astrid of Norway]], Crown Prince [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] and Crown Princess [[Princess Martha of Norway|Martha of Norway]], King [[Baudouin I of Belgium]] and [[Queen Fabiola]], [[Albert II of Belgium|Prince Albert]] and [[Queen Paola of Belgium|Princess Paola]] of Belgium, King [[Hussein I]] of Jordan, Prince [[Rainier III]] and Princess [[Grace Kelly|Grace]] of Monaco, [[Queen Juliana]] of the Netherlands, King [[Michael of Romania]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip]] of the Commonwealth realms, [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] and [[Humaira Begum|Homaira Shah]] of Afghanistan, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and [[Sirikit|Queen Sirikit]] of Thailand, and Crown Prince [[Akihito]] and [[Princess Michiko]] of Japan and many others.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=106}} Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|pp=117, 181}}

In modern times, the clientele of the Waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=147}} An entire floor was often rented out to wealthy Saudi Arabians with their own staff. Wealthy Japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floors mats.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=142}} One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman [[John Warne Gates|J.

He paid up to $50,000 a year to hire suites at the hotel.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=22}} [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=27}} Demands by people of prominence could often be exorbitant or bizarre, and [[Fidel Castro]] once walked into the hotel with a flock of live chickens, insisting that they be killed and freshly cooked on the premises to his satisfaction, only to be turned away.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=168}} While serving as Secretary of State, [[Henry Kissinger]] ordered all of the antiques to be removed from one suite and replaced them with 36 desks for his staff. An unnamed First Lady also once demanded that all of the bulbs in her suite be changed to 100 watt ones and kept on all day and night to simulate daylight; she further insisted that there be an abundance of chewing gum available.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=161}} 
[[File:President Hoover portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert Hoover who lived at the Waldorf for over 30 years from the end of his presidency]]
[[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[James Farley]] occupied two adjoining suites in the current Waldorf Astoria during his tenure as the chairman of the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472099302-ch10.pdf |title=Mr. Democrat: Jim Farley, the New Deal, and the Making of Modern American Politics |pages=215–229 |publisher=press.umich.edu |first=Daniel |last=Scroop |year=2006 |accessdate=April 11, 2013 |isbn=9780472021505 |oclc=646794810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] lived in suites on different floors of the hotel.

The official residence of the United States' [[Permanent Representative to the UN|Permanent Representative]] to the [[United Nations]], an unnamed [[42nd Floor Apartment|42nd-floor apartment]], has been located in the Waldorf Towers for many years. On June 17, 2015, however, the US Department of State announced that it was moving its headquarters during meetings of the UN General Assembly to [[The New York Palace Hotel]]. Although State Department officials did not give an official reason for the change affecting both the President and hundreds of American diplomats and support staff who travel to New York for the General Assembly each September and usually stay and hold meetings on two secured floors at the Waldorf, they pointed to Hilton Worldwide's sale of the Waldorf-Astoria to China's Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group for $1.95 billion in 2014, a deal that prompted security concerns. While the terms of the sale allow Hilton to run the hotel for the next 100 years, they also call for "a major renovation" that the officials say has raised eyebrows in the US Government because of concerns about Chinese eavesdropping and cyber espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Matthew [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_UNITED_STATES_UN_WALDORF?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "US to abandon Chinese-owned Waldorf at UN General Assembly"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626151351/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_UNITED_STATES_UN_WALDORF?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |date=June 26, 2015 }} The Associated Press, June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Carlos P.

==In popular culture==
The Waldorf Astoria has been a filming location for numerous films and TV series. [[Ginger Rogers]] headlined an all star [[ensemble cast]] in the 1945 film ''[[Week-End at the Waldorf]]'', set at the hotel and filmed partially on location there.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; Other films shot at the hotel include ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'' (1970), ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' (1984), ''[[Coming to America]]'' (1988), ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]'' (1992), ''[[The Cowboy Way (film)|The Cowboy Way]]'' (1994), ''[[Random Hearts]]'' (1999), ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999), ''[[For Love of the Game]]'' (1999), ''[[Serendipity (film)|Serendipity]]'' (2001), ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' (2001), ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'' (2002), ''[[Two Weeks Notice]]'' (2002), ''[[End of the Century]]'' (2005),  ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005), ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]''  (2006), and ''[[The Hoax]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; Television series that have filmed at the Waldorf include ''[[Law &amp; Order|Law and Order]]'', ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[Will and Grace]]''.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

Several biographies have been written about the Waldorf, including [[Edward Hungerford (author)|Edward Hungerford]]'s ''Story of the Waldorf'' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1925) and [[Horace Sutton]]'s ''Confessions of a Grand Hotel: The Waldorf-Astoria'' (New York: Henry Holt, 1953).{{Sfn|Wharton|2001|p=199}}
[[Langston Hughes]] wrote a poem entitled "Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria", criticizing the hotel and inviting the jobless and homeless to take over the space of the hotel.{{sfn|Hughes|2008}} [[Wallace Stevens]] wrote a poem entitled "Arrival at the Waldorf", in which he contrasts the wild country of the jungles of [[Guatemala]] to being "back at the Waldorf". In [[Meg Cabot]]'s novel ''[[Jinx (Cabot novel)|Jinx]]'', the Chapman School Spring Formal takes place in the Waldorf-Astoria. It is at this point that Tory (the main antagonist) reveals Jean's first attempt at a love spell, which served as a catalyst for the novel's events.{{sfn|Cabot|2008|p=191}}

In theatre, [[Terry Teachout]]'s play "''[[Satchmo at the Waldorf]]''", is set in one of the hotel's rooms, during the time when [[Louis Armstrong]] played and stayed there.
