'''Albert''' is an electoral [[Constituencies of Belize|constituency]] in the [[Belize District]] of [[Belize]].  

==History==
The Albert constituency was created for the [[British Honduras general election, 1961|1961 general election]] as part of a major nationwide redistricting.  Albert is named after the principal street (Albert Street) within its jurisdiction.

Albert Constituency is home to the headquarters of most of Belize's banks, Belize City's major stores, The Supreme Court of Belize City, The Bliss Center for the Performing Arts, The Belize City House of Culture, Battlefield Park, the Belize City Commercial Center, and several government offices.

==Location and geographic setting==
Albert, often referred to locally as Albert Division, is located entirely within the boundaries of [[Belize City]], and is one of 10 constituencies in the [[Belize District]] that fall within its city limits. Albert is considered the downtown area of Belize City and is located on the eastern part of the city's southside.

Albert is bounded by the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the east and south, Haulover Creek to the north, and the constituencies of [[Mesopotamia (Belize House constituency)|Mesopotamia]] and [[Queen's Square (Belize House constituency)|Queen's Square]] to the west. The historic [[Swing Bridge (Belize)|Belize City Swing Bridge]], which crosses Haulover Creek, connects Albert with the [[Fort George (Belize House constituency)|Fort George]] constituency. Albert is Belize's smallest constituency in terms of area.

==Politics==
In an era in which the [[People's United Party]] overwhelmingly dominated Belizean national politics, [[Philip Goldson]] of the [[National Independence Party (Belize)|National Independence Party]] first won Albert in 1965. He held the seat as a member of the NIP, then the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]] and finally the [[National Alliance for Belizean Rights|NABR]] until his retirement in 1998. Goldson was the sole opposition member in the Belize House during much of the 1960s and early 1970s. 

In 1998 [[Mark Espat]] won the constituency for the PUP for the first time in 37 years, defeating the UDP's Tom Morrison. Espat was re-elected by comfortable margins until his retirement in 2012.

Albert is currently represented in the [[House of Representatives of Belize]] by the UDP's Tracy Taegar- Panton, who is Minister of State with responsibility for Investment,Trade and Commerce.

Art Russe will continue the work of the Filatov Family Art Fund, but will take on a broader role, with the focus shifting from collecting art to showing the world the breadth and depth of the talent that thrived in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filatovartfund.org/news/31 Filatov Family Art Fund rebrands as ART RUSSE ahead of London museum launch // filatovartfund.org, 2 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2014, Art Russe became a Patron of the [[Serpentine Galleries]], one of London’s leading art galleries. The agreement demonstrates Art Russe’s commitment to supporting international galleries, museums and exhibitions, as it plans to launch its own museum in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filatovartfund.org/news/33 Art Russe becomes a Patron of the Serpentine Galleries in London // filatovartfund.org, 29 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marking the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe, in spring 2015 Art Russe arranged the art exhibition The Legacy of [[World War II]] in Russian Art in [[Saatchi Gallery]], London. The exhibition featured paintings and sculptures, most of which had never before been on public display in the UK, including Alexander Laktionov's ''Letter from the Front''; the Tkachev brothers' ''By the Well''; Igor Obrosov’s ''Wartime Moscow 1941''; Ivan Penteshin’s ''The Defence of Leningrad''; Evsey Moiseenko’s ''Freedom''; Gely Korzhev’s ''The Reunion'' and Mai Danzig's monumental canvas ''And the World Remembers the Saviours''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.rbth.com/news/2015/02/12/an_exhibition_featuring_wwii_in_russian_art_will_be_held_in_london_43655.html An exhibition featuring WWII in Russian art will be held in London] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150421225917/http://asia.rbth.com/news/2015/02/12/an_exhibition_featuring_wwii_in_russian_art_will_be_held_in_london_43655.html# |date=21 April 2015 }} // Russia Beyond the Headlines, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://russkiymir.ru/en/news/186699/ London to See WWII through Eyes of Russian Artists] // Russkiy Mir Foundation, 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition is expected to open in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/uk/347522-russia-art-russe-beaulieu/ First permanent gallery of Russian &amp; Soviet-era art to open in Britain] // RT.com, 20 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Art Russe expanded its collection through the acquisition of seven paintings by some of the most iconic Russian artists. These seven paintings previously belonged to a European noble family. This followed last year's acquisition of eleven canvases from a European royal family. In December 2015 Art Russe signed the agreement to acquire paintings representing several influential movements in Russian art, such as [[Peredvizhniki]]. These works included ''The Religious Procession in Kursk Province'', and ''Sadko in the Underwater Kingdom'' by [[Ilya Repin]], ''The Mother of God'' by [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], ''Whirlwind'' by [[Filipp Malyavin]], ''Alionushka'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], ''The Swan Princess'' by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], watercolour study ''The Rape of Europa'' by [[Valentin Serov]], and ''Ballet Dressing-room Snowflakes'' by [[Zinaida Serebriakova]].

'''Business Network International''' ('''BNI''') is an American franchised networking organization with around 233,000 members in 8,399 local chapters worldwide. Members meet weekly to discuss business and support each other's businesses by sharing [[Referral marketing|referrals]]. It claims to be the world's leading 'referral organization'&lt;!-- note: the term 'referral organisation' is not defined in WP or elsewhere, and therefore should be used with caution--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bni.com |title= BNI web page|accessdate=2013-06-14 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080222025448/http://www.bni.com/| archivedate= 22 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the organization says its members generated referrals resulting in over $9.3 billion in closed business worldwide. 

In 2016, this figure increased to $11.2 billion business passed between members and their referrals (worldwide) and in 2017, $13.6 billion worth of business was passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bni.com/BNINews/tabid/64/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/175/BNI-Launches-41st-and-42nd-Countries.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; BNI was founded in 1985 by [[Ivan Misner]].&lt;ref name="ccn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Technology Is Rewarding Close Personal Relationships |accessdate=2008-09-17 |date=2006-02-23 |work=California Science &amp; Technology News |url=http://www.ccnmag.com/article/why_technology_is_rewarding_close_personal_relationships |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929074614/http://www.ccnmag.com/article/why_technology_is_rewarding_close_personal_relationships }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sept 2018, this figure grew to $15.5 billion worth of done deals passed between members, with over 242k members worldwide in 8,653 chapters across 70 countries and 10.4 million referrals passed between them. It is one of the biggest networking organization of its kind in the world.

==Operational==
Local BNI chapters arrange weekly meetings for people from various industries and encourage the building of relationships and the passing of referrals. Members mostly consist of small business owners but medium and large organisations are also represented. Anyone can apply for membership providing they are wiling to attend the weekly meeting, are operating a full-time business and as most Executive Directors would agree, are in a position to grow and scale their business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business2community.com/small-business/6-reasons-join-bni-group-01088173 6 Reasons NOT to Join a BNI Group], by Ivana Taylor, Business to Community, 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''banknote''' (often known as a '''bill''', '''paper money''', or simply a '''note''') is a type of [[negotiable instrument|negotiable]] [[promissory note]], made by a [[bank]], payable to the bearer on demand.
Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, which were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank.{{sfnp|Atack|Passell|1994|p=469}} Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by [[central bank]]s.

National banknotes are generally [[legal tender]], meaning that medium of [[payment]] is allowed by law or recognized by a [[legal system]] to be valid for meeting a [[financial]] obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, banks sought to ensure that they could always pay customers in [[coin]]s when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of "backing" notes with something of substance is the basis for the history of [[central bank]]s backing their currencies in gold or silver. Today, most national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by [[fiat money|fiat]]. With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, [[coin]]s are used for lower valued monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.

The idea of using a durable lightweight substance as evidence of a promise to pay a bearer on demand originated in Roma, Roman [[promissory note]]s dated 57 AD have been found in London.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/ancient-rome-London-Londinum-Bloomberg-archaeology-Boudicca-archaeology/|title=Ancient Roman IOUs Found Beneath Bloomberg's New London HQ|date=2016-06-01|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3620788/The-City-s-IOU-2-000-year-old-letters-reveal-daily-life-trade-debts-Roman-London.html|title=Ancient letters reveal daily life, trade and debts in Roman London|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in China during the [[Han Dynasty]] notes appeared in 118 BC and were made of leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/history-money.html|title=NOVA - The History of Money|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] was purported to have issued bank notes on parchment or leather, at least before the city's destruction in 146 BC, making Carthage the oldest known user of lightweight promissory notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IW4vAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA10&amp;lpg=RA1-PA10 |title=Speeches of J.P.

[[Counterfeit]]ing, the [[forgery]] of banknotes, is an inherent challenge in issuing [[currency]]. It is countered by anticounterfeiting measures in the [[printing]] of banknotes. Fighting the counterfeiting of banknotes and [[cheque]]s has been a principal driver of [[security printing]] methods development in recent centuries.

==History==
{{Main|History of money}}

Paper currency first developed in [[Tang Dynasty]] China during the 7th century, although true paper money did not appear until the 11th century, during the [[Song Dynasty]]. The usage of paper currency later spread throughout the [[Mongol Empire]] or [[Yuan Dynasty]] China. European explorers like [[Marco Polo]] introduced the concept in Europe during the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Goetzmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"/&gt; [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] issued paper banknotes in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems |chapter=Chapter12: Security Printing and Seals |page=245 |chapter-url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-12.pdf |quote=The introduction of paper money into Europe by Napoleon in the early 1800s, and of other valuable documents such as bearer securities and passports, kicked off a battle between security printers and counterfeiters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash paper money originated as receipts for value held on account "value received", and should not be conflated with promissory "sight bills" which were issued with a promise to convert at a later date.

The perception of banknotes as money has evolved over time. Originally, money was based on [[precious metals]]. Banknotes were seen by some as an [[I.O.U.]] or [[promissory note]]: a promise to pay someone in precious metal on presentation (see [[representative money]]), but were readily accepted - for convenience and security - in the City of London for example from the late 1600s onwards. With the removal of precious metals from the monetary system, banknotes evolved into pure [[fiat money]].

===Early Chinese paper money===
[[File:Jiao zi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Song Dynasty ''Jiaozi'', the world's earliest paper money.]]
{{See also|List of Chinese inventions|Economy of the Song Dynasty|Jiaozi (currency)}}
Development of the banknote began in the [[Tang Dynasty]] during the 7th century, with local issues of paper currency, although true paper money did not appear until the 11th century, during the [[Song Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Bernholz"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Bernholz|title=Monetary Regimes and Inflation: History, Economic and Political Relationships|year=2003|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84376-155-6|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Headrick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel R. Headrick|title=Technology: A World History|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988759-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots were in merchant [[receipt]]s of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), as [[Four occupations#The shang (?)|merchants]] and [[wholesaler]]s desired to avoid the heavy bulk of [[Chinese coins|copper coinage]] in large commercial transactions.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais |2006|p=156}}{{sfnp|Bowman|2000|p=105}}{{sfnp|Gernet|1962|p=80}}

Before the use of paper, the Chinese used coins that were circular, with a rectangular hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given a slip of paper recording how much money they had with that person. If they showed the paper to that person, they could regain their money. Eventually, the Song Dynasty paper money called "[[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]]" originated from these [[promissory note]]s.

By 960 the [[Song Dynasty]], short of copper for striking coins, issued the first generally circulating notes. A note is a promise to redeem later for some other object of value, usually [[money|specie]]. The issue of credit notes is often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The jiaozi nevertheless did not replace coins during the Song Dynasty; paper money was used alongside the coins.

The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right of several of the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais |2006|p=156}} By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins.{{sfnp|Gernet|1962|p=80}} By the 1120s the central government officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using [[woodblock printing]]).{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais |2006|p=156}}

[[File:Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing plate 1287.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|A Yuan dynasty printing plate and banknote with Chinese and Mongol words.]]
Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper [[tribute]]. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of [[Huizhou (region)|Xin'an]] (modern [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]], [[Anhui]]) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng.{{sfnp|Needham|1986|p.47}} In that year of 1101, the [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region.{{sfnp|Needham|1986|p.48}} However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of [[Huizhou]],{{which|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- Anhui or Guangdong --&gt; [[Chengdu]], [[Hangzhou]], and [[Anqi]].{{sfnp|Needham|1986|p.48}}

The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD, that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.{{sfnp|Needham|1986|p.48}} However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of three years.{{sfnp|Gernet|1962|p=80}}

The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver.{{sfnp|Gernet|1962|p=80}} The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most.{{sfnp|Gernet|1962|p=80}} Ever since 1107, the government printed money in no less than six ink colors and printed notes with intricate designs and sometimes even with mixture of unique fiber in the paper to avoid counterfeiting.

The founder of the [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Kublai Khan]], issued paper money known as [[Chao (currency)|Chao]] in his reign. The original notes during the Yuan Dynasty were restricted in area and duration as in the Song Dynasty, but in the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund their ruling in China, they began printing paper money without restrictions on duration. The Venetian merchants were impressed by the fact that the Chinese paper money was guaranteed by the State.

Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued bank notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078 |title=Templar Order |last=Sarnowsky |first=Jürgen |website=Religion Past and Present |year=2011 |isbn=978-9-0041-4666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order |last=Martin |first=Sean |date=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=1560256451 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marco Polo, Il Milione, Chapter CXXIII and CXXIV.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|[[Marco Polo]] described the use of early banknotes in China to [[Medieval Europe]] in his book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]''.]]
In the 13th century, Chinese paper money of Mongol Yuan became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[William of Rubruck]]&lt;!-- Giljom de Rubruk --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Goetzmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|title=History of the weksel: Bill of exchange and promissory note|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4363-0694-2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Polo's account of paper money during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] is the subject of a chapter of his book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', titled "[[Wikisource:The Travels of Marco Polo/Book 2/Chapter 24|How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country]]."&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"/&gt;

{{quote|All these pieces of paper are, issued with as much solemnity and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver... with these pieces of paper, made as I have described, [[Kublai Khan]] causes all payments on his own account to be made; and he makes them to pass current universally over all his kingdoms and provinces and territories, and whithersoever his power and sovereignty extends... and indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go throughout the Great Kaan's dominions he shall find these pieces of paper current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold|[[Marco Polo]]|''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]''}}

In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Italy]] and [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]], because of the insecurity and impracticality of transporting large sums of cash over long distances, money traders started using [[promissory note]]s. In the beginning these were personally registered, but they soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had it in their possession. These notes are seen as a predecessor to regular banknotes by some but are mainly thought of as proto bills of exchange and cheques.&lt;ref name="Geld 1992, page 96"&gt;De Geschiedenis van het Geld (the History of Money), 1992, Teleac, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; The term "bank note" comes from the notes of the bank ("nota di banco") and dates from the 14th century; it originally recognized the right of the holder of the note to collect the precious metal (usually gold or silver) deposited with a banker (via a currency account). In the 14th century, it was used in every part of Europe and in Italian city-state merchants colonies outside of Europe. For international payments, the more efficient and sophisticated [[bill of exchange]] ("lettera di cambio"), that is, a promissory note based on a virtual currency account (usually a coin no longer physically existing), was used more often. All physical currencies were physically related to this virtual currency; this instrument also served as credit.

===Birth of European banknotes===
[[File:Sweden-Credityf-Zedels.jpg|thumb|left|The first paper money in Europe, issued by the [[Stockholms Banco]] in 1666.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:alvin:portal:record-47808 |title=Sverige, Palmstruchska banken, Kreditsedel 10 daler silvermynt, 17 april 1666  |trans-title=Europe's first banknotes |language=sv |website=Alvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The shift toward the use of these receipts as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the [[price revolution]], when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The [[goldsmith]]-bankers of [[London]] began to give out the receipts as payable to the ''bearer'' of the document rather than the original depositor. This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the goldsmith-banker.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal |ssrn=2244977 |title=Money Creation: Genesis 2: Goldsmith-Bankers and Bank Notes |author=Faure AP |journal=Social Science Research Network |date=6 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankers also began issuing a [[Fractional reserve banking|greater value of notes than the total value of their physical reserves]] in the form of loans, on the assumption that they would not have to redeem all of their issued banknotes at the same time. This pivotal shift changed the simple promissory note into an agency for the expansion of the monetary supply itself. As these receipts were increasingly used in the money [[circulation (currency)|circulation]] system, depositors began to ask for multiple receipts to be made out in smaller, fixed denominations for use as money. The receipts soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had possession of the note. These notes are credited as the first modern banknotes.&lt;ref name="Geld 1992, page 96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0owO86az53EC&amp;pg=PA132 |title=The History of Money for Understanding Economics |author=Vincent Lannoye |year=2011 |publisher=Vincent Lannoye| page=132 |isbn=978-1-4802-0066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first short-lived attempt at issuing banknotes by a central bank was in 1661 by [[Stockholms Banco]], a predecessor of Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geisst |first=Charles R. |title=Encyclopedia of American business history |year=2005 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-4350-7 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a means of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Karl Gunnar Persson |page=137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYJtS1MdKlsC&amp;pg=PA137 |title=An Economic History of Europe: Knowledge, Institutions and Growth, 600 to the Present |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=28 January 2010 |isbn=052154940X |access-date=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This banknote issue was brought about by the peculiar circumstances of the Swedish coin supply. Cheap foreign imports of [[copper]] had forced [[Monarchy of Sweden|the Crown]] to steadily increase the size of the copper coinage to maintain its value relative to [[silver]]. The heavy weight of the new coins encouraged merchants to deposit it in exchange for receipts. These became banknotes when the manager of the Bank decoupled the rate of note issue from the bank currency reserves. Three years later, the bank went bankrupt, after rapidly increasing the artificial money supply through the large-scale printing of paper money. A new bank, the ''[[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksens Ständers Bank]]'' was established in 1668, but did not issue banknotes until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citedeleconomie.fr/The-first-European-banknote|title=The first European banknote |website=Cité de l’économie et de la monnaie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent issue of banknotes===
[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|right|The sealing of the [[Bank of England]] Charter (1694). The Bank began the first permanent issue of banknotes a year later.]]
The modern banknote rests on the assumption that money is determined by a social and legal consensus. A gold coin's value is simply a reflection of the supply and demand mechanism of a society exchanging goods in a free market, as opposed to stemming from any intrinsic property of the metal. By the late 17th century, this new conceptual outlook helped to stimulate the issue of banknotes. The economist [[Nicholas Barbon]] wrote that money "was an imaginary value made by a law for the convenience of exchange."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Barbon, ''Discourse On Trade'', 1690. p.37&lt;/ref&gt;  A temporary experiment of banknote issue was carried out by Sir [[William Phips]] as the Governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in 1690 to help fund the [[Nine Years' War|war effort against France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yY_1a6QDLdEC|title=The Last Revolution: 1688 and the Creation of the Modern World|author=Patrick Dillon|year=2007|publisher=Random House|pages=344–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin nature printed 55 dollar front 1779.jpg|thumb |left |Fifty-five dollar bill in [[Continental currency]]; leaf design by Benjamin Franklin, 1779]]
The first bank to initiate the permanent issue of banknotes was the [[Bank of England]]. Established in 1694 to raise money for the funding of the [[Nine Years War|war]] against [[France]], the bank began issuing notes in 1695 with the promise to pay the bearer the value of the note on demand. They were initially handwritten to a precise amount and issued on deposit or as a loan. There was a gradual move toward the issuance of fixed denomination notes, and by 1745, standardized printed notes ranging from £20 to £1,000 were being printed. Fully printed notes that did not require the name of the payee and the cashier's [[signature]] first appeared in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/history.aspx |title=A brief history of banknotes |accessdate=2013-12-17 |publisher=Bank of England |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929010128/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/history.aspx |archive-date=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish economist [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] helped establish banknotes as a formal currency in France, after the wars waged by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] left the country with a shortage of precious metals for coinage.

In the [[United States]] there were early attempts at establishing a central bank in [[First Bank of the United States|1791]] and [[Second Bank of the United States|1816]], but it was only in 1862 that the [[federal government of the United States]] began to print banknotes.

===Central bank issuance of legal tender===
[[Image:London.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bank of England]] gained a monopoly over the issue of banknotes with the [[Bank Charter Act 1844|Bank Charter Act of 1844]].]]
Originally, the banknote was simply a promise to the bearer that they could redeem it for its value in specie, but in 1833 the second in a series of [[Bank Charter Act]]s established that banknotes would be considered as [[legal tender]] during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1928/13/pdfs/ukpga_19280013_en.pdf |title=Currency and Bank Notes Act, 1928 |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-nineteenth century, commercial banks were able to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial [[bank]]ing companies were the common form of currency throughout England, outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=£2 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies &amp; Co.|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=31 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bank Charter Act 1844|Bank Charter Act of 1844]], which established the modern central bank,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/39606/ |last1=Capie |first1=Forrest |last2=Fischer |first2=Stanley |last3=Goodhart |first3=Charles |last4=Schnadt |first4=Norbert |year=1994 |title=The future of central banking: the tercentenary symposium of the Bank of England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-5214-9634-6 |chapter=The development of central banking |via=LSE Research Online |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; restricted authorisation to issue new banknotes to the [[Bank of England]], which would henceforth have sole control of the [[money supply]] in 1921. At the same time, the Bank of England was restricted to issue new banknotes only if they were 100% backed by gold or up to £14 million in government debt.

==Issue of banknotes==
Generally, a [[central bank]] or treasury is solely responsible within a state or [[currency union]] for the issue of banknotes. However, this is not always the case, and historically the paper currency of countries was often handled entirely by private banks. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given country. Commercial banks in the United States had legally issued banknotes before there was a national currency; however, these became subject to government authorization from 1863 to 1932. In the last of these series, the issuing bank would stamp its name and promise to pay, along with the signatures of its president and cashier on a preprinted note. By this time, the notes were standardized in appearance and not too different from [[Federal Reserve Note]]s.[[File:Five dollar Banknote of Citizens Bank of Louisiana.jpg|thumb|A $5 note issued by Citizens Bank of Louisiana in the 1850s.]]

[[File:Bank of Scotland 20 pound note 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Example of a banknote issued by a commercial bank: a 2007 £20 note issued by the [[Bank of Scotland]]]]
In a small number of countries, private banknote issue continues to this day. For example, by virtue of the complex constitutional setup in the United Kingdom, certain [[commercial bank]]s in two of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|state's four constituent countries]] ([[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) continue to print their own banknotes for domestic circulation, even though they are not [[fiat money]] or declared in law as [[legal tender]] anywhere. The UK's central bank, the [[Bank of England]], prints notes which are legal tender in [[England and Wales]]; these notes are also usable as money (but not legal tender) in the rest of the UK (see [[Banknotes of the pound sterling]]).

In the two [[Special Administrative Region|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]], arrangements are similar to those in the UK; in Hong Kong, three commercial banks are licensed to issue [[Banknotes of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong dollar notes]],&lt;ref name="BIS"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss55.pdf |title = The Role of Central Bank Money in Payment Systems |accessdate =14 August 2008 |author=Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems |publisher= Bank for International Settlements |date=August 2003 |page = 96 |quote = Although historically not the case, these days banknotes are usually issued only by the central bank. This is broadly the case in all CPSS economies, except Hong Kong SAR, where banknotes are issued by three commercial banks. Singapore and the United Kingdom are more limited exceptions. Singapore dollar banknotes have been issued by the Board of Currency Commissioners, a government agency, although following the merger of the Board into the MAS in October 2002 this is no longer the case. In the United Kingdom, Scottish banks retain the right to issue banknotes alongside those of the Bank of England and three banks currently still do so. | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080909222757/http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss55.pdf| archivedate= 9 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Macau]], banknotes of the [[Macanese pataca]] are issued by two different commercial banks. In [[Luxembourg]], the [[Banque Internationale à Luxembourg]] was entitled to issue its own [[Luxembourgish franc]] notes until the introduction of the [[Euro]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=bil&gt;{{cite web|title=BIL’s history |url=https://www.bil.com/en/corporate/history/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=Banque Internationale à Luxembourg |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as commercial issuers, other organizations may have note-issuing powers; for example, until 2002 the [[Singapore dollar]] was issued by the [[Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore]], a government agency which was later taken over by the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]].&lt;ref name="BIS"/&gt;

As with any printing, there is also a chance for banknotes to have printing errors. For U.S. banknotes, these errors can include board break errors, butterfly fold errors, cutting errors, dual denomination errors, fold over errors, and misalignment errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pmgnotes.com/news/article/4801/Error-Is-Human-Part-I/|title=Error Is Human: Part I - PMG|website=www.pmgnotes.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Banknotes can be overstamped with new denominations, typically when a country converts to a new currency at an even, fixed exchange rate (in this case, 1000:1).]]
Prior to the introduction of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into [[coin]]s to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased. Banknotes were originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin if presented, they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the "money" that people think that they have as demand deposit bank accounts and electronic payments have negated the need to carry notes and coins.

Banknotes have a natural advantage over coins in that they are lighter to carry but are also less durable. Banknotes issued by [[commercial bank]]s had [[counterparty risk]], meaning that the bank may not be able to make payment when the note was presented. Notes issued by central banks had a theoretical risk when they were backed by gold and silver. Both banknotes and coins are subject to [[inflation]]. The durability of [[coin]]s means that even if metal coins melt in a fire or are submerged under the sea for hundreds of years they still have some value when they are recovered. Gold [[coin]]s salvaged from shipwrecks retain almost all of their original appearance, but silver [[coin]]s slowly corrode.&lt;ref&gt;Famous shipwrecks from which valuable precious metals and [[coin]]s were recovered in recent years include the ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha|Atocha]]'' and the ''[[SS Central America]]''. Shipwreck [[coin]]s are highly collectible and dealers post photos on the internet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedwickcoins.com/map/map.html|title=Virtual Shipwreck and Hoard Map by Daniel Frank Sedwick, LLC|work=sedwickcoins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other costs of using bearer money include:

# Discounting to face value: Before national currencies and efficient clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable at face value at the issuing bank. Even a branch bank could discount notes of other branches of the same bank. The discounts usually increased with distance from the issuing bank. The discount also depended on the perceived safety of the bank. When banks failed, the notes were usually partly redeemed out of reserves, but sometimes became worthless.{{sfnp|Atack|Passell|1994|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref name="Taylor 1951"&gt;

|isbn= 978-0-87332-101-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of discounting within a country does not exist with national currencies; however, under [[floating exchange rate]]s currencies are valued relative to one another in the [[foreign exchange market]].
#[[Counterfeit money|Counterfeiting]] paper notes has always been a problem, especially since the introduction of [[photocopiers|color photocopiers]] and computer [[image scanner]]s. Numerous banks and nations have incorporated many types of countermeasures in order to keep the money secure. However, extremely sophisticated counterfeit notes known as [[superdollar]]s have been detected in recent years.
# Manufacturing or issue costs. Coins are produced by industrial manufacturing methods that process the precious or semi-precious metals, and require additions of alloy for hardness and wear resistance. By contrast, bank notes are printed paper (or polymer), and typically have a higher cost of issue, especially in larger denominations, compared with coins of the same value.
# Wear costs. Banknotes don't lose economic value by wear, since, even if they are in poor condition, they are still a legally valid claim on the issuing bank. However, banks of issue do have to pay the cost of replacing banknotes in poor condition and paper notes wear out much faster than coins.
# Cost of transport. Coins can be expensive to transport for high value transactions, but banknotes can be issued in large denominations that are lighter than the equivalent value in coins.
# Cost of acceptance. Coins can be checked for authenticity by weighing and other forms of examination and testing. These costs can be significant, but good quality coin design and manufacturing can help reduce these costs. Banknotes also have an acceptance cost, the costs of checking the banknote's security features and confirming acceptability of the issuing bank.

The different disadvantages between coins and banknotes imply that there may be an ongoing role for both forms of bearer money, each being used where its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.

==Materials used for banknotes==

===Paper banknotes===
[[File:US $20 Series 2006 Obverse.jpg|thumb |right |A [[United States twenty-dollar bill|US twenty-dollar paper banknote]]]]
Most banknotes are made from [[cotton paper]] with a weight of 80 to 90&amp;nbsp;grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with [[linen]], [[abaca]], or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: it is much more resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a banknote is two years),&lt;ref name="DeLaRue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delarue.com/ProductsSolutions/BanknoteProduction/TheBanknoteLifecyc/ |title=The Banknote Lifecycle — from Design to Destruction |website=De La Rue |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513043414/http://www.delarue.com/ProductsSolutions/BanknoteProduction/TheBanknoteLifecyc/ |archive-date=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under [[ultraviolet]] light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of [[mulberry]] bark. Mitsumata (''[[Edgeworthia chrysantha]]'') and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npb.go.jp/en/intro/seizou.html |publisher=[Japanese] National Printing Bureau |title=Banknote Production Process |website=www.npb.go.jp |accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a kind of [[Washi]]).
[[File:Money poster.JPG|thumb|right|Paper money from different countries]]
Most banknotes are made using the mould made process in which a [[watermark]] and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread can be made to surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the [[De La Rue]] group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking to reduce the number of corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in the paper that make it very hard to copy.

====Counterfeiting and security measures====
When paper bank notes were first introduced in England in the 1790s, they resulted in a dramatic rise in counterfeiting.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The attempts by the Bank of England and the Royal Mint to stamp out currency crime led to new policing strategies, including the increased use of entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= How Criminal were the Irish? Bias in the Detection of London Currency Crime, 1797-1821 |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03058034.2016.1270876 |journal= The London Journal |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=36–52 |date= 2018 |doi= 10.1080/03058034.2016.1270876 |first= Adam |last= Crymble }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The characteristics of bank notes, their materials and production techniques (as well as their development over history) are topics that normally aren't thoroughly examined by historians, even though now there are a number of works detailing how bank notes were actually constructed. This is mostly due to the fact that historians prioritize the theoretical understanding of how money worked rather than how it was produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mockford-2014|Mockford, 2014; pp. 118-119]] quote="Detailed discussion of the material characteristics of Bank Notes, as well as the methods used in their construction, have therefore tended to constitute merely a footnote in historical works that have often prioritised both contemporary and modern theoretical understandings of money and exchange."&lt;/ref&gt; The first great deterrent against counterfeiting was the death penalty for forgers, but this wasn't enough to stop the rise of counterfeiting. Over the XVIII century, far less banknotes were circulating in England compared to the boom of bank notes in the XIX century and, because of this, improving notes making techniques wasn't considered an impelling issue.

In the XVIII century, bank notes were produced mainly through [[copper-plate engraving]] and [[printing]] and they were single-sided. Notes making technologies remained basically the same during the XVIII century&lt;ref&gt;[[#mockford-2014|Mockford, 2014; p. 121]] quote="The technologies employed by the Bank in the making of its notes were ones that altered very little throughout the course of the long eighteenth century, with major changes not occurring until well after the close of this period."&lt;/ref&gt; The first banknotes were produced through the so-called ''[[intaglio printing]]'', a technique that consisted of engraving a copper plate by hand and then covering it in ink to print the bank notes. Only with this technique it was possible, at that time, to force the paper into the lines of the engraving and to make suitable banknotes. Another factor that made it harder to counterfeit banknotes was the paper, since the type of paper used for banknotes was rather different from the paper commercially available at that time. Despite this, some forgers managed to successfully forge notes by getting involved and consulting paper makers, in order to make a similar kind of paper by themselves.&lt;ref name=mockford_122-123&gt;[[#mockford-2014|Mockford, 2014; pp. 122-123]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[watermark|watermarked paper]] was also used since banknotes first appeared; it involved the sewing of a thin wire frame into paper mould. Watermarks for notes were first used in 1697 by a Berkshire paper maker whose name was Rice Watkins.&lt;ref name=mockford_122-123/&gt; Watermarks, together with a special paper type, were supposed to make it harder and more expensive to forge banknotes, since more complex and expensive paper making machines were needed in order to make them.

At the beginning of the XIX century (the so-called [[Bank Restriction Period]], 1797-1821), the dramatically increased demand of bank notes slowly forced the banks to refine the technologies employed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mockford-2014|Mockford, 2014; pp. 122-123]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, [[watermarks]], which previously were straight lines, became wavy, thanks to the idea of a watermark mould maker whose name was William Brewer. This made even harder the counterfeiting of bank notes, at least in the short term, since in 1803 the number of forged bank notes fell to just 3000, compared to 5000 of the previous year&lt;ref&gt;[[#mockford-2014|Mockford, 2014; pp. 126]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, bank notes also started to become double-sided and with more complex patterns, and banks asked skilled engravers and artists to help them make their notes harder to counterfeit (episode labelled by historians as "the search for the inimitable banknote").&lt;ref&gt;[[#mockford-2014|Mockford, 2014; p. 127]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease with which paper money can be created, by both legitimate authorities and counterfeiters, has led both to a temptation in times of crisis such as war or revolution to produce paper money which was not supported by precious metal or other goods, thus leading to [[Hyperinflation]] and a loss of faith in the value of paper money, e.g. the [[Continental Currency]] produced by the [[Continental Congress]] during the [[American Revolution]], the [[Assignat]]s produced during the [[French Revolution]], the paper currency produced by the [[Confederate States of America]] and the [[Southern States Confederate Currency|individual states of the Confederate States of America]], the financing of World War I by the [[Central Powers]] (by 1922 1 gold [[Austro-Hungarian krone]] of 1914 was worth 14,400 paper Kronen), the devaluation of the [[Yugoslav dinar|Yugoslav Dinar]] in the 1990s, etc. Banknotes may also be [[overprinted]] to reflect political changes that occur faster than new currency can be printed.

In 1988, [[Austria]] produced the 5000 [[Austrian schilling|Schilling]] banknote ([[Mozart]]), which is the first foil application ([[Kinebar|Kinegram]]) to a paper banknote in the history of banknote printing. The application of optical features is now in common use throughout the world. Many countries' banknotes now have embedded [[holograms]].

===Polymer banknotes===
{{Main|Polymer banknote}}
[[File:ROL 2000 1999 obverse.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Two thousand lei|2000 Romanian lei]] polymer banknote]]
In 1983, [[Costa Rica]] and [[Haiti]] issued the first [[Tyvek]] and the [[Isle of Man]] issued the first [[Bradvek]] polymer (or plastic) banknotes; these were printed by the [[American Banknote Company]] and developed by [[DuPont]]. These early plastic notes were plagued with issues such as ink wearing off and were discontinued. In 1988, after significant research and development in Australia by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) and the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]], Australia produced the first [[polymer banknote]] made from [[biaxially-oriented polypropylene]] (plastic), and in 1996, it became the first country to have a full set of circulating polymer banknotes of all denominations completely replacing its paper banknotes. Since then, other countries to adopt circulating polymer banknotes include [[Bangladesh]], Brazil, [[Brunei]], Canada, [[Chile]], Guatemala, [[Dominican Republic]], Indonesia, [[Israel]], Malaysia, [[Mexico]], Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, [[Paraguay]], [[Romania]], [[Samoa]], Singapore, the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Thailand]], the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and [[Zambia]], with other countries issuing commemorative polymer notes, including China, Kuwait, the [[Northern Bank]] of [[Northern Ireland]], Taiwan and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=About Australia |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/currency.html |title=Our Currency |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110607104633/http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/currency.html |archivedate= 7 June 2011 |deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another country indicating plans to issue polymer banknotes is [[Nigeria]]. In 2005, [[Bulgaria]] issued the world's first hybrid paper-polymer banknote.

Polymer banknotes were developed to improve durability and prevent [[counterfeit]]ing through incorporated security features, such as [[optically variable devices]] that are extremely difficult to reproduce.

===Other materials===
[[File:Bielefeld Germany 25 Mark 1921. Silk Banknote.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bielefeld]] Germany 25 Mark 1921. Silk Banknote.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Grasser / Albert Pick: Das Bielefelder Stoffgeld 1917 - 1923, Berlin 1972 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Over the years, a number of materials other than paper have been used to print banknotes. This includes various textiles, including silk, and materials such as leather.
[[File:Russian-American Co - 1 Ruble (7559).jpg|thumb|[[Russian American Company]]-issued [[Alaskan parchment scrip]] (c. 1852)]]
Silk and other fibers have been commonly used in the manufacture of various banknote papers, intended to provide both additional durability and security. [[Crane and Company]] patented banknote paper with embedded silk threads in 1844 and has supplied paper to the [[United States Treasury]] since 1879. Banknotes printed on pure silk "paper" include "emergency money" [[Notgeld]] issues from a number of German towns in 1923 during a period of fiscal crisis and [[hyperinflation]]. Most notoriously, [[Bielefeld]] produced a number of silk, leather, velvet, linen and wood issues. These issues were produced primarily for collectors, rather than for circulation. They are in demand by collectors. Banknotes printed on cloth include a number of Communist Revolutionary issues in China from areas such as [[Xinjiang]], or Sinkiang, in the United Islamic Republic of East [[Turkestan]] in 1933. Emergency money was also printed in 1902 on [[khaki]] shirt fabric during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].

[[Cotton]] is the material of the banknotes in the United States. Leather banknotes (or coins) were issued in a number of [[siege]]s, as well as in other times of emergency. During the [[Russian America|Russian administration of Alaska]], banknotes were printed on [[Alaskan parchment scrip|sealskin]]. A number of 19th century issues are known in Germanic and Baltic states, including the places of [[Dorpat]], [[Pernau]], [[Reval]], [[Werro]] and [[Woiseck]]. In addition to the Bielefeld issues, other German leather [[Notgeld]] from 1923 is known from [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]], Osterwieck, Paderborn and Pößneck.

Other issues from 1923 were printed on wood, which was also used in Canada in 1763–1764 during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]], and by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. In 1848, in [[Bohemia]], wooden checkerboard pieces were used as money.

Even [[card money|playing cards]] were used for currency in France in the early 19th century, and in French Canada from 1685 until 1757, the Colony of Louisiana, Dutch Guiana, and in the [[Isle of Man]] in the beginning of the 19th century, and again in Germany after World War I.

Most recently, [[Bisphenol S]] (BPS), has been frequently used in the production of banknotes worldwide. BPS is an [[endocrine disruptor]] that is subject to human dermal absorption through handling banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bisphenol S, a New Bisphenol Analogue, in Paper Products and Currency Bills and Its Association with Bisphenol A Residues |author=Liao C |author2=Liu F |author3= Kannan K |pmid=22591511 |doi=10.1021/es300876n |volume=46 |date=2012 |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |pages=6515–6522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical orientation===
[[File:COP50000 frente rotated.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|The Colombian 50,000 peso note, presented in a vertical format.]]

Vertical currency is a type of [[currency]] in which the orientation has been changed from the conventional horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation. Dowling Duncan, a self-touted multidisciplinary design studio, conducted a study in which they determined people tend to handle and deal with money vertically rather than horizontally, especially when the currency is processed through [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] and other [[Money changer#Mechanical device|money machine]]s. They also note how money transactions are conducted vertically not horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=14 August 2010 |url=http://dowlingduncan.com/2010/dowling-duncan-redesign-us-bank-notes/ |website=Dowling &amp;#124; Duncan |title=Dowling Duncan redesign the US banknotes |accessdate=2012-08-15 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423032115/http://dowlingduncan.com/2010/dowling-duncan-redesign-us-bank-notes/# |archive-date=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bermuda dollar|Bermuda]], [[Cape Verdean escudo|Cape Verde]], [[Israeli new shekel|Israel]], [[Swiss franc|Switzerland]], and [[Venezuelan bolívar|Venezuela]] have adopted vertically oriented currency, although Israel is now reverting to horizontal orientation.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Since 1979, [[Sri Lankan rupee|Sri Lanka]] has unusually printed the reverse of its banknotes vertically. The 2018 series [[Banknotes of the Hong Kong dollar|Hong Kong dollar banknotes]] has the obverse is in traditional horizontal layout, while the reverse adopts vertical format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=24 July 2018 |url=http://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/key-information/press-releases/2018/20180724-5.shtml |title=2018 New Series Hong Kong Banknotes |publisher=[[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Chinese banknotes were also vertical, due to the direction of Chinese writing.

==Vending machines and banknotes==

People are not the only economic actors who are required to accept banknotes. In the late 20th century, [[vending machines]] were designed to recognize banknotes of the smaller values long after they were designed to recognize coins distinct from slugs. This capability has become inescapable in economies where inflation has not been followed by introduction of progressively larger coin denominations (such as the United States, where several attempts to make [[dollar coin (United States)|dollar coins]] popular in general circulation have largely failed). The existing infrastructure of such machines presents one of the difficulties in changing the design of these banknotes to make them less counterfeitable, that is, by adding additional features so easily discernible by people that they would immediately reject banknotes of inferior quality, for every machine in the country would have to be updated.

==Destruction==
{{See also|Money burning}}

In the United States, banknotes last an average of three years until they are no longer fit for circulation, after which they are collected for destruction, usually recycling or shredding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About U.S. Money|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0774850.html|website=Factmonster.com|accessdate=19 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716105904/http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0774850.html| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A banknote is removed from the money supply by banks or other financial institutions because of everyday [[wear and tear]] from its handling. Banknote bundles are passed through a sorting machine that determines whether a particular note needs to be shredded, or are removed from the supply chain by a human inspector if they are deemed unfit for continued use – for example, if they are mutilated or torn. Counterfeit banknotes are destroyed unless they are needed for evidentiary or forensic purposes.

Contaminated banknotes are also decommissioned. A Canadian government report indicates:

{{quote|text=Types of contaminants include: notes found on a corpse, stagnant water, contaminated by human or animal body fluids such as urine, feces, vomit, infectious blood, fine hazardous powders from detonated explosives, [[dye pack]] and/or drugs...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Business/article/261441|title=Bankers wipe out dirty money|last=Trichur|first=Rita|work=Toronto Star|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=28 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016064131/http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/261441| archivedate= 16 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These are removed from circulation primarily to prevent the spread of diseases.

When taken out of circulation, Australian plastic/polymer bank notes are melted down and mixed together to form plastic garbage bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Trissie|title=Australian Polymer Banknotes |url=http://www.therightnote.com.au/shop650/shopcontent.asp?type=polymer|website=Therightnote.com.au|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216065555/http://www.therightnote.com.au/shop650/shopcontent.asp?type=polymer |archive-date=16 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the nickname "Fed Shreds" refers to paper money which has been shredded after becoming unfit for circulation. Although these shredded banknotes are generally landfilled, they are sometimes sold in small bags as [[souvenir]]s.&lt;ref name="FED"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed11.html|title= FED|accessdate= 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligent banknote neutralisation system==
[[Intelligent banknote neutralisation system]]s (IBNS) are security systems which render banknotes unusable by marking them permanently as stolen with a degradation agent. Marked (stained) banknotes cannot be brought back into circulation easily and can be linked to the crime scene. Today's most used degradation agent is a special security ink which cannot be removed from the banknote easily and not without destroying the banknote itself, but other agents also exist. Today IBNSs are used to protect banknotes in [[automated teller machine]]s, retail machines, and during [[cash-in-transit]] operations.

==Dynamic Intelligent Currency Encryption==
[[Dynamic Intelligent Currency Encryption]] (DICE) is a security technology introduced in 2014 by [[United Kingdom|British]] company EDAQS, which devaluates banknotes remotely that are illegal or have been stolen. The technology is based on identifiable banknotes - that could be an RFID chip or a barcode - and connects to a digital security system to verify the validity of the banknote. The company claims that the banknotes are [[forgery|unforgeable]] and contribute to solve cash-related problems as well as fight crime and terrorism. In another note, the DICE benefits cover and solve almost all cash-related issues that are seen by governments to be a motivation for the progressive abolition of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/2518003|title=EDAQS Publishes the DICE – The New Banknote Technology That Protects Citizens and Fights Crime|work=digitaljournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confiscation and asset forfeiture==
In the United States there are many laws that allow the confiscation of cash and other assets from the bearer if there is suspicion that the money came from an illegal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isil.org/resources/lit/looting-of-america.html |title=International Society for Individual Liberty |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090225/http://www.isil.org/resources/lit/looting-of-america.html |archive-date=9 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a significant amount of U.S. currency contains traces of [[cocaine]] and other illegal drugs, it is not uncommon for innocent people searched at airports or stopped for traffic violations to have cash in their possession sniffed by dogs for drugs and then have the cash seized because the dog smelled drugs on the money. It is then up to the owner of the money to prove where the cash came from at his own expense. Many people simply forfeit the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndsn.org/dec94/dog.html|title=Drug Dog's "Alert" to Cash Not Grounds for Forfeiture When Up to 75 percent of Currency Tainted With Drugs|work=ndsn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held in the case of ''UNITED STATES of America v. U.S. CURRENCY, $30,060.00'' (39 F.3d 1039 63 USLW 2351, No. 92-55919) that the widespread presence of illegal substances on paper currency in the Los Angeles area created a situation where the reaction of a drug-sniffing dog would not create probable cause for civil forfeiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/39/39.F3d.1039.92-55919.html|title=Resource.org|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603030836/https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/39/39.F3d.1039.92-55919.html|archive-date=3 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displacement by electronic currency==

Banknotes have increasingly been displaced by credit and debit cards and electronic money transfers. Some governments, such as Canada, are considering replacing paper notes and coins with [[digital currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2402982,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | first=Adario | last=Strange | title=Canada Asks Developers to Create Digital Currency | date=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Randy Boswell |date=6 April 2012 |title=Canada unveils digital currency |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/Canada+unveils+digital+currency/6419676/story.html |work=The Gazette |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410222104/http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/Canada%2Bunveils%2Bdigital%2Bcurrency/6419676/story.html |archive-date=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden has begun implementing digital currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Malin Rising |url=https://news.yahoo.com/sweden-cash-king-no-more-082544562.html |title=In Sweden, cash is king no more - Yahoo!

==Paper money collecting as a hobby==

Banknote collecting, or [[Notaphily]], is a slowly growing area of [[numismatics]]. Although generally not as widespread as coin and [[stamp collecting]], the hobby is slowly expanding. Prior to the 1990s, currency collecting was a relatively small adjunct to coin collecting, but currency auctions and greater public awareness of paper money have caused more interest in rare banknotes and consequently their increased value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Since 2007 Sanjay Relan, of Hong Kong, has held the Guinness world record for collecting 221 banknotes representing 221 different countries. For a short period in 2007, he also held the Guinness world record for collecting 235 coins representing 235 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banknote.pro/articles/143922/Paper-Money-Collecting-as-a-Hobby |title=Paper Money Collecting as a Hobby |publisher=Banknote.pro |accessdate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331082631/http://www.banknote.pro/articles/143922/Paper-Money-Collecting-as-a-Hobby |archivedate=31 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trades===

For years, the mode of collecting banknotes was through a handful of mail order dealers who issued  price lists and catalogs. In the early 1990s, it became more common for rare notes to be sold at various coin and currency shows via auction. The illustrated catalogs and "event nature" of the auction practice seemed to fuel a sharp rise in overall awareness of paper money in the numismatic community. The emergence of currency third party grading services (similar to services that grade and "slab", or encapsulate, coins) also may have increased collector and investor interest in notes. Entire advanced collections are often sold at one time, and to this day single auctions can generate millions in gross sales. Today, [[eBay]] has surpassed auctions in terms of highest volume of sales of banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/checkcashingscams.php | title=You Won a Lottery, Got an Award, or a Mystery Shopper Job and They Sent You a Check!

This disparity is diminishing as paper money prices continue to rise. A few rare and historical banknotes have sold for more than a million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ad=article&amp;ArticleId=22989 | title=Long Beach Sale Set|author=Bank Note Reporter|date=August 23, 2011| publisher=World Record Academy | accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different organizations and societies around the world for the hobby, including the International Bank Note Society (IBNS), which currently assert to have around 2,000 members in 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theibns.org/joomla/index.php | title=Introducing the IBNS | publisher=IBNS | accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novelty===

The universal appeal and instant recognition of bank notes has resulted in a plethora of novelty merchandise that is designed to have the appearance of paper currency. These items cover nearly every class of product. Cloth material printed with bank note patterns is used for clothing, bed linens, curtains, upholstery and more. Acrylic paperweights and even toilet seats with bank notes embedded inside are also common. Items that resemble stacks of bank notes and can be used as a seat or ottoman are also available.

Manufacturers of these items must take into consideration when creating these products whether the product could be construed as counterfeiting. Overlapping note images and/or changing the dimensions of the reproduction to be at least 50% smaller or 50% larger than the original are some ways to avoid the risk of being considered a counterfeit. But in cases where realism is the goal, other steps may be necessary. For example, in the stack of bank notes seat mentioned earlier, the decal used to create the product would be considered counterfeit. However, once the decal has been affixed to the resin stack shell and cannot be peeled off, the final product is no longer at risk of being classified as counterfeit, even though the resulting appearance is realistic.

'''[[Brighton and Hove]] City Centre''' is the commercial and cultural centre of the city of Brighton. Geographically, the so-called city centre is located in an easterly part of the Brighton and Hove urban conurbation.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Brighton Royal Pavilion.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Pavilion]]
[[Image:Pavilion theatre brighton.jpg|thumb|left|The Pavilion Theatre]]
The North Laine area has a network of streets dubbed the 'Cultural Quarter', so called because of its concentration of theatres, galleries and small venues. This area covers New Road, the location of the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton|Theatre Royal]], and the [[Brighton Dome]] complex which includes the [[Pavilion Theatre (Brighton)|Pavilion Theatre]], Corn Exchange Theatre and the Dome Concert Hall. Next to this is [[Brighton Museum and Art Gallery]]. Bordering New Road and the Dome is Pavilion Gardens which is home to the [[Royal Pavilion, Brighton|Royal Pavilion]], former palace residence of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. Opposite New Road is Jubilee Street, a modern redevelopment containing restaurant and cafe chains. It is also the location of the [[Jubilee Library, Brighton|Jubilee Library]], the city's central library.

On the seafront is the Fishing Museum and near [[Brighton railway station]] is the [[Brighton Toy and Model Museum]]. The Old Steine and St. Peter's area is a large patch of green in the city centre which is the location of a war memorial, the Frankish [[St Peter's Church, Brighton|St. Peter's Church]] and two art galleries: the [[Phoenix Gallery]] and the [[University of Brighton]] gallery.

== Shopping ==
[[Image:Crowds fringecity 5thmay07.png|right|thumb|Weekend shoppers flock to the city centre during the day.]]
Brighton is home to hundreds of shops and is renowned{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} for its wealth of independent shops. Most of the chain stores can be found on Western Road and [[Churchill Square (Brighton and Hove)|Churchill Square]]. The other major high streets are West Street, Queens Road, North Street, East Street, Duke Street and Ship Street.

[[The Lanes (Brighton)|The Lanes]] are the centre of Brighton's old town and consist of narrow streets and alleyways. The area is home to lots of jewellery and antique shops.

North of the Lanes is the [[North Laine]], both a residential and major commercial area, and the location of most of the city's independent shops. The commercial area of North Laine is centred on Trafalgar Street, Sydney Street, Gloucester Road, Kensington Gardens, North Road, Gardner Street, Church Street and Bond Street. The area is also home to small art galleries and [[Komedia]], a theatre, bar, comedy venue and cinema. The area is also home to Jubilee Square, home of Jubilee library and a number of restaurants.

A little more east of the main high streets is [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]], home to many gay shops and other businesses. Its main shopping thoroughfare is St. James' Street, which has many cafés and restaurants, such as The Saint restaurant and Redroaster Coffee House.

== Amusements ==
[[Image:Uk BrightonPierSunset.jpg|thumb|left|Brighton Pier at sunset]]
[[Brighton Pier]] (or, the Palace Pier) is home to many rides and other amusements such as fortune tellers and prize winning games. Near the pier is Brighton Sea Life centre, an aquarium. Near the aquarium is [[Volks Electric Railway]], a historic electric railway, providing transportation to [[Brighton Marina]]. West Street is the city's centre for nightlife as home to a number of night clubs and late-night bars.

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}
[[Image:Virgin Train at Brighton.jpg|thumb|left|Brighton railway station]]
[[Image:Brighton to Shoreham along the coast 011.jpg|thumb|right|Brighton and Hove Buses run regularly throughout the city centre]]
The city centre is well served by public transport. Brighton and Hove Buses run regularly throughout the area with stops and stations at Churchill Square, Brighton Station, the [[Clock Tower, Brighton|Clock Tower]], North Street and the Old Steine. Buses serve as the main mode of public transport in Brighton and Hove connecting all suburbs and outer areas to the city centre.

There are major taxi ranks located in Brighton Station and East Street.

Near the Old Steine is Pool Valley Coach Station which is used for intercity travel.

Brighton Railway station serves as the city's main rail terminus and has good links to [[London]], [[Gatwick Airport]] and the south coast. [[Hove railway station]] serves the centre of Hove and can be reached from Brighton in less than five minutes. [[London Road (Brighton) railway station|London Road Station]] is near Preston Circus. The rail network in Brighton and Hove is not as extensive as the bus network, however certain suburbs and university campus are well connected to the centre of Brighton and Hove by rail.

== Accommodation ==
[[Image:Grand Hotel - Brighton - 02082004.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Hotel, Brighton]]

There are numerous hotels in the city centre, some of the more notable ones include [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|The Grand Hotel]], the Hilton Metropole Hotel, the [[Royal Albion Hotel]] and the Ramada Hotel.

'''Networking''' is a [[socioeconomic]] [[business sector|business]] activity by which [[businesspeople]] and [[entrepreneur]]s meet to form business relationships and to recognize, create, or act upon [[Business opportunity|business opportunities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Business networking: shaping collaboration between enterprises |author= Hubert Österle |author-link= Hubert Österle |author2= Elgar Fleisch |author2-link= Elgar Fleisch |author3= Rainer Alt |author3-link= Rainer Alt |edition= 2, illustrated |publisher= Springer |year= 2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41351-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KhbDsM3ld_cC }}&lt;/ref&gt; share information and seek potential partners for ventures.

In the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of [[personal network|networking]] was promoted to help businesspeople to build their [[social capital]]. In the US, [[workplace equity]] advocates encouraged '''business networking''' by members of marginalized groups (e.g., women, [[African-Americans]], etc.) to identify and address the challenges barring them from [[profession]]al success. Mainstream [[business literature]] subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoted them as pathways to success for all career climbers. Since the closing decades of the twentieth century, "networking" has become an accepted term and concept in American society.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In the 2000s, "[[network (disambiguation)|networking]]" has expanded beyond its roots as a business practice to the point that parents meeting to share child-rearing tips to scientists meeting research colleagues are described as engaging in "networking".&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"&gt;

== Overview ==
A business network is a type of business [[social network]] which is developed to help business people connect with other managers and entrepreneurs to further each other's business interests by forming mutually beneficial business relationships. Business networking is a way of leveraging your business and personal connections to help bring you regular supply of new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/196758 |title=What Is Business Networking, Anyway? |last=Misner |first=Ivan|work=entrepreneur |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2018-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several prominent business networking organizations that create models of networking events that, when followed, allow the business person to build new business relationships and generate business opportunities at the same time. A [[professional network service]] is an implementation of [[information technology]] in support of business networking. Chambers of Commerce and other business-oriented groups may also organize networking activities. There are multiple different types of networking groups though and the best type for each individuals varies depending on the business they are in and prospects they want to meet.

== History ==
Before online business networking, there existed face-to-face networking for business. This was achieved through a number of techniques such as [[Trade fair|trade show]] marketing and loyalty programs. Though these techniques have been proven to still be an effective source of income, many companies now focus more on online marketing due to the ability to track every detail of a campaign and justify the expenditure involved in setting up one of these campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Symonds [http://www.displaywizard.co.uk/display-hub/why-offline-marketing-still-works Why Offline Marketing Still Works in a Digital World], ''The Display Hub by Display Wizard'', 28 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Schmoozing" or "rubbing elbows" are expressions used among professional business professionals for introducing and [[meeting]] one another in a business context, and establishing business rapport.

== Ethics == 
Networking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The skilled networker cultivates personal relationships with prospective employers and selection panelists, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has raised ethical concerns. The objection is that it constitutes an attempt to corrupt formal selection processes. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Dobos, "Just What are you Trying to Pull?" http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ned Dobos, "Networking, Corruption, and Subversion", ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 2015, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Networked business ==
Many businesses use networking as a key factor in their marketing plan. It helps to develop a strong feeling of trust between those involved and play a big part in raising the profile of a company. [[Distribution (business)|Suppliers]] and businesses can be seen as networked businesses, and will tend to source the business and their suppliers through their existing relationships and those of the companies they work closely with. Networked businesses tend to be open, random, and supportive, whereas those relying on [[Social stratification|hierarchical]], traditional managed approaches are closed, selective, and controlling. These phrases were first used by Thomas Power, businessman and chairman of Ecademy, an online business network, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Power [https://www.sunzu.com/articles/closed-selective-controlling-meets-open-random-supportive-130926/ Closed Selective Controlling meets Open Random Supportive], ''Sunzu The Art Of Business'', 30 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4665">'''Curtain coating''' is a process that creates an uninterrupted curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate.  The substrate is transported on a [[conveyor belt]] or [[calender]] rolls at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. The curtain is created by using a slit or die at the base of the holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Some polymers are melted and [[extruded]] for coating.   Many manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.

==Process==
Curtain coating is a process in which the object or substrate to be coated is guided through a curtain of fluid located in a gap between two conveyors. The mechanism is formed by a tank of fluid from which a thin screen falls down in between the two conveyors. The thickness of the coating layer that falls upon the object is mainly determined by the speed of the conveyor and the amount of material leaving the tank (pump speed). Curtain coating is a premetered method, which means that the amount of liquid required is supplying from the tank to the screen, to be deposited on the substrate. 

Curtain coating is one of the technologies used in the converting industry to modify the properties of substrates.

==Edging==
To be certain the flow of the liquid is disrupted, an edging along both sides of the slit is required.  This is to prohibit the [[surface tension]] from causing the coating to taper in; sometimes edging alone is not enough and a [[surfactant]] must be added to lower the surface tension.

==Flow rate==
It is also important to note that each fluid  has its own minimum flow rate.  The minimum flow rate is the smallest amount of dye at a given moment to keep the curtain flowing continuously.  The minimum flow rate is directly proportional to the surface tension while [[viscosity]] is inversely proportional.

Curtain coating is a pre-metered coating method, which means that the exact amount of coating needed to coat the substrate can be calculated before the process is actually accomplished.  This is can be done by using the ratio of the flow rate (with respect to volume) and width of the substrate to the speed at which the substrate passes under the "curtain" of coating fluid.  

Because of the ability to calculate the exact (or nearly so) amount of fluid needed for a given project, film thickness variations on the finished product can be kept within +/− 0.5% of the target thickness 
.&lt;ref name="PFFC Magazine"&gt;http://pffc-online.com/mag/paper_curtain_coating_technology/, March 1, 2000; Dr. Peter M. Schweizer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of curtain coating==
* Faster coating velocity
* Ability to produce a thinner coat
* Easily coat abstract surfaces
* Lower cost of dies
* Lower waste of coating
* Coats a more uniform layer

==Deficits of curtain coating==
* Minimum flow rate
* Air entrainment
* Rough surfaces are more likely to have air entrainment
* Management of airflow around the apparatus

==Geometrical possibilities==
* Curtain coating is usually only effective on relatively flat substrates.  Because of the possibility of air pockets being formed beneath the coating, it is not advisable to use curtain coating on substrates with extremely rough or angular surfaces with grooves and pits etc.

==Production rates==
* Production rates are only limited by the maximum speed that the fluid can be laid down on the substrate without breaking the curtain or getting air bubbles between the substrate and the coating material.  This is dependent mainly upon the viscosity of the coating fluid.

'''Erlanger Buildings''' is a historic [[loft]] building located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It consists of a four-structure, turn-of-the-20th-century loft complex. The buildings range in size from two to six stories high and feature [[cast iron architecture|iron storefronts]] and stone detailing.  They were built between 1892 and 1910.  The buildings served as the home of the Erlanger Manufacturing Company, which produced [[BVD|BVD brand underwear]]. Charles Erlanger, co-founder of the company, is credited with making major advances in the design of underwear which revolutionized the industry.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-597.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Erlanger Buildings|date=October 1979|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Fred B.

He is chairman and CEO of Mytilineos Holdings. He is also chairman of the board in Protergia and vice president of the board ALUMINIUM A. E. since 2004 (subsidiary of Mytilineos and second-largest metals producer of the country&lt;ref name="warn grexit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c8f8e29c-65d1-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2.html#axzz4BgvTTVSf|title=Greek businessman Evangelos Mytilineos warns of Grexit danger|website=Ft.com|date=1 October 2015|author1=Kerin Hope|author2=Tony Barber|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He has been awarded inter alia to important business activity, as Businessman of the Year by the business magazine CAPITAL (1998) and has received the KOUROS award Entrepreneurship Club in the category Innovation and Development (1998).

Evangelos Mytilineos lobbied against [[Grexit]]&lt;ref name="warn grexit"/&gt; and the heavy tax policy applied in Greece to recover from its debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mytilineos-greece-idUKBRE9710HQ20130802|title=Patriotism keeps Mytilineos in high-tax Greece, for now|website=Reuters.com|date=2 August 2013|author=Jemima Kelly|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
[[Iraklis 1908 Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis FC]] was sold in 2000 to Evangelos Mytilineos for almost €3,500,000 (1.18 billion drachmas). Despite the acquisition of many promising players during the first summer, the 2000–2001 season didn't have the expected results, with the club finishing in 5th position of the national championship, out of European qualification spots. However, Iraklis managed to progress to the 2nd round of UEFA Cup. The following summer, Mytilineos sold the highly rated striker Michalis Konstantinou to Panathinaikos, setting a new record for the highest fee received for a domestic transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/32522/mitilinaios |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428081954/http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/32522/mitilinaios |archivedate=April 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">The '''Export function''' is an idea used in economic theories to measure exports.  The total amount of exports, E, in a nation is mainly affected by two variables, see [[import]], the total foreign absorption and the real exchange rate.&lt;ref&gt;Burda, Wyplosz (2005): Macroeconomics: A European Text, Fourth Edition, Oxford University Press
&lt;/ref&gt;

E = E(A*,σ) Where A* and σ are variable functions related to the total foreign absorption and the real exchange rate.  

For an explanation of the positive and negative relationship between exports and absorption and the real exchange rate, see import

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">Baron '''François du Four''' ([[Turnhout]], [[Belgium]], 1871 – 1945) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist. He married Germaine Herry in 1902, and together they had seven daughters and a son.

When his mother, Josephina Frederika Dessauer, died in 1904, he became the owner of the family business [[Brepols]], a paper - and playing card factory. The company at that moment had about 1000 employees. From 1919 up to 1932 François du Four was mayor of Turnhout. In 1929, King [[Albert I of Belgium]] knighted him and granted him the title of [[baron]]. The heraldic motto of the du Fours is ''Melius esse quam vider'', which means ''it is better to be than to seem'', and their own weapon-shield represents a lion.

In Turnhout there is a street named after him: the baron François du Four street, which starts on the central market place of Turnhout. In this street the old factory buildings of Brepols were located. In 1945, Francois du Four died at the age of 74.

François du Four liked racing-horses. His [[thoroughbred]]s won a lot of races and a lot of price money. After he died, regretfully, all his horses were sold. In 1904, he had bought a small farm in [[Retie]] with neighboring pasture. He was especially looking for a place where he could breed thoroughbreds. In 1905, he started with the construction of the park where now the castle of Retie stands. In 1906, he started the building of a castle and the stables for his horses.

== History of genetic counseling ==
Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book ''Counseling in Medical Genetics'' in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/sheldon-clark-reed-1910-2003|title=Sheldon Clark Reed (1910-2003)|work=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reed SC|date=December 1974|title=A short history of genetic counseling|journal=Social Biology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=332–9|doi=10.1080/19485565.1974.9988131|pmid=4619717}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysgeneticcounselors.org/history.php|title=NYS Genetic Counseling Information Resource|website=www.nysgeneticcounselors.org|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Seymour|date=May 1984|title=Book Review: A Genetic Counseling CasebookA Genetic Counseling Casebook.

Marks Graduate Program in Human Genetics at Sarah Lawrence College|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[National Society of Genetic Counselors|National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/national-society-genetic-counselors-nsgc|title=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|publisher=The National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic counselors==

=== Professional Roles ===
Genetic counselors work in a wide variety of patient-facing and non patient-facing settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/page/whoaregeneticcounselors|title=National Society of Genetic Counselors : NSGC Professional Status Survey|website=www.nsgc.org|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical genetic counselors may provide general care, or specialize in one or more areas. Examples include:

* Prenatal and Preconception – for women and their partners who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant
* Pediatric – for children with genetic, or suspected genetic, conditions and their family members
* Cancer – for patients with cancer and/or their family members
* Cardiovascular – for patients with diseases of the heart or circulatory system and/or their family members
* Neurology – for patients with diseases of the brain and nervous system and/or their family members.
* Assisted reproductive technology/ infertility – for couples struggling with fertility or who are carriers of genetic diseases
* Psychiatric – for patients living with mental illness and/or their family members

Outside the clinic, genetic counselors work in areas such as laboratories, research, education, public health settings, and corporate environments. Examples of roles include:

* Laboratory – Utilization management, provider and patient support, variant classification, and reporting
* Research – Coordinating research studies, patient recruitment, data collection and interpretation, manuscript preparation and grant writing
* Education – Professors, Directors of genetic counseling training programs
* Public Health – Newborn screening programs, population screening programs
* Non-profit – Patient support and advocacy organizations
* Corporate – Dedicated services for employees and their families

=== Education ===
A genetic counselor is an expert with a [[Master of Science]] degree in genetic counseling. Programs in North America are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC). There are currently 41 accredited programs in the United States, four accredited programs in Canada, and four programs with the intent to become accredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gceducation.org/Pages/Accredited-Programs.aspx|title=Accredited Programs|website=gceducation.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students enter the field from a variety of disciplines, including [[biology]]/biological sciences and social sciences such as [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/page/becomeageneticcounselor|title=National Society of Genetic Counselors : Interested in Becoming a Genetic Counselor|website=www.nsgc.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate school coursework includes topics such as human genetics, embyrology, ethics, research, and counseling theory and techniques. Clinical training including supervised rotations in prenatal, pediatric, adult, cancer, and other subspecialty clinics, as well as non-patient facing rotations in laboratories. Research training typically culminates in a capstone or thesis project.

=== Certification ===
In the United States genetic counselors are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. In Canada, genetic counselors are certified by the Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cagc-accg.ca/?page=117&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from an American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC) accredited program who have met specific criteria are eligible to take the examination which is offered twice per year by the ABGC. Although not every company requires its counselors to possess a certification, the certification shows that the practitioner has met the standards "necessary to provide competent genetic counseling services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abgc.net/Certification/qualify_exam.asp|title=How do I qualify for the exam?|last=|first=|date=|website=American Board of Genetic Counseling|publisher=American Board of Genetic Counseling, Inc.|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State licensure  ===
As of October 2018, 25 states have passed genetic counselor licensure bills that require genetic counselors to meet a certain set of standards to practice. These states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Almost every other state in the US is in the process of obtaining genetic counseling licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsgc.org/p/cm/ld/fid=19|title=States Issuing Licenses for Genetic Counselors|website=National Society of Genetic Counselors|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although genetic counseling has existed for over four decades, the first licenses for genetic counselors were not issued until 2002. Utah was the first state to do so. The [[American Society of Human Genetics]] (ASHG) has since encouraged more states to license genetic counselors before they are allowed to practice. ASHG argues that requiring practitioners to go through the necessary training and testing to obtain a license will ensure quality genetic services as well as allow for reimbursement for counselors’ services. Laws requiring licensure ensure that "professionals who call themselves genetic counselors are able to properly explain complicated test results that could confuse patients and families making important health decisions".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Genetic counselor licensure proponents call for more states to adopt licensing laws: Benefits of licensure extend to geneticists, counselors, and patients | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics. Part A | volume = 170A | issue = 1 | pages = 8–9 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26768329 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.37507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reimbursement and recognition ===
Insurance companies usually do not reimburse for unlicensed genetic counselors’ services. Patients who may benefit from genetic counseling may not be able to afford the service due to the expensive out-of-pocket cost. In addition, licensure allows genetic counselors to be searchable in most insurance companies’ databases which gives genetic counselors increased opportunities for earning revenue and clients the opportunity to see "the level of coverage insurers provide for their services".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Counseling session structure==
The goals of genetic counseling are to increase understanding of [[genetic diseases]], discuss disease management options, and explain the risks and benefits of testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Genetic Alliance Site | access-date = 29 October 2010 | url = http://www.geneticalliance.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling sessions focus on giving vital, unbiased information and non-directive assistance in the patient's decision-making process. Seymour Kessler, in 1979, first categorized sessions in five phases: an intake phase, an initial contact phase, the encounter phase, the summary phase, and a follow-up phase.&lt;ref name="pmid19798554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson JM, Gillam LH, Sahhar MA, Metcalfe SA | title = "Testing times, challenging choices": an Australian study of prenatal genetic counseling | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–37 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19798554 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-009-9248-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intake and follow-up phases occur outside of the actual counseling session. The initial contact phase is when the counselor and families meet and build rapport. The encounter phase includes dialogue between the counselor and the client about the nature of screening and diagnostic tests. The summary phase provides all the options and decisions available for the next step. If patients wish to go ahead with testing, an appointment is organized and the genetic counselor acts as the person to communicate the results. Result delivery can happen both in person or via phone. Often counselors will call out results to avoid patients having to come back in as results can take weeks to be processed. If further counseling is needed in a more personal setting, or it is determined that additional family members should be tested, a secondary appointment can be made.

==Reasons for testing and sub-specialties==
===Detecting conditions===
[[Diagnostic testing]] occurs when an individual is showing signs or symptoms associated with a specific condition. Genetic testing can be used to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in order to provide better prognosis as well as medical management and/or treatment options. Testing can reveal conditions that—while debilitating without treatment—can be mild or asymptomatic with early treatment (such as [[phenylketonuria]]). Genetic tests are available for a number of genetic conditions, including but not limited to: [[Down syndrome]], [[Sickle cell disease]], [[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay-Sachs disease]], [[Muscular dystrophy]]. Establishing a genetic diagnosis alerts any other at-risk individuals in the family to consider testing, if appropriate.

Any reproductive risks (e.g. a chance to have a child with the same diagnosis) can also be explored after a diagnosis. Many disorders cannot occur unless both the mother and father pass on their genes, such as [[cystic fibrosis]]; this is known as [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance. Other [[autosomal dominant]] diseases can be inherited from one parent, such as [[Huntington disease]] and [[DiGeorge syndrome]]. Yet other genetic disorders are caused by an error or mutation occurring during the cell division process (e.g. [[aneuploidy]]) and are not hereditary.

[[Screening (medicine)|Screening tests]] are often used prior to diagnostic testing, designed to separate people according to a fixed characteristic or property, with the intention of detecting early evidence of disease. For example, if a screening test during a pregnancy (such as [[Prenatal testing|maternal blood screening]] or [[ultrasound]]) reveals a risk of a health issue or genetic condition, patients are encouraged to receive genetic counseling to learn additional information regarding the suspected condition and about their options with discussion of management, therapy and treatments available for the conditions, including those after delivery, and those during pregnancy, such as the option to terminate the pregnancy. Patients may decline additional screening and testing, elect to proceed to diagnostic testing, or pursue further screening tests to refine the risk during the pregnancy.

[[Predictive testing|Presymptomatic or predictive testing]] occurs when an individual knows of a specific diagnosis (typically adult onset) in their family and has other affected relatives, but they themselves do not manifest any clinical findings at the time when they seek testing. The decision about whether or not to proceed with presymptomatic testing should entail a thoughtful approach and consideration of various medical, reproductive, social, insurance, and financial factors, with no “right” or “wrong” answer. Availability of treatment and medical management options for each specific diagnosis, as well as the genetics and inheritance pattern of the particular condition should be reviewed as inherited conditions can have reduced [[penetrance]].

Insurance and legal issues should also be discussed during genetic counseling. There are laws in the United States such as [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act|GINA]] ([https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr493/text Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act]) and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]] that provide certain protections against discrimination for individuals with genetic diagnoses.

=== Adult genetics ===
Adult or general genetics clinics serve patients who are diagnosed with genetic conditions that begin to show signs or symptoms in adulthood. Many genetic conditions have varying ages of onset, ranging from an infantile form to an adult form. Genetic counseling can facilitate the decision making process by providing the patient/family with education about the genetic condition as well as the medical management options available to individuals at risk of developing the condition. Adult-onset disorders may overlap multiple specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilchrist DM | title = Medical genetics: 3. An approach to the adult with a genetic disorder | journal = CMAJ | volume = 167 | issue = 9 | pages = 1021–9 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12403743 | pmc = 134180 | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/9/1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ART/Infertility genetics ===
Genetic counseling is an integral part of the process for patients utilizing [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation genetic testing]] (PGT), formerly called preimplantation genetic diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg-Strassler D,  Cabey R, Armenti EM, Jordan A | journal = Fertility and Sterility | date = September 2016 | volume = 106 | issue = 3 Supplement | page = e370| title = Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) genetic counseling; but why? The patient experience|issn = 0015-0282|doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.07.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of PGT and all require [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) using [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing|title=Preimplantation genetic testing | work = UpToDate }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGT-M, for monogenic disorders, involves testing embryos for a specific condition before it is implanted into the mother. This technique is currently being done for disorders with childhood onset, such as Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs and Muscular Dystrophy, as well as adult-onset conditions, including Huntington’s Disease, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, and Lynch Syndrome. PGT-SR, for structural rearrangements, involves testing embryos to establish a pregnancy unaffected by a structural chromosomal abnormality (translocation). PGT-A, for aneuploidy, was formerly called preimplantation genetic screening, and involved testing embryos to identify any de novo aneuploidy.

Genetic counseling can also involve medical evaluation and clinical work-up for couples with infertility and/or recurrent pregnancy loss, as these histories can be associated with parental chromosome aberrations (such as [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] or [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]) and other genetic conditions.

=== Cardiovascular genetics ===
A rapidly expanding field in genetic counseling is cardiovascular genetics. More than 1 in 200 people have an inherited [[cardiovascular disease]]. Hereditary cardiac conditions range from common diseases, such as high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, to rare diseases like [[Long QT syndrome|Long QT Syndrome]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], aortic and [[vascular disease]]s.  Genetic counselors who specialize in cardiovascular disease have developed skills specific to the management of and counseling for cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular genetic counselors are also integral in local and national efforts to prevent sudden cardiac death (the leading cause of sudden death in young people) by identifying patients with known or suspected heritable cardiovascular diseases and promoting cascade family screening or testing of at-risk relatives.

Common referral reasons include:

* Cardiomyopathy, including, [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] and familial idiopathic [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]
* Arrhythmia, including [[Long QT syndrome]] and [[Brugada syndrome]]
* Vascular disease, including [[Marfan syndrome]] and aortic aneurysm and/or dissection (&lt;50 years old)
* Other heritable heart defects (e.g. conotruncal defects, left ventricular outflow tract defects)
* [[Familial hypercholesterolemia]]
* Family history of unexplained sudden death

Guidelines on cardiovascular genetics are published by multiple professional societies.&lt;ref name="pmid24011539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Priori SG, Wilde AA, Horie M, Cho Y, Behr ER, Berul C, Blom N, Brugada J, Chiang CE, Huikuri H, Kannankeril P, Krahn A, Leenhardt A, Moss A, Schwartz PJ, Shimizu W, Tomaselli G, Tracy C | display-authors = 6 | title = HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in May 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 | journal = Heart Rhythm | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 1932–63 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24011539 | doi = 10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.05.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29567486"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershberger RE, Givertz MM, Ho CY, Judge DP, Kantor PF, McBride KL, Morales A, Taylor MR, Vatta M, Ware SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic Evaluation of Cardiomyopathy-A Heart Failure Society of America Practice Guideline | journal = Journal of Cardiac Failure | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–302 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29567486 | doi = 10.1016/j.cardfail.2018.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22068434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gersh BJ, Maron BJ, Bonow RO, Dearani JA, Fifer MA, Link MS, Naidu SS, Nishimura RA, Ommen SR, Rakowski H, Seidman CE, Towbin JA, Udelson JE, Yancy CW | display-authors = 6 | title = 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines | journal = Circulation | volume = 124 | issue = 24 | pages = e783–831 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22068434 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e318223e2bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25173338"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott PM, Anastasakis A, Borger MA, Borggrefe M, Cecchi F, Charron P, Hagege AA, Lafont A, Limongelli G, Mahrholdt H, McKenna WJ, Mogensen J, Nihoyannopoulos P, Nistri S, Pieper PG, Pieske B, Rapezzi C, Rutten FH, Tillmanns C, Watkins H | display-authors = 6 | title = 2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the Task Force for the Diagnosis and Management of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 39 | pages = 2733–79 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25173338 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21600525"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg AC, Hopkins PN, Toth PP, Ballantyne CM, Rader DJ, Robinson JG, Daniels SR, Gidding SS, de Ferranti SD, Ito MK, McGowan MP, Moriarty PM, Cromwell WC, Ross JL, Ziajka PE | display-authors = 6 | title = Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis and management of pediatric and adult patients: clinical guidance from the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia | journal = Journal of Clinical Lipidology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S1–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21600525 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacl.2011.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26510694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gidding SS, Champagne MA, de Ferranti SD, Defesche J, Ito MK, Knowles JW, McCrindle B, Raal F, Rader D, Santos RD, Lopes-Virella M, Watts GF, Wierzbicki AS | display-authors = 6 | title = The Agenda for Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 22 | pages = 2167–92 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26510694 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hereditary cancer genetics ===
Cancer genetic counselors see individuals with a personal diagnosis and/or family history of cancer or symptoms of an inherited cancer syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Counseling About Cancer|last=Schneider|first=Katherine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-1118119914|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counselors take a family history and assess for hereditary risk, or risk that can be passed down from generation to generation. If indicated, they can coordinate genetic testing, typically via blood or saliva sample, to evaluate for hereditary cancer risk.  Personalized medical management and cancer screening recommendations can be provided based on results of genetic testing and/or the family history of cancer. While most cancers are sporadic (not inherited), some are more likely to have a hereditary factor, particularly when occurring at young ages or when clustering in families.

===Neurogenetics===
Genetic counselors specializing in neurogenetics are involved in the care of individuals who have or are at risk to develop conditions affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or peripheral nervous system (the nerves that leave the spinal cord and go to other places in the body, such as the feet and hands, skeletal  muscles, and internal organs). Effects of these conditions can lead to various impairments some examples of which include cognitive decline, intellectual disability, seizures, uncontrolled movements (e.g. ataxia, chorea), muscle weakness, paralysis, or atrophy. Examples of neurogenetic disorders include:

*Brain malformation syndromes, including [[lissencephaly]] and [[polymicrogyria]]

Prenatal genetic counseling may help with the decision-making process by walking patients through examples of what some people might do in similar situations, and their rationale for choosing that option. Decisions made by patients are affected by factors including timing, accuracy of information provided by tests, and risk and benefits of the tests. This discussion enables patients to place the information and circumstances into the context of their own lives, and in the context of their own values.&lt;ref name="pmid20235896"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stefansdottir V, Skirton H, Jonasson K, Hardardottir H, Jonsson JJ|date=July 2010|title=Effects of knowledge, education, and experience on acceptance of first trimester screening for chromosomal anomalies|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=89|issue=7|pages=931–8|doi=10.3109/00016341003686073|pmid=20235896}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may choose to undergo noninvasive screening (e.g. [[ultrasound]], [[triple screen]], [[cell-free fetal DNA]] screening) or invasive diagnostic testing ([[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]). Invasive diagnostic tests possess a small risk of [[miscarriage]] (1-2%) but provide more definitive results. Testing is offered to provide a definitive answer regarding the presence of a certain genetic condition or chromosomal abnormality.

=== Psychiatric genetics  ===
Psychiatric genetic counseling is a sub-specialty within genetic counseling focused on helping people living with a [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]] and/or their family members understand both the genetic and environmental factors that contributed to their illness and address associated emotions such as guilt or self-blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Talk with Families About Genetics and Psychiatric Illness|last=Peay|first=Holly|last2=Austin|first2=Jehannine | name-list-format = vanc |publisher= Norton |location= New York, London |year=2011|isbn=978-0-393-70549-2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic counselors also discuss strategies to promote recovery and protect [[mental health]] and address any questions on chances for recurrence in other family members. While currently there is no single gene solely responsible for causing a psychiatric disorder, there is strong evidence from family, [[twin studies]], and [[Genome-wide Association Studies|genome-wide-association studies]] that both multiple genes and environment interact together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giegling I, Hosak L, Mössner R, Serretti A, Bellivier F, Claes S, Collier DA, Corrales A, DeLisi LE, Gallo C, Gill M, Kennedy JL, Leboyer M, Maier W, Marquez M, Massat I, Mors O, Muglia P, Nöthen MM, Ospina-Duque J, Owen MJ, Propping P, Shi Y, St Clair D, Thibaut F, Cichon S, Mendlewicz J, O'Donovan MC, Rujescu D | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetics of schizophrenia: A consensus paper of the WFSBP Task Force on Genetics | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 492–505 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28112043 | doi = 10.1080/15622975.2016.1268715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other areas of genetic counseling, patients at all different stages of life (pediatric, adult, prenatal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inglis A, Morris E, Austin J | title = Prenatal genetic counselling for psychiatric disorders | journal = Prenatal Diagnosis | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–13 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27466037 | pmc = 5247258 | doi = 10.1002/pd.4878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan J, Virani A, Austin JC | title = Ethical issues associated with genetic counseling in the context of adolescent psychiatry | journal = Applied &amp; Translational Genomics | volume = 5 | pages = 23–9 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26937355 | pmc = 4745399 | doi = 10.1016/j.atg.2015.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can have psychiatric genetic counseling. Since the etiology of psychiatric disorders is complex and not fully understood, the utility of genetic testing is not as clear as it is in Mendelian or single gene disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Demkow U, Wolańczyk T | title = Genetic tests in major psychiatric disorders-integrating molecular medicine with clinical psychiatry-why is it so difficult? | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = e1151 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28608853 | pmc = 5537634 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2017.106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that individuals who receive psychiatric genetic counseling have significant increases in feelings of empowerment and self-efficacy after genetic counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moldovan R, Pintea S, Austin J | title = The Efficacy of Genetic Counseling for Psychiatric Disorders: a Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 1341–1347 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28616830 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-017-0113-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric genetic counselors can help "dispel mistaken notions about psychiatric disorders, calm needless anxiety, and help those at risk to draw up a rational plan of action based on the best available information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsuang MT | title = Genetic counseling for psychiatric patients and their families | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 135 | issue = 12 | pages = 1465–75 | date = December 1978 | pmid = 717559 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.135.12.1465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychosocial aspects of genetic counseling ==
There are different approaches to genetic counseling. Some counselors favor a more purely psycho-educational approach while others incorporate more psycho-therapeutic techniques. Genetic counseling is psycho-educational as patients "learn how genetics contributes to their health risks and then process what this means and how it feels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biesecker|first=Barbara B | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-16 |pages=1–5 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0005616.pub3 | isbn=978-0-470-01590-2 |title=ELS |chapter=Genetic Counselling: Psychological Issues }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapeutic ===
"Whether the process of genetic counseling is a form of [[psychotherapy]] is up for debate". The relationship between the client and counselor is similar as are the goals of the sessions. As a psychotherapist aims to help his client improve his wellbeing, a genetic counselor also helps his client to address a "situational health threat that similarly threatens client wellbeing". Due to the lack of studies which compare genetic counseling to the practice of psychotherapy, it is hard to say with certainty whether genetic counseling can be "conceptualized as a short-term, applied, specific type of psychotherapy". However, there few existing studies suggest that genetic counseling falls "significantly short of psychotherapeutic counseling" because genetic counseling sessions primarily consist of the distribution of information without much emphasis placed on explaining any long-term impacts to the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biesecker B, Austin J, Caleshu C | title = Response to A Different Vantage Point Commentary: Psychotherapeutic Genetic Counseling, Is it? | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 334–336 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27804046 | pmc = 5383505 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-016-0025-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic counselors as support===
Genetic counselors provide supportive counseling to families, serve as patient advocates and refer individuals and families to community or state support services. They serve as educators and resource people for other health care professionals and for the general public. Many engage in research activities related to the field of medical genetics and genetic counseling. When communicating increased risk, counselors anticipate the likely distress and prepare patients for the results. Counselors help clients cope with and adapt to the emotional, psychological, medical, social, and economic consequences of the test results.

Each individual considers their family needs, social setting, cultural background, and religious beliefs when interpreting their risk.&lt;ref name="pmid19711880"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan SM | title = Prenatal genetic testing | journal = Pediatric Annals | volume = 38 | issue = 8 | pages = 426–30 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19711880 | doi = 10.3928/00904481-20090723-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clients must evaluate their reasoning to continue with testing at all. Counselors are present to put all the possibilities in perspective and encourage clients to take time to think about their decision. When a risk is found, counselors frequently reassure parents that they were not responsible for the result. An informed choice without pressure or coercion is made when all relevant information has been given and understood.

After counseling for other hereditary conditions, the patient may be presented with the option of having genetic testing. In some circumstances no genetic testing is indicated, other times it may be useful to begin the testing process with an affected family member. The genetic counselor also reviews the advantages and disadvantages of genetic testing with the patient.

===Attitudes toward genetic counseling and genetic testing===
Many studies have examined the attitudes of the lay public toward genetic counseling and genetic testing. Barriers to obtaining genetic counseling include lack of understanding of genetics by both patients and healthcare providers, concerns about cost and insurance, and fears of stigma and/or discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallagher TM, Bucciarelli M, Kavalukas SL, Baker MJ, Saunders BD | title = Attitudes toward genetic counseling and testing in patients with inherited endocrinopathies | journal = Endocrine Practice | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 1039–1044 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28613942 | doi = 10.4158/EP171875.OR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haga SB, Barry WT, Mills R, Ginsburg GS, Svetkey L, Sullivan J, Willard HF | display-authors = 6 | title = Public knowledge of and attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing | journal = Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–35 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23406207 | pmc = 3609633 | doi = 10.1089/gtmb.2012.0350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scuffham TM, McInerny-Leo A, Ng SK, Mellick G | title = Knowledge and attitudes towards genetic testing in those affected with Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Community Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–77 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24018619 | pmc = 3955457 | doi = 10.1007/s12687-013-0168-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No simple correlation has been found between the change in technology to the changes in values and beliefs towards genetic testing.&lt;ref name="pmid22476359"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer E, Couper MP, Raghunathan TE, Van Hoewyk J, Antonucci TC | title = Trends in U.S. Attitudes Toward Genetic Testing, 1990-2004 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 446–458 | date = Fall 2008 | pmid = 22476359 | pmc = 3045776 | doi = 10.1093/poq/nfn033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==
In 2018, there are nearly 7000 genetic counselors practicing worldwide, across at least 28 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abacan|first=MaryAnn|last2=Alsubaie|first2=Lamia|last3=Barlow-Stewart|first3=Kristine|last4=Caanen|first4=Beppy|last5=Cordier|first5=Christophe|last6=Courtney|first6=Eliza|last7=Davoine|first7=Emeline|last8=Edwards|first8=Janice|last9=Elackatt|first9=Niby J.|date=2018-10-05|title=The Global State of the Genetic Counseling Profession|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-018-0252-x|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41431-018-0252-x|issn=1018-4813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Genetic counseling in China (mainland) has been primarily provided by pediatricians or obstetricians for prenatal or birth defect diagnoses. Most genetic tests can only be performed in academic institutions as research tests or in commercial direct-to-consumer companies for non-clinical use.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao X, Wang P, Tao X, Zhong N | title = Genetic services and testing in China | journal = Journal of Community Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 379–90 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23595912 | pmc = 3739851 | doi = 10.1007/s12687-013-0144-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, genetic counseling is steered by the '''Chinese Board of Genetic Counseling (CBGC)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbgc.org.cn/en/|title=中国遗传学会遗传咨询分会|author=|date=|website=www.cbgc.org.cn|access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit organization. CBGC is composed of senior experts engaged in genetic education and research. CBGC is committed to establishing standardized procedures of genetic counseling, training qualified genetic counselors, improving health for all, and reducing the incidence of birth defects. CBGC was established in 2015 and is the major professional organization for genetic counselors in mainland China, providing training through short term online and in-person lectures, educational conferences, and certification for trainees.    

Genetics education in China began in the 1980s when selected medical schools began offering genetics courses that focused predominantly on molecular genetics and had limited clinical content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Xu T, Yashar BM | title = Genetics educational needs in China: physicians' experience and knowledge of genetic testing | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 757–60 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25503494 | doi = 10.1038/gim.2014.182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, there are no official master’s level graduate programs in genetic counseling or clinical genetics in China, and there is great variability in the duration and content of genetics curricula among medical schools and professional organizations.

The [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Health]] has not yet recognized genetic counselors as an independent health care occupation. There are no official statistics for the number of health care professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, and lab technicians) who are providing genetic counseling services in China.

=== South Africa ===
Genetic Counselling is a developing field in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kromberg JG, Wessels TM, Krause A | title = Roles of genetic counselors in South Africa | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–61 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23723047 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-013-9606-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are about 20 registered genetic counsellors practicing in the country. In South Africa, genetic counsellors work within academic institutions, in the private health sector and more recently, private genetic laboratories. A few qualified genetic counsellors have been employed outside of the country or in other professions, owing to funding limitations that have impacted employment opportunities, particularly in the academic/public health sector.

The first Genetic Counselling Programme in South Africa started in 1989 at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in Johannesburg, in the Gauteng province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/course-finder/postgraduate/health/genetic-counselling/|title=Genetic Counselling - Wits University|last=Johannesburg|first=The University of the Witwatersrand,|website=www.wits.ac.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second programme started in 2004 at the [[University of Cape Town]] in the Western Cape province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za/hg/teaching/msc/courses|title=Genetic Counselling Courses             {{!}} Division of Human Genetics|website=www.humangenetics.uct.ac.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the only two programmes offering Masters level genetic counselling training in South Africa. Currently these courses are running at full capacity.  This is a two year degree and includes a research component. The majority of students enter the Masters programme with a science background but those with a psychology background are also be considered.

The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpcsa.co.za|title=Home Page - HPCSA|website=www.hpcsa.co.za | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires two years of internship. Often the first year forms part of the Masters degree in Genetic Counselling and a further 12 month internship thereafter. Genetic Counsellors are required by law to register with the HPCSA in order to practice as genetic counsellors. At the end of the training period, registrants submit a portfolio to  HPCSA for assessment. If successful, the intern will be registered with the HPCSA and will be able to practice as a Genetic Counsellor in South Africa.

There is a professional organisation for Genetic Counsellors in South Africa, '''Genetic Counselling South Africa (GC-SA),''' which provides information and guidance to the HPCSA and others regarding professional issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sashg.org/about/focus-groups/genetic-counselling-south-africa/|title=Genetic Counselling South Africa – SASHG|website=sashg.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCSA is a focus group of the South African Society of Human Genetics (SASHG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sashg.org|title=SASHG – Southern African Society for Human Genetics (SASHG)|website=sashg.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The majority of Genetic Counsellors in the UK work in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genetics/services/|title=Genetic testing and counselling|website=nhs.uk|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the 33 Regional Clinical Genetics Services (some re-named Genomic Medicine Centres in England), Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Others work in specialist roles in the NHS, education, policy or research. A minority work in the private sector.

The '''Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors (AGNC)''' is the UK's professional organisation representing genetic counsellors, genetic nurses and non-medical, patient-facing staff working within the discipline of Clinical Genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agnc.org.uk|title=Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors|website=www.agnc.org.uk | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently (March 2018) 330 AGNC members within the UK. The AGNC is one of the constituent groups of the British Society for Genetic Medicine (BSGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsgm.org.uk|title=British Society for Genetic Medicine|website=www.bsgm.org.uk | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 2 year MSc in Genetic Counselling program established in the UK was from the [[University of Manchester]] 1992, followed by [[Cardiff University]] in Wales in 2000. 2016 saw major changes in the way genetic counsellors are trained in England. A 3-year training programme funded by Health Education England, the Scientist Training Programme (STP) uses a combination of work-based training in Genomic Medicine Centres and a part time MSc in Genetics (Genomic Counselling) from the University of Manchester. Recruitment is performed nationally through the National School of Healthcare Science (NSHCS). A 3-year part time MSc in Genetic and Genomic Counselling is also now delivered by Cardiff University, through blended learning, with most of the teaching delivered online, alongside some short face-to-face teaching blocks in Wales. A 2-year MSc Genetic and Genomic Counselling program began at the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland in 2016. Prerequisites for acceptance on all the programmes include a degree in a relevant science or a nursing or midwifery qualification, and experience in a caring role.  All genetic counselling training programmes are accredited by the UK Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB) and the European Board of Medical Genetics (EBMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eshg.org/index.php?id=113&amp;L=0|title=European Society of Human Genetics: Training in Genetics|website=www.eshg.org|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic counsellors in the UK are regulated through the Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcrb.org.uk|title=Home - Genetic Counsellor Registration Board|website=Genetic Counsellor Registration Board | access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although currently GCRB registration is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormond KE, Laurino MY, Barlow-Stewart K, Wessels TM, Macaulay S, Austin J, Middleton A | title = Genetic counseling globally: Where are we now? | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–107 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29575600 | pmc = 5947883 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.c.31607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCRB registry was accredited in 2016 by the Professional Standards Authority under its Accredited Registers programme. Over 200 genetic counsellors are currently registered through the GCRB. Genetic Counsellors trained through the STP programme are expected to be eligible to apply for statutory regulation through the Health Care Professions Council and it is planned that soon there will be equivalence arrangements with the GCRB to ensure statutory regulation for GCRB registered genetic counsellors.

The '''Hatfield–McCoy feud''' or the '''Hatfield–McCoy war''' as some papers at the time called it, involved two rural families of the [[West Virginia]]–[[Kentucky]] area along the [[Tug Fork]] of the [[Big Sandy River (Kentucky-West Virginia)|Big Sandy River]] in the years 1863–1891. The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield]] while the McCoys of Kentucky were under the leadership of [[Randolph McCoy|Randolph "Ole Ran'l" McCoy]]. Those involved in the feud were descended from Ephraim Hatfield (born&amp;nbsp;{{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1765) and William McCoy (born&amp;nbsp;{{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1750). The feud has entered the American folklore lexicon as a metonym for any bitterly feuding rival parties. More than a century later, the feud has become synonymous with the perils of family honor, justice, and revenge.

William McCoy, the patriarch of the McCoys, was born in Ireland around 1750 and many of his ancestors hailed from Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hausegenealogy.com/mccoy.html |title=McCoy Family Genealogy |work=hausegenealogy.com |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family, led by grandson Randolph McCoy, lived mostly on the [[Kentucky]] side of Tug Fork (a tributary of the Big Sandy River).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&amp;tree=MASTER |title=From Roots to Nuts: Hatfield Thomas, I |work=Genfan.com |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924021439/http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&amp;tree=MASTER |archivedate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hatfields, led by William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield, son of Ephraim and Nancy (Vance) Hatfield, lived mostly on the West Virginia side. The majority of the Hatfields, although living in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]] (then part of [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]]), West Virginia, fought on the Confederate side in the [[American Civil War]]; most McCoys, living in [[Pike County, Kentucky]], also fought for the Confederates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/05/29/how-realistic-is-hatfields-and-mccoys/ |title=How Realistic is 'Hatfields and McCoys'? |first=Christopher John |last=Farley |date=May 29, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of Asa Harmon McCoy, who fought for the Union. The first real violence in the feud was the death of Asa Harmon McCoy as he returned from the war, murdered by a group of [[Confederate Home Guard]]s called the Logan Wildcats. Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first, but was later confirmed to have been sick at home at the time of the murder. It was widely believed that his uncle, Jim Vance, a member of the Wildcats, committed the murder.{{sfnp|Pearce|1994|pp=59–60}}

[[File:HatfieldClan.jpg|thumbnail|The Hatfield clan in 1897]]
The Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. Devil Anse Hatfield's [[Logging|timbering]] operation was a source of wealth for his family, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. Ole Ran'l owned a {{convert|300|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. Both families had also been involved in the manufacturing and selling of illegal [[moonshine]].

==Feud==
Asa Harmon McCoy joined the [[45th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Mounted Infantry|45th Kentucky Infantry]] on October 20, 1863. According to his Compiled Service Records, he was "captured by Rebels" on December 5, 1863, and was released four months later to a Union hospital in Maryland. At the time of his capture, he was recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest. During the early months of the Civil War he joined a company of the Pike County Home Guards, under the command of Uriah Runyon, and it is thought he sustained the wound while serving in this unit. William Francis also led a company of Pike County Guards during 1862 and a group of his guards attacked and shot Mose Christian Cline, a friend of Devil Anse Hatfield. Although Cline survived his wounds, Anse Hatfield vowed to retaliate against the responsible parties. Some time in 1863, a group of Confederate Home Guards ambushed and killed William Francis as he was leaving his house, and Anse Hatfield took credit for the deed. Uriah Runyon later joined the [[39th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry|39th Kentucky Infantry]] and was killed on May 7, 1864, in Pike County, Kentucky. His Compiled Service Records say "Killed by Rebels". On muster rolls beginning on May 6, 1864, Asa Harmon McCoy is reported in a Lexington hospital, suffering from a leg fracture. Beginning in December 1864, the 45th Kentucky Infantry began mustering its regiments out of service. Asa Harmon's Company E was mustered out on December 24, 1864, in Ashland, Kentucky. He was killed near his home on January 7, 1865, just thirteen days after leaving the Union Army. A group of Confederate guerillas took credit for the killing and his wife's pension application states that he was "killed by Rebels". There are no existing records pertaining to his death and no warrants were issued in connection with the murder. McCoy family tradition points to James "Jim" Vance, an uncle of Anse Hatfield and a member of a West Virginia Militia group, as the culprit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The McCoys: Their Story |first=Truda |last=Williams McCoy |publisher=Press of the Preservation Council of Pike County |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-91681-400-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |item=Fold 3 |collection=Compiled Service Records of Union Soldiers 1861–1865 |institution=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] |location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wayne County, West Virginia in the Civil War |first=Jack L. |last=Dickinson |year=2003 |publisher=Higginson Book Co. |isbn=978-0-74044-086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Clines and Allied Families of The Tug River Valley |first=Cecil L. |last=Cline |year=1998 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Gateway Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred thirteen years later, in 1878, after a dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield, a cousin of Devil Anse's, had the hog, but Randolph McCoy claimed it was his,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/crime/hatfieldmccoy01.html |title=Hatfield-McCoy Feud 75 Years Old Today |first=Shirley |last=Donnelly |newspaper=[[The Register-Herald|Beckley Post-Herald]] |date=August 7, 1957 |via=WV Culture.org |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the notches on the pig's ears were McCoy, not Hatfield, marks.

In June 1880, Staton was killed by two McCoy brothers, Sam and Paris, who were later [[acquitted]] on the grounds of [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]].
[[File:Matewan West Virginia floodwall.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|A section of the [[flood wall]] along the [[Tug Fork]] in [[Matewan, West Virginia]], constructed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], depicts the Hatfield–McCoy feud.]]

The feud escalated after Roseanna McCoy entered a relationship with Devil Anse Hatfield's son Johnson, known as "Johnse" (spelled "Jonce" in some sources), leaving her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse Hatfield was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky [[rum-running|bootlegging]] warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Devil Anse, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported the next day to the county seat in [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]], Kentucky. Despite what was seen as her betrayal of her own family on his behalf, Johnse Hatfield thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna for her cousin, Nancy McCoy, whom he wed in 1881.

The feud continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of Devil Anse, was killed by three of Roseanna McCoy's younger brothers: Tolbert, Pharmer, and Bud.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0807.html&lt;/ref&gt; On an election day in Kentucky, the three McCoy brothers fought a drunken Ellison and his other brother; Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a gunshot. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield constables and were taken to Pikeville for trial. Secretly, Devil Anse Hatfield organized a large group of followers and intercepted the constables and their McCoy prisoners before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia, to await the fate of mortally wounded Ellison Hatfield and when Ellison died from his injuries, the McCoy brothers were killed by the Hatfields' vigilante justice in turn: being tied to [[Asimina|pawpaw]] bushes, where each was shot numerous times with a total of 50 shots fired. Their bodies were described as "bullet-riddled".{{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=26}}

Even though the Hatfields and most inhabitants of the area believed their revenge was warranted, up to about twenty men, including Devil Anse, were indicted. All of the Hatfields eluded arrest; this angered the McCoy family, who took their cause up with Perry Cline. Cline was married to Martha McCoy. Historians believe that Cline used his political connections to reinstate the charges and announced rewards for the Hatfields' arrest as an act of revenge. A few years prior, Cline lost a lawsuit against Devil Anse over the deed to thousands of acres of land, subsequently increasing the hatred between the two families. In 1886, Jeff McCoy killed a mail carrier named Fred Wolford, and the man who went to pursue him for his crime was acting constable Cap Hatfield. Cap and a friend named Tom Wallace shot him while on the run on the banks of Tug River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kleber |first=John |encyclopedia=The Kentucky Encyclopedia |title=Hatfields and McCoys |date=May 18, 1992 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-81311-772-0 |page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Wallace was soon found dead in the spring of 1887. The feud reached its peak during the 1888 New Year's Night Massacre. Cap Hatfield and Jim Vance led several members of the Hatfield clan to surround the McCoy cabin and opened fire on the sleeping family.&lt;ref name=History.com&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hatfield and McCoy Feud |url=http://www.history.com/shows/hatfields-and-mccoys/articles/the-hatfield-mccoy-feud |work=[[History.com]] |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin was set on fire in an effort to drive Randolph McCoy into the open. He escaped by making a break for it, but two of his children were shot and his wife was beaten and almost killed. With his house burning, Randolph and his remaining family members were able to escape to the woods; his children, unprepared for the elements, suffered [[frostbite]]. The remaining McCoys moved to Pikeville to escape the West Virginia raiding parties.

===Battle of the Grapevine Creek===
{{main|Battle of the Grapevine Creek}}
Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families. On one occasion, the governors of West Virginia and Kentucky even threatened to have their militias invade each other's states. In response, Kentucky Governor [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|S. B. Buckner]] sent his [[Adjutant General]] Sam Hill to Pike County to investigate the situation.&lt;ref name=SamHill&gt;{{cite web |title=What in Sam Hill ... started the Hatfield and McCoy Feud?

The posse's first victim was Jim Vance, who was killed in the woods after he refused to be arrested. Philipps then made other successive raids on Hatfield homes and supporters and captured three before cornering the rest in Grapevine Creek on 19 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hatfieldmccoycountry.com/feud/ |title=The Hatfield McCoy Feud |work=Hatfield and McCoy Country |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210044513/http://hatfieldmccoycountry.com/feud/ |archive-date=December 10, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Philipps, Devil Anse and other Hatfields were waiting for them with an armed group of their own.

===Trial===
Because of issues of [[due process]] and illegal [[extradition]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] became involved (''Mahon v. Justice'', 127 U.S. 700 (1888)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=127&amp;invol=700 |title=Mahon v. Justice, 127 U.S. 700 (1888) |work=Findlaw.com |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Kentucky, holding that, even if a fugitive is returned from the asylum state illegally, instead of through lawful extradition procedure, no federal law prevents him from being tried. Eventually, the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received [[life imprisonment]], while the eighth, Ellison "Cottontop" Mounts, was executed by [[hanging]].{{sfnp|Rice|1982|p=111}} Thousands attended the hanging in Pikeville.
* Valentine "Uncle Wall" Hatfield, elder brother of Devil Anse, was overshadowed by Devil Anse's ambitions but was one of the eight convicted, dying in prison of unknown causes. He petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery, which has since been paved over.
* [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield]], the younger and more militant brother of Valentine Hatfield, led the clan in most of their combative endeavors.
* Doc D. Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, one of the eight Hatfields convicted, served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son, Melvin.
* Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, served 14 years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife, who had remarried but left her second husband to live with Pliant again.

Fighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts. Trials continued for years until the 1901 trial of Johnse Hatfield, the last of the feud trials.

==Hatfields and McCoys in the modern era==
In 1979, the families united for a special week's taping of the popular game show ''[[Family Feud]]'', in which they played for a cash prize and a pig which was kept on stage during the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game Show Network airs milestone episodes, including Hatfield–McCoy battle |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_July_11/ai_76459805}}&lt;/ref&gt; The McCoy family won the week-long series three games to two. While the Hatfield family won more money – $11,272 to the McCoys' $8,459—the decision was made to augment the McCoy family's winnings to $11,273.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kT8bRuLXwY |title="Family Feud" episode clip |work=YouTube |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourists travel to parts of West Virginia and Kentucky each year to see the areas and historic relics which remain from the days of the feud. In 1999, a large project known as the "Hatfield and McCoy Historic Site Restoration" was completed, funded by a federal grant from the [[Small Business Administration]]. Many improvements to various feud sites were completed. A committee of local historians spent months researching reams of information to find out about the factual history of the events surrounding the feud. This research was compiled in an audio [[compact disc]], the ''Hatfield–McCoy Feud Driving Tour'', which is only available at the Pike County Tourism CVB Visitors Center in Pikeville, Kentucky. The CD is a self-guided driving tour of the restored feud sites and includes maps and pictures as well as the audio CD. The driving tour leads visitors to feud related points of interest including the gravesites of the feudists, the "Hog Trial Cabin", also known and Valentine Hatfield's cabin, Randolph McCoy's homeplace and well in Hardy, Kentucky, Aunt Betty's House and many more sites, some complete with historical markers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tourpikecounty.com/things-to-see-do/history_culture/hatfields_and_mccoys/ |title=Hatfields and McCoys Feud Tour |last=Shepherd |first=Jay |date=May, 2012 |publisher=Pike County Tourism CVB |quote=The Hatfield and McCoy Driving Tour is a self-guided tour that includes all historic sites, both in Kentucky and West Virginia, of the feud.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great-great-great grandsons of feud patriarch Randolph McCoy, Bo McCoy of [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and his cousin, Ron McCoy of [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], organized a historic joint [[family reunion]] of the Hatfield and McCoy families in 2000.

In 2002, Bo and Ron McCoy brought a [[lawsuit]] to acquire access to the McCoy Cemetery which holds the graves of six family members, including five slain during the feud. The McCoys took on a private property owner, John Vance, who had restricted access to the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-29/news/0301290352_1_hatfields-family-feud-cemetery |title=Hatfields, McCoys trade shots in court |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 29, 2003 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, a {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} [[all-terrain vehicle]] trail system, the [[Hatfield–McCoy Trails]], was created around the theme of the feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/trailNRT/HatfieldMcCoy-WV.html |title=Hatfield–McCoy Regional Recreation Area |work=National Recreation Trails |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2003, in [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]], Kentucky, the McCoy cousins partnered with Reo Hatfield of [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], to declare an official truce between the families. Reo Hatfield said that he wanted to show that if the two families could reach an accord, others could also. He had said that he wanted to send a broader message to the world that when national security is at risk, Americans put their differences aside and stand united: "We're not saying you don't have to fight because sometimes you do have to fight," he said. "But you don't have to fight forever." Signed by more than sixty descendants during the fourth Hatfield–McCoy Festival, the truce was touted as a proclamation of peace, saying "We ask by God's grace and love that we be forever remembered as those that bound together the hearts of two families to form a family of freedom in America." [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[Paul E. Patton]] of Kentucky and [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Bob Wise]] of West Virginia signed proclamations declaring June 14 Hatfield and McCoy Reconciliation Day. Ron McCoy, one of the festival's founders, said it is unknown where the three signed proclamations will be exhibited. "The Hatfields and McCoys symbolize violence and feuding and fighting, but by signing this, hopefully people will realize that's not the final chapter", he said.

In 2011, the ''Hatfields and McCoys Dinner Show'', a musical comedy production, opened in the resort community of [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]], [[Tennessee]], near the entrance to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].

The Hatfield and McCoy Reunion Festival and Marathon are held annually in June on a three-day weekend. The events take place in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]], [[Matewan, West Virginia]], and [[Williamson, West Virginia]]. The festival commemorates the famed feud and includes a marathon and half-marathon (the motto is "no feudin', just runnin'"), in addition to an ATV ride in all three towns. There is also a tug-of-war across the Tug Fork tributary near which the feuding families lived, a live re-enactment of scenes from their most famous fight, a motorcycle ride, live entertainment, Hatfield–McCoy landmark tours, a cornbread contest, pancake breakfast, arts, crafts, and dancing. Launched in 2000, the festival typically attracts thousands with more than 300 runners taking part in the races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Hatfield and McCoy Reunion Festival and Marathon |title=Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary |location=Detroit |publisher=Omnigraphics, Inc |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September of 2018, a wooden statue, standing over 8 feet tall, was erected in honor of Randolph McCoy at the McCoy homeplace in Hardy, Kentucky. Carved by chainsaw carver Travis Williams and donated to the property, this statue was commissioned by McCoy property owner, and Hatfield descendant Bob Scott. The statue was unveiled during Hatfield McCoy Heritage Days in Pike County, Kentucky, an event that occurs every September, and involves the Hatfield and McCoy descendants returning to Pike County to celebrate the peace between the two families. This property, like many others, are open to tourists year-round. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tourpikecounty.com/randolph-mccoy-statue-unveiled-at-the-mccoy-well-hardy-ky/ |title=Randolph McCoy Statue Unveiled at the McCoy Well, Hardy, KY |last=Shepherd |first=Jay |date=September 25, 2018 |publisher=Pike County Tourism CVB |quote=The Randolph McCoy statue stands approximately 8 feet tall, and is situated in such a way to provide visitors with a beautiful photo opportunity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1923 [[Buster Keaton]] comedy ''[[Our Hospitality]]'' centers on the "Canfield–McKay feud," a thinly disguised fictional version of the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

The 1938 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon ''[[A Feud There Was]]'' depicts a feud between two backwoods families, called the Weavers and the McCoys. It features [[Egghead (Looney Tunes)|Egghead]] as a peace activist - going by the name [[Elmer Fudd]] (before he was a hunter) - trying to put an end to the two feuding hillbilly clans.

The 1939 [[Max Fleischer]] cartoon ''[[Musical Mountaineers]]'' has [[Betty Boop]] wander into the territory of the Peters family who are at war with the Hatfields.

The 1946 [[Disney]] cartoon short ''The Martins and the Coys'' in ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' animated feature was another very thinly disguised [[caricature]] of the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

In 1949, the [[Samuel Goldwyn]] feature film ''[[Roseanna McCoy]]'' told the story of the romance between the title character, played by [[Joan Evans (actress)|Joan Evans]], and Johnse Hatfield, played by [[Farley Granger]].

The 1949 [[Screen Songs]] short "Comin' Round the Mountain" features another thinly disguised caricature of the Hatfield–McCoy feud, with cats (called "Catfields") and dogs ("McHounds") fighting each other, until a new school teacher arrives.

In 1950, [[Warner Bros.]] released a spoof of the Hatfield–McCoy feud titled ''[[Hillbilly Hare]]'', featuring [[Bugs Bunny]] interacting with members of the "Martin family", obviously a reference to a family in the other famous Kentucky feud, the [[Rowan County War]] who had been feuding with the "Coy family". When Bugs Bunny is asked, "Be y'all a Martin or be y'all a Coy rabbit?", Bugs answers, "Well, my friends say I'm very coy!" and laughs. The Martin brothers chase Bugs for the rest of the short and are outwitted by him at every turn.

The 1951 [[Abbott and Costello]] feature ''[[Comin' Round the Mountain]]'' features a feud between the Winfields and McCoys.

The 2007 movie ''[[Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud]]'' portrays the feud between the Hatfields and McCoys, but the circumstances of the feud are different.

In 2012, [[Lionsgate Films]] released a direct-to-DVD film titled ''Hatfields &amp; McCoys: Bad Blood'', starring [[Jeff Fahey]], [[Perry King]], and [[Christian Slater]].

===Literature===
Mark Twain's classic novel [[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]] includes a bitter feud between two rival families, the Grangerfords and Sheperdsons.  Many aspects of this feud emulate the Hatfield–McCoy feud (which was actively raging at the time of the book's publication; many readers believe that Twain's inclusion of this element was a satirical protest of both the H&amp;M feud and of needless feuding and death in general), including one of the Grangerfords' daughters' eloping with a young male member of the Sheperdsons, causing the already-hotly-simmering feud to boil over into a frenzied gun-battle in which many lives are lost on both sides.

The Belgian comic book "[[Les Rivaux de Painful Gulch]]" from the series [[Lucky Luke]] by artist [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] and writer [[Rene Goscinny]] features two families named O'Hara's (with big ears) and O'Timmins (with big red noses). They are loosely inspired by the real-life Hatfield-McCoy.

[[Ann Rinaldi]] authored a [[historical novel]] titled ''[[The Coffin Quilt]]'', based on a fictionalized account of the feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0152164502 |title=The Coffin Quilt |publisher=HMH Books for Young Readers |date=April 1, 2001 |isbn=978-0-15216-450-8 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manly Wade Wellman]]'s short story "Old Devlins Was A-Waitin'" has the [[Silver John|protagonist]] calling up the shade of "[[Devil Anse|Old Devlins]]" to settle a conflict on behalf of one of the latter's descendants, although the story takes some liberties with history.

===Television===
''[[The Flintstones]]'' featured a feud between the Hatrocks and the Flintstones in the episode "The Flintstone Hillbillies" (aired January 16, 1964), which was loosely based upon the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

An episode of the Scooby-Doo show “The Ozark Witch Switch” mentions the Hatfields and the McCoys, with the main villain in the episode being from the McCoy family “Witch McCoy” and her hatred for the Hatfields in the episode.

''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' also alluded to the rivalry in an episode called "A Feud is a Feud" (aired December 5, 1960), in which the feud is between the Wakefields and Carters.

The 1968 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon "Feud with a Dude" has the character [[Merlin the Magic Mouse]] trying to make peace with the two families, only to end up as the new target. This short has Hatfield claiming McCoy stole his hen, while McCoy claims Hatfield stole his pig.

A 1975 television movie titled ''The Hatfields and the McCoys'' told a fictionalized version of the story. It starred [[Jack Palance]] as "Devil Anse" Hatfield and [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as "Randall" McCoy.

The two feuding [[Virginia]] families in the 2007 made-for-TV film ''[[Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud]]'' are called Hatfield and McCoy.

The second-season episode ''[[Vanished (NCIS)|Vanished]]'' of ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' takes place in a rural valley in [[Virginia]], the two sides of which are feuding in a manner that [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]] compares to the Hatfields and McCoys.

The eleventh episode of ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' season 7, entitled ''[[Bones (season 7)#ep140|The Family in the Feud]]'', is about a long-running family feud that main character [[Seeley Booth]] likens to the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

From May 28–30, 2012, U.S. television network [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] aired a three-part [[miniseries]] titled ''[[Hatfields &amp; McCoys (miniseries)|Hatfields &amp; McCoys]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sundaygazettemail.com/News/201204140088 |last=Imbrogno |first=Douglas |title=Hatfield &amp; McCoy feud fuels star treatment |newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]] |date=April 14, 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606025936/http://sundaygazettemail.com/News/201204140088 |archive-date=June 6, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Kevin Costner]] as William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield and co-starring [[Bill Paxton]] as Randolph "Ole Ran'l" McCoy, [[Tom Berenger]] as Jim Vance, and [[Powers Boothe]] as Judge Valentine "Wall" Hatfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/hatfields-and-mccoys |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125202716/http://www.history.com/hatfields-and-mccoys |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 25, 2013 |title=Hatfields &amp; McCoys |work=History.com |accessdate=April 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The miniseries set the record as the most-watched entertainment telecast in the history of advertising-supported basic cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hatfields &amp; McCoys' is a ratings record-setter |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57445267/hatfields-mccoys-is-a-ratings-record-setter/ |work=Associated Press |date=June 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605030202/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57445267/hatfields-mccoys-is-a-ratings-record-setter/ |archivedate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[NBC]] commissioned a pilot for a television show updating the feud to present-day [[Pittsburgh]] with [[Rebecca De Mornay]], [[Virginia Madsen]], [[Sophia Bush]], and [[James Remar]] but it was not picked up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/deception-canceled-nbc-90271/ |title=NBC passes on 'Hatfields,' six other pilots, cancels 'Deception' |work=[[TheWrap]] |first1=Tim |last1=Kenneally |first2=Tim |last2=Molloy |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2013, the reality television series ''Hatfields &amp; McCoys: White Lightning'' premiered on the History channel. The series begins with an investor offering to set up the feuding families into business making moonshine, and follows the families' attempt to run the business together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html |title=What's On Thursday |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Kathryn |last=Shattuck |date=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of ''[[Modern Family]]'' originally aired January 15, 2014, titled "[[Under Pressure (Modern Family)|Under Pressure]]," Cam is working as a gym teacher who has plans to let parents play [[dodgeball]] with each other at the school's open house, and wants to divide the two teams into Hatfields and McCoys. The school principal frowns upon this idea, however, Gloria and a competitive mother played by [[Jane Krakowski]] decide to settle their score with such a game. Hurriedly Cam proclaims Hatfields for one side and McCoys for the other.

The [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' featured an episode titled "The Hooffields and McColts", in which two clans have a longstanding feud over whether to use land for farming or construction. A similar theme was covered in [[List of Littlest Pet Shop episodes|Season 3, episode 9]] of ''[[Littlest Pet Shop (2012 TV series)|Littlest Pet Shop]]'', "Feud for Thought", in which two koalas are at odds with each other but don't know why, other than that their owners are in a feud.

In [[Bonanza]] The Gunmen (season 1, episode 19) Joe and Hoss were mistaken for two gunmen called Sladeboys that were hired by Mcfadden (McCoy) to take out the Hatfields in the small Texas town of Kiowa Flats.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}

===Role playing games===

In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', the Alliance starting zone of Elwynn Forest features two feuding farmer families called the McClure and the Stonefield and a pig they are fighting over, a reference to the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

In the action RPG ''[[Borderlands 2]]'', the game features two rivaling families (clans), the Hodunks and Zafords, and many fans believe this is a reference to the Hatfield–McCoy feud. This idea is supported by the add-on ''[[Borderlands 2#Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre|Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre]]'', in which a member of each clan is to be married, a likely reference to the marriage of Nancy McCoy and Johnson Hatfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/9408/20140211/borderlands-2-news-latest-headhunter-pack-mad-moxxi-wedding-day.htm |title=Borderlands 2 News: Latest Headhunter Pack, Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre, Out Today |first=Luke |last=Caulfield |work=Gamenguide |date=February 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
"The Legend of Bad Jim" is a song by the rock band Majungas, which is dedicated to Jim Vance and his influence in the Hatfield/McCoy rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.majungastheband.com |title=Majungas |work=majungastheband.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hear-the-roar/id931340299 |title=Hear the Roar |work=iTunes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)]]" written by [[Bobby Emmons]] and [[Chips Moman]], sung by [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]], makes mention of the Hatfield/McCoy feud.

The song 'A Summer Vacation' by Ice Cube mention the event and explains it as senseless violence in which lives are unnecessarily lost. While comparing to the events going on in his life by gang violence.

The song The Hatfield and the McCoy's was written and sung by Eddie Martin a Bristol-based musician and regular at the Famous Old Duke. It is track 8 on Pillowcase Blues

In 2018, Mountain Fever Records released a single from their album from Dave Adkins, "Right Or Wrong".  The song, "Blood Feud", Written by Dave Adkins and Larry Cordle, is a retelling of the familiar story of the deadly discord between the Hatfield and McCoy families during the Civil War era.

[[Shaun]] and [[Marty McCoy]] of the West Virginia rock band [[Bobaflex]] are direct descendants of the McCoy family.

===Video Games===

In the multiplayer FPS ""Team Fortress 2" the core component of the story is that two rival brothers, Redmond Mann and Blutarch Mann, have been fighting for the properties granted to them by their father Zepheniah Mann for years, hiring different mercenaries to carry out the operations. This is similar to a family feud with the exception that it takes place in a single family.



The third chapter of “Red Dead Redemption 2” features two feuding Southern families called the Grays and Braithwaites.  Both families task the player character in carrying out attacks on one another. This plotline also features a forbidden romance reminiscent of Johnse Hatfield and Roseanne McCoy.

'''Henry Chakava''' (born 26 April 1946) is a [[Kenya]]n publisher. He has focused on the publication of books particularly in [[East Africa]] and has been called "the father of Kenyan publishing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-tkyk8Q4gI "JSO INTERVIEW, HENRY CHAKAVA, 23RD MAY PART 1"], YouTube, 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wanjala |first1=chris |title=Going down memory lane with doyen of publishing |url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/weekend/Going-down-memory-lane-with-doyen-of-publishing/1220-3133954-10yykwk/index.html |work=Daily Nation |issue=25 March 2016 |language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his contribution to educational and cultural literature in his region, he has received several awards.

== Life ==
Henry Miyinzi Chakava&lt;ref&gt;"Chakava, Henry Miyinzi", in ''Africa Who's Who'', London: Africa Journal for Africa Books Ltd, 1981, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Vokoli]], [[Vihiga District]]. He began his career after completing his study in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chakava, [http://www.bellagiopublishingnetwork.com/newsletter25/chakava.htm "Dealing with the British"], ''BPN Newsletter'', Issue No 25, July 1999, Bellagio Publishing Network.&lt;/ref&gt; First he was editor and subsequently chief editor in [[Nairobi]] of the international publishing house [[Heinemann Educational Books]], where he was involved in the publication and promotion of high-profile African writers including [[Ali Mazrui]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Marjorie Oludhe Macgoye]], [[Meja Mwangi]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] and [[Okot p'Bitek]].&lt;ref name="PCA"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/238 profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCFCV"&gt;Prince Claus Awards (2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/awards/documents/HenryChakavaCV.pdf |title=CV |accessdate=2013-02-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705022106/http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/awards/documents/HenryChakavaCV.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OBU"&gt;Oxford Brookes University, [http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/honorary/profiles/henry_chakava biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Chakava took over the Kenyan establishment and went further under the name East African Educational Publishers. Later, he expanded his business with establishments in [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OBU" /&gt;

He published a great number of educational and cultural books that have had a major importance in eastern Africa. For instance, he published the school books for primary and tertiary education that signified an important renewal in view of the subjects that were written from an African perspective. Previously, school books had been influenced greatly by a Western viewpoint.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

Also in the cultural field, Chakava came with innovating publications. Besides books in the [[English language]], he published in local languages, at a time when local languages were still seen by governments and authorities as state subversive. Furthermore he published books with a critic stance on local governments. Challenging the boundaries of the [[freedom of expression]], he took great risks and in fact, was repeatedly threatened.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

Moreover, he took the lead over the African Publishing Institute, and maintained contacts with important publishers in [[Oxford]], [[England]], such as the African Books Collective and Bellagio Publishing Network. Henry Chakava is also a visiting lecturer at the [[Oxford Brookes University]].&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

He is the author of the 1996 book ''Publishing in Africa: One Man's Perspective'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanbookscollective.com/authors-editors/henry-chakava Henry Chakava page] at African Books Collective.&lt;/ref&gt; for which Chinua Achebe wrote a brief introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyanpoet.com/2013/03/30/remembering-chinua-achebe-dr-henry-chakava/ "Remembering Chinua Achebe; Dr.Henry Chakava"], ''Kenya Poet'', 30 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate Henry Chakava's 70th birthday, a number of key personalities in the publishing world have authored a book, '''''Coming of Age: Strides in African Publishing''''', published by East African Educational Publishers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. The new release, published in April 2016, is a collection of essays in honour of Dr Henry Chakava @70. 

== Recognition ==
Chakava received several awards. Here follows a selection:&lt;ref name="PCFCV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OBU" /&gt;
*1984: Award for extraordinary service to Kenya, by the Kenyan Head of State
*2000: [[Zimbabwe International Book Fair]] Award
*2005: [[Honorary doctorate]] of [[Oxford Brookes University]]
*2006: [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]]

'''''Human Capital Supply Chain''''' is a book by Tim Giehl and Sara Moss.

==Origin of term==
"Human capital supply chain" refers to the integration of business planning, strategic [[workforce planning]], staffing and recruiting processes and technology to enhance corporate productivity and profitability. Employing methods of common manufacturing and distribution [[supply chain management]] principles to [[human resources]] and [[human capital]], corporations create an end-to-end, human capital supply chain.

The term was introduced in the 2009 book, ''Human Capital Supply Chains''. The concept consolidates 30 years of expertise by companies like [[Toyota]], [[Wal-Mart]], and [[Dell]] in [[total quality management]], lean and strategic supplier relationships, and applies it to the human resources industry. The major aim when implementing a human capital supply chain is to reduce labor costs. While that is attained in the short-term, the long-term tuning of the supply chain can result in growth and strategic competitive advantage.

== Career ==
[[File:Olympic dam rd1.jpg|thumb|Monument marking the first hole drilled into the Olympic Dam IOCGU deposit (commenced 13 June 1975).]]
Duncan joined Western Mining Corporation (WMC Resources) in 1971 and remained with the company for 27 years. He commenced as operations manager of the company's exploration division, and rose to General Manager of the [[Olympic Dam mine]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessnews.com.au/article/Duncan-joins-Energy-Ventures|title=Duncan joins Energy Ventures|date=2005-10-11|work=Business News|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Nuclear power ==
During the 2000s and 2010s, Duncan advocated for the development of [[nuclear power in Australia]].  

In 2005, Duncan described the status of breeder reactors as seeing "little advancement". He told the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] that "There is abundant uranium to meet all future requirements for light water reactors that are planned around the world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That year he also became a non-executive director of Perth-based company, Energy Ventures Ltd.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, the company owns various uranium and energy exploration and development projects in Australia and internationally. The most advanced of these is the Aurora Uranium project in Oregon, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/ASX:EVE/Energy-Ventures-/timeline/|title=Proactive Investors Limited - Energy Ventures Share Price - EVE, RNS News, Articles, Quotes, &amp; Charts (ASX:EVE, EVE.AX)|work=Proactiveinvestors UK|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Duncan described opponents of nuclear power as often using the subject of nuclear waste as a "tool". He argued that "due to global progress and example, the disposal of nuclear waste need not be a showstopper for nuclear power in Australia."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

In 2009, Duncan told ''[[The Age]]'' that he thought it was "time to seriously think about nuclear power as part of the baseload electricity generation. It's time that we moved along from the caveman attitude of just picking up and burning things. We should move to a higher order of source of energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au//breaking-news-national/its-time-for-nuclear-power-experts-20090715-dlac.html|title=It's time for nuclear power: experts|last=Alexander|first=Cathy|date=2009-07-15|work=The Age|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also referred to nuclear power as clean electricity with virtually no greenhouse gas emissions. He estimated that Australia's first nuclear power station could cost $6-8 billion and take ten years to design, build and commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/garretts-beds-are-burning-critics-20090715-dkn5.html|title=Garrett's beds are burning: critics|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Duncan spoke at an event in Western Australia hosted by CEDA entitled "Assessing the Prospects of Nuclear Power in Australia". Michael Angwin of the [[Australian Uranium Association]] and Daniela Stehlik of the [[National Academies Forum]] also spoke at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceda.com.au/Events/Library/Past-Events1/W100419|title=CEDA - Assessing the Prospects of Nuclear Power in Australia|website=www.ceda.com.au|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Duncan told an Australian Institute of Energy Syposium held by the Perth Branch that he predicted that Australia's first nuclear reactors would be [[Light-water reactor|light-water reactors]] with a 600–1200 MWe capacity each, built in pairs, with sea water cooled condensers. They would be fueled with [[enriched uranium]] and [[spent nuclear fuel]] would ultimately be disposed of into ancient and stable underground rock storage facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aie.org.au/AIE/Documents/Vol28No3.pdf|title=Nuclear: The elephant in the energy room|last=Meaton|first=Claire|date=2010-09-01|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Fukushima ===
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]], Duncan remained optimistic about the prospect of nuclear power in Australia.

In 2013, he wrote that "if the economics for electricity generation is impacted by a carbon tax or a compulsory carbon capture and sequestration, then nuclear generation will be economically competitive."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atse.org.au/Documents/Events/nuclear-energy-australia/ab-duncan-ian.pdf|title=Nuclear Regulator for Australia|last=Duncan|first=Ian|date=|website=|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At a conference entitled "Nuclear Power for Australia?" held by ATSE in July of that year, he argued that if Australia were to aspire to produce electricity with nuclear power plants, a new Commonwealth agency 'inspectorate' with regulatory control over the choice of technology, siting, construction and operation should be established by 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He proposed the working title Nuclear Installations Regulator for Australia (NIRA) and presented a detailed timeline of potential milestones to achieve between 2013 and criticality for the first reactor in 2030. His presentation flagged "Restart nuclear debate" as a first step, during the period 2014-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atse.org.au/Documents/Events/nuclear-energy-australia/pr-duncan-ian.pdf|title=Nuclear Installations Regulator for Australia (NIRA)|last=Duncan|first=Ian|date=2017-07-01|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, a [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] commenced in South Australia tasked with investigating the opportunities and risks associated with South Australia's future role in the nuclear fuel cycle. Duncan's submission to the Royal Commission identified areas of the state's coastline he believed were potentially suitable for the siting of nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/the-nuclear-royal-commission-has-drawn-submissions-from-around-the-world-with-strong-opinions-on-both-sides-of-the-debate/news-story/ed38c38ffdef74da61ea134748b35224|title=SA Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission draws submissions from around the world|last=England|first=Cameron|date=2015-08-11|work=The Advertiser|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Nuclear waste ==
Duncan was a Member of the [[Synroc|SYNROC]] Steering Committee (whose work was based on research and development undertaken by ANSTO and the ANU).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

In 2002, after his retirement, Duncan completed a doctorate at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] considering the "interface between society and the disposal of radioactive waste". His publication was entitled "''Radioactive Waste: Risk, Reward, Space and Time Dynamics"'' and he followed it with opinion pieces and media commentary on the subject during the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2003 he anticipated that "by far the biggest advancement will come from a better understanding of the public psyche by industry and not by a better understanding of the industry by the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atse.org.au/publications/focus/focus-duncan2.htm|title=What to do with Nuclear Waste|date=2003-10-08|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008170237/http://www.atse.org.au/publications/focus/focus-duncan2.htm|archivedate=2003-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he made the claim that "the Premier that supports the siting of a national repository will probably be remembered as the statesman who cleaned up Australia!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the mid-2000s Duncan was actively consulting in the area,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atse.org.au/index9729.html|title=ATSE - Duncan 140|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/30565/20071029-0000/www.atse.org.au/index9729.html|archivedate=2007-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/expert/realexpert/nuclearpower/07.htm|title=Nuclear Power - Ask a Real Expert - Ask an expert - The Lab - Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Gateway to Science|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was consulted during the Uranium Mining, Processing and Nuclear Energy Review (UMPNER) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=URANIUM MINING, PROCESSING AND NUCLEAR ENERGY — OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIA?|last=|first=|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2006|isbn=0-9803115-0-0|location=Canberra, ACT|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Duncan maintained the view that Australia had an obligation to appropriately manage its own, domestically produced nuclear waste. In an article published in ''Focus'', the magazine of ATSE, he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no justification for the importation of other countries’ radioactive waste, nor for participation in any so called ‘international attempts’ at nuclear waste disposal. Our moral obligation is to properly dispose of our own waste and that is achievable."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2015 Duncan was appointed to the Independent Advisory Panel of the National Radioactive Waste Management Project for the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]. 

In September 2016, Duncan gave a presentation on the work of the Royal Commission and the National Radioactive Waste Management Project to members of the Minerals, Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Division of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. During his talk he mentioned that 40 years had transpired since the [[Flower's Report]] was published in the UK, which prompted environmental consideration of the fate of nuclear wastes and their future management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iom3.org/sites/default/files/MP%26EM%20Newsletter_Issue%205_March%202017.pdf|title=MP&amp;EM Newsletter Issue 5 : March 2017|last=Brooks|first=Mike|date=2017-03-01|website=|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
ICS consists of a standard management hierarchy and procedures for 
managing temporary incident(s) of any size.  ICS procedures should be pre-established and sanctioned by participating authorities, and personnel should be well-trained prior to an incident.

ICS includes procedures to select and form temporary management hierarchies
to control funds, personnel, facilities, equipment, and communications.
Personnel are assigned according to established standards and procedures previously sanctioned by participating authorities.
ICS is a system designed to be used or applied from the time an incident occurs until the requirement for management and operations no longer exist.

ICS is interdisciplinary and organizationally flexible to meet the following management challenges:
* Meets the needs of a jurisdiction to cope with incidents of any kind or complexity (i.e. it expands or contracts as needed).
* Allows personnel from a wide variety of agencies to meld rapidly into a common management structure with common terminology.
* Provide logistical and administrative support to operational staff.
* Be cost effective by avoiding duplication of efforts, and continuing overhead.
* Provide a unified, centrally authorized emergency organization.

==History==
The ICS concept was formed in 1968 at a meeting of Fire Chiefs in Phoenix, Arizona. The program was built primarily to take after the management hierarchy of the US Navy and it was mainly for fire fighting of wildfires in California and Arizona. During the 1970s, ICS was fully developed during massive [[wildfire suppression]] efforts in California ([[FIRESCOPE]]) that followed a series of catastrophic wildfires, starting with the massive [[Laguna fire]] in 1970. Property damage ran into the millions, and many people died or were injured. Studies determined that response problems often related to communication and management deficiencies rather than lack of resources or failure of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaknesses in incident management were often due to:
* Lack of accountability, including unclear [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and supervision.
* Poor communication due to both inefficient uses of available communications systems and conflicting codes and terminology.
* Lack of an orderly, systematic planning process.
* No predefined methods to integrate inter-agency requirements into the management structure and planning process effectively.
* Freelancing by individuals within the first responding team without the direction from team leader (IC) and those with specialized skills during an incident without coordination with other first responders
* Lack of knowledge with common terminology during an incident.

Emergency Managers determined that the existing [[management]] structures — frequently unique to each agency — did not scale to dealing with massive [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] responses involving dozens of distinct agencies and when these various agencies worked together their specific training and procedures clashed. As a result, a new [[command and control]] [[paradigm]] was collaboratively developed to provide a consistent, integrated framework for the management of all incidents from small incidents to large, [[multi-agency]] emergencies.

It should be noted that at the beginning of this work, despite the recognition that there were incident or field level shortfalls in organization and terminology, there was no mention of the need to develop an on the ground incident management system like ICS.  Most of the efforts were focused on the multiagency coordination challenges above the incident or field level.  It wasn’t until 1972 when Firefighting Resources of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies (FIRESCOPE) was formed that this need was recognized and the concept of ICS was first discussed.  Also, ICS was originally called Field Command Operations System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

ICS became a national model for command structures at a fire, crime scene or major incident. ICS was used in New York at the first [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|attack]] on the World Trade Center in 1993. On 1 March 2004, the [[Department of Homeland Security]], in accordance with the passage of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) calling for a standardized approach to incident management amongst all federal, state, and local agencies, developed the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS) which integrates ICS. Additionally, it was mandated that NIMS (and thus ICS) must be utilized to manage emergencies in order to receive federal funding.

The [[Superfund]] Amendment and Re-authorization Act title III mandated that all first responders to a hazardous materials emergency must be properly trained and equipped in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q). This standard represents OSHA's recognition of ICS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

HSPD-5 and thus the National Incident Management System came about as a direct result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, which created numerous All-Hazard, Mass Casualty, multi-agency incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Jurisdiction and legitimacy==
In the United States, ICS has been tested by more than 30 years of emergency and non-emergency applications. All levels of government are required to maintain differing levels of ICS training and private sector organizations regularly use ICS for management of events. ICS is widespread in use from law enforcement to every-day [[business]], as the basic goals of clear [[communication]], [[accountability]], and the efficient use of resources are common to incident and emergency management as well as daily operations. ICS is mandated by law for all [[Hazardous Material]]s responses nationally and for many other emergency operations in most states. In practice, virtually all [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] and disaster response agencies utilize ICS, in part after the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] mandated the use of ICS for [[emergency services]] throughout the [[United States]] as a condition for federal preparedness funding. As part of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]'s [[National Response Plan]] (NRP), the system was expanded and integrated into the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).

ICS is widely used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United Nations]] recommended the use of ICS as an international standard. ICS is also used by agencies in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalhealth.ca/EspeciallyFor/EmergencyPreparedness/IncidentCommandSystem/default.htm Alberta Health Services website on ICS]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand]] has implemented a similar system, known as the [[Coordinated Incident Management System]], [[Australia]] has the [[Australasian Inter-Service Incident Management System]] and [[British Columbia]], Canada, has [[BCERMS]] developed by the [[Emergency Management BC].

In [[Brazil]], ICS is also used by [[The Fire Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro]] (CBMERJ) and by the Civil Defense of the State of Rio de Janeiro in every emergency or large-scale events.

==Basis==
=== Incidents ===&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
Incidents are defined within '''ICS''' as unplanned situations necessitating a response. Examples of incidents may include:
* [[Emergency medical services|Emergency medical situations]] ([[ambulance]] service)
* [[Hazardous material]] spills, releases to the air (toxic chemicals), releases to a drinking water supply
* [[Hostage crisis|Hostage crises]]
* [[Anthropogenic hazard|Man-made disasters]] such as [[Traffic collision|vehicle crashes]], [[industrial accident]]s, train [[derailment]]s, or [[structure fire]]s
* [[Natural disaster]]s such as [[wildfire]]s, [[flood]]ing, [[earthquake]] or [[tornado]]
* [[Public Health]] incidents, such as disease [[outbreak]]s
* [[Search and Rescue]] operations
* [[Technological crisis]]
* [[Terrorism|Terrorist]] attacks
* [[Traffic collision|Traffic incidents]]

===Events===
Events are defined within ICS as planned situations. Incident command is increasingly applied to events both in emergency management and non-emergency management settings. Examples of events may include:
* Concerts
* Parades and other ceremonies
* Fairs and other gatherings
* Training exercises

==Key concepts==

=== Unity of command ===
Each individual participating in the operation reports to only one supervisor. This eliminates the potential for individuals to receive conflicting orders from a variety of supervisors, thus increasing accountability, preventing freelancing, improving the flow of information, helping with the coordination of operational efforts, and enhancing operational safety. This concept is fundamental to the ICS chain of command structure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Emergency management Institute. [http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/IS200%20Lesson%20Summary.pdf "IS-200: ICS for Single Resources and Initial Action Incidents"]. 29 November 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714010117/http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/IS200%20Lesson%20Summary.pdf |date=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common terminology===
Individual response agencies previously developed their protocols separately, and subsequently developed their terminology separately. This can lead to confusion as a word may have a different meaning for each organization.

When different organizations are required to work together, the use of common [[terminology]] is an essential element in team cohesion and communications, both internally and with other organizations responding to the incident.

An incident command system promotes the use of a common terminology and has an associated glossary of terms that help bring consistency to position titles, the description of resources and how they can be organized, the type and names of incident facilities, and a host of other subjects. The use of common terminology is most evident in the titles of command roles, such as ''Incident Commander'', ''Safety Officer'' or ''Operations Section Chief''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

===Management by objective===
Incidents are managed by aiming towards specific objectives. Objectives are ranked by priority; should be as specific as possible; must be attainable; and if possible given a working time-frame. Objectives are accomplished by first outlining strategies (general plans of action), then determining appropriate tactics (how the strategy will be executed) for the chosen strategy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

===Flexible and modular organization===
Incident Command structure is organized in such a way as to expand and contract as needed by the incident scope, resources and hazards. Command is established in a top-down fashion, with the most important and authoritative positions established first. For example, Incident Command is established by the first arriving unit.

Only positions that are required at the time should be established. In most cases, very few positions within the command structure will need to be activated. For example, a single fire truck at a [[dumpster]] fire will have the officer filling the role of IC, with no other roles required. As more trucks get added to a larger incident, more roles will be delegated to other officers and the Incident Commander (IC) role will probably be handed to a more-senior officer.

Only in the largest and most complex operations would the full ICS organization be staffed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Conversely, as an incident scales down, roles will be merged back up the tree until there is just the IC role remaining.

===Span of control===
To limit the number of responsibilities and resources being managed by any individual, the ICS requires that any single person's [[span of control]] should be between three and seven individuals, with five being ideal. In other words, one manager should have no more than seven people working under them at any given time.  If more than seven resources are being managed by an individual, then they are being overloaded and the command structure needs to be expanded by delegating responsibilities (e.g. by defining new sections, divisions, or task forces). If fewer than three, then the position's authority can probably be absorbed by the next highest rung in the chain of command.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Coordination==
One of the benefits of the ICS is that it allows a way to coordinate a set of organizations who may otherwise work together sporadically. While much training material emphasizes the hierarchical aspects of the ICS, it can also be seen as an inter-organizational network of responders. These network qualities allow the ICS flexibility and expertise of a range of organizations. But the network aspects of the ICS also create management challenges. One study of ICS after-action reports found that ICS tended to enjoy higher coordination when there was strong pre-existing trust and working relationships between  members, but struggled when authority of the ICS was contested and when the networks of responders was highly diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moynihan |first= Donald |title=The Network Governance of Crisis Response: Case Studies of Incident Command Systems (2009)|work= Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 19: 895-915 |url=http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/facultystaff/moynihan/JPART194.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coordination on any incident or event is facilitated with the implementation of the following concepts:

===Incident Action Plans===
''Incident Action Plans'' (IAPs) ensure that everyone is working in concert toward the same goals set for that operational period by providing all incident supervisory personnel with direction for actions to be taken during the operational period identified in the plan. Incident Action Plans provide a coherent means of communicating the overall incident objectives for both operational and support activities. They include measurable strategic objectives to be achieved in a time frame called an Operational Period, which may be any interval of time but is commonly 12 hours. They may be verbal or written except for hazardous material incidents where it must be written,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=40 CFR 1910.120(q)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are prepared by the Planning Section.

The consolidated IAP is a very important component of the ICS that reduces freelancing and ensures a coordinated response. At the simplest level, all Incident Action Plans must have four elements:
*What do we want to do?
*Who is responsible for doing it?
*How do we communicate with each other?
*What is the procedure if someone is injured?

The content of the IAP is organized by a number of standardized ICS forms that allow for accurate and precise documentation of an incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Comprehensive resource management===
''Comprehensive resource management'' is a key management principle that implies that all assets and personnel during an event need to be tracked and accounted for. It can also include processes for reimbursement for resources, as appropriate.
Resource management includes processes for:
* Categorizing resources.
* Ordering resources.
* Dispatching resources.
* Tracking resources.
* Recovering resources.

Comprehensive resource management ensures that visibility is maintained over all resources so they can be moved quickly to support the preparation and response to an incident, and ensuring a graceful demobilization. It also applies to the classification of resources by type and kind, and the categorization of resources by their status.
* '''Assigned''' resources are those that are working on a field assignment under the direction of a supervisor.
* '''Available''' resources are those that are ready for deployment(staged), but have not been assigned to a field assignment.
* '''Out-of-service''' resources are those that are not in either the "available" or "assigned" categories. Resources can be "out-of-service" for a variety of reasons including: resupplying after a sortie (most common), shortfall in staffing, personnel taking a rest, damaged or inoperable.

T-Cards ([[ICS 219]], Resource Status Card) are most commonly used to track these resources. The cards are placed in T-Card racks located at an Incident Command Post for easy updating and visual tracking of resource status.

===Integrated communications===
Developing an integrated voice and data communications system, including equipment, systems, and protocols, must occur prior to an incident.

Effective ICS communications include three elements:
* Modes: The "hardware" systems that transfer information.
* Planning: Planning for the use of all available communications resources.
* Networks: The procedures and processes for transferring information internally and externally.

==Composition==

=== Incident commander ===
* Single incident commander - Most incidents involve a single [[incident commander]]. In these incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making final authority.
* Unified Command - A [[Unified Command (ICS)|Unified Command]] involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a single incident commander.  Unified Command is used on larger incidents usually when multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved. A Unified command typically includes a command representative from major involved agencies and/or jurisdictions with one from that group to act as the spokesman, though not designated as an Incident Commander. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note, that in Unified Command the command representatives will appoint a single Operations Section Chief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/NIMS_core.pdf National Incident Management System] - December 2008 Page 51&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Anchor|Area Command}}
* Area command - During multiple-incident situations, an Area Command may be established to provide for Incident Commanders at separate locations. Generally, an Area Commander will be assigned - a single person - and the Area Command will operate as a logistical and administrative support. Area Commands usually do not include an Operations function.

===Command staff===
* Safety officer - The Safety Officer monitors safety conditions and develops measures for assuring the safety of all assigned personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency [http://training.fema.gov/position%20specific%20taskbooks/#safety "FEMA Taskbooks"], ''FEMA'', 28 October 2010, accessed 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public information officer - The Public Information Officer (PIO or IO) serves as the conduit for information to and from internal and external stakeholders, including the media or other organizations seeking information directly from the incident or event. While less often discussed, the Public Information Officer is also responsible for ensuring that an incident's command staff are kept apprised as to what is being said or reported about an incident. This allows public questions to be addressed, rumors to be managed, and ensures that other such public relations issues are not overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency [http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/Glossary.htm#P "FEMA Glossary"], ''FEMA'', 28 October 2010, accessed 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liaison Officer - A Liaison serves as the primary contact for supporting agencies assisting at an incident.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency [http://training.fema.gov/EMIWEB/IS/ICSResource/ICSResCntr_Glossary.htm#L "FEMA Glossary"], ''FEMA'', 28 October 2010, accessed 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Staff===
* Operations Section Chief: Tasked with directing all actions to meet the incident objectives.
* Planning Section Chief: Tasked with the collection and display of incident information, primarily consisting of the status of all resources and overall status of the incident.
* Finance/Administration Section Chief: Tasked with tracking incident related costs, personnel records, requisitions, and administrating procurement contracts required by Logistics.
* Logistics Section Chief: Tasked with providing all resources, services, and support required by the incident.

===200-Level ICS===
At the ICS 200 level, the function of Information and Intelligence is added to the standard ICS staff as an option. This role is unique in ICS as it can be arranged in multiple ways based on the judgement of the Incident Commander and needs of the incident. The three possible arrangements are:
* Information &amp; Intelligence Officer, a position on the command staff.
* Information &amp; Intelligence Section, a section headed by an Information &amp; Intelligence Section Chief, a General Staff position.
* Information &amp; Intelligence Branch, headed by an Information &amp; Intelligence Branch Director, this branch is a part of the Planning Section.

===300-Level ICS===
At the ICS 300 level, the focus is on entry-level management of small-scale, All-Hazards incidents with emphasis on the scalability of ICS. It acts as an introduction to the utilization of more than one agency and the possibility of numerous operational periods. It also involves an introduction to the Emergency Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===400-Level ICS===
At the ICS 400 level, the focus is on large, complex incidents. Topics covered include the characteristics of incident complexity, the approaches to dividing an incident into manageable components, the establishment of an "Area Command", and the MultiAgency Coordination System (MACS).

==Design==

=== Personnel ===
ICS is organized by levels, with the supervisor of each level holding a unique title (e.g. only a person in charge of a Section is labeled "Chief"; a "Director" is exclusively the person in charge of a Branch). Levels (supervising person's title) are:
:* Incident Commander
::* Command Staff Member (Officer)- Command Staff
::* Section (Chief)- General Staff
:::* Branch (Director)
::::* Division (Supervisor) - A Division is a unit arranged by geography, along jurisdictional lines if necessary, and not based on the makeup of the resources within the Division.
::::* Group (Supervisor) - A Group is a unit arranged for a purpose, along agency lines if necessary, or based on the makeup of the resources within the Group.
:::::* Unit, Team, or Force (Leader) - Such as "Communications Unit," "Medical Strike Team," or a "Reconnaissance Task Force." A Strike Team is composed of same resources (four ambulances, for instance) while a Task Force is composed of different types of resources (one ambulance, two fire trucks, and a police car, for instance).
::::::* Individual Resource. This is the smallest level within ICS and usually refers to a single person or piece of equipment. It can refer to a piece of equipment ''and'' operator, and less often to multiple people working together.

===Facilities===
ICS uses a standard set of facility nomenclature. ICS facilities include:
'''Pre-Designated Incident Facilities:''' Response operations can form a complex structure that must be held together by response personnel working at different and often widely separate incident facilities. These facilities can include:

* '''Incident Command Post''' (ICP): The ICP is the location where the Incident Commander operates during response operations. There is only one ICP for each incident or event, but it may change locations during the event. Every incident or event must have some form of an Incident Command Post. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, trailer, tent, or within a building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the present and potential hazard zone but close enough to the incident to maintain command. The ICP will be designated by the name of the incident, e.g., Trail Creek ICP.
* '''Staging Area''': Can be a location at or near an incident scene where tactical response resources are stored while they await assignment. Resources in staging area are under the control status. Staging Areas should be located close enough to the incident for a timely response, but far enough away to be out of the immediate impact zone. There may be more than one Staging Area at an incident. Staging Areas can be collocated with the ICP, Bases, Camps, Helibases, or Helispots.
* A '''Base''' is the location from which primary logistics and administrative functions are coordinated and administered. The Base may be collocated with the Incident Command Post. There is only one Base per incident, and it is designated by the incident name. The Base is established and managed by the Logistics Section. The resources in the Base are always out-of-service.
* '''Camps''': Locations, often temporary, within the general incident area that are equipped and staffed to provide sleeping, food, water, sanitation, and other services to response personnel that are too far away to use base facilities. Other resources may also be kept at a camp to support incident operations if a Base is not accessible to all resources. Camps are designated by geographic location or number. Multiple Camps may be used, but not all incidents will have Camps.
* A '''Helibase''' is the location from which helicopter-centered air operations are conducted. Helibases are generally used on a more long-term basis and include such services as fueling and maintenance. The [[Helibase]] is usually designated by the name of the incident, e.g. Trail Creek Helibase.
* '''Helispots''' are more temporary locations at the incident, where helicopters can safely land and take off. Multiple Helispots may be used.

Each facility has unique location, space, equipment, materials, and supplies requirements that are often difficult to address, particularly at the outset of response operations. For this reason, responders should identify, pre-designate and pre-plan the layout of these facilities, whenever possible.

On large or multi-level incidents, higher-level support facilities may be activated. These could include:

* '''Emergency Operations Center''' (EOC): An emergency operations center is a central command and control facility responsible for carrying out the principles of emergency preparedness and emergency management, or disaster management functions at a strategic level during an emergency, and ensuring the continuity of operation of a company, political subdivision or other organization. An EOC is responsible for the strategic overview, or "big picture", of the disaster, and does not normally directly control field assets, instead making operational decisions and leaving tactical decisions to lower commands. The common functions of all EOC's is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and property, maintain continuity of the organization, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. In most EOC's there is one individual in charge, and that is the Emergency Manager.
* '''Joint Information Center''' (JIC): A JIC is the facility whereby an incident, agency, or jurisdiction can support media representatives. Often co-located - even permanently designated - in a community or state EOC the JIC provides the location for interface between the media and the PIO. Most often the JIC also provides both space and technical assets (Internet, telephone, power) necessary for the media to perform their duties. A JIC very often becomes the "face" of an incident as it is where press releases are made available as well as where many broadcast media outlets interview incident staff. It is not uncommon for a permanently established JIC to have a window overlooking an EOC and/or a dedicated background showing agency logos or other symbols for televised interviews. The National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) at FEMA has both, for example, allowing televised interviews to show action in the NRCC behind the interviewer/interviewee while an illuminated "Department of Homeland Security" sign, prominently placed on the far wall of the NRCC, is thus visible during such interviews.
* '''Joint Operations Center''' (JOC): A JOC is usually pre-established, often operated 24/7/365, and allows multiple agencies to have a dedicated facility for assigning staff to interface and interact with their counterparts from other agencies. Although frequently called something other than a JOC, many locations and jurisdictions have such centers, often where Federal, state, and/or local agencies (often law enforcement) meet to exchange strategic information and develop and implement tactical plans. Large mass gathering events, such as a presidential inauguration, will also utilize JOC-type facilities although they are often not identified as such or their existence even publicized.
* '''Multiple Agency Coordination Center''' (MACC): The MACC is a central command and control facility responsible for the strategic, or "big picture" of a disaster. A MACC is often used when multiple incidents are occurring in one area or are particularly complex for various reasons such as when scarce resources must be allocated across multiple requests. Personnel within the MACC use [[Multi-agency Coordination]] to guide their operations. The MACC coordinates activities between multiple agencies and incidents and does not normally directly control field assets, but makes strategic decisions and leaves tactical decisions to individual agencies. The common functions of all MACC's is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and property, maintain continuity of the government or corporation, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. While often similar to an EOC, the MACC is a separate entity with a defined area or mission and lifespan whereas an EOC is a permanently established facility and operation for a political jurisdiction or agency. EOCs often, but not always, follow the general ICS principles but may utilize other structures or management (such as an Emergency Support Function [ESF] or hybrid ESF/ICS model)schemas. For many jurisdictions the EOC is where elected officials will be located during an emergency and, like a MACC, supports but does not command an incident.

===Equipment===
ICS uses a standard set of equipment nomenclature. ICS equipment include:
* Tanker - This is an aircraft that carries fuel (Fuel Tanker) or water (Water Tanker).
* Tender - Like a tanker, but a ground vehicle, also carrying fuel (Fuel Tender), water (Water Tender), or even [[fire fighting foam]] (Foam Tender).

===Type and kind===
The "type" of resource describes the size or capability of a resource. For instance, a 50&amp;nbsp;kW (for a generator) or a 3-ton (for a truck). Types are designed to be categorized as "Type 1" through "Type 5" formally, but in live incidents more specific information may be used.

The "kind" of resource describes what the resource is. For instance, generator or a truck. The "type" of resource describes a performance capability for a kind of resource for instance,

In both type and kind, the objective must be included in the resource request. This is done to widen the potential resource response. As an example, a resource request for a ''small aircraft for aerial reconnaissance of a search and rescue scene'' may be satisfied by a [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] [[OH-58 Kiowa]] helicopter (Type &amp; Kind: Rotary-wing aircraft, Type II/III) or by a [[Civil Air Patrol]] [[Cessna 182]] (Type &amp; Kind: Fixed-wing aircraft, Type I). In this example, requesting only a fixed-wing or a rotary-wing, or requesting by type may prevent the other resource's availability from being known.

===Command transfer===
A role of responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons: As the incident grows a more qualified person is required to take over as Incident Commander to handle the ever-growing needs of the incident, or in reverse where as an incident reduces in size command can be passed down to a less qualified person (but still qualified to run the now-smaller incident) to free up highly qualified resources for other tasks or incidents. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the incident moves locations or area of responsibility, or normal turnover of personnel due to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a transfer of command briefing, which may be oral, written, or a combination of both.

'''James Franklin''' (February 4, 1697 in [[Boston]] &amp;ndash; February 4, 1735 in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]) was an [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonial]] author, [[printer (publisher)|printer]], [[newspaper]] [[publisher]], and [[almanac]] publisher. James published the ''[[The New-England Courant|New England Courant]]'', one of the oldest and the first truly independent American newspapers.

==Early years==
James was an older brother of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the son of [[Josiah Franklin]], a chandler and businessman from [[Ecton, Northamptonshire|Ecton, Northamptonshire, England]], and Abiah Folger Franklin, who came from a family of [[Nantucket]] [[Puritan]]s. In addition to James, their children included: John (1690&amp;ndash;1756), Peter (1692&amp;ndash;1766), Mary (1694&amp;ndash;ca. 1730), Sarah (1699&amp;ndash;1731), Ebenezer (1701&amp;ndash;1702), Thomas (1703&amp;ndash;1706), [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin]] (1706&amp;ndash;1790), Lydia (1708&amp;ndash;1758), and [[Jane Mecom|Jane]] (1712&amp;ndash;1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/benjaminf/d0/i0000001.htm#i2|title=Fifth Generation |publisher=genealogy.com|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; James had seven other siblings from his father's earlier marriage.&lt;ref name="udel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.udel.edu/lemay/franklin/1706-1714frame.html |title=1706 Calendar 3 |publisher=udel.edu |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724235826/http://www.english.udel.edu/lemay/franklin/1706-1714frame.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
James began publishing the ''Courant'' in Boston in 1721 with wife, Ann, and brother, Benjamin, working alongside him. While at the ''Courant'', James gathered a group, referred to by some as "The Hell-Fire Club", for assistance, and introduced "[[yellow journalism]]" to Boston.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=James|title=The Rhode-Island almanack for the year, 1728.

At the invitation of James's brother, John, a [[tallow]] [[wikt:chandler|chandler]], James and Ann moved to Newport. Here, they had five children, including Mary, Elizabeth, and James Jr. Here, too, James and Ann established the colony's first printing press.&lt;ref name="mays" /&gt;

Starting in 1727, James printed and published eight editions of the ''Rhode-Island Almanack'', sometimes under the [[pseudonym]] "[[Poor Robin]]". They were printed in James' shop near the town schoolhouse, or at his printing-house on Tillinghast's Wharf, near the Union-Flag Tavern. With the assistance of Thomas Fleet, the almanacs were sold as far away as Pudding-Lane in Boston.&lt;ref name="mays" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hammett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammett|first=Charles Edward |title=A Contribution to the Bibliography and Literature of Newport, R.

On September 27, 1732, James published the first issue of the ''Rhode Island Gazette'', {{convert|12|in|cm}} by {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} in size. Its run lasted only until May 24, 1733, and its issues were irregular.&lt;ref name="field" /&gt;&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book|title=The National cyclopaedia of American biography Being the history of the United States as illustrated in the lives of the founders, builders, and defenders of the Republic|publisher=J.T.

==Later years==
James was ill while living in Newport, but before his death, his brother Benjamin Franklin came for a visit. When Benjamin left for [[Philadelphia]], he had with him his nephew, James Jr., and provided him with a printing [[apprenticeship]] thereafter.&lt;ref name="field" /&gt; After a long illness, James died in Newport in 1735, on his 38th birthday and 12th wedding anniversary.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/specials/women/94root3.htm|title=Ann Franklin (1696-1763)|last=Fleming|first=Arline A|publisher=projo.com|accessdate=2008-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628225332/http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/specials/women/94root3.htm |archivedate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Franklin was buried in the Newport [[Common Burying Ground and Island Cemetery]].

L.P. Alford and the Evolution of Modern Industrial Management''. New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]], Alford graduated from the High School of [[Plainville, Connecticut]], and in 1896 from the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpi.edu/News/Journal/Spring98/arts.html People of the Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016091954/http://www.wpi.edu/News/Journal/Spring98/arts.html |date=2013-10-16 }} in WPI Journal, Spring 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; After ten years in the industry in various functions,&lt;ref name="SUN 1942"&gt;"Prof. Alford of N.Y.U. dies, administrative engineer expert was 65." in: ''The Sun'' New York City, 2 January 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; he received his ME from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1905.&lt;ref name="TN 1933"&gt;''[http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=technews The Tech News Volume]'' 25, Issue 6, November 8, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 Alford started as shop foreman at the McKay Metallic Fastening Assn. in  Boston, which merged to McKay-Bigelow Heeling Assn. in 1897. After another two years as shop foreman, he found employ as production superintendent at the United Shoe Machinery Company in 1899 in Boston. The United Shoe Machinery Company, formed in 1899 out of the merger of three shoe machinery companies, developed revolutionary new shoemaking equipment, which revolutionized the shoe industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cummings.com/history.html Background &amp; History] at ''cummings.com.'' Accessed 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The company employed 9,000 workers and in its best days supplied 85% of all shoemaking machines in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!140355!0 United Shoe Machinery Corporation Records, 1898-1987]. Accessed November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 Alford got promoted to mechanical engineer, and invented and patented some new constructions for the United Shoe Machinery Company.

In 1907 Alford started working in engineering journalism for the Engineering Magazine company. From 1907 to 1911 he was engineering editor at the ''[[American Machinist]]'', and from 1911 to 1917 editor-in-chief. Sequentially he was editor for the ''Industrial Management'' from 1917 to 1920, from 1921 to 1923 editor for ''Manufacturing Industrial Management,'' and from 1923 to 1928 consulting editor for the ''Factory and Industrial Management'' and vice-president of the Ronald Press Company in New York.&lt;ref name="SUN 1942"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cecil Cook. ''Who's who in American Education: A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Living Educators of the United States, Volume 9.'' Who's Who in American Education, 1940. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Alford co-developed the theory called systematic management, and was an advocate of this management style within the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME).

In 1929, [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed a president's commission to investigate the current state of the economy. Alford served on this panel and was the principal co-author of the committee's report, ''Recent Economic Changes'' (1929). From 1935 to 1937 he joined the Federal Communications Commission, where he was assistant engineer-in-charge of the manufacturing costs unit. In 1937 Alford jointed the faculty of New York University, where he became chairman of the department of administrative engineering.&lt;ref name="SUN 1942"/&gt;

Alford was elected fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and was its former vice-president, and fellow  of the Institute of Management and its former president. He was awarded the first Melville Medal in 1927&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asme.org/getmedia/d1e06f49-bec6-49c6-b286-6256fa8abda5/Honors_Manual.aspx ASME Honors Manual]. Accessed 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1929 the [[Henry Laurence Gantt Medal]] from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

== Work ==
=== Systematic management and scientific management ===
Alford was a practitioner of systematic management and an advocate of this management style within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This systems of management principles, partly based on the ideas of [[Charles Babbage]], was developed together with [[Alexander Hamilton Church]], would paved the way to modern [[industrial management]].&lt;ref name="WJ 1957"/&gt; Their views clashed with the [[scientific management]] approach advocated by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref name="RV 1996"&gt;[[Richard Vangermeersch]] (1996) "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/aah,210 Church, Alexander Hamilton (1866-1936]." In ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia,'' edited by [[Michael Chatfield]] and [[Richard Vangermeersch]]. New York: Garland Publishing, 1996. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Alford published a critique of scientific management that undermined Taylor's claims of success.

Alford argued that labor efficiency improvements at the [[Philadelphia]] plant of the Link-Belt Company were due to the personality of company's president, [[James Mapes Dodge]]. Dodge had won much respect and trust from the workers because of arrangements and incentives he offered so that they would accept Taylor's changes.{{Ref|SciManinUse}}

Later in 1912, Alford sat on the ASME committee that considered whether or not to publish Taylor's book, ''The Principles of Scientific Management''.  Alford's criticisms of Taylor and his management techniques moderated the committee's position on the text.  Because the committee's report was ambivalent about the merits of Scientific Management, the ASME declined to publish Taylor's book.{{Ref|Nelson}}

=== Industrial management ===
Alford published his own management text, ''Industrial Management''.  He advocated a reformist approach to labor and to unionism.  In 1920, he co-founded the Management Division within the ASME.  Alford advocated flexibility in "[[industrial relations]]" and "[[human engineering]]" and rejected fixed and rigid approaches to labor management such as scientific management.  His approach to labor soon became the dominant accepted practice of corporate liberal management. Because of this approach, the Management Division soon became the largest division within the ASME.

'''Lázaro Báez''' (born February 11, 1951 in [[Corrientes]], [[Argentina]]) is an Argentine businessman who is a central figure in the corruption scandals, known as ''[[The Route of the K-Money]]'', surrounding former Argentine Presidents [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]. The case was also known as ''Lázarogate''.&lt;ref name=perfil1&gt;{{cite web |last=Delfino |first=Emilia |title=Martín Báez, el heredero y el más comprometido del Lázarogate |website=Perfil.com |url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/Martin-Baez-el-heredero-y-el-mas-comprometido-del-Lazarogate-20130427-0008.html |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;{{cite web |title=Lázaro Báez: "No soy corrupto" |publisher=La Nación |date=Oct 31, 2012 |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1522252-lazaro-baez-no-soy-corrupto |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Báez became a friend of Kirchner in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barilochense.com/?notas=1&amp;id=5583 |title=La historia secreta de los exitosos amigos empresarios de los Kirchner |publisher=barilochense.com |accessdate=5 January 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2003 founded a construction company, Austral Construcciones, which was awarded many government contracts during Kirchner's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2013/6/30/datos-unen-lazaro-baez-asesor-kirchner-723847.asp |title=Más datos unen a Lázaro Báez con un asesor de Kirchner |publisher=losandes.com.ar |date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=5 January 2014 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034441/http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2013/6/30/datos-unen-lazaro-baez-asesor-kirchner-723847.asp |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Báez built [[Mausoleum of Néstor Kirchner|Kirchner's mausoleum]]. He has been called ''the main beneficiary of public contracts in Patagonia''.&lt;ref name=lanac2&gt;{{cite web |last=Alconada Mon |first=Hugo |title=Báez busca prohibir que se informe sobre sus negocios con los Kirchner |publisher=La Nacion| date=Dec 18, 2013 |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1648801-baez-busca-prohibir-que-se-informe-sobre-sus-negocios-con-los-kirchner |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Báez was born in 1951 in San Luis del Palmar, Corrientes, Argentina, to a family of [[Peronists]]. His family moved to [[Río Gallegos]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], in [[Patagonia]], in 1962. The move was reportedly occasioned by political persecution,&lt;ref name=pcr&gt;{{cite web |title=El grupo K| website=PCR.org |url=http://www.pcr.org.ar/nota/pol%C3%ADtica-nacional/el-grupo-k |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; his father having apparently had to leave his home province following the [[Coup d'état|coup]] against President [[Arturo Frondizi]].&lt;ref name=period&gt;{{cite web |title=Lázaro Báez y su sorprendente historia con los Kirchner |publisher=Periodismo Independiente Tribuna |date=Dec 5, 2013 |url=http://periodicotribuna.com.ar/14371-lazaro-baez-y-su-sorprendente-historia-con-los-kirchner.html#.UvFiprSpDqI |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 he married Norma Beatriz Calismonte, who worked as tutor assistant in a public secondary school.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

==Career==

===Bank jobs===
After completing high school, in 1980, he began his first job, as an office junior at a local branch of a National Bank. He then served as a sergeant in the army.{{citation needed |reason=I think it's a misunderstanding of a expression in ref called period |date=April 2016}} In 1985, he started working at his second job, as a teller at the provincial state Bank of Santa Cruz. In 1990 he established a relationship with Néstor Kirchner by means of leaked bank accounts data Báez offered to Kirchner.&lt;ref name=period/&gt; Kirchner was at the time serving his last year as [[mayor]] of Río Gallegos and beginning a crucial campaign for governor, a position he would end up holding from 1991 to 2003. Báez then became bank assistant manager.&lt;ref name=pcr/&gt;

===Austral Construcciones===
Báez formed Austral Construcciones S.A. in 2003, and within three months the firm's capital rose from [[Argentine peso|$AR]]12,000 to [[Argentine peso|$AR]]500,000.&lt;ref name=pcr/&gt; Former Santa Cruz [[prosecutor]] Andrés Vivanco said in May 2013 that Báez "was previously just a bank employee who has no legal way of justifying his increased fortune... Everything Lázaro Báez has come from Néstor Kirchner. He previously had nothing; he was not an entrepreneur because he never risked his capital, he would always just wait to submit a public ''tender'' with the government".&lt;ref name="argentinaindependent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/tag/lazaro-baez/ |title=Tag Archive&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;Lázaro Báez |publisher=The Argentina Independent |website=argentinaindependent.com |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2005, Austral and other firms owned by Báez were awarded the majority of the contracts offered by the province of Santa Cruz during the presidency of Néstor Kirchner and 12% of the contracts awarded by the Ministry of Planning under Minister Julio de Vido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Báez recauda 60 millones por mes por las obras en Santa Cruz |publisher=Clarin |url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Baez-recauda-millones-Santa-Cruz_0_902309792.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OPI Santa Cruz"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cristina lo hizo: Austral Construcciones SA entró en el negocio de las Represas |publisher=OPI Santa Cruz |url=http://opisantacruz.com.ar/home/2012/10/01/austral-construcciones-sa-entro-en-el-negocio-de-las-represas/15066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a five-year period, the firm received 4&amp;nbsp;billion dollars in federal contracts and 1.2&amp;nbsp;billion dollars in contracts for the province of Santa Cruz. His firm Southern Building was investigated in [[Liechtenstein]] for money laundering.

==Other business activities==
After 2006, Báez began to buy properties along the Santa Cruz River. He ultimately paid more than $28&amp;nbsp;million for 10 properties totaling 200,000 acres. Later he contracted with Kirchner to construct the [[Condor Cliffs Dam|Cóndor Cliff]]-[[La Barrancosa Dam]]s which would flood those lands. One commentator wrote in 2012 that Báez had plainly purchased the properties knowing that they would be made valuable by the dam project. "In any serious country this would be called the use of privileged information, influence peddling, [and] corruption."&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;&lt;ref name="OPI Santa Cruz"/&gt;

According to a 2009 report, Báez constructed a luxury building on Kirchner-owned land in Rio Gallegos. The structure was completed in 2007.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title="Gracias, Néstor": La política de los negocios. Los socios del Holding Kirchner: Rudy Ulloa, Lázaro|author=Di Matteo, L.|date=2012|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Argentina|isbn=9789500739412|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=ePGjw6i5qAsC&amp;pg=PA2002|page=2002|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Báez built himself a mansion outside of Rio Gallegos. In recent years he has expanded his interests into the oil business and properties along the Santa Cruz River.&lt;ref name=lagac&gt;{{cite web| title =Quién es Lázaro Báez| publisher=La Gaceta| date =April 15, 2013| url =http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/540939/politica/quien-lazaro-baezhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Báez also owns the oil firms Misahar SA and Epsur SA,&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; and the newspaper Prensa Libre in Rio Gallegos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perfil.com/politica/Lazaro-Baez-denuncia-a-Faria-y-pide-que-declaren-Rial-Ventura-y-Molinari—20130516-0007.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He has two sons, Martín Antonio Báez and Leandro Martín Báez. The former, who has his own mansion in Rio Gallegos, is considered Báez's likely successor as head of his empire.&lt;ref name=perfil1/&gt;

===2007 tax investigation===
On August 17, 2007, the Deputy Director of Research of the General Tax Directorate (DGI), Jaime Mecikovsky, completed an elaborate three-year investigation of public works contractors and concluded that Austral had issued false invoices.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

==Relationship with Kirchner==
In April 2013, Deputy Francisco De Narváez called Báez "a person of great intimacy with the Kirchner family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Báez es una persona de mucha intimidad con la familia Kirchner| publisher=La Politica Online| url =http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/nota-90058/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchner reportedly ate his last dinner with Báez and with the two men's wives. It was Báez, moreover, who built Kirchner's [[Mausoleum of Néstor Kirchner|massive mausoleum]] in the Rio Gallegos Cemetery.&lt;ref name=lagac/&gt; In late December 2013 it was reported that the mausoleum had sustained structural damage, owing to its monumental weight, and that Báez had visited the site personally to inspect the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Cedió el piso del mausoleo de Néstor Kirchner construido por Lázaro Báez| publisher=Los Andes| url =http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2013/12/28/cedio-piso-mausoleo-nestor-kirchner-construido-lazaro-baez-758830.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jorge Lanata program==
On April 14, 2013, journalist Jorge Lanata of Periodismo para todos (Journalism for All), a news program aired on Argentina's Channel 13, presented a report entitled "La ruta del dinero K" ("The K Money Trail"), with "K" standing for the late Argentinian president Néstor Kirchner. Lanata's report included a videotaped testimony by financier Federico Elaskar and a hidden-camera recording of businessman Leonardo Fariña in which these men described large-scale illegal financial manipulations by members of the Kirchner circle, including Báez, that involved the transfer of about 55&amp;nbsp;million euros over a six-month period to [[Switzerland]] and other foreign tax havens. The men indicated that Kirchner himself was directly involved in these maneuvers.

Allegedly, at Báez's direction, Fariña orchestrated a plan whereby the funds were sent abroad via Elaskar's financial firm, SGI. More than fifty companies were purportedly created with the express purpose of facilitating these transfers. Also supposedly involved in this scheme was Fabián Rossi, who was said to have funneled the money through Panama banks. According to Elaskar, silver from [[Patagonia]] was shipped to Switzerland by way of [[Montevideo, Uruguay]].&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;{{cite web| title =Casanello será el juez que investigue a Lázaro Báez tras el programa de Lanata| publisher=Perfil| url =http://www.perfil.com/politica/Casanello-sera-el-juez-que-investigue-a-Lazaro-Baez-tras-el-programa-de-Lanata-20130417-0027.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked on hidden camera whether Báez was an associate of Kirchner's, Fariña said yes, and added that "in politics there are no front men, only operators." Elaskar said that he had been cheated and threatened with death by business associates of Báez.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt;&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt; Elaskar also said that both of Báez's sons had been involved in the offshore firms to which funds had been illegally transferred. Martin Báez runs Teegan, a firm founded in Panama and based in the tax haven of Belize.&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt;

==Later interviews==
In a subsequent interview with Rolando Graña on América Noticias, however, Elaskar claimed that there had been no money laundering or death threats, and that everything he had said on Lanata's program was untrue. "I lied. I apologize," he said. He maintained that he had lied because he was "angry" and "young" Fariña, in an interview with Jorge Rial of Intrusos (Intruders), also claimed to have been lying in the videotape aired on Lanata's program.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt; Fariña said that he apologized to Báez, whom he called "a first-rate guy."

Lanata replied to these claims by saying that Fariña was "not the brain" of the operation and that on his next show he would provide evidence Báez was the real mastermind.&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt; In an early May interview with Lanata, Kirchner's former secretary, Míriam Quiroga, confirmed some of the charges made by Fariña and Elaskar about Báez, saying that at the Casa Rosada, during Kirchner's presidency, she had seen bags, apparently containing money, that were sent to the Kirchners’ mansion in Santa Cruz province, where they were placed in a vault, the money later presumably finding its way to bank accounts in [[Switzerland]], [[Panama]], and [[Belize]].&lt;ref name="argentinaindependent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Habló la ex secretaria: Afirman que con Kirchner se llevaban "bolsos con plata" |publisher=Clarin |url=http://www.clarin.com/gobierno/Afirman-Kirchner-llevaban-bolsos-plata_0_914308607.html |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal case==
After the Lanata program was aired, several opposition legislators called on public prosecutor Carlos Gonella to investigate the accusations against Báez. They also called for the freezing of Báez's assets.&lt;ref name="clarin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Amplian-denuncia-lavado-dinero_0_902909862.html|title=Piden a la Justicia que inhiba los bienes de Lázaro Báez|publisher=clarin.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insightcrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/kirchners-associate-accused-money-laundering-argentina|title=Kirchners' Associate Accused of Money Laundering in Argentina|publisher=insightcrime.org|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judicial investigation of Báez on charges of money laundering, conspiracy, and cover-up was initiated on April 17. Martín Irurzun of the Federal Court appointed Sebastián Casanello as the judge in the case.

On the same date, and again in early May, raids were carried out on SGI's offices at "La Rosadita" by la Policía de Seguridad Aeroportuaria (Airport Security Police, PSA) on the orders of Casanello.&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.ar/politica/caso-baez-farina-otro-allanamiento-en-madero-center,6eb3ca0228c6e310VgnVCM3000009acceb0aRCRD.html|title=Caso Báez-Fariña: otro allanamiento en Madero Center|publisher=noticias.terra.com.ar|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iprofesional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iprofesional.com/notas/158933-Lavado-de-dinero-en-la-mira-la-Justicia-allan-La-Rosadita-y-la-casa-de-Leonardo-Faria|title=Lavado de dinero en la mira: la Justicia allanó &amp;quot;La Rosadita&amp;quot; y la casa de Leonardo Fariña|publisher=iprofesional.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early June, Báez's possessions and safety boxes were raided by the National Gendarmerie, also on Casanello's orders. Báez was described as being "visibly upset" by the raids, which he described as "unnecessary show."&lt;ref name="elpais"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/allanaron-propiedades-empresario-argentino-lazaro.html|title=Allanaron propiedades del empresario argentino Lázaro Báez &amp;#124; Noticias Uruguay y el Mundo actualizadas - Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|publisher=elpais.com.uy|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other persons charged in the case included Elaskar, Fariña, Rossi, Báez's son Leandro Martín Báez, and Daniel Perez Gadin.&lt;ref name="infobae"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infobae.com/2013/05/10/710001-la-justicia-realizo-nuevos-allanamientos-la-rosadita-puerto-madero |title=La Justicia realizó nuevos allanamientos en La Rosadita de Puerto Madero |publisher=Infobae |accessdate=13 August 2015 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, after Elaskar and Fariña had already been charged, federal prosecutor William Marijuan filed money laundering charges against Báez.&lt;ref name="argentinaindependent"/&gt;

It was reported in early May that Báez had made some of the suspicious land purchases through three of his companies: Austral Construcciones, Austral Agro, and Valle Hermoso.&lt;ref name="elobservador"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/249844/otra-parada-en-la-ruta-del-dinero-k-mas-estancias-en-santa-cruz/|title=Otra parada en la ruta del dinero K: más estancias en Santa Cruz|publisher=elobservador.com.uy|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Casanello called Lárazo Báez for inquiry in 2016. He took a plane with unknown destination, so the judge ordered his detention, fearing an attempt to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1886637-lazaro-baez-traslado-detencion-comodoro-py-indagatoria-juez-casanello|title= Lázaro Báez y Pérez Gadín ya están en el despacho del juez Casanello para ser indagados|trans-title=Lázaro Báez and Pérez Gadín are in the office of judge Casanello, ready for inquiry|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 6, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Báez lawsuits against Elaskar and Farina===
It was reported on May 5 that Báez was suing Elaskar and Fariña for the statements they had made about him on Lanata's program. Báez called the accusations part of "a smear campaign...with a clear political agenda."&lt;ref name="novanacional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novanacional.com/nota.asp?n=2013_5_5&amp;id=33117&amp;id_tiponota=24|title=Elaskar y Fariña fueron denunciados penalmente por Lázaro Báez|publisher=novanacional.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prensalibreonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prensalibreonline.com.ar/dblog/noticia.asp?id=27519|title=prensalibreonline.com.ar|publisher=prensalibreonline.com.ar|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, Báez said that he had never worked with Fariña, and that Fariña had, rather, worked for the firm Pluscarga, which did business with Báez's businesses. He also denied any involvement in money laundering or any business relationship with Kirchner.&lt;ref name="lanacion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1584312-lazaro-hablo-de-su-relacion-con-farina-y-nestor|title=Lázaro habló de su relación con Fariña y Néstor - 22.05.2013 - lanacion.com|publisher=lanacion.com.ar|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Báez's lawsuit against Fariña and his wife, Karina Jelinek, on charges of slander was dismissed in early July by judge Raúl García.&lt;ref name="unoticias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoticias.com.uy/2013/07/03/internacionales/justicia-argentina-rechazo-denuncia-de-lazaro-baez-contra-farina/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225203619/http://www.unoticias.com.uy/2013/07/03/internacionales/justicia-argentina-rechazo-denuncia-de-lazaro-baez-contra-farina/ |archive-date=2013-12-25 |dead-url=yes|title=Justicia argentina rechaz&amp;oacute; denuncia de L&amp;aacute;zaro B&amp;aacute;ez contra Fari&amp;ntilde;a|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further revelations===
In December 2013, the argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that seven Báez companies had signed documents agreeing to rent 935 rooms a month at the Alto Calafate Hotel throughout 2010 and 2011, whether or not they were occupied. regardless of whether in fact employees were staying there. La Nacion additionally revealed that Báez had paid at least $3.2&amp;nbsp;million to Kirchner in "rent" for Las Dunas, an inn in El Calafate, and that he had paid a total of $14.5&amp;nbsp;million in "rent" for the two hotels, plus the La Aldea Hotel, during 2010 and 2011, even as Báez was receiving large sums from the federal government for public works projects.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1648801-baez-busca-prohibir-que-se-informe-sobre-sus-negocios-con-los-kirchner|title=Báez busca prohibir que se informe sobre sus negocios con los Kirchner - 18.12.2013 - lanacion.com|publisher=lanacion.com.ar|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lt10digital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lt10digital.com.ar/noticia/idnot/197432/afirmanquelazarobaezinventoingresosparapagarlesaloskirchner.html|title=Afirman que Lázaro Báez inventó ingresos para pagarles a los Kirchner – Lt10 – Lt10.com.ar|year=2014|publisher=lt10digital.com.ar|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also emerged in December 2013 that Báez, during the previous ten years, in Santa Cruz alone, had purchased tracts of land amounting to at least 263,000 hectares, or 13 times the size of the Federal District.&lt;ref name="lanacion.com.ar"/&gt;

===Injunction request===
Also in December 2013, Báez asked for an injunction that would prohibit the media from publishing anything about his business or personal ties to Kirchner. This request was rejected by El Foro de Periodismo Argentino (Argentine Journalism Forum, FOPEA) and the Asociación de Entidades Periodísticas Argentinas (Association of Argentine Journalism Entities, ADEPA), the latter of which called the idea unconstitutional. Reacting to Báez's request, Parliament member Margarita Stolbizer described him as a "mobster" while Labor Party leader Gabriel Solano described the use of "prior censorship to defend the 'confidentiality'  of the business activities of Lázaro Báez" as undemocratic.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fopea.org/Inicio/Fopea_rechaza_la_posibilidad_de_que_la_justicia_obstruya_al_periodismo_de_investigacion_y_censure_a_los_medios_de_comunicacion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219151318/http://www.fopea.org/Inicio/Fopea_rechaza_la_posibilidad_de_que_la_justicia_obstruya_al_periodismo_de_investigacion_y_censure_a_los_medios_de_comunicacion |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2013 raid===
On the orders of tax court judge Javier López Biscayart, who was investigating Báez on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, the Argentinian federal police raided the offices of Austral Construcciones in Buenos Aires in late December 2013.&lt;ref name="buenosairesherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/147961/police-raids-l%C3%A1zaro-b%C3%A1ez-offices|title=Police raids Lázaro Báez offices - BuenosAiresHerald.com|publisher=buenosairesherald.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security measures===
In January 2014, it was reported that Báez traveled with such a level of security that it was "as if he were the President of the United States in a war zone."&lt;ref name="diarioveloz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diarioveloz.com/notas/113862-lazaro-baez-y-la-cadena-del-miedo-el-temor-ser-el-nuevo-alfredo-yabran|title=Lázaro Báez y la cadena del miedo - El temor a ser el nuevo Alfredo Yabrán &amp;#124; Planeta Boimvaser, Lázaro Báez|publisher=diarioveloz.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swiss investigation===
It was reported in August 2013 that the investigation of Báez's financial dealings in Switzerland was stalled because that country's Department of Justice was refusing to release information about Swiss bank accounts held in the name of one of Báez's sons.&lt;ref name="elpais2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/suiza-no-da-datos-cuenta.html|title=Suiza no da datos de cuenta de Báez &amp;#124; Noticias Uruguay y el Mundo actualizadas - Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|publisher=elpais.com.uy|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss ambassador to Argentina, Johannes Matyassy, said in January 2014 that a criminal investigation into Báez's financial activities in Switzerland was progressing. Matyassy said that this was the first case in which Switzerland and Argentina had collaborated in such a manner under a new cooperative agreement.&lt;ref name="elintransigente"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2014/1/11/lavado-dinero-complica-situacion-lazaro-baez-por-avance-justicia-suiza-investigacion-226173.asp|title=Lavado de dinero: Se complica la situación de Lázaro Báez por el avance de la justicia suiza en la investigación|publisher=elintransigente.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguayan investigation===
It was reported in late January 2014 that a Uruguayan investigation into the money laundering charges against Báez had not progressed, owing to the failure of Argentinian authorities to cooperate with the investigation.&lt;ref name="elpais3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/argentina-datos-uruguay-freno-causa.html|title=Argentina no dio datos y Uruguay frena la causa K &amp;#124; Noticias Uruguay y el Mundo actualizadas - Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|publisher=elpais.com.uy|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepal Financial Reporting Standards''' ('NFRS') are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable within Nepal. The rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external.

NFRS was issued by [[Nepal Accounting Standard Board]] in 2013. Earlier it has issued Nepal Accounting Standards. NFRS is prepared in line with on IFRS.

==Objective of financial statements==

Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial positions and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.

To meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity's:
*     assets;
*     liabilities;
*     equity;
*     income and expenses, including gains and losses;
*     contributions by and distributions to owners in their capacity as owners; and
*     cash flows.
This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.

The following are the general features in NFRS:
* Fair presentation and compliance with NFRS:
Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the Framework of NFRS.
* Going concern: 
Financial statements are present on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
* Accrual basis of accounting: 
An entity shall recognise items as assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses when they satisfy the definition and recognition criteria for those elements in the Framework of NFRS.
* Materiality and aggregation: 
Every material class of similar items has to be presented separately. Items that are of a dissimilar nature or function shall be presented separately unless they are immaterial.
* Offsetting
Offsetting is generally forbidden in NFRS.
* Frequency of reporting: 
NFRS requires that at least annually a complete set of financial statements is presented.
* Comparative information: 
NFRS requires entities to present comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts reported in the current period's financial statements. In addition comparative information shall also be provided for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to understanding the current period's financial statements.
* Consistency of presentation: 
NFRS requires that the presentation and classification of items in the financial statements is retained from one period to the next unless: 
(a)     it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the entity's operations or a review of its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies.
(b)     an NFRS standard requires a change in presentation.

'''Paul G. Hahnemann''' (31 October 1912 in [[Strasbourg]] &amp;ndash; 23 January 1997 in [[Munich]]) sometimes known as "Nischen-Paule", was a leading director at [[BMW]] between 1961 and 1972.   

==Early years==
[[File:paul_g._hahnemann.png|thumb|Paul G. Hahnemann as a student: summer 1930]]
After the end of the [[First World War]] (which [[Treaty of Versailles|was followed by]] the transfer of [[Strasbourg]], where the family had been living, to [[France]]), Hahnemann's mother fled, with her two sons across the [[Rhine]], to [[Kehl]], now on Germany's western frontier.   He successfully completed his Abitur (final exam programme) at the [[:de:Kant-Gymnasium Karlsruhe |"Kant-Oberrealschule", now the "Kant Gymnsium"]] (senior school) in [[Karlsruhe]], a short distance to the north.

==BMW years==
At the end of 1960 Hahnemann was recruited from [[Auto Union]] by [[Herbert Quandt]],&lt;ref name=HahnemanntoBMW&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2010/48/Autokonzern-BMW/seite-2|title= Konzern im Spagat:   Vor 50 Jahren stand BMW vor dem Aus – und wurde in letzter Minute gerettet.

Hahnemann was a brilliant if sometimes subversive salesman who oversaw the introduction in 1961 of the [[BMW New Class#1500 (4-doors)|BMW 1500]].&lt;ref name=Motor197201/&gt;   Whether the car created a new 'niche', or merely exploited the niche created by the departure of the [[Borgward Isabella]], its commercial success transformed BMW from a marginal manufacturer with an uncertain future into one of Europe's most consistently profitable auto-makers.

'''Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter I''' (July 30, 1877 – June 11, 1949) was an American executive and member of the board of directors of [[DuPont]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on July 30, 1877 to Walter Samuel Carpenter and Bedde Morgan.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Known as "Ruly", Carpenter was educated at the [[Hillman Academy]] in his hometown of [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], and at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

He worked in his family's hardware store before joining DuPont as a district purchasing agent in 1906. He married [[Margaretta Lammot du Pont]], the sister of company president [[Pierre S. du Pont]], on December 18, 1906.  They had a son, [[Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |coauthors= |title=Robert Carpenter Jr., Ex-Phillies Owner, 74  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/11/obituaries/robert-carpenter-jr-ex-phillies-owner-74.html |quote=Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter Jr., the former owner of the Philadelphia Phillies, died of cancer Sunday. He was 74 years old. ...|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=July 11, 1990 |accessdate=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began working under another brother, [[Irénée du Pont]] in the development department, of which he was named director in 1911. Carpenter was instrumental in guiding the company's diversification outside the explosives industry, being appointed to the executive committee and serving on the board of directors from 1914 until his death in 1949. During his tenure, he held positions including head of personnel and vice president. His younger brother, [[Walter S. Carpenter, Jr.]], was President of DuPont from 1940 to 1948.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1940, Carpenter joined the [[board of trustees]] of the [[University of Delaware]], and was a major catalyst for the development of its athletic program, personally funding the construction of a new gymnasium.  In 1943, he purchased the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] of the [[National League]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  He left day-to-day control in the hands of his son, [[R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr.]], who continued his father's tradition of substantial support for the University of Delaware’s athletic program after his father's death.

Carpenter also served as president of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington's]] Homeopathic Hospital, as a trustee of Philadelphia's [[Academy of Natural Sciences]], and as director of the [[Mellon Financial|Girard Trust Company]], and of the [[Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad]].

He died on June 11, 1949, of [[cancer]] at [[Memorial Hospital (Wilmington, Delaware)|Memorial Hospital]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=R.

The '''Refuge Water Supply Program (RWSP)''' is administered by the [[United States Department of the Interior]] jointly by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] and [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] and tasked with acquiring a portion and delivering a total of 555,515 [[acre feet]] (AF) of water annually to 19 specific protected wetland areas in the Central Valley of California as mandated with the passing of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act signed on October 30, 1992 by President [[George H. W. Bush]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvpia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== The Central Valley Project (CVP) ===
The [[Central Valley (California)]] once contained over 4 million acres of naturally occurring wetlands that provided habitat: land, food, and shelter for resident and migratory birds and wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/suppl/10.3996/012014-JFWM-003/suppl_file/012014-jfwm-003.s10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Valley, historically and today, constitutes a significant portion of the [[Pacific Flyway]] used by millions of migrating birds each year.

The Central Valley's winter flood-prone geography and summer dry climate were natural constraints to permanent human settlement. The [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP); an interconnected engineered system of reservoirs, aqueducts and flood control measures, constructed by the US Bureau of Reclamation; managed flooding and provided reliable water supplies year-round with highly managed and calculated water storage, release and conveyance infrastructure. Along with the construction of similar facilities by others, the CVP's flood control and water delivery systems created a stable environment suitable for permanent human development in the Central Valley.

Controlling and manipulating the water supply for human benefit dramatically and quickly transformed the landscape. All but 400,000 acres of natural wetlands were transformed for development, a reduction in wetland area of 90%. The loss of wetlands concentrated the migrating and resident wildlife on less land and required their sharing of and dependence on less water. This unhealthy crowding caused bird populations to decline as they suffered from disease and the lack of necessary food, shelter, and water. Compounding the problem, human activity, in some cases, polluted the waters that flowed into the remaining wetlands. The [[Kesterson Reservoir]] disaster provided a clear indication that wildlife was suffering in the modified Central Valley and helped inspire actions to mitigate for the CVP's effects to bird and fish populations.

=== Central Valley Project Improvement Act ===
The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) was signed into law on October 30, 1992 as mitigation and remedy for some of the CVP's adverse environmental effects, specifically, to increase the population and improve the health of the Central Valley's [[anadromous]] fish and increase the acreage and health of wetlands used by migratory birds and other resident wildlife. The CVPIA is managed by the United States Department of Interior through collaboration between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvpia/title_34/public_law_complete.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refuge Water Supply Program ==
[[File:RWSP Refuge Map.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of the Refuges Supported by the RWSP]]
CVPIA Section 3406(d) mandates that 555,515 AF of water of suitable quality be delivered to maintain and improve wetland habitat areas in 19 wetland areas specifically identified in the ''Report on Refuge Water Supply Investigations (March 1989)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvpia/3406d/resc_docs/Report%20on%20Refuge%20Water%20Supply%20Investigations%20('89%20Report).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''San Joaquin Basin Action Plan/Kesterson Mitigation Action Plan (December 1989)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15911.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15911coll2/id/24110}}&lt;/ref&gt; collectively referred to as 'the Refuges'. These Refuges comprise nearly 200,000 acres of wetlands and as such represent almost 50% of the wetlands remaining in California's Central Valley. Reclamation created the Refuge Water Supply Program (RWSP) to manage and administer the activities necessary to ensure the acquisition and delivery of this water as required under this section. Like the CVPIA, the RWSP is administered jointly by the Bureau of Reclamation (from the Mid-Pacific Regional Office in Sacramento, CA) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (from the Pacific Southwest Regional Office in Sacramento, CA)

=== The Refuges ===

==== National Wildlife Refuges ====
The following Refuges, benefiting from CVPIA legislation, are administered by the Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service as National Wildlife Refuges. In some instances the specific Refuge named in the CVPIA is currently a constituent part of a FWS administrative complex of refuges that includes several such refuges and/or other non-benefiting lands.

The following CVPIA benefiting refuges are components of the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex: [[Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Delevan National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Colusa National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Sutter National Wildlife Refuge]].

The following CVPIA benefiting Refuges are components of the [[San Luis National Wildlife Refuge]] Complex: San Luis Unit, West Bear Creek Unit, East Bear Creek Unit, Kesterson Unit, Freitas Unit and [[Merced National Wildlife Refuge]]. The refuges currently identified as 'Units' were separate refuges at the time the legislation was written and passed.

The following CVPIA benefiting Refuges are components of the Kern National Wildlife Refuge Complex: [[Kern National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Pixley National Wildlife Refuge]]

==== California State Wildlife Areas ====
The following Refuges, benefiting from CVPIA legislation, are administered by the State of California, Department of Fish and Wildlife as Wildlife Areas. In some instances the specific Refuge named in the CVPIA is currently a part of a DFW administrative unit that includes several such refuges and/or other non-benefiting lands.

Gray Lodge Wildlife Area; Los Banos Wildlife Area (portion); the following currently designated 'units' of the North Grasslands Wildlife Area, China Island Unit and Salt Slough Unit; and the Volta Wildlife Area (portion). Note: 'portion', is used to indicate that the current existing wildlife area boundary is larger than it was in the defining report. CVP water obligated for the RWSP is only permitted to be used on that portion of the wildlife area specifically described in the defining report and legislation.

==== The Grasslands Resource Conservation District ====
The Grassland Resource Conservation District (GRCD) comprises 75,000 acres of land including: the Grassland Water District (GWD) which provides water to 165 hunting clubs; the Kesterson and Freitas Units of the San Luis National wildlife Refuge (NWR); Volta Wildlife Management Area (WMA); Los Banos WMA; and privately owned wetlands. As such, the GRCD includes 60,000 acres of privately owned hunting clubs, 12,000 acres of land owned by the Federal and state governments, and 3,000 acres of cropland. The federal and state Refuges identified in the CVPIA legislation that are within the GRCD do not share GRCD's water allocation.

=== The Water ===
The water associated with the program is either categorized as Level 2 or Incremental Level 4 and there are different supply quantities and characteristics of each. The goal of the program is to provide the 'Full Level 4' water quantity which is the cumulative sum of the full quantity of each category for each Refuge. Program-wide, typically between 75% and 85% of Full Level 4 is delivered annually.

The water the RWSP provides accounts for varying portions of an individual Refuge's total water supply. Because some Refuges do not have adequate conveyance capacity to them (Pixley NWR, Merced NWR, Sutter NWR, East Bear Creek Unit and Gray Lodge WA) delivered water supplies vary annually with hydrological and climactic conditions.  Construction projects enabling these Refuges to receive water supplies have been identified and in some cases are progressing but funding limitations will likely cause this condition to persist.

==== Full Level 4 ====
The amount of water identified as being required for the optimal management of a designated wetland is defined as that refuge's 'Full Level 4' quantity. The 555,515AF of water the RWSP is tasked with providing is the sum of all of the specified refuges' Full Level 4 quantities. Full Level 4 is a contractually obligated amount of water that consists of 2 blocks, Level 2 and Incremental Level 4. Each refuge has a 'Full Level 4' quantity which is the sum of its total Level 2, and total Incremental Level 4 quantity of water. These amounts are provided in the table "RWSP Contract Water Quantities".

==== Level 2 Water ====
Each of the 19 benefiting Refuges has its own Level 2 water quantity which is based on the average water supplies necessary to maintain the wetland areas in existence prior to the passing of the CVPIA or equate to its prior dependably delivered quantity (regardless of water quality) and collectively totals 422,251 AF. For this reason the delivery of a Refuge's Level 2 allocation is considered to be essential for a Refuge's successful operation.

For those refuges that have the infrastructure to receive it, Level 2 water comes from the CVP, meaning a fixed portion of the federal water supply stored and delivered by the CVP Project is automatically dedicated annually for Refuge use and thus provides a perennially reliable water source. The RWSP manages and funds several long-term contracts (5 – 40 years) with a variety of water agencies to convey this water from its CVP source to a Refuges' boundaries.

It is important to note that the individual Refuges determine the amount of this water to be delivered, per month, at their discretion. This is a unique condition because most CVP water contracts impose limitations on both the total monthly delivery amount and the months in which deliveries may occur.

==== Incremental Level 4 Water ====
The incremental difference between the Refuges' Full Level 4 allocation and its Level 2 allocation defines Incremental Level 4 (IL4) and represents the quantity of water necessary for Refuges to ideally manage all lands identified in the refuge reports for the benefit of waterfowl. In most cases IL4 water is needed to fully support an expanded wetland footprint. Like Level 2 water, each refuge has its own Incremental Level 4 quantity but unlike Level 2 supplies, this water is not dedicated from CVP supply and must be acquired from other sources, such as willing sellers or from those relinquishing their federal or state supplies. The RWSP manages and funds contracts of varied duration to acquire and convey this water from its source to the refuges' boundaries. The suppliers, availability and cost of water available as Incremental Level 4 is less predictable than Level 2 supplies because of unpredictable region-wide water needs and usage; the potential lack of sufficient conveyance infrastructure; inconsistent annual natural conditions, specifically rainfall; and occasional water quality concerns.

Additionally, Individual refuges retain the right to refuse to accept water that the RWSP has the ability to acquire if it is not of suitable quality or does not benefit the refuge at the time it is available. Thus, water supplied delivered in a year may be less than those that were potentilly available.

=== RWSP Program Components ===

[[File:Shasta dam 2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lake Shasta is the ultimate source of much of the refuges' Level 2 Water Supply]]
[[File:Delta-Mendota Canal.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Portion of the Delta Mendota Canal]]
The RWSP's efforts are concentrated into 3 components, Water Acquisition, Facility Construction and Water Conveyance.

==== Water Acquisitions ====
CVPIA Section 3406(d)(2) requires the acquisition of IL4 Water for critical wetland habitat supporting resident and migratory waterfowl, threatened and endangered species, and wetland dependent aquatic biota on the Refuges. These supplies are ideally used to allow refuges to optimally manage the preserved land for the improvement of waterfowl populations.

IL4 water consists of long-term and annual purchases from willing sellers of both surface and groundwater supplies; supplies at no cost, e.g., water exchanges; water delivered under a mitigation agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 'permanent water', water that the program has purchased a permanent right to take under specific conditions.

===== North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program =====
California, and the Central Valley, experienced persistent drought conditions for much of the early part of the twenty first century. With global warming expected alter historic conditions the long-term availability oh IL4 supplies is questionable. To meet its acquisition and delivery mandate the RWSP was challenged to find reliable and affordable sources for Incremental 4 water to deliver to the refuges well into this uncertain future. The North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program will make treated, recycled water from the Cities of [[Turlock]] and [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] available for re-use at the Refuges. The RWSP took an active role in this pioneering program's development and in return, in 2016, signed a 40-year contract for water deliveries from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvr-recycledwater.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/documentShow.cfm?Doc_ID=25647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Facility Construction ====
CVPIA Section 3406(d)(5) provides for facilities construction to benefit the mandate of supplying refuge water. This component funds projects that identify, construct and/or maintain infrastructure projects supporting the long-term delivery of firm, reliable water supplies to the boundary of the Refuges. The RWSP's goal is to have the necessary facilities in place allowing for the delivery of Full L4 water supplies to the Refuges that meet their timing and scheduling requirements. A total of 46 new or modifications to major structures and/or actions were identified to provide needed capacity for the delivery of Full Level 4 surface supplies to these refuges.

==== Water Conveyance (Wheeling) ====
CVPIA Sections 3406(d)(1),(2) and (5) of the CVPIA describe the functions and responsibilities of the Refuge Water Conveyance (Wheeling) Component. The use of a water conveyance facility by someone other than the owner or operator to transport water is referred to as "wheeling." The conveyance component is responsible for ensuring the delivery of a refuge's level 2 and acquired water supplies through contracts and agreements that allow for these water supplies to move from source to refuge destination.

The reservoirs that hold water destined for a refuge are connected to the refuges by a network of channels, owned and operated by multiple entities. Similar to a network of roadways there are conveyance channels of many kinds (with names like: aqueduct, canal, slough and ditch) and sizes. Some channels are free to use by the RWSP, like rivers, and some require payment, such as those built and maintained by a water district.  The RWSP negotiated contracts coordinating the delivery of water.  Reclamation currently has nine long-term (15–50 years) conveyance agreements that are administered by the RWSP, one Service 40-year conveyance agreement, cooperative agreements to reimburse delivering entities for costs of conveying L2 and IL4 water supplies through federal, state, and private water distribution systems to the refuges and agreements to reimburse costs for groundwater pumping in instances where groundwater is pumped at the refuge itself. Deliveries are monitored throughout the system as water enters and exits metered channels.

Water that is transferred any distance suffers what are termed 'conveyance losses' which means that the amount of water released at the start is not the same amount that ultimately arrives. The difference between what is sent versus what is received are conveyance losses and can be the result of evaporation or seepage (soaking into the land). In some cases water travels over 300 miles to reach its final refuge destination.

== Accomplishments and Benefits to Nature ==
The CVPIA was enacted to increase the population and improve the health of the Central Valley's anadromous fish and increase the acreage and health of wetlands used by migratory birds and other resident wildlife both of which suffered as a result of the construction of the CVP. The RWSP focuses on the health of wetlands by acquiring and conveying necessary water supplies. Since CVPIA was enacted numerous biological benefits have resulted from supplying the Refuges with a reliable year-round water supply that adequately meets the refuge-specific water delivery schedules developed for individual wetland management requirements. Prior to CVPIA, refuge managers had to concentrate the majority of their water use in the fall and early winter months, when Central Valley waterfowl numbers peaked. With the passage of CVPIA, the habitat calendar was expanded to the full year. These increased and reliable supplies of water enable managers to enhance existing habitats, expand their wetland base, and provide increased benefits to a greater number of wetland-dependent species.

=== Habitat and Biodiversity ===
Refuge activities are water dependent. Having a firm and adequate supply of water available when most beneficial throughout the year enables managers to implement improved management techniques and allows them to better manage lands and activities. This increased efficiency and reliability has both increased wetland acreage and improved wetland health by affording refuge managers with the ability to manage a diverse mix of habitat types that more fully satisfied year-round environmental requirements of many wildlife species.   
[[File:Snow geese and Ross geese (6338624060).jpg|thumbnail|left|Snow Geese and Ross Geese at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge]]

==== Benefits of Water Reliability ====
Before the CVPIA, refuge managers concentrated the majority of water use in fall and early winter months (October - December), when Central Valley waterfowl numbers peaked. With the passage of CVPIA, the habitat calendar was expanded to the full year, allowing refuge managers' the ability to provide habitat to an extended group of migratory birds as well as other wildlife and grow plant materials that provide a food supply or habitat for food sources. Under CVPIA programs, moist soil food plant irrigations are carried out since water is reliably available during August and September to satisfy the needs of the early arriving migrant waterfowl and shorebirds, maintenance flows are applied throughout the winter months to improve water quality and decrease avian disease outbreaks, and during spring and summer, when wetland habitat can be particularly limited by hydrology, water provides critical nesting habitat for waterfowl and colonial birds as well as habitat for resident wildlife and their young. Wintering wildlife also benefit from this habitat diversity, as seasonal wetlands are now managed to coincide with peak migration times of shorebirds and waterfowl.

With the increased frequency and acreage of irrigated moist soil food plants there has been a doubling in desirable plant biomass, which equates to more high-quality, high energy food available to waterfowl. In some refuges waterfowl food production has increased tenfold. Timely de-watering and irrigation promote the germination and irrigation of important moist-soil food plants, such as swamp timothy and watergrass. These plants provide a high-energy food source through both their seeds and associated invertebrate communities. The increase in supply reliability allows wetland managers to lower water depths to make seeds and invertebrates available without the fear of having wetlands completely evaporate.

==== Benefits of Increased Wetland Acreage ====
Waterfowl, shorebirds and other wetland-dependent wildlife have benefited as their habitats have been expanded and enhanced. Central Valley wetlands receiving CVP water supplies have increased by more than 20,000 acres since the passage of the CVPIA while tens of thousands of acres of habitat have been enhanced. This wetland acreage helps explain the 75% decrease in waterfowl disease-related mortality in some wetland areas as the birds spread out over a greater area.

==== Benefits of Improved Water Quality ====
At least as important as the increase in acreage, improvement in the quality of previously existing wetlands that has resulted from the delivery of suitable water. Increasing water supplies to wetlands also has the effect of improving water quality, both on and off refuges. For example, providing firm, quality water supplies has reduced the exposure of waterfowl and shore birds spending the winter in the Grasslands area of the valley to contaminents. In a report on selenium in aquatic birds from the Central Valley, 1986-1994, FWS scientists noted that application of freshwater resulted in the decline of selenium contamination. Improved maintenance water flows through refuge ponds to improve water quality and reduce avian disease. The ability to battle avian disease outbreaks, such as botulism and cholera, is greatly assisted by applying additional water and creating a "flow through" system of water delivery and drainage. This "flow through" also helps deal with wetland areas high in salinity, which are often lower in productivity and diversity. CVPIA water allows wetland managers to "flush" salts from wetland basins and improve soil quality.

[[File:Anser albifrons elgasi, Colusa NWR 1.jpg|thumbnail|left|Greater White Fronted Geese at Colusa National Wildlife Refuge]]

=== Migratory Waterfowl ===
Since the passage of the CVPIA, Sacramento Valley areas receiving CVP water have seen a 20% increase in waterfowl use and a significant decline in water-borne wildlife diseases. Waterfowl use in the early fall have recorded increases of 800 percent, from 2 million to over 18 million waterfowl use days per year.

White-faced ibis and sandhill cranes are excellent examples of how the availability of adequate water supplies enabled refuge managers to provide habitat for endemic species that had been in severe decline for decades. Improved water supplies first led to an increase in the numbers of frogs, snails, aquatic insects, and small fish. This, in turn, provided the ibis and cranes with habitat for late-spring and summer nesting, essential components for these species. The increased and improved breeding habitat resulted in a steady upswing in bird numbers.

=== Other Wildlife ===
Wetlands are diverse ecosystems. The increased wetland acreage and improved water quality has benefited more than bird populations. Improved water supplies led to an increase in the numbers of frogs, snails, aquatic insects, and small fish. Habitat that is now available during the months of August and early September is utilized by resident wildlife and their young during a critical time of the year when wetland habitat is otherwise reduced. Introducing water for semi-permanent and permanent wetland habitat in the spring and summer directly benefits the recovery of special status species such as the giant garter snake and tri-colored blackbirds.

== Budget ==
The CVPIA is a federal program and receives funding every year through Congressional appropriation.  It would require between $50 - $60 Million annually to achieve the goals of the RWSP. The most recent budget (FY 2017) provided approximately $22 Million.

'''''Safe trade''''' is a slogan advocated by [[Greenpeace]] in its desire to "[[Green movement|green]]" the [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[Doha Development Round]].  It is designed to compete with "[[free trade]]" as a concept.

Safe trade is generally seen as a single framework of rules worldwide to drastically inhibit the flow of alien [[organism]]s (e.g. [[Genetically modified organism]]s, [[imported animals]]) across the borders of [[ecoregion]]s, to preserve their natural wild [[biodiversity]].  It seeks to prevent [[ecological]] disasters caused by imported organisms or untested [[genetics|genetic]] [[technologies]], and to augment and increase local [[natural capital]] by encouraging soil remediation, [[precision agriculture]], and [[local consumption]] of the [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] [[species]], rather than imported organisms and heavy use of [[pesticide]]s.

==Proposal==
An important achievement of safe [[trade]] [[advocacy]] is the [[Biosafety Protocol]] agreed in [[Montreal]] in January 2000.  Although it relied on the weaker legal principle of [[Informed Consent]] and not the much stronger [[Precautionary Principle]] language sought by advocates, the [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] was considered by most to be a victory that could enhance both [[biosafety]] and [[biosecurity]].

Other safe trade reforms seek to advance [[sustainability]] by reducing reliance on [[energy]] [[subsidies]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]-based [[transport]], and (indirectly) improves [[Equity (economics)|equity]] in [[economic]] affairs - that is, it promotes a safer [[political economy]] which is more respectful of [[life]] in general.

Safe trade is a major goal of systems of [[Bioregional democracy]] and is often advocated alongside it, e.g. by [[Green movement|Greens]].  Both are also implicitly related to [[Community-Based Economics]], as local trade in local goods with no reliance on [[Alien (biology)|alien]] organisms presents no ecological risk to its [[genome]]s, [[soil]], or [[drainage basin]]s.  Accordingly, some advocates argue, local trade in any native species within an ecoregion's borders should not be taxed at all, as it presents little or no ecological risk compared to imported goods, and so requires little or no [[regulation]], labelling, [[inspection]], or other expenses.

The assumption that imports carry [[moral hazard]]s, and that [[tax, trade, tariff]] measures should compensate for harms done, is shared by advocates of [[fair trade]] whose programs address, in addition, more overt [[social justice]] concerns of [[human]] beings, such as the maintenance of the "[[human capital]]" of a region.  Both initiatives are alternatives to [[free trade]], which has no such controls, and generally permits and encourages free [[transport|transit]] in goods (but not, in general, labour) across ecological and social borders.

A broader understanding of [[biosecurity]] that is emerging under threat of [[biological warfare]], and the fear that such economically devastating events as the [[mad cow disease]] epidemic could recur, either deliberately (as an act of [[bioterrorism]]) or by accident due to unrestricted imports, is causing some nations, notably [[New Zealand]], to adopt relatively harsh restrictions against imported organisms.  As one objective of [[asymmetric warfare]] is to cause attacks to appear initially as accidents, or blame slow responses on apparently incompetent governments, there is some concern that spreading a virulent organism among animals would be an effective way to attack humans, damage economies, and discredit governments who are lax on [[biosecurity]].  Technologies for scanning for dangerous organisms at ports and markets are also becoming more reliable and less expensive.  However, no [[bio-defense]] solution seems to be able to compete with a simple reduction of import volumes, and its corresponding reduction in risk of any accidents.

==Reception==
===Opposition===
Critics of safe trade argue that the [[military]] and [[agriculture]] aspects of [[biosecurity]] are dissimilar, unlikely to converge in the form of an attack disguised as an accident, and require such differential prevention and response measures that there is little risk reduced in altering the [[fundamental structure]] of trade relationships to accommodate a robust regime of [[biosecurity]].  Such critics usually argue instead that emergency services' [[biodefense]] measures are sufficient to handle outbreaks of any diseases or alien organisms, and that such outbreaks are unlikely to be long sustained or deliberately masked as agricultural accidents.  This, to the advocates, seems like wishful thinking.

===Support===
Advocates point to the costs of emergency measures such as burning over one million cows suspected of having [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in the UK, smoke from which they calculated (based on [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] levels) was to be expected to kill several hundred Britons from cancers in this generation.  Safe trade, they argue, would have removed the need for any such measures, as [[vaccination]] of British beef cattle would have been possible (the burning was to prevent British exports of beef from being rejected by its trade partners, who would not have been able to tell vaccinated from infected beef), and the foot-and-mouth disease was not so dangerous to humans that it could have justified dooming so many fellow citizens to die of the dioxin-caused cancers.  The burning, they argue, was justified only by bad trade rules that spread infection and advise dangerous cures that are worse than the ailment itself.

Another argument supporting safe trade rules is that there are links between [[primate]] extinction and [[deforestation]] in the regions where primates are abundant, i.e. the [[Amazon rainforest]], [[African rainforest]], and [[Sumatran rainforest]].  Fail to prevent devastating logging in these regions, advocates claim, and a [[Great Ape]] species will likely become extinct, causing a critical link to the human past to be permanently lost.  Accordingly, preventing logs from these forests from reaching foreign markets has been a major focus of [[Greenpeace]] actions, especially in 2002.

Born and raised in the [[Kingdom of Tonga]], '''Sisi’uno Helu''' (born 1972) has become the leading impresario of European opera within Polynesia. She holds a diploma in instrumental music from the University of Queensland's School of Music, awarded in 1993.
[[File:Sisiʻuno Helu.jpg|thumb|Sisiʻuno Helu|right]]

==Life==
In her early 20s, she pioneered the performing arts division of [[ʻAtenisi Institute]] in Tonga; the institute’s university had, since its inception in 1975, adhered to a classical curriculum that focused on philosophy, literature, mathematics, and music. Helu’s division offered instruction in European opera as well as traditional Tongan ''faiva''.

Between 1996 and 2006, the division’s troupe toured the U.S. and Pacific. A typical presentation included two or three lavishly costumed excerpts from ''Aida, La Bohème, Carmen, Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Don Giovanni, Nabucco, La Traviata, Il Trovatore'', or ''Rigoletto''. The troupe would sing passages in the scored language with a slight Polynesian accent. The excerpts often followed choral selections from Bach, Handel, Mozart, or Purcell.

‘Atenisi had been founded as a continuing education centre in 1963 by Helu’s father, [[Futa Helu|Dr ‘Ilaisa Futa Helu]] (1934-2010), and eventually comprised a high school, university, and the performing arts division. In 2007, with a cavalcade of productions to her credit, Helu returned to Tonga to succeed her ailing father as institute director. On her father’s suggestion, she tapped former associate dean, U.S. sociologist Dr Michael Horowitz, as university dean. Working as a team, Helu and Horowitz have placed talented graduates in lucrative postgraduate fellowships in Europe, the U.S., and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://matangitonga.to/2015/09/14/atenisi-celebrates-40-years&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Helu launched a satellite performance centre in suburban Sydney, the Futa Helu Performing Arts and Culture Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://matangitonga.to/2011/11/18/helu-family-launches-new-cultural-group-australia&lt;/ref&gt; Like its Tongan parent, the academy teaches European opera as well as traditional Tongan ''faiva''.

Concurrent with her directorships in both Tonga and Australia, Helu has also taught instrumental music, music theory, and Polynesian dance … not only to students at ‘Atenisi’s university but to secondary school students on Tongatapu, who attend her classes on ‘Atenisi’s campus in late afternoon.

Along with Horowitz and her sister ‘Atolomake, Helu starred in an hour-long documentary about ‘Atenisi, ''Tongan Ark'', that was critically acclaimed at the New Zealand International Film Festival in 2012. Among other attractions, the documentary features snippets of past performances under Helu’s baton.

'''Techsource''' involves the [[automation]], or conversion of a task or job from a manual task performed by a person, to a job performed entirely by machines. The concept of "techsourcing" has occurred across many industries for many years, however the phrase was coined by George Tosh, Principle Software Engineer for Salesforce in 2016.  Techsourcing might include the use of [[robotics]], or dedicated purpose-built machines to complete a task, but not always.

A popular example of techsourcing is the ATM or “[[Automated Teller Machine]]”. The ATM performs many of the tasks that human [[bank teller]]s performed. It has allowed banks and other financial institutions to increase customer satisfaction through decreased wait times, but often at the cost of job opportunities for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teach-ict.com/gcse_new/organisations/banking/miniweb/pg2.htm|title=Teach ICT - GCSE ICT - banking and ICT|website=www.teach-ict.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techsourcing usually occurs for jobs and roles that cannot be outsourced due to the specific nature of the job.

In 2015, and continuing into 2016, the push for a $15/hour minimum wage among many [[minimum wage]] earners has increased fears among [[economists]] that increasing the minimum wage will only lead to jobs being “techsourced”, automated, or eliminated entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/05/26/mcdonalds-ex-ceo-says-15-minimum-wage-would-lead-to-robots-and-automation-hes-right/#150611d57860|title=McDonald's Ex-CEO Is Right When He Says A $15 Minimum Wage Would Lead To Automation|last=Worstall|first=Tim|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that minimum wage jobs are not the only jobs at risk for being techsourced. In Belgium two hospitals have employed robots as receptionists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/345245/pepper-robot-lands-a-hospital-job|title=Pepper Robot Lands a Hospital Job|website=PCMAG|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to offer directions and assist patients, jobs that previously would have been filled by humans.

'''''The Discipline of Market Leaders''''' is a 1995 book written by Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema and published by [[Addison-Wesley]]. The book discusses competitive business strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/business/business-best-sellers.html |title=Business Best Sellers |date=September 3, 1995 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] after the authors placed orders for thousands of copies of their own book.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/28/books/article-says-2-authors-tried-to-exploit-times-list.html |title=Article Says 2 Authors Tried to Exploit Times List |last1=Glaberson |first1=William |date=July 28, 1995 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The core of the book is based on five years of research by the authors into companies such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Dell]], [[Southwest Airlines]], [[Cott]], [[Airborne Express]], [[Atlantic Richfield]], [[Home Depot]], [[Intel]] and [[Sony]]. It opens with several business questions, such as "Why is it that [[Casio]] can sell a calculator more cheaply than [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg]]'s can sell a box of corn flakes? Does corn cost that much more than silicon?" The book raises questions about American business management and practices and then attempts to answer them. It also examines the financial benefits for companies that focus primarily on customer satisfaction rather than [[shareholder]] profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-03-27/business/9503270030_1_sony-corp-fred-wiersema-authors |title=New Breed Of Company Gains Ground With Novel Approach: Customer First |last1=Yates |first1=Ronald |date=March 27, 1995 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book provides a business model based on three dimensions (called 'Value Disciplines"):
# Customer Intimacy
# Product Leadership
# Operational Excellence
and postulates that any successful business needs to maintain at least "acceptable" levels of performance in each of the three dimensions but would need to choose one of them to become a market leader in its field. The model suggests that if you truly want to excel in any of the three disciplines you will have to make sacrifices in the other two as these become mutually exclusive. 

==Reception==
The book debuted on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller Non-Fiction list on February 26, 1995, and remained on the list for 15 weeks,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; peaking at No. 4.&lt;ref name=peak&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/business/spending-it-business-best-sellers.html |title=SPENDING IT; Business Best Sellers |date=April 2, 1995 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also debuted at No. 1 on the ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' best-seller list on April 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/01/books/book-notes-004774.html |title=Book Notes |last1=Tabor |first1=Mary |date=November 1, 1995 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was reported to have sold over 250,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKie |first=David |last2=Munshi |first2=Debahish |title=Reconfiguring Public Relations: Ecology, Equity and Enterprise (Routledge Advances in Management and Business Studies) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A23v5xZA-MEC&amp;pg=PA83 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location= |isbn=978-0415512497 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lois Weisberg]] stated the book "Provides great insight into the linkage of product value, operating excellence and customer focus,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-01-10/entertainment/9901100368_1_massage-therapist-perseus-books-cultural-affairs |title=Regina M.

==Allegations==

An August 1995 article in ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' by Will Stern first alleged the authors had manipulated sales of their book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/27/books/a-best-seller-plot-is-said-to-be-charged.html |title=A Best-Seller Plot Is Said to Be Charged |last1=Stout |first1=David |date=July 27, 1995 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treacy and Addison-Wesley denied trying to manipulate sales, though Stern states according to his sources the campaign was orchestrated by Treacy and carried out with the help of Wiersema, Addison-Wesley and CSC Index, an international consulting firm Treacy regularly consulted for.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt; It was revealed that the names of the bookstores that would be used to gauge book sales for ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list had become known, and that orders for the book had been placed at those stores. Stern states he interviewed dozens of book store owners, including one who took a suspicious order for 125 copies of the book shortly after it was published. After also interviewing over 100 book industry representatives, Stern concludes the authors spent over $250,000 buying over 10,000 copies of their own book. The authors admitted to buying "fewer than 10,000" copies of the book for clients and prospective clients.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Stern also states CSC Index was used to covertly purchase an additional 30,000 to 40,000 copies. He traced many purchases of the book to CSC employees and affiliates. Most CSC affiliates refused to comment on the issue; however, the President of Paragon Co, a database marketing firm in [[Oxford, Ohio]], confirmed that CSC had reimbursed him for over 10,000 copies of the book that he ordered for his firm, costing over $200,000. It was reportedly boasted around the office at Paragon Co that the company was involved in a scheme to make the book a best-seller, and so many copies of the book arrived at the firm they were stored in a tractor trailer.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt; An independent book store in [[Manhattan]] sold 2,500 copies of the book to a consulting firm in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/27/business/the-media-business-a-one-store-bookseller-challenges-the-giants.html |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; A One-Store Bookseller Challenges the Giants |last1=Feder |first1=Barnaby |date=February 27, 1995 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' initially stated they were aware of the bulk book sales, and that they were confident the bulk sales had not increased the books position on the best-seller list.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1995-08-06/did-dirty-tricks-create-a-best-seller |title=Did Dirty Tricks Create A Best Seller? |last1=Stern |first1=Will |date=August 6, 1995 |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing the article in ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', however, the editor of ''The New York Times'' book review section stated it was possible that the result had been manipulated, but that the process "would be so expensive that [they'd] have to have another reason for doing it beyond simply boosting book sales.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

It is alleged the authors spent money on their own book in order to gain the benefits that are common from making ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list, such as speaking engagements and consulting opportunities, as well as further book sales, as chart success often begets more chart success. Treacy was said to be giving around 80 speeches a year, increasing his [[speaking fee]] from $25,000 to $30,000 after featuring on the best-seller list. While it is uncertain if the practice is illegal, the tactic has been described by publishers and booksellers as highly unethical.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt;  Following the incident ''The New York Times'' improved their methods for filtering bulk sales from affecting the list, and made a better effort to hide the names of stores that were reporting for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blank |first=Grant |title=Critics, Ratings, and Society: The Sociology of Reviews |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM5KyiTkWxsC&amp;pg=PA145 |accessdate= May 8, 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location= |isbn=978-0742547025 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

His father, Count [[Aldo Maria Brachetti Peretti]], [[Order of Merit for Labour|Cavaliere Del Lavoro]] was the head of the family group, [[Anonima Petroli Italiana (API)]] for thirty years, until his retirement in September 2007. The company was founded by his maternal grandfather Cavaliere Del Lavoro Ferdinando Peretti. His mother, Mila Peretti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mila Peretti | url=http://www.cri.it/componenti/infermiere_volontarie/mila.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the ''National Inspectress'' of the [[Italian Red Cross]], which she has served for over 30 years. She is the only woman in Italy to carry the military grade of General.  
In 2005 Peretti married the [[Countess]] Isabella Borromeo Arese Taverna. They have three children: Angera (b. 2005), Ludovico (b. 2008) and a second son Federico (b. 2012).

==Career==
He was educated at the [[ACS International Schools|American Community School]] in London where he graduated in 1983 with an international [[Baccalaureate degree]] and then qualified for a degree in [[Business Administration]] at the [[American University of Rome]] in 1987. He subsequently obtained his specialization at [[Boston University]]. He completed his military service as an officer of the [[Carabinieri]]. 
 
After 1990 he started working as a manager in the family business of which he and his brothers are 100% [[shareholder]]s. During his time with API he has held many positions, at first operating the "downstream cycle" (a combination of activities such as deliveries, transportation, [[Oil refining|refining]], sale and marketing of oil). In 2007, after a series of promotions, he became Chairman of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CEO | url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/settembre/21/Api_Brachetti_Peretti_lascia_guida_co_9_070921082.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he focused the Group's activities back to the oil sector, with the strengthening of the distribution network and the improvement of the Falconara refinery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/economia/16_febbraio_24/api-ritorno-petrolio-190-milioni-954b6890-db2c-11e5-956c-6f7e55711737.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; He holds several other chairs, vice-chairs and advisory positions within API as well as being a member of the boards at [[UniCredit]], the Executive Council of the "Rome Industrial Union" and Unione Petrolifera.

'''William Avery Rockefeller, Jr.''' (May 31, 1841 – June 24, 1922) was an American businessman and financier. He was a co-founder of [[Standard Oil]] along with his older brother [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller]] (1839–1937). He was also a prominent member of the [[Rockefeller family]].

==Early years==
William Jr. was born in [[Richford, New York]]. He was the middle son of con artist [[William Rockefeller Sr.|William Avery Rockefeller Sr.]] (1810—1906) and Eliza Davison (1813—1889). In addition to elder brother [[John D. Rockefeller|John]], William Jr.'s siblings were Lucy (1838—1878), Mary (1843—1925), and twins [[Frank Rockefeller|Franklin (Frank)]] (1845—1917) and Frances (1845—1847). He also had two elder half-sisters, Clorinda (c. 1838—?, died young) and Cornelia (c. 1840—?), through his father's affairs with mistress and housekeeper Nancy Brown.&lt;ref name=Titan&gt;{{cite web|last=Chernow|first=Ron|title=The Flimflam Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/c/chernow-titan.html|work=New York Times|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 his family moved to [[Strongsville, Ohio]]. As a young pupil in public school, he was inspired and motivated by his teacher-mentor, [[Rufus Osgood Mason]], whom Rockefeller later named "A Rockefeller Patron."

==Business career==
When the newly formed [[Mutual Alliance Trust Company]] opened for business in New York on the Tuesday after June 29, 1902, there were 13 directors, including [[Emanuel Lehman]] and Rockefeller.&lt;ref name=nyt-vander&gt;{{Citation | date       =June 29, 1902| title      =Mutual Alliance Trust Co.| work =The New York Times| page = 35| url        =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A03EFDC113DEE32A2575AC2A9609C946397D6CF&amp;legacy=true| accessdate =January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil business===
In 1865, Rockefeller entered the oil business by starting a refinery in Ohio. In 1867, his older brother John's firm, [[Rockefeller &amp; Andrews]], absorbed the refinery. In 1870, that company became [[Standard Oil]].

Rockefeller was very adept in business matters. He served as the company's [[New York (state)|New York]] representative until 1911 when Standard Oil of New Jersey was split up by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. He also had interests in copper mining and processing, railways (which had expanded extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and public utilities, and built up the National City Bank of New York, now known as [[Citigroup]].

===Copper mining===
In the late 1890s, Rockefeller joined fellow Standard Oil principal [[Henry H. Rogers]] in forming the [[Amalgamated Copper Mining Company]], a holding company that intended to control the copper industry. Rockefeller, along with Henry Rogers, devised a scheme which earned them a profit of $36 million. First, they purchased Anaconda Properties from [[Marcus Daly]] for $39 million, with the understanding that the check was to be deposited in the bank and remain there for a definite time (National City Bank was run by Rockefeller's friends). Rogers and Rockefeller then set up a [[paper organization]], known as the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, with their own clerks as dummy directors, saying the company was worth $75 million.

They had Amalgamated Copper Company buy Anaconda from them for $75 million in capital stock, which was conveniently printed for the purpose. Then, they borrowed $39 million from the bank using Amalgamated Copper as collateral. They paid back Daly for Anaconda and sold $75 million worth of stock in Amalgamated Copper to the public. They paid back the bank's $39 million and had a profit of $36 million in cash.

With help from banker [[John D. Ryan (mining)|John Dennis Ryan]], Amalgamated acquired two large competitors, and soon controlled all the mines of [[Butte, Montana]]. By the late 1920s it had become [[Anaconda Copper Company]] and was the fourth-largest company in the world.

From 1912 to 1913, the [[Pujo Committee]] investigated Rockefeller and others for allegedly earning $30 million in profit through cornering the copper market and "synchronizing with artificially enforced activity" in Amalgamated Copper stock in the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/01/06/100603509.pdf|format=PDF|title=Don't Expect Rockefeller|website=Timesmachine.nytimes.com|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller married Almira Geraldine Goodsell (March 19, 1844 — January 17, 1920) on May 25, 1864 in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Almira&gt;{{cite web|title=Almira Geraldine Goodsell|url=http://backushistory.info/getperson.php?personID=I16143&amp;tree=backus1|publisher=backushistory.info|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many connections among this and other elite families. Her sister Esther Judson Goodsell was married to [[Oliver Burr Jennings]], who became one of the original stockholders of Standard Oil. Together, William and Almira had:
#Lewis Edward Rockefeller (March 2, 1865 — August 3, 1866)
#Emma Rockefeller (June 8, 1868 — August 11, 1934), who married Dr. David Hunter McAlpin
#[[William Goodsell Rockefeller]] (May 21, 1870 — November 30, 1922), who married Sarah Elizabeth "Elsie" Stillman
#John Davison Rockefeller II (March 8, 1872 — 1877)
#[[Percy Avery Rockefeller]] (February 27, 1878 — September 25, 1934), who married Isabel Goodrich Stillman
#[[Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge|Ethel Geraldine Rockefeller]] (April 3, 1882 — August 13, 1973), who married [[Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr.]]
William Rockefeller, Jr. died of pneumonia on June 24, 1922 in Tarrytown. He had caught a cold during a car trip he took with brother [[John D. Rockefeller|John]] and nephew [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.|John, Jr.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;]] to visit his childhood home in [[Richford, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=William Rockefeller Dies At Home; Cold Contracted In Rain Fatal |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xCBQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uQoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6813,4611350&amp;dq=william+rockefeller&amp;hl=en |quote=Rockefeller, a founder of the Standard Oil company and one of the wealthiest men in the United States, died of pneumonia Saturday morning at his home.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 25, 1922 |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]], [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

''[[The New York Times]]'', in discussing a trust that Rockefeller set up for his born and yet-to-be born great-grandchildren, stated that he "left a gross estate of $102,000,000 which was reduced to $50,000,000 principally by $30,000,000 of debts and $18,600,000 of [[Inheritance taxes|inheritance and estate taxes]]."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 5 August 1937, p. 1 "Estate of William Rockefeller Increasing $1,000,000 a Year"&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller was a regular attendee of the [[Saint Mary's Episcopal Church]] in Scarborough in the last few years of his life.&lt;ref name="NYT WAR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wm. Rockefeller Dies of Pneumonia|newspaper=The New York Times|page=14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/06/25/archives/wm-rockefeller-dies-of-pneumonia-ill-only-a-week-a-founder-of.html|date=June 25, 1922|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and descendants===
Rockefeller and Almira's second son, [[William Goodsell Rockefeller]], married Sarah Elizabeth "Elsie" Stillman, the elder daughter of [[James Stillman|James Jewett Stillman]] and Sarah Elizabeth Stillman; the father was National City Bank president. The new couple's family included [[James Stillman Rockefeller]]. He became a member of the [[Jekyll Island Club]] (aka The millionaires Club) on [[Jekyll Island, Georgia]], along with [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Joseph Pulitzer]], and other business moguls of the day.

===Residences===
In 1886, Rockefeller bought property in Westchester County along the [[Hudson River]] from General Lloyd Aspinwall. He renovated or rebuilt the mansion [[Rockwood Hall]].

The '''Rockefeller Cottage''' is a house on [[Jekyll Island, Georgia]]. It is also called ''Indian Mound'' and is next to the [[Jekyll Island Club]]. The house was built by [[Gordon McKay]] in 1892. McKay died in 1903 and the house was bought by William Rockefeller in 1905, who used it as a winter home. It was evacuated in 1942, along with the rest of the island. The house remained in the Rockefeller family until 1947, when the Jekyll Island Authority bought the property. It was open as a museum from 1950 until 1968, when it was closed for badly needed repairs. It is now a public museum.Decades later the former "Indian Mound" Cottage was [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Glynn County, Georgia|listed on the National Register of Historic Places]] as [[Rockefeller Cottage]].

A '''work at home parent''' is an [[entrepreneur]] who works from [[home]] and integrates [[parenting]] into his or her business activities. They are sometimes referred to as a WAHM (work at home mom) or a WAHD (work at home dad).

Entrepreneurs choose to run businesses from home for a variety of reasons, including lower business expenses, personal health limitations, eliminating [[commuting]], or in order to have a more flexible schedule. This flexibility can give an entrepreneur more options when planning tasks, business and non-business, including parenting duties. While some home-based entrepreneurs opt for [[childcare]] outside the home,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://workathomemoms.about.com/od/childcare/a/childcaretypes.htm|title=7 Ways to Take Charge of Child Care|last=Duncan|first=Apryl|date=August 23, 2016|work=The Spruce|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; others integrate child rearing into their [[Working time|work day]] and workspace. The latter are considered work-at-home parents.

Many WAHPs start [[Home business|home-based businesses]] in order to care for their children while still creating [[income]]. The desire to care for one's own children, the incompatibility of a [[Working time#9-to-5|9-to-5]] work day with school hours or sick days, and the expense of childcare prompt many parents to change or leave their jobs in the [[workforce]] to be available to their children. Many WAHPs build a business schedule that can be integrated with their parenting duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.workhomelife.com.au/become-work-home-parent/|title=Why become a Work at Home Parent? - Work / Home / Life|last=Gourlay|first=Sharon|date=2014-10-28|work=Work / Home / Life|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrating Business and Parenting ==
An integration of parenting and business can take place in one or more of four key ways: combined uses of time, combined uses of space, normalizing children in business, and flexibility.

Combining uses of time involves some level of [[Human multitasking|multitasking]], such as taking children on business errands, and the organized scheduling of business activities during child’s down times and vice versa. The WAHP combines uses of space by creating a home (or mobile) office that accommodates the child's presence.

Normalizing acknowledges the child’s presence in the business environment. This can include letting key business partners know that parenting is a priority, establishing routines and rules for children in the office, and even having children help with business when appropriate.

Finally, the WAHP can utilize the inherent flexibility of the work-at-home arrangement. This may mean working in smaller increments of time instead of long stretches, looser scheduling of the day’s activities to allow for the unexpected, and working at non-traditional times.

A business that demands 9-to-5 business hours, a polished office, intense one-on-one time with clients, dangerous materials, or impromptu appointments may not work well for a parent with children at home. Thus, not all professions lend themselves to work-at-home parenting.  Without good organization, the WAHP may experience decreased productivity due to added responsibilities and unexpected interruptions.  Internet businesses or 'virtual assistants' are well-suited as work-at-home businesses.

The Center for Women's Business Research, a non-profit organization, found that [[Generation X]] mothers are the most likely to work from home. The center also reports that between 1997 and 2004, employment at female-owned companies grew by 24.2%, more than twice the rate of the 11.6% logged by all businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-05-03/working-moms-tear-down-office-walls|title=Working Moms Tear Down Office Walls|last=Gogoi|first=Pallavi|date=2005-05-04|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of businesses that WAHPs may engage in include [[telecommuting]] for corporations, freelancing on project such as articles, graphic design or consulting, or working as an independent contractor, running home-party businesses, managing complete companies from home, and providing valuable business and marketing support.

== History ==
The concept of the WAHP has been around for as long as [[guild|small businesses]] have.  In [[pre-industrial]] societies, [[merchant]]s and [[artisan]]s often worked out of or close to their homes. Children typically remained in the care of a parent during the day and were often present while the parents worked. Societal changes in the 1800s, such as [[compulsory education]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], made working from home with children around less common.

[[Entrepreneurship]] saw a resurgence in the 1980s, with more of an emphasis on [[work-life balance]].  Among the long-traditional groups of WAHPs are those professionals in private practice with home offices such as physicians, therapists, music teachers and tutors. The term WAHP began gaining popularity in the late 1990s especially as the growth of the Internet allowed for small business owners and entrepreneurs to have greater options for starting and running their businesses. By 2004, over 20 million people worked at home at least part-time (either as business owners or in a formal arrangement with their employer), many of whom were parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/homey.nr0.htm|title=Work At Home Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=Division of Labor Statistics|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a digital magazine was established by a WAHM with a decade of experience in the publications field specifically for work-at-home parents. The [[WAHM (magazine)|WAHM Magazine]] was designed to address the issues of the complete lifestyle of work-at-home parents regardless of field or industry, and has a mission to validate, empower, encourage, educate and support WAHPs in their personal, professional and lifestyle goals. And the end of the first decade of the 21st century, [[telecommuting]] is becoming a greater option for companies and employees alike for a variety of economic and environmental concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2585">'''Workforce Investment Boards''' (or "WIBs") were regional entities created to implement the [[Workforce Investment Act of 1998]] in the [[United States]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of Palau]] and the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]]. The implementing law was replaced by the [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act]] in 2014.

Every community in the fifty states, the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and [[Republic of Palau]], was associated with a Local WIB (LWIB). For each LWIB, a chief elected official (for example, a county commissioner or the mayor of a lead city) appointed members to sit on the WIB.  These appointed positions were unpaid.  At least 50% of a WIB's membership was required to come from private businesses.  There were also designated seats for representatives from [[labor unions]] and educational institutions like [[community college]]s as well. Beyond these basic guidelines, many aspects of how an individual WIB operated could vary.

The WIB's main role was to direct [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Local government|local]] funding to [[workforce development]] programs. WIBs conducted and published research on these programs and the needs of their regional economy. They also oversaw the [[One-Stop Career Centers]], where job seekers could get employment information, find out about career development training opportunities and connect to various programs in their area. One-Stop Career Centers also provided many no-cost services to employers. Services varied by state and WIB.

WIBs worked in conjunction with economic development related organizations to minimize the reaction time and create resources to intervene for both the dislocated workforce and the incumbent workforce members of a community.
