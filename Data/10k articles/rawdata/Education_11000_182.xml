'''AVANCE''' is an American non-profit organization, headquartered in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] with locations across the United States. Formed in 1973, it provides free parenting and early childhood education programs to low-income, predominately Hispanic, families with children of up to three years of age.&lt;ref name="AVANCE Home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avance.org/ |title='Home' |publisher=Avance |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AVANCE's name derives from the Spanish word for "advance"&lt;ref name="AVANCE Home"/&gt; It originally started in 1973 as a 500-unit public housing development serving 35 families in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. Currently it encompasses over 100 programs across U.S.A. The number of participants in its early childhood education/parenting and family support services number several thousand.&lt;ref name="AVANCE's History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avance.org/ |title='AVANCE's History' |publisher=avance.org|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2014}} The concept of the organization was based on the educational theories of [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], of [[Cornell University]],&lt;ref name="AVANCE's History"/&gt; and whose graduate students established the first AVANCE  program in [[Dallas]], Texas in 1973.&lt;ref name="AVANCE's History" /&gt; The founders received start-up funding from the [[Zale Corporation]] which allowed for an expansion of the program to San Antonio.

==Premise==
The basis of the pProgram is on Dr. Bronfenrenner's (1979) observations of the impact of environmental factors on human development.&lt;ref name="AVANCE Parent-Child Education Program"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_6TUCMlzhMC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69 |title=AVANCE Parent-Child Education Program - paper written by Todd B. Walker, Gloria Rodriguez, Dale L. Johnson, Carmen P. Cortez, published in report entitled ''Two Generation Programs for Families in Poverty: A New Intervention Strategy'. Edited by Sheila Smith.|publisher=Ablex Publishing Corporation|date= |page=69 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research suggested that factors external to the family were constraints to escaping from poverty cycles, and the research aimed to provide model for intervention.&lt;ref name="AVANCE Parent-Child Education Program"/&gt; The Parent-Child Education Program, adopted by AVANCE,  focuses on the role of both parent and child.&lt;ref name="AVANCE Parent-Child Education Program"/&gt; It assists parents by providing a stable home environment improving the parents' language and work skills, their parenting knowledge, and awareness of community services.&lt;ref name="AVANCE Parent-Child Education Program"/&gt;

==Parent-child education program==
The principal program AVANCE promotes is the Parent-Child Education Program. This aims to help parents create a cognitively rich environment.&lt;ref name="The AVANCE Model"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avance.org/ |title=The AVANCE Model |publisher=Avance |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers seek to do this by encouraging parents to stimulate their children's development through talking to them, praising them and interacting with the world around them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The New York Times referred to the goal of AVANCE as, "Teaching mothers how to teach their children."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;"The New York Times1"&lt;/ref&gt; The program is structured in two tiers, with the first addressing the children's basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical services. The second stage focusses on the parents' educational needs, where applicable, with the aim of improving the home environment and parents' employment options.

The Parent-Child Education Program consists of weekly three-hour classes that are designed to mirror the local school calendar and comprises curricula based on Play and Toys, Parenting Education, Home Visits and Community Resource Awareness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;"The AVANCE Model"&lt;/ref&gt; The average participant in the program is a low-income Hispanic mother in her mid-twenties, with 2 – 3 children. However, it also includes fathers, grandparents and primary guardians or caregivers of children up to three years of age.&lt;ref name="Focus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc191.pdf |title='Focus' |publisher=Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=2012-01-12|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of participants possess no higher than a ninth-grade education and limited or no work experience.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;"Focus"&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of the program is to provide practical support in order to encourage parental participation by arranging transport to and from program services, providing free meals and employing bilingual staff from the same communities as participants.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Individuals are not charged for participating in the program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Assessment of effectiveness==
The effectiveness of the Parent-Child Education Program was evaluated over a four-year period, from 1987 – 1991 with support from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]].&lt;ref name="AVANCE Parent-Child Education Program"/&gt; The evaluation studied a group of 486 individuals, comprising 207 participants in the AVANCE program and 279 in a control group.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The data collected related to maternal knowledge, behavior, attitudes and continuing education.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Corporation Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avance.org/why-avance/impact/carnegie-corporation-study/ |title='Carnegie Corporation Study' |publisher=avance.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228223103/http://www.avance.org/why-avance/impact/carnegie-corporation-study/ |archivedate=2011-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study continued over a two-year period and concluded that "most of the program goals were attained to an impressive degree."&lt;ref name="Compendium of Comprehensive, Community-based Initiatives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://76.12.61.196/publications/compendium.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318031856/http://76.12.61.196/publications/compendium.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-18 |title='Compendium of Comprehensive, Community-based Initiatives' |publisher=The Finance Project |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It found the two-generation Parent-Child Education Program for low-income families to be beneficial in such aspects as the home learning environment, maternal behaviors and attitudes towards children.&lt;ref name="SRI Internationals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policyweb.sri.com/cehs/publications/patfinal.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213070439/http://policyweb.sri.com/cehs/publications/patfinal.pdf| archivedate=2010-12-13| title=Multisite Parents As Teachers Evaluation – Experiences And Outcomes For Children And Families |publisher=[[SRI International]] |date=June 2001|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the program in Early Childhood Education Journal, found that children in the AVANCE-Dallas chapter academically outperformed their peers. In the 2005 TAKS ([[Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills]]), 88% of child graduates met the passing standard for reading, compared to 73% in the Dallas Independent School District and 83% in the state.{{sfn|Schaller| Rocha |Barshinger| 2006| p=355}}

A 1991 survey of 23 women and 32 children who had participated in AVANCE's first program group showed that 94% of the children had completed high school, received a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) or were still in education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;"Compendium of Comprehensive, Community-based Initiatives"&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 57% of the mothers who had previously dropped out of school, went back and resumed studies, subsequently attaining a GED.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

As part of a 1994 report into the state of care for children in U.S.A., the Carnegie Corporation commented on the AVANCE programs: "Evaluations show that Avance (sic.) programs improve families' ability to provide an emotionally stimulating and nurturing environment for their young children, positively influence mothers' childrearing attitudes and knowledge, and expand mother's use of community resources." &lt;ref name="The Quiet Crisis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie.org/fileadmin/Media/Publications/PDF/Starting%20Points%20Meeting%20the%20Needs%20of%20Our%20Youngest%20Children.pdf |title=The Quiet Crisis |publisher=Carnegie.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914184441/http://carnegie.org/fileadmin/Media/Publications/PDF/Starting%20Points%20Meeting%20the%20Needs%20of%20Our%20Youngest%20Children.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at a time, the report continued, when three million children, comprising almost 25% of all American infants and toddlers, lived in poverty.&lt;ref name="The New York Times3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/us/study-confirms-some-fears-on-us-children.html?scp=9&amp;sq=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title='Study Confirms Some Fears on U.S. Children' |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr. Susan B. Neuman]] investigated AVANCE's Parent-Child Education program as part of research into early intervention initiatives. She is Professor in Educational Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Elementary and Secondary Education, and was primarily responsible for implementing the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].&lt;ref name="Susan B. Newman"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Archived: Biography of Susan B. Neuman, Former Assistant Secretary of Elementary and Secondary Education
|accessdate = 2012-01-13| url = http://www.ed.gov/offices/OESE/neuman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AVANCE program was one of nine non-school intervention initiatives that Dr. Neuman examined. She found high performance levels for children who had participated in the program. 100% of children scored excellent or satisfactory on the Dallas school district's kindergarten test of pre-reading skills.&lt;ref name="Education Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edrev.info/reviews/rev1079.pdf |title=Neuman, Susan B.

==External recognition==
In 2009 AVANCE was awarded the E Pluribus Unum Prize,&lt;ref name="E Pluribus Unum Prizes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/integrationawards/winners-avance.cfm |title=2009 E Pluribus Unum Winner |publisher=mirgrationinformation.org |date=|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by the Migration Policy Institute's National Center on Immigration Integration Policy. This award is given in recognition of initiatives that help immigrants and their children to adapt and contribute to the United States.&lt;ref name="Accolades for AVANCE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avance.org/why-avance/accolades/ |title=Accolades for AVANCE |publisher=avance.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228221846/http://www.avance.org/why-avance/accolades/ |archivedate=2011-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, AVANCE was awarded the Simmons Luminary Award for education excellence by Southern Methodist University.

The work of the organization has been commented upon by former First Ladies, Hillary Clinton, Rosalynn Carter and Barbara Bush, in relation to education. In a 1999 forum on educational initiatives and issues held in Washington D.C., Clinton described AVANCE as "...one of the most effective home-building programs of support. If you're not familiar with it, you should see it and read about it."{{sfn|Hoholik|1999}} She had also written about the organization in her book, ''It Takes a Village''.&lt;ref name="Clinton1996"/&gt; Rosalynn Carter, in discussing the effectiveness of several organizations in the promotion of mental well-being, described AVANCE as one of those programs which '...have in common efforts to reduce the risk factors that can contribute to mental illness while they enhance protective factors that can help keep our children well.'&lt;ref name="Carter Golant"/&gt; Separately, The [[Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy]] recognized AVANCE among ten innovative family literacy programs that focused on early intervention.&lt;ref name="Education Resources Information Center"/&gt;

The organization was also included in a 1997 book and photographic exhibition called 'Pursuing the Dream', a joint venture between award-winning photographer, [[Stephen Shames]] and the Family Resource Coalition (FRC). This was the culmination of a two-year photographic record undertaken by Shames, of community programs serving disadvantaged youth and families and helping families achieve financial and emotional stability.&lt;ref name="ShamesWolf1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Shames|author2=Kathy Goetz Wolf|author3=Michael Jordan|author4=Roger Rosenblatt |others=Family Resource Coalition (Chicago, Ill.)|title=Pursuing the dream: what helps children and their families succeed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53LaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 January 2012|date=September 1997|publisher=Aperture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's work has been commented upon by [[Hillary Clinton]],&lt;ref name="Clinton1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillary Rodham Clinton|title=It takes a village: and other lessons children teach us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBvaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 January 2012|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-81843-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosalynn Carter]]&lt;ref name="Carter Golant"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosalynn Carter|author2=Susan K.

'''Atheneum''', named after the [[Athenaeum (ancient Rome)|ancient school]] founded by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]], is the name used for one of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] educational courses aimed at preparation for Scientific education on a university. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|vwo (voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs)]] which translates to 'preparatory scientific education', consists out of two substreams, the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and Atheneum. The latter does not require to do finals in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[Latin]] language and culture, while the former does.

Atheneum is a six-year course[1]. Successful completion allows the candidate to enroll in a Bachelor program at a Dutch university. The first three years of Atheneum are the same for every student. During the six years there are some mandatory subjects:

* Dutch 4F (language and literature)
* English (language and literature. Reading level C1. Listening, speaking, Writing level B2)
* German (language and literature. Reading level C1. Listening, speaking B2. Writing level B1)
* French (language and literature. Reading level B2. Listening B2. Speaking B1+. Writing level B1)
* P.E.
* Sociology (4th year)
* Calculus 3F
* Biology (until 3rd year)
* History (until 3rd year)
* Geography (until 3rd year)
* Cultural and artistic education (3rd year).

Apart from these mandatory subjects, there are some extra subjects that are mandatory in line with the chosen profile, within the last three years of Atheneum. There are four profiles a student can choose: Nature and Technology (NT), Nature and Health (NG), Economy and Society (EM), Culture and Society (CM).

Nature and Technology has the extra mandatory subjects:

* Mathematics (A/B/C/D)
* Physics
* Chemistry
* One subject of choice out of the subjects appointed by the general administrative order.

Nature and Health has the extra mandatory subjects:

* Mathematics (A/B/C/D)
* Biology
* Chemistry
* One subject of choice out of the subjects appointed by the general administrative order.

Economy and Society has the extra mandatory subjects:

* Mathematics (A/B/C/D)
* Economy
* History
* One subject of choice out of the subjects appointed by the general administrative order.

Culture and society has the extra mandatory subjects:

* Mathematics (A/B/C/D)
* History
* One cultural subject of choice
* One society subject of choice

It should be noted that in the third year a student makes the following decisions apart from their choice in profile:

* They may choose between French or German as a second modern language they want to study for the last three years of Atheneum.
* They choose one of the variants of Mathematics:
** A: Analytical, probability and statistic.
** B: Analytical, geometry, algebra and formula.
** C: Basic mathematics.
** D: More difficult Math B combined with extra subjects from A (This version is not taught in every Atheneum)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3401">The '''Broadcast Journalism Training Council''' (BJTC) is an industry-led body offering accreditation to courses for aspiring journalists.

==History==
In the late 1970s, the [[National Union of Journalists]] was pushing for a more structured approach to training for broadcast. After a series of meetings with universities, the [[BBC]] and the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]], the Joint Advisory Council for the Training of Radio Journalists was formed, chaired by the retired Managing Director of [[BBC World Service]], Gerard Mansell.&lt;ref name=bjtc&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bjtc.org.uk | title=BJTC web site | accessdate=11 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This organisation was the forerunner of the BJTC. In 1987, Tom Beesley succeeded Mansell as chair.  He continued for 23 years, before retiring in 2010. Other past Chairmen have been Marie Kinsey from the [[University of Sheffield]] and Martin Campbell, former [[Ofcom]] Chief Advisory. Currently the BJTC is chaired by [[Ralph Bernard]], CBE, with [[Jon Godel]] as its Chief Executive.

It was founded on 25 November 1996.

==Purpose==
The BJTC is a partnership of 90 per cent of UK broadcasting employers: the [[BBC]], [[ITV News]] Group, [[ITN]], [[Sky News]], [[Thomson-Reuters]], [[RadioCentre]], [[Associated Press Television News|APTN]], plus the [[NUJ]] and Creative Skillset, the sector Skills Council for the media industries. Associate members include 37 colleges and universities, running a total of 56 accredited courses. 
The aim of the BJTC is to make students more employable, so the primary role is as a forum for employers and training providers to agree training standards.&lt;ref name=bjtc/&gt; 

Recently the BJTC has reviewed and updated its Requirements in accordance and consultation with industry and academic personnel. These were published to all accredited courses in December 2015. 

The BJTC hold biannual conferences for Council members, allowing them to get up-to-date news from the BJTC and partake in debates, talks and workshops including voice training, mobile, social media and drone journalism. 

==Awards==
The BJTC also runs a successful annual awards programme. In 2016, the ceremony was held at [[ITV plc|ITV]] Southbank studios, hosted by [[Charlene White]] with students from [[City, University of London]] winning the top Steve Harris Award for Best Original Journalism. Past presenters have included [[Alastair Stewart]], [[Nina Hossain]], Neila Butt (BBC Diversity Editor), [[Dominic Laurie]] and Chris Mason (BBC Political Correspondent). 

==Structure==
It is headquartered in [[Gerrards Cross]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], near [[Gerrards Cross railway station]], between the B416 and [[A413 road|A413]].

'''Broadcom MASTERS''', a program of [[Society for Science &amp; the Public]], is a national science competition for U.S. middle school students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyforscience.org/masters SSP website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcom Foundation launched the competition in 2010 and pledged $6 million over the next 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710204314/http://articles.ocregister.com/2010-09-21/science/24647331_1_engineering-fair-elizabeth-marincola-middle-school Broadcom Foundation launches $6 million science contest, OC Register]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, approximately 6,000 middle school students were eligible for entry and 2,054 students completed and submitted the application.

== Overview ==
Each year, the top 10% of students from certain SSP-affiliated regional and state science fairs across the nation are eligible for entry in the Broadcom MASTERS competition. The first stage is an online application that consists of project information and other essays. The project described in the application must be the same as the one presented at the qualifying fair. On the basis of the online application, 300 semifinalists are selected and announced. The 30 finalists are selected from the pool of semifinalists; no additional information needs to be sent in between semifinalist and finalist stages. The 30 finalists are then invited for finalist week, to meet and compete with the other finalists in-person. From 2011 through 2014, finalist week has occurred in Washington DC. There is no pre-ranking prior to finalist week. Judging occurs over three days and consists of project judging as well as a variety of STEM challenges. The STEM challenges are done in teams, but judges weigh individual performance much more than combined team performance. There are six teams of five students each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://student.societyforscience.org/broadcom-masters-faq SSP Website FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Ransom Rogers''' (January 8, 1902 – February 4, 1987) was an American [[psychologist]] and among the founders of the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic approach]] (or client-centered approach) to [[psychology]]. Rogers is widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of psychotherapy research and was honored for his pioneering research with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in 1956.

The [[Person-centered therapy|person-centered approach]], his own unique approach to understanding personality and human relationships, found wide application in various domains such as psychotherapy and counseling ([[Person-centered psychotherapy|client-centered therapy]]), [[education]] ([[student-centered learning]]), organizations, and other group settings. For his professional work he was bestowed the Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology by the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] in 1972. In a study by Steven J. Haggbloom and colleagues using six criteria such as citations and recognition, Rogers was found to be the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century and second, among clinicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haggbloom|first=Steven J.|last2=Warnick|first2=Renee|last3=Warnick|first3=Jason E.|last4=Jones|first4=Vinessa K.|last5=Yarbrough|first5=Gary L.|last6=Russell|first6=Tenea M.|last7=Borecky|first7=Chris M.|last8=McGahhey|first8=Reagan|last9=Powell|first9=John L.|date=March 2003|title='The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century': Correction to Haggbloom et al (2002)|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.37|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=37–37|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haggbloom, S.J.|displayauthors=etal |year=2002 |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=[[Review of General Psychology]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139|url=http://creativity.ipras.ru/texts/top100.pdf }} Haggbloom et al. combined three quantitative variables: citations in professional journals, citations in textbooks, and nominations in a survey given to members of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], with three qualitative variables (converted to quantitative scores): [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) membership, [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) President and/or recipient of the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and surname used as an eponym. Then the list was rank ordered.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rogers was born on January 8, 1902, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago]]. His father, Walter A. Rogers, was a [[civil engineer]], a Congregationalist by denomination. His mother, Julia M. Cushing,&lt;ref name="Cushing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cushing|first=James Stevenson|title=The genealogy of the Cushing family, an account of the ancestors and descendants of Matthew Cushing, who came to America in 1638|publisher=The Perrault printing co.|location=Montreal|year=1905|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/06032460 |page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CalDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=CAdeath1940|title=California Death Index, 1940-1997|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=19 April 2010 |postscript=. Rogers' mother's maiden name is Cushing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a homemaker and devout Baptist. The Congregationalists and the Baptists tended to be Calvinistic and Fundamentalists at the time. Carl was the fourth of their six children.&lt;ref name="1910Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=1910USCenIndex&amp;indiv=try&amp;h=107466638|title=1910 United States Federal Census|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=19 April 2010|postscript=. Oak Park, Cook, Illinois; Roll T624_239; Page: 2B; Enumeration District: 70; Image: 703. Carl is fourth of six children of Walter A. and Julia M. Rogers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers was intelligent and could read well before kindergarten. Following an education in a strict religious and ethical environment as an [[altar boy]] at the [[vicarage]] of Jimpley, he became a rather isolated, independent and disciplined person, and acquired a knowledge and an appreciation for the [[scientific method]] in a practical world. His first career choice was [[agriculture]], at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where he was a part of the fraternity of Alpha Kappa Lambda, followed by history and then [[religion]]. At age 20, following his 1922 trip to [[Peking]], [[Republic of China|China]], for an international Christian conference, he started to doubt his religious convictions. To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled ''Why am I entering the Ministry?'', after which he decided to change his career. In 1924, he graduated from University of Wisconsin and enrolled at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)]]. He later became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin (2007). The Cambridge Companion to Atheism. Cambridge University Press. p. 310. {{ISBN|9780521842709}}. "Among celebrity atheists with much biographical data, we find leading psychologists and psychoanalysts. We could provide a long list, including...Carl R. Rogers..."&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years he left the [[seminary]] to attend [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], obtaining an MA in 1928 and a PhD in 1931. While completing his doctoral work, he engaged in child study. In 1930, Rogers served as director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, New York. From 1935 to 1940 he lectured at the [[University of Rochester]] and wrote ''The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child'' (1939), based on his experience in working with troubled children. He was strongly influenced in constructing his client-centered approach by the post-Freudian psychotherapeutic practice of [[Otto Rank]],&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Robert. "The Birth of Client-Centered Therapy : Carl Rogers, Otto Rank, and 'The Beyond'". ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'', 35.4 (1995) p. 54-110.&lt;/ref&gt; especially as embodied in the work of Rank's disciple, noted clinician and social work educator [[Jessie Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirschenbaum|first1=Howard|title=On Becoming Carl Rogers|publisher=Delacorte Press|isbn=0-440-06707-3|pages=92-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=deCarvalho|first1=Roy J.|title=Otto Rank, the Rankian Circle in Philadelphia, and the Origins of Carl Rogers' Person-Centered Psychotherapy|journal=History of Psychology|date=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=132-148|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.2.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1940 Rogers became professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State University, where he wrote his second book, ''Counseling and Psychotherapy'' (1942). In it, Rogers suggested that the client, by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting therapist, can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure their life.

In 1945, he was invited to set up a counseling center at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1947 he was elected President of the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/past-presidents.aspx Former APA Presidents]&lt;/ref&gt; While a professor of psychology at the [[University of Chicago]] (1945–57), Rogers helped to establish a counseling center connected with the university and there conducted studies to determine the effectiveness of his methods. His findings and theories appeared in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' (1951) and ''Psychotherapy and Personality Change'' (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], established the [[Parent Effectiveness Training|Parent Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.)]] movement. Another student, [[Eugene T. Gendlin]], who was getting his Ph.D. in philosophy, developed the practice of [[Focusing (psychotherapy)|Focusing]] based on Rogerian listening. In 1956, Rogers became the first President of the American Academy of Psychotherapists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapweb.com/history.html American Academy of Psychotherapists History of the Academy&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957–63), during which time he wrote one of his best-known books, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961). Carl Rogers and [[Abraham Maslow]] (1908–70) pioneered a movement called [[humanistic psychology]] which reached its peak in the 1960s. In 1961, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Rogers was also one of the people who questioned the rise of [[McCarthyism]] in 1950s. Through articles, he criticized society for its backward-looking affinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Demanchick |first1=S. |last2=Kirschenbaum |first2=H. |year=2008 |title=Carl Rogers and the CIA |journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=6–31 |doi=10.1177/0022167807303005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers continued teaching at University of Wisconsin until 1963, when he became a resident at the new [[Western Behavioral Sciences Institute]] (WBSI) in [[La Jolla|La Jolla, California]]. Rogers left the WBSI to help found the Center for Studies of the Person in 1968. His later books include ''Carl Rogers on Personal Power'' (1977) and ''Freedom to Learn for the 80's'' (1983). He remained a resident of La Jolla for the rest of his life, doing therapy, giving speeches and writing until his sudden death in 1987. In 1987, Rogers suffered a fall that resulted in a fractured [[human pelvis|pelvis]]: he had life alert and was able to contact paramedics. He had a successful operation, but his [[pancreas]] failed the next night and he died a few days later after a heart attack.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/06/obituaries/carl-r-rogers-85-leader-in-psychotherapy-dies.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers's last years were devoted to applying his theories in situations of political oppression and national social conflict, traveling worldwide to do so. In [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], he brought together influential Protestants and Catholics; in South Africa, blacks and whites; in Brazil people emerging from dictatorship to democracy; in the United States, consumers and providers in the health field. His last trip, at age 85, was to the Soviet Union, where he lectured and facilitated intensive experiential workshops fostering communication and creativity. He was astonished at the numbers of Russians who knew of his work.

Together with his daughter, Natalie Rogers, and psychologists Maria Bowen, Maureen O'Hara, and John K. Wood, between 1974 and 1984, Rogers convened a series of residential programs in the US, Europe, Brazil and Japan, the Person-Centered Approach Workshops, which focused on cross-cultural communications, personal growth, self-empowerment, and learning for social change.

==Theory==
{{Psychology sidebar}}
Rogers' theory of the self is considered to be [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[Existential psychology|existential]], and [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Pescitelli, [http://pandc.ca/?cat=carl_rogers&amp;page=rogerian_theory ''An Analysis of Carl Rogers' Theory of Personality'']&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is based directly on the "[[phenomenal field theory|phenomenal field]]" personality theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, Donald and Combs, Arthur W. (1949), ''Individual Behavior: A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' "Phenomenal Field" Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' elaboration of his own theory is extensive. He wrote 16 books and many more journal articles describing it. Prochaska and Norcross (2003) states Rogers "consistently stood for an empirical evaluation of psychotherapy. He and his followers have demonstrated a humanistic approach to conducting therapy and a scientific approach to evaluating therapy need not be incompatible."

===Nineteen propositions===
His theory (as of 1953) was based on 19 propositions:&lt;ref name="r53"&gt;{{cite book |title=Client-centered therapy: Its current practice, implications and theory.|first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1953 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84119-840-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# All individuals (organisms) exist in a continually changing world of experience (phenomenal field) of which they are the center.
# The organism reacts to the field as it is experienced and perceived. This perceptual field is "reality" for the individual.
# The organism reacts as an organized whole to this phenomenal field.
# A portion of the total perceptual field gradually becomes differentiated as the self.
# As a result of interaction with the environment, and particularly as a result of evaluational interaction with others, the structure of the self is formed—an organized, fluid but consistent conceptual pattern of perceptions of characteristics and relationships of the "I" or the "me", together with values attached to these concepts.
# The organism has one basic tendency and striving—to actualize, maintain and enhance the experiencing organism.
# The best vantage point for understanding behavior is from the internal frame of reference of the individual.
# Behavior is basically the goal-directed attempt of the organism to satisfy its needs as experienced, in the field as perceived.
# Emotion accompanies, and in general facilitates, such goal directed behavior, the kind of emotion being related to the perceived significance of the behavior for the maintenance and enhancement of the organism.
# The values attached to experiences, and the values that are a part of the self-structure, in some instances, are values experienced directly by the organism, and in some instances are values introjected or taken over from others, but perceived in distorted fashion, as if they had been experienced directly.
# As experiences occur in the life of the individual, they are either, a) symbolized, perceived and organized into some relation to the self, b) ignored because there is no perceived relationship to the self structure, c) denied symbolization or given distorted symbolization because the experience is inconsistent with the structure of the self.
# Most of the ways of behaving that are adopted by the organism are those that are consistent with the concept of self.
# In some instances, behavior may be brought about by organic experiences and needs which have not been symbolized. Such behavior may be inconsistent with the structure of the self but in such instances the behavior is not "owned" by the individual.
# Psychological adjustment exists when the concept of the self is such that all the sensory and visceral experiences of the organism are, or may be, assimilated on a symbolic level into a consistent relationship with the concept of self.
# Psychological maladjustment exists when the organism denies awareness of significant sensory and visceral experiences, which consequently are not symbolized and organized into the gestalt of the self structure. When this situation exists, there is a basic or potential psychological tension.
# Any experience which is inconsistent with the organization of the structure of the self may be perceived as a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself.
# Under certain conditions, involving primarily complete absence of threat to the self structure, experiences which are inconsistent with it may be perceived and examined, and the structure of self revised to assimilate and include such experiences.
# When the individual perceives and accepts into one consistent and integrated system all her sensory and visceral experiences, then she is necessarily more understanding of others and is more accepting of others as separate individuals.
# As the individual perceives and accepts into his self structure more of his organic experiences, he finds that he is replacing his present value system—based extensively on introjections which have been distortedly symbolized—with a continuing organismic valuing process.

In relation to No. 17, Rogers is known for practicing "[[unconditional positive regard]]", which is defined as accepting a person "without negative judgment of .... [a person's] basic worth".&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P. (2002). Mental Health and Mental Illness. (7th ed.) New York: Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the personality===
With regard to development, Rogers described principles rather than stages. The main issue is the development of a self-concept and the progress from an undifferentiated self to being fully differentiated.

{{quote|'''Self Concept''' ... the organized consistent conceptual gestalt composed of perceptions of the characteristics of 'I' or 'me' and the perceptions of the relationships of the 'I' or 'me' to others and to various aspects of life, together with the values attached to these perceptions. It is a gestalt which is available to awareness though not necessarily in awareness. It is a fluid and changing gestalt, a process, but at any given moment it is a specific entity. (Rogers, 1959)&lt;ref name="r59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Carl.|editor=(Ed.) S. Koch|title= Psychology: A study of a science. Vol. 3: Formulations of the person and the social context.|year=1959|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn= |pages= |chapter=A theory of therapy, personality relationships as developed in the client-centered framework.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the development of the self-concept, he saw conditional and unconditional positive regard as key. Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves. Those raised in an environment of conditional positive regard feel worthy only if they match conditions (what Rogers describes as ''conditions of worth'') that have been laid down for them by others.

===Fully functioning person===
Optimal development, as referred to in proposition 14, results in a certain process rather than static state. He describes this as ''the good life'', where the organism continually aims to fulfill its full potential. He listed the characteristics of a fully functioning person (Rogers 1961):&lt;ref name="r61"&gt;{{cite book |title=On becoming a person: A therapist's view of psychotherapy |first=Carl |last=Rogers |year=1961 |publisher=Constable |location=London |isbn=1-84529-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A growing openness to experience – they move away from defensiveness and have no need for subception (a perceptual defense that involves unconsciously applying strategies to prevent a troubling stimulus from entering consciousness).
# An increasingly existential lifestyle – living each moment fully – not distorting the moment to fit personality or self-concept but allowing personality and self-concept to emanate from the experience. This results in excitement, daring, adaptability, tolerance, spontaneity, and a lack of rigidity and suggests a foundation of trust. "To open one's spirit to what is going on now, and discover in that present process whatever structure it appears to have" (Rogers 1961)&lt;ref name="r61"/&gt;
# Increasing organismic trust – they trust their own judgment and their ability to choose behavior that is appropriate for each moment. They do not rely on existing codes and social norms but trust that as they are open to experiences they will be able to trust their own sense of right and wrong.
# Freedom of choice – not being shackled by the restrictions that influence an incongruent individual, they are able to make a wider range of choices more fluently. They believe that they play a role in determining their own behavior and so feel responsible for their own behavior.
# Creativity – it follows that they will feel more free to be creative. They will also be more creative in the way they adapt to their own circumstances without feeling a need to conform.
# Reliability and constructiveness – they can be trusted to act constructively. An individual who is open to all their needs will be able to maintain a balance between them. Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congruent individuals.
# A rich full life – he describes the life of the fully functioning individual as rich, full and exciting and suggests that they experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and courage more intensely. Rogers' description of ''the good life'':{{quote|This process of the good life is not, I am convinced, a life for the faint-hearted. It involves the stretching and growing of becoming more and more of one's potentialities. It involves the courage to be. It means launching oneself fully into the stream of life. (Rogers 1961)&lt;ref name="r61"/&gt;}}

===Incongruence===
Rogers identified the "[[real self]]" as the aspect of one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the "you" that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, to the extent that our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an "ideal self". By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the "I am" and the "I should" is called ''incongruity''.

===Psychopathology===
Rogers described the concepts of ''congruence'' and ''incongruence'' as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for ''positive regard''. In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside out.

Rogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat. They deploy ''defense mechanisms'' to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: ''distortion'' and ''denial''. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.

This defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself. And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self-concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self structure. If the incongruence is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic. Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable. If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruence of their situation. Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably.

===Person-centered therapy===
{{main|Person-centered therapy}}
Rogers originally developed his theory to be the foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called this "non-directive therapy" but later replaced the term "non-directive" with the term "client-centered" and then later used the term "person-centered". Even before the publication of ''Client-Centered Therapy'' in 1951, Rogers believed that the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts and not just in the therapy situation. As a result, he started to use the term ''person-centered approach'' later in his life to describe his overall theory. [[Person-centered therapy]] is the application of the person-centered approach to the therapy situation. Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, [[cross-cultural]] relations and other "helping" professions and situations. In 1946 Rogers co-authored "Counseling with Returned Servicemen" with John L. Wallen (the creator of the behavioral model known as ''[[The Interpersonal Gap]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. &amp; Wallen, J.L. (1946) Counseling with Returned Servicemen. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; documenting the application of person-centered approach to counseling military personnel returning from the second world war.

The first empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the client-centered approach was published in 1941 at the Ohio State University by [[Elias Porter]], using the recordings of therapeutic sessions between Carl Rogers and his clients.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, E.H. (1941) The development and evaluation of a measure of counseling interview procedure. Ph. D. Dissertation, Ohio State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter used Rogers' transcripts to devise a system to measure the degree of directiveness or non-directiveness a counselor employed.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschenbaum, Howard (1979). ''On Becoming Carl Rogers.'' pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude and orientation of the counselor were demonstrated to be instrumental in the decisions made by the client.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Porter|Porter, E.H.]] (1950) ''An Introduction to Therapeutic Counseling''. Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl. (1951). ''Client-Centered Therapy.'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learner-centered teaching===
The application to education has a large robust research tradition similar to that of therapy with studies having begun in the late 1930s and continuing today (Cornelius-White, 2007). Rogers described the approach to education in ''Client-Centered Therapy'' and wrote ''Freedom to Learn'' devoted exclusively to the subject in 1969. ''Freedom to Learn'' was revised two times. The new Learner-Centered Model is similar in many regards to this classical person-centered approach to education.
Rogers and Harold Lyon began a book prior to Rogers death, entitled ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher—Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon'', which was completed by Lyon and Reinhard Tausch and published in 2013 containing Rogers last unpublished writings on person-centered teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R, Lyon, Harold C., Tausch, Reinhard: (2013) On Becoming an Effective Teacher—Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers had the following five hypotheses regarding learner-centered education:&lt;references group="Rogers, Carl R, Lyon, Harold C., Tausch, Reinhard: (2013) On Becoming an Effective Teacher—Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon. London: Routledge:" /&gt;
# "A person cannot teach another person directly; a person can only facilitate another's learning" (Rogers, 1951). This is a result of his personality theory, which states that everyone exists in a constantly changing world of experience in which he or she is the center. Each person reacts and responds based on perception and experience. The belief is that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. The focus is on the student (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, the background and experiences of the learner are essential to how and what is learned. Each student will process what he or she learns differently depending on what he or she brings to the classroom.
# "A person learns significantly only those things that are perceived as being involved in the maintenance of or enhancement of the structure of self" (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, relevancy to the student is essential for learning. The students' experiences become the core of the course.
# "Experience which, if assimilated, would involve a change in the organization of self, tends to be resisted through denial or distortion of symbolism" (Rogers, 1951). If the content or presentation of a course is inconsistent with preconceived information, the student will learn if he or she is open to varying concepts. Being open to consider concepts that vary from one's own is vital to learning. Therefore, gently encouraging open-mindedness is helpful in engaging the student in learning. Also, it is important, for this reason, that new information be relevant and related to existing experience.
# "The structure and organization of self appears to become more rigid under threats and to relax its boundaries when completely free from threat" (Rogers, 1951). If students believe that concepts are being forced upon them, they might become uncomfortable and fearful. A barrier is created by a tone of threat in the classroom. Therefore, an open, friendly environment in which trust is developed is essential in the classroom. Fear of retribution for not agreeing with a concept should be eliminated. A classroom tone of support helps to alleviate fears and encourages students to have the courage to explore concepts and beliefs that vary from those they bring to the classroom. Also, new information might threaten the student's concept of him- or herself; therefore, the less vulnerable the student feels, the more likely he or she will be able to open up to the learning process.
# "The educational situation which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (a) threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum and (b) differentiated perception of the field is facilitated" (Rogers, 1951). The instructor should be open to learning from the students and also working to connect the students to the subject matter. Frequent interaction with the students will help achieve this goal. The instructor's acceptance of being a mentor who guides rather than the expert who tells is instrumental to student-centered, nonthreatening, and unforced learning.

===Rogerian rhetorical approach===
In 1970, Richard Young, [[Alton L. Becker]], and [[Kenneth Pike]] published ''Rhetoric: Discovery and Change'', a widely influential college writing textbook that used a [[Rogerian argument|Rogerian approach]] to communication to revise the traditional Aristotelian framework for rhetoric. The Rogerian method of argument involves each side restating the other's position to the satisfaction of the other. In a paper, it can be expressed by carefully acknowledging and understanding the opposition, rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl. ''Communication: Its Blocking and Its Facilitation''. [On Becoming a Person. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1961. 329-337.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-cultural relations===
The application to cross-cultural relations has involved workshops in highly stressful situations and global locations including conflicts and challenges in South Africa, Central America, and Ireland.&lt;ref name="StrasserRandolph2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Freddie Strasser|author2=Paul Randolph|title=Mediation: A Psychological Insight Into Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHiUxPcizvUC&amp;pg=PA13|date=30 December 2004|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-7503-9|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Alberto Zucconi and Charles Devonshire, he co-founded the Istituto dell'Approccio Centrato sulla Persona (Person-Centered Approach Institute) in Rome, Italy.

His international work for peace culminated in the Rust Peace Workshop which took place in November 1985 in [[Rust, Austria]]. Leaders from 17 nations convened to discuss the topic "The Central America Challenge". The meeting was notable for several reasons: it brought national figures together as people (not as their positions), it was a private event, and was an overwhelming positive experience where members heard one another and established real personal ties, as opposed to stiffly formal and regulated diplomatic meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Carl|title=The Carl Rogers Reader|year=1989|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CRnR87UQbMwC&amp;pg=PA457&amp;lpg=PA457&amp;dq=1985+the+rust+peace+workshop#v=onepage&amp;q=1985%20the%20rust%20peace%20workshop&amp;f=false|isbn=0395483573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Person-centered, dialogic politics ===
Some scholars believe there is a politics implicit in Rogers's approach to psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Thorne&gt;Thorne, Brian, with Sanders, Pete (2012). ''Carl Rogers''. SAGE Publications, 3rd ed., pp. 119–120. {{ISBN|978-1-4462-5223-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Proctor&gt;Proctor, Gillian; Cooper, Mick; Sanders, Pete; and Malcolm, Beryl, eds. (2006). ''Politicizing the Person-Centered Approach: An Agenda for Social Change''. PCCS Books. {{ISBN|978-1-898059-72-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his life, Rogers came to that view himself.&lt;ref&gt;Totton, Nick (2000). ''Psychotherapy and Politics''. SAGE Publications, p. 68. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-5849-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The central tenet of a Rogerian, person-centered politics is that public life does not have to consist of an endless series of winner-take-all battles among sworn opponents; rather, it can and should consist of an ongoing dialogue among all parties. Such dialogue would be characterized by respect among the parties, authentic speaking by each party, and – ultimately – empathic understanding among all parties. Out of such understanding, mutually acceptable solutions would (or at least could) flow.&lt;ref name=Thorne /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirschenbaum&gt;Kirschenbaum, Howard, and Henderson, Valerie Land. "A More Human World." In Kirschenbaum and Hendersion, eds. (1989). ''The Carl Rogers Reader''. Houghton Mifflin Company, pp. 433–435. {{ISBN|978-0-395-48357-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his last decade, Rogers facilitated or participated in a wide variety of dialogic activities among politicians, activists, and other social leaders, often outside the U.S.&lt;ref name=Kirschenbaum /&gt; In addition, he lent his support to several non-traditional U.S. political initiatives, including the "12-Hour Political Party" of the [[Association for Humanistic Psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;Multiple authors (May 1980).

(2000). ''Collaborative Approaches to Resolving Conflict''. SAGE Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-1930-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists of a specifically Rogerian, person-centered approach to politics as dialogue have made substantial contributions to that project.&lt;ref name=Proctor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, Gillian, and Napier, Mary Beth, eds.

==Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)==
{{More footnotes|section|date=October 2017}}
Carl Rogers served on the board of the Human Ecology Fund from the late 50s into the 60s, which was a [[CIA]]-funded organization that provided grants to researchers looking into personality. In addition, he and other people in the field of personality and psychotherapy were given a lot of information about [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]. 'We were asked to figure out what we thought of him and what would be the best way of dealing with him. And that seemed to be an entirely principled and legitimate aspect.

'''Compulsory education''' refers to a period of education that is required of all people and is imposed by government. Depending on the country, this education may take place at a registered school ([[schooling]]) or at home ([[homeschooling]]). "Compulsory education differs from compulsory attendance, which means that parents are obliged to send their children to a certain school. Compulsory education involves both the duty imposed upon parents by law to see that their children receive instruction, and the prerogative of every child to be educated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1875|title=Compulsory Education|url=|journal=New England Journal of Education|volume=1|pages=52|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] requires, within a reasonable number of years, the principle of compulsory education [[free education|free of charge]] for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to free education|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], Article 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of compulsory education ==
In old times, compulsory education was to master physical skills which are necessary and can be contributed to the nation. And it instilled values of ethics and social communications abilities into teenagers's minds. Plus, it would allow immigrants to fit in the unacquainted society of a new country. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niece|first=Richard|date=1983|title=Compulsory Education: Milestone or Millstone?|url=|journal=The High School Journal|volume=67|pages=33|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, compulsory education has been considered as rights for every citizens in many countries. It is mostly used to advance the educated quality of all the citizens, minimize the students who stop going to school because of family economic reasons, and also, balance the education differences between rural and urban areas.

The compulsory education in each country depends on what the politic system the country has and how well is the education system developed in the country. On the other hand, in the republic countries, being educated is necessary and important for every citizen, and there are strict laws about compulsory education (Camp 181).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Camp|first=David N|date=1871|title=Compulsory Education|url=|journal=The Connecticut School Journal|volume=1|pages=181-184|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of compulsory education==

===[[Ancient history|Antiquity]]===

Compulsory education was not unheard of in ancient times. However instances are generally tied to royal, religious or military organization—substantially different from modern notions of compulsory education.

====Hellenic====

[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (c. 424–c. 348 BCE) is credited with having popularized the concept of compulsory education in Western intellectual thought. Plato's rationale was straightforward. The ideal city would require ideal individuals, and ideal individuals would require an ideal education. 
The popularization of Plato's ideas began with the wider [[Renaissance]] and the translation of Plato's works by [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499), culminating in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], known for his own work on education (including [[Emile, or On Education]]), said, 'To get a good idea of public education, read Plato’s Republic. It is not a political treatise, as those who merely judge books by their title think, but it is the finest, most beautiful work on education ever written.'&lt;ref&gt;http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sparta]] boys between the age 6 and 7 left their homes and were sent to military school. School courses were harsh and have been described as a "brutal training period". Between the age of 18 and 20, Spartan males had to pass a test that consisted of fitness, military ability, and leadership skills. A student's failure meant a forfeiture of citizenship (perioidos) and political rights. Passing was a rite of passage to manhood and citizenry, in which he would continue to serve in the military and train as a soldier until the age of 60 when the soldier could retire to live with his family.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia: [[Agoge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judea====

Every parent in [[Judea]] since ancient times [[Jewish education#History|was required]] to teach their children at least informally. Over the centuries, as cities, towns and villages developed, a class of teachers called Rabbis evolved. According to the [[Talmud]] (tractate [[Bava Bathra]] 21a), which praises the sage [[Joshua ben Gamla]] with the institution of formal Jewish education in the 1st century AD, Ben Gamla instituted schools in every town and made formal education compulsory from age 6-8.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia: [[Jewish education#Primary schooling]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Middle Ages|Medieval Era]]===

The [[Aztec Triple Alliance]], which ruled from 1428 to 1521 in what is now central [[Mexico]], is considered to be the first state to implement a system of universal compulsory education.&lt;ref name="Soustelle2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Soustelle|title=Daily life of the Aztecs: on the eve of the Spanish Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMrNE7uq-tMC|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=11 November 2002|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-42485-9|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia: [[Aztec#Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Early modern period|Early Modern Era]]===

The [[Protestant Reformation]] prompted the establishment of compulsory education for boys and girls, first in regions that are now part of [[Germany]], and later in [[Europe]] and in the [[United States of America|United States]].

[[Martin Luther]]'s seminal text ''An die Ratsherren aller Städte deutschen Landes'' (To the Councillors of all Towns in German Countries,1524) called for establishing compulsory schooling so that all parishioners would be able to read the [[Bible]] by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=LmOsRpe0nC0C |page=70 |title=Luther deutsch }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant South-West of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] soon followed suit. In 1559, the German Duchy [[Württemberg]] established a compulsory education system for boys.&lt;ref&gt;"Große Kirchenordnung", 1559, Oliver Geister, Die Ordnung der Schule. Zur Grundlegung einer Kritik am verwalteten Unterricht. Münster 2006, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1592, the German Duchy [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]] became the first territory in the world with compulsory education for girls and boys,&lt;ref&gt;Emil Sehling (ed.), Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des 16. Jahrhunderts. Vol 18: Rheinland-Pfalz I. Tübingen 2006, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1598 by [[Strasbourg]], then a free city of the Holy Roman Empire and now part of [[France]].

In [[Scotland]], the [[School Establishment Act 1616|School Establishment Act of 1616]] commanded every parish to establish a school for everyone paid for by parishioners. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] confirmed this with the [[Education Act 1633|Education Act of 1633]] and created a local land-based tax to provide the required funding. The required majority support of parishioners, however, provided a [[tax avoidance|tax evasion loophole]] which heralded the [[Education Act 1646|Education Act of 1646]]. The turmoil of the age meant that in 1661 there was a temporary reversion to the less compulsory 1633 position. However, in 1696 a new [[Education Act 1696|Act]] re-established the compulsory provision of a school in every parish with a system of fines, sequestration, and direct government implementation as a means of enforcement where required.

In the United States, following Luther and other Reformers, the [[Separatists|Separatist]] [[Congregationalists]] who founded [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620, obliged parents to teach their children how to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;John Demos (1970), ''A Little Commonwealth: Family Life in Plymouth Colony.'' Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y., pp. 104, 142-144&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Massachusetts School Laws]], three legislative acts enacted in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1642, 1647, and 1648, are commonly regarded as the first steps toward compulsory education in the United States. The 1647 law, in particular, required every town having more than 50 families to hire a teacher, and every town of more than 100 families to establish a school.&lt;ref&gt;See references in articles [[Massachusetts School Laws]] and [[Massachusetts#Education]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Puritan zeal for learning was reflected in the early and rapid rise of educational institutions; e.g., [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] was founded as early as 1636.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prussia]] implemented a modern compulsory [[Prussian education system|education system]] in 1763. It was introduced by the Generallandschulreglement (General School Regulation), a decree of [[Frederick the Great]] in 1763-5.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxiv"/&gt; The Generallandschulreglement, authored by [[Johann Julius Hecker]], asked for all young citizens, girls and boys, to be educated from age 5 to age 13-14 and to be provided with a basic outlook on (Christian) religion, singing, reading and writing based on a regulated, state-provided curriculum of text books. The teachers, often former soldiers, were asked to cultivate silk worms to make a living besides contributions from the local citizens and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/250-jahre-volksschule-in-preussen-lesen-schreiben-und-beten/8624112.html 250 Jahre Volksschule in Preußen, Lesen, Schreiben und Beten] (250 years of primary education in Prussia) 12.08.2013 Tagesspiegel Berlin, Barbara Kerbel, in German&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funding and training of the teachers was slowly expanded and received funding till teachers gained full academic status in the 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Education in Austria|Austria]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (Czech lands), mandatory primary education was introduced by Empress [[Maria Theresa]] in 1774.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxiv"&gt;James van Horn Melton. "Absolutism and the Eighteenth-Century Origins of Compulsory Schooling in Prussia and Austria". p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Modern history#Late modern period 2|Late Modern Era]]===

====Europe====

Compulsory school attendance based on the Prussian model gradually spread to other countries. It was quickly adopted by the governments in [[Denmark-Norway]] and [[Sweden]], and also in [[Finland]], [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] within the [[Russian Empire]], but it was rejected in Russia itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cubberley, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =says&gt;{{cite journal |first=Yasemin Nuhoglu |last=Soysal |first2=David |last2=Strang |title=Construction of the First Mass Education Systems in Nineteenth-Century Europe |journal=Sociology of Education |year=1989 |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=277–288 |jstor=2112831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
The [[United Kingdom]] was slow to introduce compulsory education due to the upper class defending its educational privileges.&lt;ref name=says /&gt; In [[England and Wales]], the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] paved the way for compulsory education by establishing [[school boards]] to set up schools in any places that did not have adequate provision. Attendance was made compulsory until age 10 in 1880. [[History of education in England#Education Act 1996|The Education Act of 1996]] made it an obligation on parents to require children to have a full-time education from age 5 to 16. However, attendance at school itself is not compulsory: Section 7 of the Act allows for [[Home education in the United Kingdom|home education]].

==== France ====
[[France]] was equally slow to introduce compulsory education, this time due to conflicts between the secular state and the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="says" /&gt; and as a result between anti-clerical and Catholic political parties. The first set of [[Jules Ferry Laws]], passed in 1881, made primary education free for girls and boys; communes and departments had the shared responsibility to fund it. In 1882, the second set of Jules Ferry Laws made education compulsory for girls and boys until the age of 13. In 1936, the upper age limit was raised to 14.&lt;ref&gt;Law of August 9, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, it was further extended to 16.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ordonnance]] of January 6, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
Germany's compulsory education is supported by the states of Germany. It started in 1619 and improved in the 17th century. It had a huge effect in the country and among a larger number of people than in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neufeld|first=John|date=October 1963|title=Compulsory Education in Germany|url=|journal=ALA Bulletin|volume=57|pages=805|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

In 1852, [[Massachusetts]] was the first U.S. state to pass a contemporary universal public education law. In particular, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] required every town to create and operate a grammar school. Fines were imposed on parents who did not send their children to school, and the government took the power to take children away from their parents and apprentice them to others if government officials decided that the parents were "unfit to have the children educated properly".&lt;ref name="rothbard1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothbard |first=Murray Rothbard |title=Conceived in Liberty |chapter=The Puritans 'Purify': Theocracy in Massachusetts |publisher=Arlington House Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of compulsory attendance in the Massachusetts tradition throughout the U.S., especially for Native Americans, has been credited to General [[Richard Henry Pratt]].&lt;ref name="Witte-Mero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |author=Witte, Daniel E. and [[Paul Mero|Paul T. Mero]] |title=Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5noKmGSvh?url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt used techniques developed on Native Americans in a prisoner of war camp in Fort Marion, Augustine, Florida, to force demographic minorities across America into government schools.&lt;ref name="Witte-Mero" /&gt; His prototype was the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in Pennsylvania.

In 1918, [[Mississippi]] was the last state to enact a compulsory attendance law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Michael S.|title=A History of Compulsory Education Laws|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED119389.pdf|website=ERIC - Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=ERIC|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 an attempt was made by the voters of Oregon to enact the [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]], which would require all children between the ages of 8 and 16 to attend [[State School]], only leaving exceptions for mentally or physically unfit children, exceeding a certain living distance from a state school, or having written consent from a county superintendent to receive private instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jorgenson|first1=Lloyd P.|title=The Oregon School Law of 1922: Passage and Sequel|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|page=455|jstor=25018244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was passed by popular vote but was later ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]], determining that "a child is not a mere creature of the state". This case settled the dispute about whether or not private schools had the right to do business and educate within the United States.

====Japan====

In [[Japan]], compulsory education was established shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868. Initially, it was strongly influenced by the Prussian education system. After World War II, it was rebuilt to a large extent, and the new education model is largely influenced by the American model.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia article [[Education in Japan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian kingdom of [[Travancore]], Queen [[Gowri Parvati Bayi]] issued a royal rescript declaring universal education and formally recognized the role of State  ensure the right of education from public revenue in 1817.

==== China ====
China’s nine-year compulsory education was established and considered successful. The compulsory education brings huge effects of different aspects of people’s lives. The amount of students became larger and the drop-out rates of students decreased in huge percent, even in the rural area. The purpose of the establishment of compulsory education in China is about “universalization”, which balances the educated differences between the towns and villages (Ding 13). On the other hand, it efficiently improves the quality of the facilities in schools because of the safety guarantee. However, nine-year compulsory education still has problems and needs to be improved. Most of the drop-out students quit schools because of the unwillingness of studies and bad education, instead of not being able to afford the tuition. Therefore, the improvements of Chinese compulsory education are still necessary in the modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Problems with Access to Compulsory Education in China and the Effects of the Policy of Direct Subsidies to Students|last=Ding|first=Yanqing|publisher=Chinese Education &amp; Society vol.45, no.1|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Per-country variations in the age range of compulsory education==

The following table indicates at what ages compulsory education starts and ends, country by country. The most common age for starting compulsory education is 6, although this varies between 3 and 8.&lt;ref name="webgate.ec.europa.eu"&gt;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/images/2/24/Compulsory_Education_in_Europe_2016_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d08/tables/dt08_165.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number of pupils and students enrolled in compulsory education==

Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, [[UNESCO]] calculated in 2006 that over the subsequent 30 years, more people would receive formal education than in all prior human history.&lt;ref name="Robinson, K."&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity'']. TED Talks, 2006, Monterey, CA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compulsory Education for disabled ==
Since disabled people may need more time to study than normal people due to their disabilities, they are required to go to special schools. The purpose of disabled to go to school is that they will be able to receive more taught education instead of knowledges that are wrongly understood by themselves. Also, someone stated that since there are parents who want their disabled kids to go to work or be spoiled at home instead of going to school, compulsory education can solve the issues from family, which the prohibition of disabled from going to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PYBAS|first=ADELAIDE H.|date=September 1909|title=COMPULSORY EDUCATION FOR THE DEAF|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44463867|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|volume=54|pages=356-360|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

{{Main|Anti-schooling_activism|l1=Anti-Schooling Activism}}
Critics of compulsory education argue that education violates the [[Children's rights|freedom of children]], is a method of political control, is ineffective at teaching children how to deal with the real world, and has extremely negative effects on children leading to higher rates of [[apathy]], [[bullying]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2018}}

People have argued that compulsory education has shown its benefits by making certain societies more profitable. People are able to get educated and be employed in companies. However, some people disagree that the main issue it is whether students need to be forced by using the laws and whether schools need to take full responsibility to the students during the period of compulsory education. In the suggestions given by Katz (1971) to the reformers who change the school system, there is one about ending the compulsory education radically. It reflected the discussion about the mandatory level of compulsory education. So the pressure compulsory education has to face is to educate students in order to establish them in the society in future. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creager|first=Joan G.|date=1977|title=Why Compulsory Education?|url=|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=39|pages=336-362|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Class, bureaucracy, and schools|last=KATZ|first=M.B.|publisher=New York: Praeger Publishers|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curriculum mapping''' is a procedure for reviewing the operational [[curriculum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Linda |last=Starr |date=29 May 2006 |title=Virtual Workshop: Curriculum Mapping |url=http://www.education-world.com/a_curr/virtualwkshp/virtualwkshp004.shtml |publisher=Education World |accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is entered into an electronic [[database]] at any [[education]] setting.  It is based largely on the work of [[Heidi Hayes Jacobs]] in ''Mapping the Big Picture: Integrating Curriculum and Assessment K-12'' ([[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|ASCD]], 1997) and ''Getting Results with Curriculum Mapping'' (2004, ASCD).  Schools are using curriculum templates that display key components of the curriculum: content, skills, [[Educational assessment|assessments]], and essential questions.

Some states such as South Dakota have adopted curriculum mapping on a statewide basis and provide detailed online curriculum mapping resources for their professional staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation|title=South Dakota Department of Education Office of Curriculum, Technology, &amp; Assessment |url=http://shop.ascd.org/productdisplay.cfm?productid=197135 |accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states such as Indiana have mandated curriculum mapping as a tool for schools which do not meet [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] and also provide numerous online tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |title=Indiana Department of Education: Resources for Districts in Improvement and Corrective Action |url=http://www.doe.in.gov/TitleI/leaimprovement/improvement_corrective_action.html |accessdate=6 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602145908/http://www.doe.in.gov/TitleI/leaimprovement/improvement_corrective_action.html |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to the approach is that each teacher enters what is actually taught in real-time during the school year, in contrast to having an outside or separate committee determine decisions.  The entries by teachers are not left alone, however; in fact, because the work is displayed via internet-based programs, it is open to view by all personnel in a school or district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Valerie |last=Truesdale |author2=Claire Thompson |author3=Michael Lucas |chapter=Use of Curriculum Mapping to Build a Learning Community |chapterurl=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/104011/chapters/Use_of_Curriculum_Mapping_to_Build_a_Learning_Community.aspx |editor=[[Heidi Hayes Jacobs]] |title=Getting results with curriculum mapping |publisher=[[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |location=[[Alexandria, Virginia]] |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-87120-999-3 |oclc=55960819 |accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows educators to view both K-12 and across grade levels and subjects what is transpiring in order to be informed and to revise their work.

The curriculum mapping model as originally defined by Dr. Jacobs has seven specific steps&lt;ref name="shop.ascd"&gt;{{cite book |first=Heidi Hayes |last=Jacobs |authorlink=Heidi Hayes Jaoobs |title=Mapping the Big Picture: Integrating Curriculum and Assessment K-12 (ASCD,1997) |url=http://shop.ascd.org/productdisplay.cfm?productid=197135}}&lt;/ref&gt; that schools use to thoroughly examine and then revise their curriculum.  There are both commercial companies and [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit groups]] that have generated curriculum mapping [[software]] used around the world.  Related to mapping, but separate from it, is the concept of a curriculum audit, described by [[Fenwick W. English]].  in "Deciding What to Teach and Test: Developing, Auditing, and Aligning the Curriculum" (1999, Sage).

Curriculum mapping is not limited to [[United States]] [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Heidi Hayes |authorlink=Heidi Hayes Jacobs |title=The Teacher as Designer: Integrating the Curriculum |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ575272&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ575272 |publisher=[[European Council of International Schools]] |journal=International Schools Journal |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=November 1998 |pages=22–33 |oclc=93367190 |issn=0264-7281}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of independent schools have adopted the curriculum mapping process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Heidi Hayes |authorlink=Heidi Hayes Jacobs |title='Connections, Mapping, and Structures for Learning' Interview with Dr. Heidi Hayes Jacobs |publisher=[[National Association of Independent Schools]] |journal=Independent School Magazine |date=Spring 1998 |volume=57 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to review and revise their curriculum.  The bulk of schools using curriculum mapping outside the US tend to be independent schools that follow an international curriculum (such as [[IB Diploma Programme|IB]], [[Alternative Education Resource Organization|AERO]], or [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]]) or public schools located in Anglo-Saxon countries.

== Consensus Maps ==
A development of a consensus map (also called an essential map, core map, district map, or master map) takes places in Phase 3 of Heidi Hayes Jacobs’s Four Phases of Curriculum Mapping. Hale (2008) distinguishes between consensus maps and essential maps, assigning the former to the building level, and the latter to the district level (p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Guide to Curriculum Mapping|last = Hale|first = J. A.|publisher = Corwin Press|year = 2008|isbn =|location = Thousand Oaks, CA|pages = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs (2004) defines a consensus map as one that “reflects the policy agreed on by a professional staff that targets those specific areas in each discipline that are to be addressed with consistency and flexibility in a school or district” (para. 4; Jacobs &amp; Johnson, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;65).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Curriculum Mapping Planner: Templates, Tools, and  Resources for Effective Professional Development|last = Jacobs &amp; Johnson|first = Heidi &amp; Ann|publisher = ASCD|year = 2009|isbn =|location = Alexandria, VA|pages = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an opportunity, by thoughtful reflection, for teachers to have a common ground for communication about their curriculum while also maintaining the necessary flexibility to do what is right for each child. Hale (2008) adds that a consensus map functions as a communication tool to convey to stakeholders the students’ learning expectations (p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ideally, it comes later in the curriculum mapping process - after horizontal and vertical data examination and after interdisciplinary or mixed-group review (Jacobs, 2004, para. 13). According to Jacobs and Johnson (2009) mixed group reviews “add a unique perspective to the process and are sometimes able to see things that other teachers do not” (p.&amp;nbsp;58).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, a social studies teacher might be able to observe that students are taught the Holocaust in 9th grade social studies and again in 10th grade English. An effective map would seek to marry the two instructional units, eliminating redundancies and providing a cross-disciplinary approach to instruction. By this time, professionals are working on “multiple levels and tiers” (Jacobs, n.d.), reviewing the maps for “possible gaps, repetitions, or omissions” (Jacobs &amp; Johnson, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;57).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This takes time and, as with all curriculum mapping, cannot be rushed and the big picture must be taken into account. Phase 3 in the Mapping Process is critical because “ if we don't have consensus on where we want to go, we will never get there” (Jacobs, n.d.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://c3ta.org/kb_files/Ch7-Consensus.php|title = Consensus Maps {{!}} C3|website = c3ta.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus map might include what they district staff have targeted as the “nonnegotiables that will be taught in each grade level or subject in a school or district” and should represent “best practices, 21st century curriculum, higher order thinking, high standards, and clearly defined grade- or course-level expectations” (Jacobs &amp; Johnson, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;65). According to Hale (2008), its elements are “compulsory and are designed according to national, state, [or] district… standard[s]” (p.&amp;nbsp;146).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They may include content and skills, essential questions, and required assessments.

== Individual curriculum maps ==
Individual curriculum maps are “developed by individual teachers [and] reflect what they teach in their class or classes. They include essential questions, content, skills, and assessments”  (Jacobs &amp; Johnson, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;115).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More detailed than the consensus map, “allow for individual teacher autonomy” (Hale, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;146).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In a small school “with only one section of a course or subject, the individual map becomes the consensus map” (Jacobs &amp; Johnson, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;65).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These maps showcase what takes place in an individual classroom, ideally providing evidence of the students’ learning with that teacher. For example, in a Unit applying [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|ELA Standard RL11-12.5]], students are expected to learn to “[a]nalyze how an author's choices concerning how to structure specific parts of a text (e.g., the choice of where to begin or end a story, the choice to provide a comedic or tragic resolution) contribute to its overall structure and meaning as well as its aesthetic impact.” While a teacher may choose to teach this standard using The Crucible by Arthur Miller, theoretically, another teacher may use a series of short stories, or perhaps even a novel. While the standard is the same and would be represented on the consensus map (as would the common assessments), the individual map would show the different content being employed in the classroom, along with the activities and skill work that might be specific to the piece of literature under study.  Jacobs &amp; Johnson (2009) suggest that “[i]deally, a school or district is able to focus on individual maps first, and then map the taught curriculum,” though they do acknowledge that some schools do the reverse, often under external influences that can rush the process (p.&amp;nbsp;67).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Both consensus and individual maps might show the essential questions for units of study and content learned, but individual maps will be more detailed in regards to the daily activities, strategies, and assignments that introduce, practice, and inspire mastery of the skills and standards indicated on the consensus map, the latter of which will also eventually mandate the common or same assessments that should take place across the board in individual classrooms. By the daily trial and error that is inherent in an individual map, resources might be suggested to the consensus map.

There are online programs that offer insight to curriculum mapping throughout the year. Take [http://www.oncoursesystems.com/products/detail/curriculumbuilder OnCourse Systems for Education's Curriculum Builder] tool, when used in tandem with the Lesson Planner it can create a report that will show you all standards that have been aligned to units and what standards still need to be addressed.

The Erasmus Programme, together with a number of other independent programmes, was incorporated into the [[Socrates programme]] established by the European Commission in 1994. The Socrates programme ended on 31 December 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme on 24 January 2000, which in turn was replaced by the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] on 1 January 2007.

==History==
[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

===Origins of the name===
The programme is named after the Dutch philosopher, theologian, [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist]], [[monk]], and devout [[Roman Catholic]], [[Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam]], called "the crowning glory of the Christian humanists".&lt;ref name="ERASMUS-ProgHist"/&gt; Erasmus, along with his good friend [[Thomas More]], became the center of European intellectual life during the Renaissance. Known for his satire, Erasmus urged internal reform of the Catholic Church. He encouraged a recovery of the Catholic [[Patristic]] tradition against contemporary abuses of the [[Sacraments]] and certain excessive devotional practices. He famously clashed with Protestant revolutionary [[Martin Luther]] on the subject of free will. ERASMUS is a [[backronym]] meaning '''''E'''u'''R'''opean community '''A'''ction '''S'''cheme for the '''M'''obility of '''U'''niversity '''S'''tudents''.&lt;ref name="ERASMUS-ProgHist"/&gt;

===1987 European Commission proposal===
By the time the Erasmus Programme was adopted in June 1987, the [[European Commission]] had been supporting pilot student exchanges for 6 years. It proposed the original Erasmus Programme in early 1986, but reaction from the then Member States varied: those with substantial exchange programmes of their own (essentially France, Germany and the United Kingdom) were broadly hostile; the remaining countries were broadly in favour. Exchanges between the [[Member States]] and the [[European Commission]] deteriorated, and the latter withdrew the proposal in early 1987 to protest against the inadequacy of the triennial budget proposed by some Member States.&lt;ref name="ERASMUS-ProgHist"/&gt;

===European Court of Justice decision===
This method of voting was not accepted by some of the opposing Member States, who challenged the adoption of the decision before the [[European Court of Justice]]. Although the Court held that the adoption was procedurally flawed, it maintained the substance of the decision; a further decision, adapted in the light of the jurisprudence, was rapidly adopted by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]].

===Adoption and growth===
The programme built on the 1981–1986 pilot student exchanges, and although it was formally adopted only shortly before the beginning of the academic year 1987-1988, it was still possible for 3,244 students to participate in Erasmus in its first year. In 2006, over 150,000 students, or almost 1% of the European student population, took part. The proportion is higher among university teachers, where Erasmus teacher mobility is 1.9% of the teacher population in Europe, or 20,877 people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the past twenty years, over two million students&lt;ref name="Survey of the Socio-Economic Background of Erasmus Students - DG EAC 01/05"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/erasmus/doc920_en.htm Ec.europa.eu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211164532/http://ec.europa.eu/education/erasmus/doc920_en.htm |date=11 December 2008 }}, Table: Erasmus student mobility (number of outgoing students): 1987/88-2006/07&lt;/ref&gt; have benefited from Erasmus grants, and the European Commission aims to reach a total of 3&amp;nbsp;million by 2012.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013===
The [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] replaced the Socrates programme as the overall umbrella under which the Erasmus (and other) programmes operate from 2007.

===Erasmus Mundus===
{{Main|Erasmus Mundus}}
The [[Erasmus Mundus]] programme is another, parallel programme that is oriented towards globalising European education. Whereas the Erasmus Programme is open to Europeans, Erasmus Mundus is open to non-Europeans with Europeans being exceptional cases.

Its goal was to increase the budget for EU exchange programmes like Erasmus or the [[European Voluntary Service]] from 2014. To be successful it would have needed 1 million signatures by 1 November 2013. It ultimately collected only 71,057 signatures from citizens across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Citizens Initiatives – one year of challenges |author=Simona Pronckutė |url=http://www.europeanpublicaffairs.eu/european-citizens-initiatives-one-year-of-challenges/ |publisher=EuropeanPublicAffairs.eu |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=20 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518054159/http://www.europeanpublicaffairs.eu/european-citizens-initiatives-one-year-of-challenges/ |archivedate=18 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erasmus+ 2014–2020===

'''Erasmus+''' [...] provides grants for a wide range of actions including the opportunity for students to undertake work placements abroad and for teachers and education staff to attend training courses.

Erasmus+ key action 1 provides a unique opportunity for teachers, headmasters, trainers and other staff of education institutions to participate in international training courses in different European countries.

The staff home institution shall apply to receive the grant to send its staff members abroad for training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erasmustrainingcourses.com/teacher-training-courses-erasmus-plus-funding.html|title=Erasmus Plus Funding for Teacher Training Courses {{!}} Erasmus+ KA1|website=TEACHER TRAINING|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022931/http://www.erasmustrainingcourses.com/teacher-training-courses-erasmus-plus-funding.html|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erasmus+ also conducts projects in Central Asia's Kazakhstan. The programme funded 40 projects involving 47 universities in Kazakhstan.

Studies have discussed issues related to the selection into the programme and the representativeness of the participants. Some studies have raised doubts about the inclusiveness of the programme, by socio-economic background, level of study, or academic performance. Thus, one study analyses the financial issues and family background of Erasmus students, showing that despite the fact that access to the programme has been moderately widened, there are still important socio-economic barriers to participation in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otero|first=Manuel Souto|date=2008-02-12|title=The Socio-Economic Background of Erasmus Students: A Trend Towards Wider Inclusion?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-007-9081-9|journal=International Review of Education|language=en|volume=54|issue=2|pages=135–154|doi=10.1007/s11159-007-9081-9|issn=0020-8566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study uncovered what seems to be an adverse self-selection of Erasmus students based on their prior academic performance, with higher-performing students less likely to participate than lower-performing ones. However, this case was based on a number of four hundred graduates in a Spanish university only. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varela|first=Diego|date=2016-05-05|title=Grade uncertainty and the adverse selection of Erasmus students: a Spanish experience|url=http://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/view/697|journal=Journal of Contemporary European Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|issn=1815-347X|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529154708/http://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/view/697|archivedate=29 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inversely, one study looking in details at French and Italian students found that the primary predictor of participation to Erasmus was students' prior academic records, not the occupation of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Pietro|first=Giorgio|date=2008-08-20|title=Who Studies Abroad?

===Requirements===
The Erasmus Programme had previously been restricted to applicants who had completed at least one year of tertiary-level study, but it is now also available to secondary school students.

===Details===
Students who join the Erasmus Programme study at least 3 months or do an internship for a period of at least 2 months to an academic year in another European country. The Erasmus Programme guarantees that the period spent abroad is recognised by their university when they come back, as long as they abide by terms previously agreed. Switzerland has been suspended as a participant in the Erasmus programme as of 2015, following [[Federal popular initiative "Against mass immigration"|the popular vote]] to limit the immigration of EU citizens into Switzerland.  As a consequence, Swiss students will not be able to apply for the programme and European students will not be able to spend time at a Swiss university under that programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzettadelsud.it/news/english/81542/Swiss-students-out-of-Erasmus-program-starting-in-2015.html|title=Swiss students out of Erasmus program starting in 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403141442/http://www.gazzettadelsud.it/news/english/81542/Swiss-students-out-of-Erasmus-program-starting-in-2015.html|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main part of the programme is that students do not pay extra tuition fees to the university that they visit. Students can also apply for an Erasmus grant to help cover the additional expense of living abroad. Students with disabilities can apply for an additional grant to cover extraordinary expenses.

In order to reduce expenses and increase mobility, many students also use the European Commission-supported accommodation network, CasaSwap, FlatClub, Erasmusinn, [[Eurasmus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasmus.com|title=Student rooms and accommodation, internships and erasmus guides.|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105190410/http://eurasmus.com/|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmate or Student Mundial, which are free websites where students and young people can rent, sublet, offer and swap accommodation – on a national and international basis. A derived benefit is that students can share knowledge and exchange tips and hints with each other before and after going abroad.

==The "Erasmus experience"==

=== Cultural phenomenon ===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Aubergeespagnole.jpg|thumb|150px|Films such as [[L'Auberge espagnole]] shed light on the Erasmus cultural phenomenon]] --&gt;

For many European students, the Erasmus Programme is their first time living and studying in another country. Hence, it has become a cultural phenomenon and is very popular among European students, going on to become the subject of movies such as the French film ''[[L'Auberge espagnole]]'', and the documentary ''[[Erasmus 24 7]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Erasmus 24_7 Official Website  |url = http://erasmus247.com  |deadurl = no  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140504010217/http://erasmus247.com/  |archivedate = 4 May 2014  |df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme fosters learning and understanding of the host country. The Erasmus experience is considered both a time for learning as well as a chance to socialise.

Tutors are often keen for students of subjects such as Politics or [[International Relations]] to participate in Erasmus. It is seen as a great opportunity to study abroad while not having the expense of studying outside the [[European Union]], since the grants available to Erasmus students are not available to those opting to leave the continent to study.

Some academics have speculated that former Erasmus students will prove to be a powerful force in creating a [[pan-European identity]]. The political scientist [[Stefan Wolff]], for example, has argued that "Give it 15, 20 or 25 years, and Europe will be run by leaders with a completely different socialisation from those of today", referring to the so-called 'Erasmus generation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katrin |last=Bennhold |authorlink= |author2= |title=Quietly sprouting: A European identity |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/04/26/news/enlarge2.php |work=International Herald Tribune |publisher= |date=26 April 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031182243/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/04/26/news/enlarge2.php |archivedate=31 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

=== Film ===
Most of the characters in the movie [[L'Auberge Espagnole]] are enrolled in the Erasmus programme and the programme plays a central role in the plot.

=== Books ===
Pakistani novelist [[Nimra Ahmed]]'s novel "Jannat K Patte" (Leaves of Heaven) is based on the Erasmus programme, where the protagonist Haya goes to [[Sabancı University]] through [[Erasmus Mundus]], which marks a turning point in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Online novels by Nimra Ahmed | url = http://www.urdunovelsonline.com/category/nimra-ahmed/ | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831073232/http://www.urdunovelsonline.com/category/nimra-ahmed/ | archivedate = 31 August 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''cafébabel'' ===
The online public forum ''cafébabel'' was founded in 2001 by Erasmus exchange programme students, and is headquartered in Paris. The forum is based on the principle of participatory journalism. As of July 2013 it had over 16,000 registered members, up to 1,500 contributors and 20 ‘local offices’ writing about Europe as they see it. Volunteer contributors simultaneously translate the forum into six languages – French, English, German, Italian, Spanish and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = cafébabel, the first European media | url = http://ec.europa.eu/languages/news/2013/20130716-cafebabel-european-media_en.htm | publisher = [[European Commission]] | date = 16 July 2013 | access-date = 24 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113212/http://ec.europa.eu/languages/news/2013/20130716-cafebabel-european-media_en.htm | archivedate = 25 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faneromeni School''' (Greek: Παρθεναγωγείο Φανερωμένης, Turkish: Faneromeni Okulu), founded by Archbishop [[Makarios I]] in 1857, was the first all-girls school in [[Cyprus]].

The founder of the School, Archbishop [[Makarios I]], was instrumental in the establishment of many other schools throughout the island of Cyprus in order to combat illiteracy.

The School is located in the historical [[Faneromeni Square Nicosia|Faneromeni Square]], situated in the centre of the capital and within the [[Venice|Venetian]] medieval walls of [[Nicosia]].

The School building features predominantly [[Greece|Greek]] [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architectural traits, as well as, local Cypriot elements.

The Marble Mausoleum on the eastern side of Faneromeni Church is situated on the front of the building and was built in memory of four clerics executed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] governor in 1821, following the Cypriot revolt due to the newly declared [[Greek War of Independence]].

Today it is a co-ed school and the same building houses a nursery, primary and high schools. In 2014 it was announced that the building will be leased to house the [[University of Cyprus]]' school of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/191186/i-architektoniki-paei-sti-faneromeni&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Faneromeni school building university of Cyprus by night Nicosia Republic of Cyprus Cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|View of Faneromeni School by night]]
[[File:Faneromeni school within old Nicosia Cyprus.jpg|thumb|View of Faneromeni School]]
The school was founded in 1852 after many efforts from the  Greek Orthodox Church and especially the Faneromeni church which is situated right in front of the school. Primarily it was used as “parthenagogeio” which means a Girls Only School (G.O.S.). The school had 115 students but only one teacher. The only way she could teach all these children was by using the help of older children as teachers-assistants for the younger ones.

As from 1903 Faneromeni School was also used for the training of the female teachers. The school took its΄ present form in 1924 with financial assistance  from the Faneromeni Church.  Nowadays the school is a public school for boys and girls. Within the same building there is a nursery school, a  primary school and a high school.

'''Greenwood Hall''' was a publicly traded [[educational technology]] company that provided cloud-based people and technology-enabled solutions designed to help post-secondary institutions better manage the student lifecycle.  Greenwood Hall was headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]] and operated student service center facilities in [[Orange County, California]], [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and [[College Station, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CEO Centerfold - John Hall|url=http://www.ocmetro.com/t-CEO_Centerfold_John_Hall_022808.aspx|accessdate=28 June 2014|work=OC Metro|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company ceased operations on December 15, 2017, after its assets were sold to [[Answernet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear former Greenwood Hall employee': Letter confirms no pay coming for call center staff|url=http://wpde.com/news/local/dear-former-greenwood-hall-employee-letter-confirms-no-pay-coming|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Company's assets now operate as Answernet Education Services, in Phoenix, Arizona, from the same facility operated by Greenwood Hall, prior to it ceasing operations.

== History ==

Greenwood Hall was founded by [[Dr. John R. Hall]] and Zan Greenwood in 1997.  In 1998, Greenwood Hall commenced call center operations from a facility in [[Irvine, California]] and a partner location in nearby Santa Ana, California. The Company focused on building its call center network during the first years of operations to support the needs of the direct response television industry and large television infomercials.

In 2000, the Company expanded its operations to include customer relationship management, logistics, fulfillment, and other related services as demand for the outsourcing of these services continued to increase significantly.

The Company relocated its corporate headquarters in August 2002 from Irvine to Santa Ana, California.

In the fall of 2006, the Company announced an expansion of its services and infrastructure and to accommodate significant new demand within higher education.   In October 2007, Greenwood &amp; Hall acquired the Financial Aid Solutions (FAS) Division of [[Nelnet|Nelnet, Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Campuses Turn to Remote Call Centers to Handle Flood of Calls|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Campuses-Turn-to-Remote-Call/134064/|accessdate=28 June 2014|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, Greenwood Hall shifted its focus to helping colleges and universities manage the student lifecycle.

In 2013, Greenwood Hall commenced a restructuring, during which time the Company shed unprofitable business and made changes to its management team.

In August 2014, the Company announced it completed an $8 million recapitalization which included refinancing of its bank debt and an equity infusion for expansion purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greenwood Hall Completes $8 Million Recapitalization to Fuel Rapid Expansion in Higher Education Sector|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140825-905378.html|accessdate=3 September 2014|work=Wall Street Journal Online|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the recapitalization, the Company became a publicly traded entity.

In May 2015, the Company opened a new student services center in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], relocating its California operations to this facility. The Company located its corporate headquarters and sales offices to [[West Los Angeles]], California in conjunction with this move.

In July 2017, John R. Hall, Greenwood Hall's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, abruptly resigned from the Company after 19 years serving as CEO. In his resignation letter, Hall expressed concerns regarding his ability to operate the Company based on constraints Hall stated were being imposed on Greenwood Hall by its lender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter of Resignation, John R. Hall|url=http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/Greenwood+Hall.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2017|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, Hall also indicated he was owed back pay as well as approximately $250,000 in funds he incurred on Greenwood Hall's behalf.

In August 2017, Bill Bradfield, Greenwood Hall's EVP of Business Development and the former Founder &amp; CEO of Perceptis, Inc. was appointed the Company's Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greenwood Hall Selects Bill Bradfield as Their New Chief Executive Officer|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/greenwood-hall-selects-bill-bradfield-as-their-new-chief-executive-officer-20170821-00943|accessdate=23 August 2017|work=NASDAQ|date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, it was announced that Greenwood Hall was moving its operations and corporate headquarters to South Carolina, where it planned to invest over $1.4 million and hire more than 300 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology firm plans 300 new jobs for Myrtle Beach area|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/news/technology-firm-plans-news-jobs-for-myrtle-beach-area/article_e2924e3e-be1f-11e7-b01d-57ea5e0dd0d7.html|accessdate=29 November 2017|date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Greenwood Hall abruptly closed its Bryan, TX and Myrtle Beach, SC locations and it was reported that the assets of Greenwood Hall were sold to [[Answernet]] and that Answernet would continue to operate the Company's Phoenix, AZ location rebranded Answernet Education Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear former Greenwood Hall employee': Letter confirms no pay coming for call center staff|url=http://wpde.com/news/local/dear-former-greenwood-hall-employee-letter-confirms-no-pay-coming|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Danton''' (born '''Henry David Boileau Down'''; 30 March 1919) is a British dancer, teacher, and stager of [[classical ballet]].

Danton was a prolific dancer in London during and immediately after [[World War II]]. In the UK, Danton performed as a soloist in the [[International Ballet]] partnering [[Mona Inglesby]] in ''[[Les Sylphides]]'' and ''[[Swan Lake]]'' 1943–44, and with the [[Royal Ballet|Sadler's Wells Ballet]] 1944–46, where he appeared with [[Margot Fonteyn]], [[Beryl Grey]], and [[Violetta Elvin]] in the ''[[Rose Adagio]]'' and [[Pamela May]] in ''Les Sylphides'' and created leading roles in a number of works, most notably in [[Sir Frederick Ashton]]'s ''[[Symphonic Variations (ballet)|Symphonic Variations]]'' partnering [[Moira Shearer]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, David (1999).  Frederick Ashton and his Ballets (second ed.).  London:  Dance Books.  {{ISBN|1852730625}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately educated with Judith Espinosa, he passed the [[Royal Academy of Dancing]]'s four exams with honours winning the [[Adeline Genée]] Silver Medal after just 18 months of classical ballet training. During the war Danton studied intensively with the Russian teacher [[Vera Volkova]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Meinertz, Alexander.

Born [[Boileau baronets|Henry David Boileau Down]] to a family with French and Scottish ancestry and proud military traditions, Henry Danton attended Crowthorne Towers preparatory school as a child, and later [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], as a King's Cadet.

Aged 19, he was commissioned from the Academy in January 1939 as Second Lieutenant in the [[Royal Artillery]] and was promoted to Captain at the outbreak of World War II before being retired from active service in 1940.

The Award aims to encourage promising students with outstanding academic, extra-curricular and community service achievements, and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doj.gov.hk/chi/public/pdf/2010/sj20100626c.pdf | title = Speech by Wong Yan Lung, Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong, at the Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards Prize Presentation Ceremony 2010| publisher = The Government of Hong Kong | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Department of Political Science and International Relations''' has been offering undergraduate and graduate programs since 1995.

==Goals==
The undergraduate program offers a broad range of courses in political theory, and area studies leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and in Area Studies.Graduate programs leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees are offered at the Department and focus in several areas: Conflict Studies, Political Theory, and Area Studies, including European Public Affairs, Middle Eastern Studies, East Asian Studies, and Caucasus Studies.The faculty is composed of primarily representatives of the youngergeneration of Western-educated specialists in Political Science with research and professional experience in Western Europe, North America,and other advanced industrialized countries. Jointly with the Institute of Politics the Department conducts a number of scholarly events annually, including annual moot courts on political philosophy, crisis simulation exercises, executive education workshops, and conferences.

==Activities==
Institute of Politics The Institute of Politics at Khazar University is an independent, nonpartisan institution committed to public policy research, analysis andeducation.The Institute (formerly the Center for International and Strategic Studies) has a primary objective of contributing to improving the performance of public institutions in Azerbaijan and the quality of public policy through cultivating regular interaction between policymakers and scholars to analyze current issues, and offering practical approaches for dealing with those issues. The Institute holds regular conferences, seminars, workshops and panel discussions with various public officials, diplomats and scholars as well as various student-oriented workshops, such as annual crisis simulation exercises and annual moot courts. It has offered a wide range of programs and resources including speakers, visiting and resident fellows, study groups, conferences, and internships. Below are some examples of the Institute’s activities:

* In May 2010, an OSCE Model Conference was organized by Khazar University and OSCE Office in Baku bringing together students from about 15 universities of Azerbaijan.
* A group of students of Khazar University became winner of the competition conducted among Azerbaijani universities for participation at OSCE Simulation Model Conference. Students of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences attended OSCE Model Conference in Vienna in 2008.
* In 2006-2007 a series of crisis simulations exercises, conferences and workshops on various issues of contemporary international relations as well as on different topics in political science were organized.
* The two-day Modeling Azerbaijan's Future: Examining Trends,Exploring Opportunities conference took place on June 18–19,
2005 and was a convention of around 60 scholars, practitioners and students of public policy, government executives and civil society leaders, devoted to expert discussion of trends and opportunities pertaining to major public issues in Azerbaijan. The core outcomes of the conference were concrete policy recommendations to various institutions and agencies in Azerbaijan, involved in public policy making. The program consisted of several panels and roundtables on political development, economic development, foreign policy and public diplomacy, identity and nationalism. During specialized workshops concrete policy recommendations were developed by specialists and shared with the larger audience.272
* Second Annual Crisis Simulation Exercise was held on April 30, 2005 and around 70 students from four universities in Baku took part in the exercise. Seven teams of students from Khazar University, Baku State University, Azerbaijan State Economic University, and Baku Slavic University were "representing" mock National Security Councils (NSC) of seven countries – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and the United States – in a role-play game in order to solve an imaginative crisis in the South Caucasus. Each "NSC" consisted of a President, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of National Security, Minister of Defense, and Adviser to the President on Economic Affairs. Several other states as well as major international organizations were "represented" by one person. "Mass media" were highlighting the developments during the exercise. The working language at the exercise was English.
* From November 22–26, 2004, Khazar University Institute of Politics held its First Annual Executive Education Workshop Doing
Policy Analysis: How to Tackle Policy Problems in Azerbaijan. This unique workshop was conducted under the auspices of the Eurasia Foundation/ Azerbaijan and the Embassy of the United States of America in Azerbaijan to equip government and public sector executives and analysts as well as faculty and students of public policy with essential tools to handle problem identification, policy formulation and decision-making issues confidently and effectively. 25 government executives and policy analysts, NGO managers, junior faculty and advanced students from Azerbaijan and Georgia participated in this workshop led by Dr. Beryl Radin, Professor of Government and Public Administration at the American University in Washington, DC. Participants applied various methods in policy analysis through analyzing case studies and developing their own policy analysis project.

In [[linguistics]], '''language death''' occurs when a [[language]] loses its [[terminal speaker|last]] [[First language|native speaker]]. By extension, '''language extinction''' is when the language is no longer known, including by [[Second language|second-language]] speakers. Other similar terms include '''linguicide''',&lt;ref name="Stop, revive and survive"&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the death of a language from natural or political causes, and rarely '''glottophagy''',&lt;ref&gt;Calvet, Jean-Louis. 1974. ''Langue et colonialisme: petit traité de glottophagie.'' Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; the absorption or replacement of a minor language by a major language.

Language death is a process in which the level of a [[Speech community|speech community's]] [[linguistic competence]] in their [[Variety (linguistics)|language variety]] decreases, eventually resulting in no native or fluent speakers of the variety. Language death can affect any language form, including [[dialect]]s. Language death should not be confused with [[language attrition]] (also called language loss), which describes the loss of proficiency in a [[first language]] of an individual.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000"&gt;Crystal, David (2000) ''Language Death''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern period]] (c. 1500 CE–present; following the rise of [[colonialism]]), language death has typically resulted from the process of [[cultural assimilation]] leading to [[language shift]] and the gradual abandonment of a native language in favour of a foreign ''[[lingua franca]]'', largely those of [[European colonialism|European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XxZbhSsqnUQC&amp;pg=PT739|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|last=Byram|first=Michael|last2=Hu|first2=Adelheid|date=2013-06-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136235531|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HecNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|title=Living Through Languages: An African Tribute to René Dirven|last=Walt|first=Christa Van der|date=2007-05-01|publisher=AFRICAN SUN MeDIA|isbn=9781920109707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sq5pdj2snokC&amp;pg=PA115|title=Mapping Applied Linguistics: A Guide for Students and Practitioners|last=Hall|first=Christopher J.|last2=Smith|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Wicaksono|first3=Rachel|date=2015-05-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136836233|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2000s, a total of roughly 7,000 natively spoken languages existed worldwide. Most of these are minor languages in danger of extinction; one estimate published in 2004 expected that some 90% of the currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4387421/|title=Study by language researcher, David Graddol|date=2004-02-26|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2012-03-22}} {{cite web|url=http://www.chinasmack.com/stories/90-percent-worlds-languages-extinct-in-41-years/|title=Research by Southwest University for Nationalities College of Liberal Arts|author=Ian on Friday, January 16, 2009 61 comments|date=2009-01-16|publisher=Chinasmack.com|accessdate=2012-03-22}}. [[Ethnologue]] records 7,358 living languages known,{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp|title=Ethnologue|date=|publisher=Ethnologue|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005193846/http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp|archivedate=October 5, 2001|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-03-22}}  but on 2015-05-20, [[Ethnologue]] reported only 7,102 known living languages; and on 2015-02-23, Ethnologue already reported only 7,097 known living languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Language death is typically the final outcome of [[language shift]] and may manifest itself in one of the following ways:
* Gradual language death: slowly, over a period of time
* Bottom-to-top language death: cessation of the use of language except in special circumstances (e.g. liturgical language) 
* Top-to-bottom language death: when language shift begins in a high-level environment such as the government.
* Radical language death: The disappearance of a language when all speakers of the language cease to speak the language
* Linguicide (also known as sudden death, language genocide, physical language death, biological language death)
* Language attrition: the loss of proficiency in a language at the individual level

The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one [[language]] becomes [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] with another language, and gradually [[Language shift|shifts]] allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original, [[heritage language]]. This is a process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] which may be voluntary or may be forced upon a population. Speakers of some languages, particularly regional or minority languages, may decide to abandon them based on economic or utilitarian grounds, in favor of languages regarded as having greater utility or prestige.

Languages with a small, geographically isolated population of speakers can die when their speakers are wiped out by [[genocide]], [[disease]], or [[natural disaster]].

== Definition==
A language is often declared to be dead even before the last native speaker of the language has died. If there are only a few elderly speakers of a language remaining, and they no longer use that language for communication, then the language is effectively dead. A language that has reached such a reduced stage of use is generally considered moribund.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000"/&gt; Half of the spoken languages of the world are not being taught to new generations of children.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000" /&gt; Once a language is no longer a native language—that is, if no children are being socialized into it as their primary language—the process of transmission is ended and the language itself will not survive past the current generations.

Language death is rarely a sudden event, but a slow process of each generation learning less and less of the language, until its use is relegated to the domain of traditional use, such as in poetry and song. Typically the transmission of the language from adults to children becomes more and more restricted, to the final setting that adults speaking the language will raise children who never acquire fluency. One example of this process reaching its conclusion is that of the [[Dalmatian language]].

==Consequences on grammar==
During language loss—sometimes referred to as ''obsolescence'' in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. This process of change has been described by Appel (1983) in two categories, though they are not mutually exclusive. Often speakers replace elements of their own language with something from the language they are shifting toward. Also, if their heritage language has an element that the new language does not, speakers may drop it.

* analogical leveling.

==Language revitalization==
{{Main|Language revitalization}}
Language revitalization is an attempt to slow or reverse language death. Revitalization programs are ongoing in many languages, and have had varying degrees of success.

The [[revival of the Hebrew language]] in [[Israel]] is the only example of a language's acquiring new [[first language]] speakers after it became extinct in everyday use for an extended period, being used only as a [[liturgical language]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, Leanne; &amp; Hale, Ken (eds.). 2001. ''The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice''. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], there is a theory that argues that "the Hebrew revivalists who wished to speak pure Hebrew failed. The result is a fascinating and multifaceted Israeli language, which is not only multi-layered but also multi-sourced. The revival of a clinically dead language is unlikely without cross-fertilization from the revivalists' mother tongue(s)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html "Aboriginal languages deserve revival"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923233756/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html |date=2009-09-23 }}, ''The Australian Higher Education'', August 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases of language revitalization which have seen some degree of success are [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]  and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As a response to English linguistic dominance, [[Anglicization#Place names|de-anglicisation]] became a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under [[colonialism|colonial]] rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject.&lt;ref name=ALD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html|title=The Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland|first=Douglas|last=Hyde|date=25 November 1892|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= De-Anglicization - Free Online Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/de-anglicization| publisher= |accessdate= | quote=the elimination of English influence, language, customs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following centuries of [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English rule in Ireland]] and English imposition of the English language, an argument for de-anglicization was delivered before the [[National Literary Society|Irish National Literary Society]] in Dublin, 25 November 1892; "When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English."&lt;ref name=ALD/&gt; Language was one of the features of Anglicisation in Ireland: although it never died out and became an [[official language]] after independence, Irish had lost its status as the island's principal vernacular to become a minority language during the period of English rule; similarly, in North America [[indigenous language]]s have been replaced by those of the colonists.

According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "language reclamation will become increasingly relevant as people seek to recover their cultural autonomy, empower their spiritual and intellectual sovereignty, and improve wellbeing. There are various ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian benefits of language revival—for example, historical justice, diversity and employability, respectively."&lt;ref name="Stop, revive and survive"/&gt;

== Factors that prevent language death ==
Google launched the Endangered Languages Project aimed at helping preserve languages that are at risk of extinction. Its goal is to compile up-to-date information about endangered languages and share the latest research about them.

Anthropologist Akira Yamamoto has identified nine factors that he believes will help prevent language death:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKHjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|date=2014-11-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781316124093|location=|pages=191|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There must be a dominant culture that favors linguistic diversity
# The endangered community must possess an ethnic identity that is strong enough to encourage language preservation
# The creation and promotion of programs that educate students on the endangered language and culture
# The creation of school programs that are both bilingual and bicultural
# For native speakers to receive teacher training
# The endangered speech community must be completely involved 
# There must be language materials created that are easy to use
# The language must have written materials that encompass new and traditional content
# The language must be used in new environments and the areas the language is used (both old and new) must be strengthened

==Dead languages ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
Linguists distinguish between language "death" and the process where a language becomes a "dead language" through normal [[language change]], a linguistic phenomenon analogous to [[pseudoextinction]]. This happens when a language in the course of its normal development gradually morphs into something that is then recognized as a separate, different language, leaving the old form with no native speakers. Thus, for example, [[Old English]] may be regarded as a "dead language" although it changed and developed into [[Middle English]], [[Early Modern English]] and [[Modern English]]. Dialects of a language can also die, contributing to the overall language death. For example, the Ainu language is slowly dying - "The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger lists Hokkaido Ainu as critically endangered with 15 speakers ... and both Sakhalin and Kuril Ainu as extinct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Länsisalmi|first1=Riikka|title=NORTHERN VOICES: EXAMINING LANGUAGE ATTITUDES IN RECENT SURVEYS ON AINU AND SAAMI|journal=Studia Orientalia Electronica|date=October 2016|volume=117|pages=429-267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language change ==
The process of language change may also involve the splitting up of a language into a family of several [[daughter language]]s, leaving the common parent language "dead". This has happened to [[Latin]], which (through [[Vulgar Latin]]) eventually developed into the [[Romance languages]], and to [[Prakrit]], which developed into the [[Indo-Aryan languages#New Indo-Aryan|New Indo-Aryan languages]]. Such a process is normally not described as "language death", because it involves an unbroken chain of normal transmission of the language from one generation to the next, with only minute changes at every single point in the chain. Thus with regard to Latin, for example, there is no point at which Latin "died"; it evolved in different ways in different geographic areas, and its modern forms are now identified by a plethora of different names such as French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Catalan, Galician, Venetian, etc.

==Measuring language vitality==
Except in case of linguicide, languages do not suddenly become extinct; they become moribund as the community of speakers gradually [[Language shift|shifts]] to using other languages. As speakers shift, there are discernible, if subtle, changes in language behavior. These changes in behavior lead to a change of linguistic vitality in the community.  There are a variety of systems that have been proposed for measuring the vitality of a language in a community. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by [[Joshua Fishman]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Joshua. 1991. ''Reversing Language Shift''. Clevendon: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; A noteworthy publishing milestone in measuring language vitality is an entire issue of ''[[Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development]]'' devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind. These include works by [[Arienne Dwyer]],&lt;ref name=Dwyer2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Arienne M. |title=Tools and techniques for endangered-language assessment and revitalization |url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/7109/1/Dwyer2011_AssessRevitalize.pdf |date=October 23–24, 2009 |location=New York |journal=Trace  Foundation Lecture Series Proceedings: Preprint |format=PDF |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Ehala,&lt;ref&gt;Ehala, Martin. 2009.

The '''Learning assistant model''' is a model for improving the recruitment and education of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] teachers. It was established in 2003 at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/02/04/461942790/making-science-teaching-more-than-a-backup-plan |title=Making Science Teaching More Than 'A Backup Plan' |last=Kamenetz |first=Anya |date=February 4, 2016 |website=npr.org |publisher=NPR |access-date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve three related goals: (1) to recruit and improve the preparation of future mathematics and science teachers, (2) to improve the education of all students enrolled in our mathematics and science courses, and (3) to engage science faculty more thoroughly in the preparation of future teachers.

The LA model was initiated as a part of the STEM Colorado project headed by Richard McCray. The impetus behind the LA model was data that most students under perform in science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) subjects [1,2], that many of our teachers having neither a major nor minor in their field [3], and that large research universities are not producing adequate numbers of mathematics and science teachers [4].

The Learning Assistant model is based on the premise that teacher preparation begins with training in a specific STEM discipline.  It then encourages students to consider a career in education through a modest stipend,first hand teaching experiences, and a specially designed education seminar course.  Typically, LAs facilitate small group interactions in large-enrollment courses, and at the same time, they make up the pool from which we recruit new K-12 teachers.

The required Mathematics and Science Education Seminar aims to help LAs integrate content, pedagogy, and practice, and is taught by a faculty member from the School of Education and a K12 teacher. In this course students investigate relevant educational literature, and engage in in-depth discussions about their own teaching and learning. Seminar readings and discussions include topics such as discussion techniques, learning theory, cooperative learning, student [[epistemological|epistemologies]], metacognition and argumentation, self-explanations and tutoring, multiple intelligences and differentiated instruction, the nature of science and mathematics, national standards, teaching with technology, and qualities of an effective teacher.

Because the point of the LA model is to enhance the recruitment of well-trained students in the teaching profession, a student can continue as an LA only if s/he shows commitment to finding out more about teaching.  The outcomes of the LA project at UC Boulder are currently being evaluated through research on improvements in discipline-specific and pedagogical content knowledge and the number of new teachers recruited and retained.

'''Lyndon Bentley Wainwright''' (7 December 1919 – 2 January 2018) was a British [[Metrology|metrologist]], [[ballroom dancer]] and author. He worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) during [[World War II]], and was a Chairman of the British Engineering Metrology Association. 

After the war, he was a leading exhibition dancer, and one of a small group of experts who introduced [[Latin dances|Latin American dance]] to Britain. Wainwright wrote nine books on ballroom dancing. He received the [[Carl Alan Award]] for 1996-99, and other honours from the dance community. He was an expert on phonogram [[Performing rights|performance rights]] and was a member of the British Ring of the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]].  

==Personal life==
Born in [[Scarborough, Yorkshire]] in 1919, Wainwright married three times: to Felicia Heslop (m. 1943-60; divorced); Isobel Scott (m. 1964–69; divorced), and Yvonne Gandy (m. 1973-2011; her death). 

He had one son, Mark, from his second marriage and four grandchildren, Annabel, Connor, Ewan, and Brodie. He died in January 2018 at the age of 98.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lyndon-wainwright.muchloved.com Tribute to Lyndon Wainwright, 1919–2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrology==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
After his education and upbringing in Scarborough, Wainwright joined the NPL, the largest applied physics laboratory in the UK, in 1939. There he trained and worked as an engineering [[metrology|metrologist]]. From September 1939, this facility worked mainly in support of the war effort, and so employment there was to some extent a [[reserved occupation]]: key employees were not called up for military service if the employer made appropriate application to the [[War Office]]. In addition to their work, staff members were expected to join the NPL [[Fire Brigade]] as part-timers or the [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] (air-raid warning and fire watch).

Later in life, when his active career as a dancer was over, Lyndon returned to metrology, working at the National Engineering Laboratory in [[East Kilbride]], Scotland for four years, and then for seven years was Head of Quality Control and Metrology at PIRA, the Research Association for the Printing, Packaging and Paper Making Industries (formerly PATRA, the Printing Industry Research Association) in [[Leatherhead, Surrey]]. In this capacity he lectured in the UK and abroad, and sat on committees of the International Association of Research Organizations in the Printing Industries. Wainwright was Chairman of the English Metrology Association from 1967-72.

==Career in dance==
Wainwright met his first wife, Felicia (14 April 1920 – September 1993), in 1940, and they soon started to train as a ballroom dance couple. They married in 1943, the year they first gave a dance exhibition for payment. After taking coaching from [[Monsieur Pierre]], they started to compete as a professional couple. In 1948 they won the Premier Prix in a World's Professional Eight Dance Ballroom championship, staged in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;This was the ''third'' prize, after the Champion and Vice-champion. The event was organised by the ''Societé National de Professers de Danse'' (SNPD). These events do not have the status of the modern [[World Dance Council|WDC events]], but they were an opportunity for competitors to dance some Latin rhythms at a time when all the English competitive events were purely English ballroom dances.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The couple then specialised in the Latin dances and helped to introduce these dance forms to the British public. The partnership was billed as ''Lyndon &amp; Felicia'' for their dance exhibitions, which were given in clubs, ballrooms, restaurants, celebrations and on television. On [[BBC tv]], they appeared with the [[Edmundo Ros]] Orchestra, and [[Victor Silvester]]'s ''BBC Dancing Club'', dancing rumba, samba, paso doble and mambo. Between 1950 and 1960, the pair were probably the leading [[exhibition dancers]] of Latin American style in England. At their peak, they were presenting over 400 shows a year, often several times at different venues on a Sunday, and they also ran dance studios in [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[Ewell]] and [[Purley, London|Purley]] in Greater London. They were engaged to perform every alternate Dancers' Night for a year at the [[Hammersmith Palais]].&lt;ref&gt;Olney, Walley. "Personalities of Dance: Lyndon Wainwright", ''Danscene'', 21 September 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews of the partnership===
:"The highlights of their career are their appearances as demonstrators at the first ever World Congress of Teachers of Dancing organised by the Official Board of Ballroom Dancing, their several appearances on television with Edmundo Ros and Victor Silvester, and their demonstrations in Switzerland, Holland, Éire, Ulster and Denmark…

:"Lyndon and Felicia are now well on their way to their two thousandth demonstration… Within Great Britain they have travelled over 100,000 miles to give demonstrations… It is estimated that nearly one million people have seen these demonstrations personally, apart from those who have seen them on the television screen." &lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Dance and the Dancer''. July 1953, pg. 29. They danced 1,500 miles in Demonstrations: tenth anniversary of successful Lyndon &amp; Felicia partnership.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Together they broke box office records all over the country, in an era when England was producing the most beautiful dancers in the world." Kenneth Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kenneth 1993. ''Dance Teacher'' November pg. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If ever a list is produced of the six best show business [acts] from the world of ballroom dancing in the past 50 years, it would not be complete without [them]." [[Walter Laird]].&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Walter 1993. ''Dance Teacher'' November pg. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

:"They must have been one of the top ranking and highest paid duos of that and many other eras." Bob More.&lt;ref&gt;More, Bob 1993. ''Dance Teacher'' November pg. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In the early 50s Lyndon &amp; Felicia were well known for their wonderful cabaret – they didn't follow the normal trend – they studied all types of Latin American rhythms. Some that they danced, such as Blues, Mambo and the Mexican Jarabe, are quite new to many people today, but Lyndon and Felicia studied them, and presented every time a cabaret with a difference." [[Peggy Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Peggy 1993. ''Dance Teacher'' November pg. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later dance work ===
Many years later, the [[BBC]] invited Lyndon to take part in a television documentary ''Last Man at the Palais'' dealing with the history of the [[Hammersmith Palais]]. The Palais had opened in 1919 as a dance hall and entertainment venue, and finally closed in 2007. With a fellow professional, Lyndon danced a [[waltz]], which was the last dance shown on the televised program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Weller|first1=Richard|date=Spring 2009|title=Project Palais|url=http://www.hfhbg.org.uk/newsletters/Newsletter-20-Spr-09.pdf|format=PDF|magazine=Hammersmith and Fulham Historic Buildings Group Newsletter|issue=20|page=7|access-date=11 July 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; first screened on [[BBC Four]] on Christmas Eve 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Man in Hammersmith Palais|publisher=BBC Four (TV channel)|date=2007|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008l3rx|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SO16A3cp|archivedate=6 September 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his dance partnership and marriage ended in 1960, Wainwright devoted himself to teaching, writing and the administrative side of the dance world. He was Executive Councillor, Hon. Treasurer, and Company Secretary of the [[International Dance Teachers Association]] (IDTA). He served as a delegate to the [[British Dance Council]] and as founder and Hon Secretary of its Teachers' Committee, and on the ''Council for Dance Education and Training'', and the [[Central Council of Physical Recreation]]. He was an acknowledged expert in the Performing and Phonographic Rights involved in playing music in public. For over 50 years he contributed articles to dance magazines such as ''Dance Teacher'' (now ''Dance International''), ''Ballroom Dancing Times'' (now ''Dance Today''), and Dance Expression. Wainwright also wrote articles for the [[Daily Mirror]].
 
The dance profession has honoured Lyndon for his services to dance. In 1996 and 1999 he received the [[Carl Alan Award]], in 1998 the ''Classique de Danse'', in 2000 the ''President's Award'' of the Ballroom Dancers' Federation, and in 2005 the ''Distinguished Service Award'' of the IDTA.

'''Magda Gerber''' (died April 27, 2007) was an early childhood educator in the United States and is known for teaching parents and caregivers how to understand babies and interact with them respectfully from birth.
 
The seeds for her passion for infant care come from pediatrician [[Emmi Pikler]]. Pikler's innovative theories on infant care were successfully tested during the course of her tenure as medical director of Loczy, a state-run [[orphanage]] in Budapest. Gerber incorporated many of Pikler's theories into her own philosophy, which she called Educaring®. The term ''Educarer®'', which she also coined, refers to either a parent or other caregiver, and emphasizes the bidirectional influence of caring and educating.

== Biography ==
Gerber was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. She received a degree in linguistics at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=:Mooney&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories of attachment: An introduction to Bowlby, Ainsworth, Gerber, Brazelton, Kennel and Klaus.|last=Mooney|first=Carol Gerhart|publisher=Redleaf Press.|year=2010|isbn=9781933653389|location=MN|pages=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband Imre Gerber had three children.
 
Magda met Pikler in her role as a pediatrician for the local families of Budapest.  When her daughter was sick, and their regular pediatrician was away, Gerber called the mother of her daughter's school friend, who was a doctor.  Pikler examined her daughter, and Gerber was so impressed by how respectfully Pikler spoke to her daughter, and the cooperation that she elicited, that she asked Pikler to become the family's regular pediatrician.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Your Self-Confident Baby: How to encourage your child's natural abilities - from the very start.|last=Gerber|first=Magda|last2=Johnson|first2=Alison|publisher=J. Wiley|year=1998|isbn=9781118158791|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Pikler, Gerber earned a Master's degree in early childhood education in Budapest and in 1945 she began working with Pikler at the National Methodological Institute for Infant Care and Education in Budapest, commonly called Lóczy after the street on which it was located. Pikler became Gerber's mentor and friend.&lt;ref name=":Hammond 2009"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Respecting babies: A new look at Magda Gerber's RIE approach.|last=Hammond|first=Ruth Ann|publisher=ZERO TO THREE|year=2009|isbn=9781934019351|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the end of WWII, the Communist Party takeover threw Hungary into political turmoil. Gerber's husband and teenage daughter were jailed as political prisoners.&lt;ref name=":Mooney" /&gt;  After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the family left Hungary to seek sanctuary in Austria. Gerber worked as an interpreter at the American Embassy in Vienna until 1957 when the family emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;

They were placed at [[Camp Kilmer]], a military base in New Jersey, before moving to Boston for a year where Gerber again worked as an interpreter at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;  The family then settled in Los Angeles where Gerber worked as a therapist at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles|Children's Hospital]] with children who had cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;  Gerber then spent seven years working with autistic children at the Dubnoff School, in North Hollywood, California.&lt;ref name=":Carlisle 2013"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baby knows best.|last=Solomon|first=Deborah Carlisle|publisher=Little Brown and Company|year=2013|isbn=9780316219198|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to her book, "Your Self-confident Baby", Gerber was able to develop relationships with extremely disturbed children that nobody else had been able to reach. She claimed that her magic was closely observing the children and expecting only what they could do.  "When a child is expected to do something he cannot, he is set up for failure."&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;

In 1968, she developed and directed the Pilot Infant Program at the Dubnoff School.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;

In 1972, Gerber was invited by Thomas Forrest, pediatric neurologist and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at [[Stanford University]], to advise him on the program he was starting for the Children's Health Council (CHC) in Palo Alto, California.  Gerber co-directed the Demonstration Infant Program (DIP) with Forrest for four years.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt; The DIP was a program of preventative mental health based on modeling selective intervention with a group of infants and toddlers to their parents or carers.  The program encouraged children to learn problem solving skills through play and foster self-confidence.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;  Gerber described the purpose of the program "If you can help parents to perceive and accept the child at his own developmental level, and to learn how to understand and respond to his needs, you can prevent problems before they develop, rather than have the difficult job of undoing them later in life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The RIE Manual for parents and professionals|last=|first=|publisher=Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE)|year=2013|isbn=9781892560087|editor-last=Gerber|editor-first=Magda|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=|editor-last2=Greenwald|editor-first2=Deborah|editor-last3=Weaver|editor-first3=Joan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 she began teaching parent/infant guidance classes in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":Carlisle 2013" /&gt;

In 1978, Gerber and Forrest co-founded the non-profit organisation [[Resources for Infant Educarers]]® (RIE®) in Los Angeles to further their work with families and child care professionals. At RIE (pronounced 'rye'), Gerber taught parents to observe their babies as they played, while a facilitator modelled how and when to intervene.&lt;ref name=":Carlisle 2013" /&gt;

Gerber taught parents to think about guiding children's behaviour through the lens of a stoplight.  When a child can handle the situation, the light is green and the adult does not need to intervene.  If the child's behaviour will put themselves or another person in danger, or is socially inappropriate, (a red light situation) then the adult will intervene to prevent anyone from getting hurt or to explain why something is not okay. This is done in a calm, non-judgmental way. It might also include physically blocking the child from causing harm.  When there is a situation where the child may not be able to manage on their own, the adult can respond to this as an amber light situation.  The adult would come close to observe the situation, and be ready to act.&lt;ref name=":Hammond 2009" /&gt;

Gerber taught early childhood development classes at the University of California, Los Angeles; California State University, Northridge and Pacific Oaks College, Pasadena.  She taught professional training classes and RIE parent/infant guidance classes at the RIE centre in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;

== The RIE Approach ==
RIE's mission is to improve the lives of infants and young children through respectful care. Gerber believed that babies are whole, competent beings from birth and should be treated as such. Gerber states in her book "Dear Parent: Caring for infants with respect" that, "We not only respect babies, we demonstrate our respect every time we interact with them. Respecting a child means treating even the youngest infant as a unique human being, not as an object."&lt;ref name=":Gerber 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Parent: Caring for infants with respect.|last=Gerber|first=Magda|publisher=Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE)|year=2002|isbn=9781892560063|editor-last=Weaver|editor-first=Joan|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principles of the RIE approach are:.&lt;ref name=":Gerber 1998" /&gt;
* Basic trust in the child to be an initiator, an explorer, and a self-learner.
* An environment for the child that is physically safe, cognitively challenging and emotionally nurturing.
* Time for uninterrupted play.
* Freedom to explore and interact with other infants.
* Involvement of the child in all care-giving activities to allow the child to be an active participant rather than a passive recipient.
* Sensitive observation of the child in order to understand her needs.
* Consistency and clearly defined limits and expectations to develop discipline.

RIE continues to offer classes for parents and their infants and toddlers, as well as a certificate program for parents and professionals in the Educaring® Approach. The Approach has now found its way around the world, with certified RIE Associates™ teaching and practicing in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Central America, uniting many cultures in their appreciation of the rights and integrity of infants and young children.
 
Gerber's work has been included in professional journals and videos, and her training tools are used to educate infant teachers and [[Early Head Start]] teachers in the US.&lt;ref name=":Mooney" /&gt;  Mooney states that Gerber "did much to set the tone for quality infant care and parenting programs in the US and around the world".&lt;ref name=":Mooney" /&gt; 
 
== Published Works ==
Gerber edited "The RIE Manual for Parents and Professionals" which was first published in 1978 and continues to be used and expanded in 2012 with more of her work. In 1997 she wrote ''Your Self-Confident Baby: How to Encourage Your Child's Natural Abilities from the Very Start'' with Allison Johnson, and in 1998 she wrote ''Dear Parent: Caring for Infants With Respect'' (with Joan Weaver) (Resources for Infant Educarers 1998, 2003).

A '''maid''', or '''housemaid''' or '''maidservant''', is a female [[domestic worker]]. Although now usually found only in the most wealthy of [[households]], in the [[Victorian era]] domestic service was the second largest category of employment in England and Wales, after agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/census.html|title=Occupations: census returns for 1851, 1861 and 1871|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maids were once part of an elaborate hierarchy in [[great house]]s, where the [[retinue]] of servants stretched up to the housekeeper and butler, responsible for female and male employees respectively. The word "maid" itself is short for "maiden", meaning a girl or unmarried young woman or virgin. Domestic workers, particularly those low in the hierarchy, such as maids and [[footmen]], were expected to remain unmarried while in service,&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essay XI''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus, ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; and even highest-ranking workers such as butlers could be dismissed for marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320949/Downstairs-Downton-Abbey-How-real-servants-worked-14-hour-days-maids-confined-virgin-quarters.html|title=Downstairs at Downton: How the real servants worked 14-hour days and the maids were confined to 'virgin quarters'|date=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victorian England, all middle class families would have "help", but for most small households, this would be only one employee, the maid of all work, often known colloquially as "the girl".

Historically many maids suffered from [[Prepatellar bursitis]], an inflammation of the [[Prepatellar bursa]] caused by long periods spent on the knees for purposes of scrubbing and fire-lighting, leading to the condition attracting the colloquial name of "Housemaid's Knee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://patient.info/health/housemaids-knee-prepatellar-bursitis|title = Housemaid's Knee (Prepatellar Bursitis)|work = Patient.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{See also|Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong}}

In the contemporary [[Western world]], comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help, usually relying on [[cleaner]]s, employed directly or through an agency ([[Maid service]]). Today a single maid may be the only [[domestic worker]] that upper-middle class households employ, as was historically the case. 

In less developed nations, various factors ensure a labour source for domestic work: very large differences in the income of urban and rural households, widespread poverty, fewer educated women, and limited opportunities for the employment of less educated women.

Maids perform typical domestic chores such as laundry, ironing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for household pets. They may also [[child care|take care of children]], although there are more specific occupations for this, such as [[nanny]]. In some poor countries, maids take care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a [[uniform]].

Legislation in many countries makes certain living conditions, working hours, or minimum wage a requirement of domestic service. Nonetheless, the work of a maid has always been hard, involving a full day, and extensive duties.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} 

==Types==
[[File:Joshua Reynolds - George Clive and his Family with an Indian Maid - WGA19338.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Clive (died 1779)|George Clive]] and his family with an Indian maid, painted 1765. As she appears to be caring for the child, she may be an ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]''.]]
Maids traditionally have a fixed position in the hierarchy of the large households, and although there is overlap between definitions (dependent on the size of the household) the positions themselves would typically be rigidly adhered to. The usual classifications of maid in a large household are:

* [[Lady's maid]]: a senior servant who reported directly to the [[lady]] of the house, but ranked beneath the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|Housekeeper]], and accompanied her lady on travel. She took care of her mistress's clothes and hair, and sometimes served as confidante. 
* House-maid or housemaid: a generic term for maids whose function was chiefly "above stairs", and were usually a little older, and better paid. Where a household included multiple housemaids the roles were often sub-divided as below.
** Head house-maid: the senior house maid, reporting to the Housekeeper. (Also called "House parlour maid" in an establishment with only one or two upstairs maids).
** Parlour maid: they cleaned and tidied reception rooms and living areas by morning, and often served refreshments at [[afternoon tea]], and sometimes also dinner. They tidied studies and libraries, and (with footmen) answered bells calling for service.&lt;ref&gt;A Parlour Maid's timetable is summarised [http://chestofbooks.com/food/household/Woman-Encyclopaedia-1/Parlourmaid-s-Time-Table.html in this webpage] extract from a book.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Chamber maid: they cleaned and maintained the bedrooms, ensured fires were lit in fireplaces, and supplied hot water.
** Laundry maid: they maintained bedding and towels. They also washed, dried, and ironed clothes for the whole household, including the servants.
** Under house parlour maid: the general deputy to the house parlour maid in a small establishment which had only two upstairs maids.
* [[Nursemaid|Nursery maid]]: also an "upstairs maid", but one who worked in the children's nursery, maintaining fires, cleanliness, and good order. Reported to the [[Nanny]] rather than the Housekeeper.
* [[Kitchen maid (domestic worker)|Kitchen maid]]: a "below stairs" maid who reported to the Cook, and assisted in running the kitchens.
** Head kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed, the "head kitchen maid" was effectively a [[line cook|deputy to the cook]], engaged largely in the plainer and simpler cooking (sometimes cooking the servants' meals).
** Under kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed these were the staff who prepared vegetables, peeled potatoes, and assisted in presentation of finished cooking for serving.
* [[Scullery maid]]: the lowest grade of "below stairs" maid, reporting to the cook, the scullery maids were responsible for washing cutlery, crockery, and glassware, and scrubbing kitchen floors, as well as monitoring ovens while kitchen maids ate their own supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlifestyle.org/?cat=14|title=Victorian Life Style|work=victorianlifestyle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Between maid]]: roughly equivalent in status to scullery maids, and often paid less, the between maids in a large household waited on the senior servants ([[butler]], [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], and [[Cook (domestic worker)|cook]]) and were therefore answerable to all three department heads, often leading to friction in their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwardfamily.com/victorian_servants.htm|title=ourwardfamily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes known by the name 'tweeny'.
* [[Still room maid]]: a junior maid employed in the [[still room]]; as the work involved the supply of alcohol, cosmetics, medicines, and cooking ingredients across all departments of the house, the still room maids were part of the "between staff", jointly answerable to all three department heads.

In more modest households a single '''maid-of-all-work''' or '''skivvy''' was often the only staff. It is possible this word originates from the Italian for slave ("schiavo"—"owned person").

==In popular culture==
One of the most in-depth and enduring representations of the lives of several types of maid was seen in the 1970s television drama ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'', set in [[England]] between 1903 and 1936. Another representation of the lives of maids is seen nowadays in ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', set in England between 1912 and 1926.

==In Middle East countries==
{{See also|Migrant workers in the Gulf region|Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia}}

Foreign women are employed in Middle East and African countries ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Somalia]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and others) in large numbers to work as maids and domestic servants and are often vulnerable to sexual abuse, violence and poor living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/07/07/if-i-am-not-human/abuses-against-asian-domestic-workers-saudi-arabia|title="As If I Am Not Human" - Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|date=7 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/saudi-arabia-treatment-foreign-workers |date=13 January 2013| title=Saudi Arabia's treatment of foreign workers under fire after beheading of Sri Lankan maid |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanrightswatch1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Human Rights Watch |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=printdoc&amp;amp;docid=412ef32a4| title='Bad Dreams:' Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date= 14 July 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15653">'''Nadine Bommer''' (born 1968 in [[New York City|New York City, New York]]) is an American-Israeli [[contemporary dance]] choreographer, teacher, and artistic director. She is the founder and artistic director of the internationally renowned Nadine Bommer Dance Company.

== Early life and training ==

Though born in New York City, Nadine Bommer spent most of her childhood in [[Rishon LeZion]], Israel. The drive to create dance productions has been ever-present in her life, and Bommer began creating when she was still just a child. Following her amateur productions for family, friends, and neighbors, Bommer was invited to head the student production at her school when she was only 11 years old, and then again in junior high and high school. She received a scholarship from the mayor for her impressive work as a child choreographer/director, and was invited to teach dance to a local group of students following the show produced in her junior year of high school. Intermittently throughout her childhood, Bommer traveled to NYC with her mother, studying dance at the [[American Ballet Theatre]] School and [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] School while there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isconshanghai.org/web/article.php?id=375|title=Nadine Animato Dance Company visits Shanghai - Consulate General of Israel In Shanghai|website=www.isconshanghai.org|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young adult, Bommer focused on teaching dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newvictory.org/Blog/July-2016/Victory-Dance-The-Companies-of-Program-C|title=Victory Dance: The Companies of Program C|website=www.newvictory.org|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 21, she opened the first in a series of successful dance studios in Israel. With her established school and developing choreography, Bommer began to codify the technique and artistic philosophy that now sustains her career and choreographic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/mvmagazine/docs/m_v_issue_13/94|title=Muses &amp; Visionaries magazine No13|work=issuu|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Bommer began her career as an educator, opening her first dance studio, Ketzev Hagoof, in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketzev Hagoof About Us|url=http://ketzevhagoof.co.il/Web/?PageType=0&amp;n=1&amp;ItemID=292863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketzev Hagoof still teaches dance to children throughout Israel, offering classes at their original location and multiple branches throughout the country. In 1994, Bommer shifted her focus, opening another school called the Nadine Bommer Dance Academy. This school of contemporary dance focuses on preparing students for professional careers in dance and classes are based in Bommer's technique the Nadine Bommer Method (see technique section). Nadine Bommer Dance Academy is currently the flagship location offering this technique to aspiring professional dancers.

In 1997 Bommer established her dance company, beginning performances of work inspired by the early stages of her method. As she continued to make work, Bommer codified her technique, working through stages focused on classical technique (Nevet), improvisation (Kinetica), and characterization (Animato). The final stage of the method, Animato, was completed in 2006, leading to a new phase of the company centered in comedic narrative dance works. In 2007, Bommer began receiving sustained support from the Israeli Ministry of Science, Culture &amp; Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.choreographers.org.il/646|title=Nadine Bommer|last=Thomas|website=www.choreographers.org.il|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year also marked the premiere of her landmark work ''Manimation'' which received great acclaim as Bommer's first work fully utilizing the Nadine Bommer Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.danceinisrael.com/2009/11/no-ballet-and-lots-of-israeli-dance/|title=No Ballet and Lots of Israeli Dance|date=2009-11-12|work=Dance In Israel|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Manimation'', Bommer choreographed three new full-length works in quick succession, ''American Cinema'', ''Invisi'BALL'', and ''Poodle It''. Her humorous depiction of a soccer championship in ''Invisi'BALL'' rose to international acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.korczak-festival.pl/2014/spektakle_zagraniczne_EN.php|title=International performances - Korczak Festival|website=www.korczak-festival.pl|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading the company to tours all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tyausa.org/nadine-animato-dance-company-assitej-world-congress/|title=Theatre for Young Audiences/USA   » Nadine Animato Dance Company @ ASSITEJ World Congress|website=tyausa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with this success, Bommer's teenage daughter Gaya Bommer-Yemini received prominence &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/gaya-bommers-cartoon-girl_n_1607211.html|title=Gaya Bommer's 'Cartoon Girl': Incredible Footage Of 'First Position' Dancer Gets A Second Life (VIDEO)|last=Rao|first=Mallika|date=2012-06-19|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the award-winning documentary ''[[First Position]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/movies/young-dancers-compete-in-the-documentary-first-position.html|title=Young Dancers Compete in the Documentary ‘First Position’|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=2012-05-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film featured Bommer's choreography as her daughter won many prizes while performing it around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/arts/dance/youth-america-grand-prix-at-city-center-review.html|title=Youth America Grand Prix at City Center - Review|last=Sulcas|first=Roslyn|date=2011-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to New York ==

In 2015 Bommer was invited to present work in New York City after an anonymous donor sponsored her relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/A-simple-twist-of-fate-455831|title=A simple twist of fate|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the company took on a cross-continental structure, working with dancers based in both NYC and Israel. In NYC, Bommer began working with a new group of dancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.israel21c.org/the-choreographer-who-turned-soccer-into-a-dance-form/|title=The choreographer who turned soccer into dance|work=Israel21c|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; teaching them the Nadine Bommer Method and mounting her international sensation ''Invisi'BALL'' for its the NYC premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A Stage Becomes a Stadium, and Genders Switch, in "Invisiball"|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/stage-becomes-stadium-and-genders-switch-invisiball/|language=en|accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After only a few months with this new company structure, Bommer began creating her newest work ''SEPIA''. The piece departs from Bommer's signature comedic tone, for a more dramatic work centered around powerfully evolving sea creature characters. ''SEPIA'' premiered at the [[Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater]] in 2016, and has since been presented in an immersive adaptation in NYC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boguszewski|first1=Theo|title=IMPRESSIONS: Nadine Bommer Dance Company's "SEPIA: The Aquarium Version" at the Bromley|url=https://www.dance-enthusiast.com/features/view/Impressions-Nadine-Bommer-Sepia-Aquarium-Bromley|website=Dance Enthusiast|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this work, the company continues to tour internationally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.safea.gov.cn/2015-08/03/content_21660786.htm|title=Family fun when human puppets run riot on stage|last=李齐|website=en.safea.gov.cn|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with repertory out of NYC and Israel, most recently visiting South Korea, Russia, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teatrium.ru/gavrosh/israel-2016/spectacles/futbol-gavrosh2016/|title=Футбол (ГАВРОШ-2016) - Спектакли - Театриум на Серпуховке|website=teatrium.ru|language=ru-RU|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Bommer has shared her work at [[Jacob's Pillow Dance|Jacob's Pillow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkshireonstage.com/2016/05/06/jacobs-pillow-dance-festival-readies-biggest-summer-yet-with-350-events-many-free/|title=Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival readies biggest Summer yet with 350 events, many Free|date=2016-05-06|website=BERKSHIRE ON STAGE|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at [[New Victory Theater|The New Victory Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/arts/dance/victory-dance-series-to-include-limon-and-camille-a-brown-troupes.html|title=Victory Dance Series to Include Limón and Camille A.

== Technique ==

Bommer's work as a choreographer and educator centers around her technique The Nadine Bommer Method. This improvisational method is inspired by the endless motion of the sea and split into two core principles: The Body (''Kinetica'') and The Character (''Animato'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nadine Bommer Dance Company|title=Gaya Bommer-Yemini; Kinetica Movement by Nadine Bommer|date=2015-09-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4Xvhvs5s8|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetica gives dancers a step-by-step process to create a uniquely personal movement language. It cultivates full control of fluid, malleable, and expansive movement using kinetic energy and internal listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadine Animato Dance Company @ ASSITEJ World Congress|url=http://tyausa.org/nadine-animato-dance-company-assitej-world-congress/|website=Theatre for Young Audiences USA|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bommer’s character work (Animato) this liquidity is used to develop a new, but equally expressive, physicality dependant upon the dancer’s belief in their transformation to a new being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bklyner.com/dance-performance-portrays-soccer-like-youve-never-seen-it-before-parkslopestoop/|title=Performance Portrays Soccer Like You've Never Seen It|last=Geis|first=Shannon|date=2015-06-23|work=BKLYNER|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterization in her choreographic work has ranged from soccer players to marionettes to inanimate objects like a lamp and more.

A third branch of the technique, ''Nevet'', brings this method to classical technique, focusing an inward attention to the structure of ballet. ''Nevet'' was the initial iteration of the method codified in 1994, and is still used as an anchoring entry point in the process of pairing the imagination and internal listening with the body. The full method is taught in Bommer's school, Nadine Bommer Dance Academy, as well as 15 dance schools across Israel including Kibbutzim College of Education Dance Theatre. The company also offers a training program for professional dancers in both NYC and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadine Bommer Dance Academy|url=http://embassies.gov.il/london/culture/IsraeliCulture/Education/Dance/Pages/Nadine-Bommer-Dance-Academy.aspx|website=Israeli Embassy|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repertoire ==

''Manimation'' (2007) - Manimation presents a cartoon depiction of comedic situations in a coffee shop. With music by Meredith Monk, the stage transforms into a colorful, Cartoon-like world, where a new experience of dance is created.

''American Cinema'' (2009) - American Cinema is a theatrical dance comedy exploring the nuances of cinematic experience through diverse characters in two parts. In part one marionettes react to a film through their operator's point of view. Later, in part two, people translate the puppets' responses into human reactions, offering a second depiction of the emotions brought out in the movie going experience.

''Invisi'BALL'' (2010) - Invisi’BALL transforms a cast of female dancers into two teams of ultra-competitive male soccer players. With popular chants and roaring crowds, this unique theater-dance piece illustrates a surprising, hilarious, and multi-cultural mash-up of the game from the moment the audience arrives at the theater. 
 
''Poodle It'' (2013) - The glory days of a barber shop come back to life in the memories of a Poodles Barber who has fallen from grace. On stage a mix of animal, inanimate and human characters, to tell his story in an innovative, humorous and fascinating dance theater work.

''SEPIA'' (2016) - Sepia is a 60-minute contemporary dance work depicting imaginatively evolved creatures who merge the past, present, and future with their powerful presence. Journeying through a world of their own creation, these creatures display a feminine strength, ability to change, and inherent danger through the signature Nadine Bommer movement language.

Other works: ''Shorties'', ''Field Trip''

== History ==

In 2011, the word " PARfessionals" was created by the company's founder. In 2012, PARfessionals decided to develop the first peer-based online [[Recovery coaching|recovery coach]] training program designed for those interested in mentoring individuals into and through long-term recovery from [[Dual diagnosis|co-occurring disorders]] and other [[addiction]]s and [[addictive behavior]]s.

In 2013, PARfessionals developed the first Peer Recovery/Addiction Recovery Coach Study Guide, a free Peer Recovery/Addiction Recovery Coach Curriculum Guide, a free Peer Recovery/Addiction Recovery Coach Practicum Guide and an online Peer Recovery/Addiction Recovery Coach Train the Trainers course. Additionally, PARfessionals' founder and several family members applied for an ACE college credit review with The American Council On Education and then to Distance Education Accreditation Council (DEAC) in August 2015. After being rejected by DEAC, the founder contacted Charter State Oak College who in November 2015 about their program being recognized for college credit under their college assessment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charter Oak State College: Connecticut College Assessment Program|url = https://www.charteroak.edu/prior-learning-assessment/ccap/index.cfm|accessdate = 2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PARfessionals designed a Peer Recovery Facilitator Development e-Course&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/parfessionals/parfessionals|title=PARfessionals Online Peer Recovery/Addictions Recovery Coach Train th…|website=www.slideshare.net|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to support the ongoing efforts of social service agencies, foundations, government agencies, and employers worldwide. This course would also work towards the development of community re-entry programs for inmates and workforce development skills for disadvantaged individuals such as ex-offenders, disabled individuals, low-income communities and minorities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parfessionals.org/uploads/2014/02/TTT-Brochure-06.pdf|title=Peer Recovery Train the Trainer Program|last=PARfessionals, LLC.|first=|date=2015|website=PARfessionals|publisher=|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in collaboration with post-secondary educators and coaching experts for a diverse population with an array of learning skills who may be teaching, employing or supporting those who may be inmates, ex-offenders, mental health consumers, recovering addicts and individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It provides adult-oriented learning strategies for a diverse group of individuals with different learning abilities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The online Peer Recovery Facilitator Development e-Course was officially approved in 2014, by the Association for Addiction Professionals, also known as NAADAC.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2014, PARfessionals developed the first free Peer Recovery Support Specialist/Addiction Recovery Coach classroom curriculum kits in addition to a home study course, a correctional correspondence course for inmates, research journal, universal Code of Ethics and an international certification board. Additionally, PARfessionals' founder created an in-house private virtual research institute, the '''Powell Leary Jacobs (PLJ) Multicultural Institute for Transformation Research in Addictions,''' to self-fund resources on [[Peer support|Peer Recovery]] and Prevention. It was internally closed in 2014.

From 2013-2014, PARfessionals and its parent organization, the SJM Family Foundation (which closed in January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/sosda/index.shtml|title=SOSDirect - An Online Business Service from the Office of the Secretary of State|website=www.sos.state.tx.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the Texas Secretary of State) provided seven scholarships&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pocketsense.com/college-grants-recovering-addicts-10030403.html|title=College Grants for Recovering Addicts|work=Pocket Sense|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for eligible candidates from the general public who were devoted to seeking training for [[Drug rehabilitation|addiction treatment]] and [[Peer support|peer recovery]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Academy of Health Care Providers in the Addictive Disorders|url = http://www.americanacademy.org/resources/ceopportunities.aspx|website = www.americanacademy.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelley-Hardison also established the International Certification Board of Recovery Professionals (ICBRP), the first ever, peer-run certification board created for [[Peer support specialist|peer recovery professionals]] in the world. The ICBRP's mission was to be an independent, informal ad-hoc advisory board that provides guidance and accountability for the National Certified Peer Recovery Professionals (NCPRP) credentialing program.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjmfamilyfoundation.org/|title=SJM Family Foundation|website=www.sjmfamilyfoundation.org|accessdate=2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later dissolved (through the Georgia Secretary of State in March 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch|title=Georgia Corporations Division|last=International Certification Board of Recovery Professionals, Inc.|first=Control #14075767|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), and merged into PARfessionals' private corporate structure. 

In Spring 2017, The PARfessionals' Cultural Intelligence in Addictions course supplemental student workbook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/cultural-intelligence-in-addictions-parfessionals-peer-navigator-campus-inc/1127970326|title=Cultural Intelligence in Addictions: PARfessionals' Peer Recovery Workforce Development Workbook|last=Noble|first=Barnes &amp;|website=Barnes &amp; Noble|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was included in the [[German National Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = German National Library|url = http://www.dnb.de/EN/Home/home_node.html|website = http://www.dnb.de/EN/Home/home_node.html|accessdate = 2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|August 2018}}, PARfessionals is a private product design and consulting firm doing business as PARfessionals Behavorial Health Research Development Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/|title=Arkansas Secretary of State|website=www.sos.arkansas.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The founder, Jorea Kelley-Hardison is a nationally certified psychiatric technician&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parfessionals.com|title=PARfessionals|website=www.parfessionals.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychtechs.org/|title=Home - AAPT - Certifying Psychiatric Technicians|website=psychtechs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;and social impact artist that has successfully worked with dozens of licensed professional clinicians and medical staff worldwide, including professionals from [[Harvard Medical School]] and the [[National Institute of Health]]. to create 45+ PARfessionals' branded resources, including Peer Recovery Practicum Guide, a Peer Recovery Pre-Certification Review e-Course. a Peer Recovery Supervision Training Course, and Peer Recovery classroom curriculum kits. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SJM Family Foundation|url = http://www.sjmfamilyfoundation.org/|website = www.sjmfamilyfoundation.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/226953473/Substance-Abuse-Treatment-The-Case-for-Providing-Job-Opportunities|title=Substance Abuse Treatment: The Case for Providing Job Opportunities {{!}} Recovery Approach {{!}} Substance Abuse|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anita_Barnes5|title=Anita M.

== The Definition of “Peer Recovery” ==
The term peer recovery can be first defined through PARfessionals as “the process of giving and receiving encouragement and assistance to achieve long-term recovery. Peers offer emotional support, share knowledge, teaches skills, provide practical assistance, and connect people with resources, opportunities, communities of support, and other people”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Peer Services Toolkit|last = Hendry|first = P.|publisher = ACMHA: The College for Behavioral Health Leadership and Optum|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 23|url = https://acmha.org/images/uploads/files/Peer_Services_Toolkit.pdf|last2 = Hill|first2 = T.|last3 = Rosenthal|first3 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association for Addiction Professionals&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; (NAADAC) provides a different definition of recovery. According to William White, MA, “recovery is the experience… through which individuals, families, and communities impacted by severe alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems utilize internal and external resources to voluntarily resolve these problems, heal the wounds inflicted by AOD related problems, actively manage their continued vulnerability to such problems, and develop a healthy, productive, and meaningful life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Addiction recovery: Its definition and conceptual boundaries|last = White|first = William|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment|doi = |pmid = |pages = 229–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Certification &amp; Reciprocity Consortium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IC&amp;RC - Home|url = http://internationalcredentialing.org/|website = internationalcredentialing.org|accessdate = 2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internationalcredentialing.org/creds/pr|title=IC&amp;RC - PR|website=www.internationalcredentialing.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IC&amp;RC) states that “peer recovery is experiencing rapid growth, whether it is provided by a peer recovery coach, peer recovery support specialist, peer navigator, patient navigators, public health learning navigators, behavorial health navigator or peer recovery mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.careersinpublichealth.net/careers/patient-navigator/|title=Patient Navigator {{!}} Careers In Public Health|website=www.careersinpublichealth.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://patientnavigator.com/patient-navigator-finds-the-care-and-services-that-clients-need/|title=Patient Navigator Finds the Care and Services that Clients Need {{!}} Patient Navigator|website=Patient Navigator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://recoveryoutcomes.org/navigators/|title=Navigators|work=Recovery Outcomes Institute|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://recoveryoutcomes.org/navigators/|title=Navigators|work=Recovery Outcomes Institute|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/What+patient+navigators/4305467/story.html|title=What are patient navigators?|last=Fayerman|first=,Pamela|work=www.vancouversun.com|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nursing.ok.gov/peer3.html|title=Oklahoma Board of Nursing Peer Assistance Program|last=|first=|date=|website=nursing.ok.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vacareers.va.gov/peer-to-peer/|title=Peer Support - VA Careers|website=www.vacareers.va.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seton.net/behavioral-health-care/contact/behavioral-health-navigators/|title=Behavioral Health Navigators {{!}} Behavioral Health Care|last=Family|first=Seton Healthcare|work=Behavioral Health Care|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Peer support services - advocating, mentoring, educating, and navigating systems – are becoming an important component in recovery oriented systems of care”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://internationalcredentialing.org/creds/pr|title = Peer Recovery (PR)|date = |accessdate = 2015|website = International Credentialing|publisher = |last = The International Certification &amp; Reciprocity Consortium (IC&amp;RC)|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=12 September 2018 |language=en |date=13 May 2013}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAMHSA states that:
{{block quote|Peer support services are delivered by individuals who have common life experiences with the people they are serving. People with mental and/or substance use disorders have a unique capacity to help each other based on a shared affiliation and a deep understanding of this experience. In self-help and mutual support, people offer this support, strength, and hope to their peers, which allows for personal growth, wellness promotion, and recovery.{{pb}}Research has shown that peer support facilitates recovery and reduces health care costs. Peers also provide assistance that promotes a sense of belonging within the community. The ability to contribute to and enjoy one’s community is key to recovery and well-being. Another critical component that peers provide is the development of self-efficacy through role modeling and assisting peers with ongoing recovery through mastery of experiences and finding meaning, purpose, and social connections in their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/recovery/peer-support-social-inclusion|title=Peer Support and Social Inclusion|last=ann.lynsen|date=2014-09-03|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Peer Recovery Navigator Academics Program and(Micro-Certification) Registry ==
In 2012, PARfessionals developed the first globally recognized online training program for peer recovery professionals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; {{as of|September 2015}}, PARfessionals offers an online distance learning pre-certification training course, a home study correspondence course and an inmate correspondence course for student-candidates to study at their own pace for global certification in peer recovery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Peer Recovery Workforce Development: Student-Candidate Handbook|last = PARfessionals, LLC.|first = |publisher = PARfessionals, LLC.|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is based on proven research in order to make it the most specialized and comprehensive training program for a new generation of Peer Recovery Professionals for a variety of settings. 

Students worldwide have completed the training and shared their '''satisfaction''' with PARfessionals training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.melissamorgantang.com/my-story#!|title=Melissa Morgan Tang {{!}} My Story|website=Melissa Morgan Tang {{!}} Life Coach|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/176041377|title=In Real Life: The Story of LaQuita " Lala" Bullock|website=Vimeo|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PARfessionals developed its own exam and credential, NCPRP, which stands for “National Certified Peer Recovery Professional”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisoneducation.com/prison-education-news/the-revolution-of-recovery-leadership|title=The Revolution of Recovery Leadership|last=TInsman|first=Anthony|date=2015|website=PrisonEducation.com|publisher=|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quizlet.com/86569458/ncprp-competency-review-flashcards/|title=NCPRP Competency Review Flashcards Flashcards {{!}} Quizlet|website=Quizlet|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCPRP credential and exam primarily emphasize the concept of [[peer support|peer recovery]], with the main purpose of providing guidance, knowledge or assistance, especially among those with similar experiences who can meet as equals. The certification was integrated into the academic program and renamed the PARfessionals' Peer Recovery Workforce Development Certification Program.

In Fall 2016, PARfessionals' founder worked with qualified and licensed clinicians to create and sponsor the world's first college level peer recovery training course and lifetime credential for the behavioral healthcare workforce, which was submitted and reviewed through the Connecticut Credit Assessment Program and The Consortium for the Assessment of College Equivalence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cacereviews.org/|title=CACE Reviews.org|website=www.cacereviews.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; of  Charter State College in Fall 2016.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thesjmgroup.com/peerrecoverycollegetraining/|title = SJM FAMILY PRESERVATION CAMPUS INC.|date = |accessdate = 2017|website = PARfessionals|publisher = PARfessionals|last = PARfessionals|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.charteroak.edu/prior-learning-assessment/ccap/|title=Connecticut Credit Assessment Program (CCAP)|website=Charter Oak State College|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;..

'''Roger Cruz''' (born '''Rogério da Cruz Kuroda''' on February 22, 1971, in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[comic book creator|comic book artist]].

== Biography ==
Cruz started his professional career as a [[letterer]] for [[Editora Abril]], the Brazilian publishing house, for whom he lettered many Portuguese translations of American comics; then worked as a writer and art assistant for ''Mil Perigos'', a short-lived black and white comics magazine.

When Art &amp; Comics Studio&lt;!-- which studio?--&gt; first introduced Brazilian artists to the American comic book market, he was given the opportunity to work as an artist for [[Marvel Comics]] on the titles ''[[Ghost Rider]]'', ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'', ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[X-Men Alpha]]'', ''[[X-Patrol]]'', ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'', ''[[X-Calibre]]'', ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', ''[[X-Man]]'', ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers: Timeslide]]'' and ''[[Silver Surfer]]''. He also worked for [[DC Comics]], where he provided art for one issue of the comic book ''[[Batman Chronicles]]''.

At the end 1990s Cruz took a break from working on comic books and returned to Brazil, where he became one of the founders and partners of an art studio/school in Brazil called ''Fábrica de Quadrinhos'' ("Comic Book Factory"). Cruz also worked as a storyboard designer for advertising agencies, a character designer for TV shows, and an art teacher, and gave a two-year course of lectures and workshops in universities.&lt;!-- which universities?--&gt;.

Still being a ''Fábrica de Quadrinhos'' partner, he returned to work for the American market, contributing to Marvel titles such as ''[[Darkness]]'', ''[[Ascension (comics)|Ascension]]'', ''[[X-Men]]'', ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', and ''[[Magneto: Dark Seduction]]''.

In 1999 Cruz gave up his projects in ''Fábrica de Quadrinhos'' and turned back to work exclusively with comics. In 2002, negotiated by Art &amp; Comics Studio, he illustrated issues of ''[[Wonder Woman]]''. Since 2004, he has been working for Marvel once again, as the artist on ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' and ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.

Cruz published more authoral works in Brazil, such as ''[[Xampu- Lovely Losers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devir.com.br/hqs/xampu_v01.php{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Cruz was a regular on the (now defunct) Genesis Comics "Swipe Of The Week" website around 1999.  The site placed two pieces of published work by two different artists side by side, and allowed the users to vote whether they were seeing an homage, a coincidence, or a [[swipe (comics)|direct copy]]. Primarily, Cruz's work was placed beside the previously printed work of [[Joe Madureira]],&lt;ref&gt;Cruz's ''[[X-Men: Alpha]]'' (February 1995), p. 30, vs. Madureira's ''[[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]]'' #3 (December 1994), p. 21; Cruz's ''[[Brigade (comics)|Brigade]]'' #17 (February 1995), p. 21, vs. Madureira's ''Vanguard'' #3 (December 1994), pp. 10, 11, and 20; Cruz's ''X-Men: Omega'' (June 1995), p. 7, vs. Madureira's ''Vanguard'' #3 (December 1994), p. 20; Cruz's ''[[X-Men: Omega]]'' (June 1995), p. 26, vs. Madureira's ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #312 (May 1994), p. 9; Cruz's ''X-Men: Omega'' (June 1995), p. 31, vs. Madureira's ''Vanguard'' #3 (December 1994), p. 22; and Cruz's ''Uncanny X-Men'' #324 (September 1995), p. 7; vs. Madureira's ''Vanguard'' #3 (December 1994), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[Jim Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Cruz's ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #89 (January 1995), p. 18, vs. Lee's ''Uncanny X-Men'' #276 (May 1991), p. 10; Cruz's ''Wolverine'' #89 (January 1995), p. 21, vs. Lee's ''X-Men'' vol. 2., #6 (March 1992), p. 21 and Lee's ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' #3 (December 1992), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz has acknowledged on his (now defunct) website that he learned to draw primarily by copying from other pencillers.

==History==
The Foundation of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences(SUMS) dates back to about 70 years ago when Shiraz Institute of Higher Health Education admitted a few medical students (1945). The High Institute of Health developed into Medical Faculty in 1946. The medical school is  located in central Shiraz, which was founded in 1946 as a college within [[Pahlavi University]].  In 1953, a Faculty of Nursing was added, followed by a Faculty of Dentistry in 1969.  After the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|Islamic Revolution]] overthrew the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], drastic changes were implemented at all universities.  The name of Pahlavi University was immediately changed to Shiraz University.  In 1986, the Iranian Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education took over the departments and faculties in the medical sciences and SUMS became an independent institution.

==Statistics==
Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), founded in 1946, is one of the oldest medical universities nationwide. Shiraz University of Medical Sciences was first established as the "Institute of Health for Higher Education". This institute was turned into the Faculty of Medicine in 1949.  "Nemazee Higher Institute for Nursing" and the School of Dentistry were founded in 1954 and 1970 respectively. Afterwards, other schools were shaped gradually.
All public higher educational schools in Shiraz (medical and non-medical) were initially under the auspices of Shiraz University – former "Pahlavi University". In 1986 education of medical sciences in Iran was taken over by the "Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education" with the purpose of utilizing national medical resources more desirably in addition to promoting healthcare as well as medical teaching and research. Consequently, all medical faculties and centers continued their activities under the new affiliation; "Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS)". Non-medical programs, however, are still offered under the supervision of Shiraz University.
Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS) is not only responsible for training students in medical areas, but also manages all public hospitals, clinics and healthcare centers in Fars Province in southern Iran. The private sector of health system in Fars is also under the surveillance of SUMS. 
The following feature SUMS:
17 Schools
63 Research centers
41 Public Hospitals (including 14 teaching hospitals)
6 Research Incubators
 
Over 900 faculty members and more than 25000 personnel are working at SUMS in different areas including health, treatment, research and education. Currently, over 9000 students are studying in a variety of academic disciplines at SUMS schools and research centers. Iranian students are recruited to SUMS through National Entrance Exam (Konkur), whereas non-Iranian international applicants who would like to apply to SUMS are required to apply online after going through our A-Z program list. At SUMS, we have been capable of providing an intellectual environment to educate top students and send them out to practice their skills all over the world.
 
SUMS displays a good deal of tradition as well as modernity, aiming at training students, utilizing high-quality education and research. Since its foundation, SUMS has been active as one of the largest and most reputable universities in Iran and the Middle East and an influential figure in the region, regarding the services it offers to the students as well as the patients.

The '''Sloan Fellows''' program is the world's first mid-career [[master's degree]] in [[general management]] and [[leadership]]. It was initially supported by a grant from [[Alfred P. Sloan]], the late CEO of [[General Motors]], to his alma mater, [[MIT]]. The program was established in 1930 in [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. later, it was expanded to other leading two business schools of the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], and the [[London Business School]]&amp;nbsp;(LBS). Considered to be the most prestigious management training program, it targets experienced managers who have demonstrated success either within organizations or independently as [[entrepreneur]]s.

==History==
The Sloan Fellows Program was created at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1930, by [[Alfred P. Sloan]], Chairman of [[General Motors]] from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship as a means of developing the "ideal manager".  The Sloan Fellows Program is the world's first management and leadership education program for mid-career experienced managers.

In the following decades, the program was expanded to include the Sloan Master's at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford Sloan Master's Program|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford GSB|title=The Sloan Program at 50|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0708/feature-sloan.html|publisher=Stanford GSB|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Sloan Master's at [[London Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Business School|title=Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy|url=http://www.london.edu/programmes/sloanmastersinleadershipandstrategy.html|publisher=London Business School|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1968 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Business School|title=Sloan 40th anniversary|url=http://www.london.edu/programmes/sloanmastersinleadershipandstrategy/sloan40.html?WT.mc_id=1863|publisher=London Business School|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2013 Stanford changed the name of its Sloan Fellows Program to Stanford MSx (Master of Science in Management for Experienced Leaders), though participants in the program remain Stanford Sloan Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford renames Sloan Master's Program - http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/headlines/redesigned-sloan-masters-curriculum-named-stanford-msx-program-experienced-leaders&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Sloan Fellows comprise a mix of company- and self-sponsored candidates. On all three schools, a significant degree of experience is required for admission. This is in keeping with Alfred P. Sloan's conviction that experienced managers would benefit best from the program. Alumni describe the program as "transformational", in keeping with the original vision of preparing successful managers for senior business leadership positions and increasingly, successful enterprise ventures.

The Sloan Fellows program runs full-time over the course of 12–14 months, depending on electives. [[London Business School]] and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT&amp;nbsp;Sloan]] offer an optional research project/thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/fellows/calendar-fulltime.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620131409/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/fellows/calendar-fulltime.php |date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan/ International Study Trip]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.edu/sloanfellowship/Programme%20details.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622050804/http://www.london.edu/sloanfellowship/Programme%20details.html |date=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program recognizes the importance of developing leadership as well as management competency in Sloan Fellows. As such, in addition to the standard MBA curriculum of management courses, the Sloan program contains a strong [[personal development|personal-development]] component designed to develop the leadership and strategic thinking capabilities of Sloan Fellows. The London Business School Sloan Masters is a specialised programme emphasising Strategy, Leadership and an intensive personal development provision.

==Admission==
Admission to [[Sloan Fellow]] Program is highly selective and goes through several steps of selection. In [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], the prospective applicant needs to first register interest in the program website and upload resume. A valid GMAT or GRE score is also required before submitting the application. After initial screening, a member of the admission committee calls the screened registered applicant  for 30 minutes discussion. Number of screened and interviewed by telephone prospective applicants will be invited to visit the program in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] for class visit, sit with current students and meet the program officers. After this stage, the applicant to submit a formal application. The received applications are again screened and the selected files will be moved to the interview stage. The invited candidates will have to participate in a formal admission interview, usually held in MIT Sloan campus, or globally in selected places. Following the interview, the decisions letters of admission or rejection will be sent to the applicants. This process is repeated three times for three rounds of application deadlines.

Following a successful shortlisting after applying, London Business School Sloan Fellows will have a personal interview with an alumnus or LBS representative.  There are four deadlines across the cycle. LBS  offers preliminary discussions,  CV reviews and class visits to support Sloan candidates’ research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11991">The '''St. John's University strike of 1966-1967''' was a [[strike action|strike]] by faculty at [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in [[New York City]] which began on January 4, 1966, and ended in June 1967. The strike began after 31 faculty members were dismissed in the fall of 1965 without due process, dismissals which some felt were a violation of the professors' [[academic freedom]]. The strike ended without any reinstatements, but led to the widespread unionization of public college faculty in the New York City area.

==Cause of the strike==
In the fall of 1965, 31 faculty members at St. John's University were dismissed without due process or any hearing. Both the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) and the [[United Federation of College Teachers]] (UFCT) claimed the university had violated the professors' academic freedom. St. John's, the two groups said, demanded that the faculty restrict their teaching to a narrow, dogmatic approach to [[Thomism]] and required faculty to submit all articles and books to the administration for clearance before seeking publication. The Rev. [[Joseph T. Cahill]], president of St. John's, said the teachers had used their classrooms for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref name="Strife"&gt;"Strife at St. John's," ''Time,'' December 31, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Currivan, "St. John's Hints Faculty Conduct Led to Ousters," ''New York Times,'' December 23, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the UFCT, [[Israel Kugler]], pushed for a more radical response to the dispute. The AAUP refused to engage in a strike, and largely withdrew from the dispute when faculty appeared to support Kugler.  Kugler called for a strike to begin in January 1966, and widened the dispute to include pay and benefits (faculty pay was the lowest of the 10 largest Catholic universities in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Strife" /&gt;

==The strike begins==
The strike at St. John's started on January 4, 1966. The union pushed for mediation and arbitration in December 1965, but the university refused to submit to either. Using tactics pioneered by [[Albert Shanker]] to win collective bargaining rights for New York City public school teachers, Kugler pushed for local and state government officials to get involved in the dispute. Only a minority of St. John's faculty walked out, forcing the university to close some but not a majority of classes.&lt;ref&gt;Currivan, "St. John's Strike on Jan. 3 Called By Teacher Union," ''New York Times,'' December 18, 1965; Currivan, "St. John's Gets Mediation Offer," ''New York Times,'' December 24, 1965; Currivan, "St. John's Bars Mediation By City," ''New York Times,'' December 28, 1965; Grutzner, "Mayor Offers Aid on St. Johns," ''New York Times,'' January 4, 1966; Currivan, "St. John's Opens Despite Its Strike," ''New York Times,'' January 5, 1966; Currivan, "St. John's Warns 25 Absentees to Return to Job or Face Action," ''New York Times,'' January 6, 1966; Dallos, "St. John's Calls Boycott Failure," ''New York Times,'' January 11, 1966; Gansberg, "St. John's Strike Closes Classes, But 2 Sides Disagree on Number," ''New York Times,'' February 15, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next two years, Kugler challenged the university's accreditation before the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] twice. But that body only warned the university and took no further action.&lt;ref&gt;Dallos, "St. John's to Keep Its Accreditation But Gets Warning," ''New York Times,'' May 1, 1966; Currivan, "St. John's Warned Its Accreditation May Be Revoked," ''New York Times,'' December 2, 1966; Currivan, "St. John's Retains Its Accreditation," ''New York Times,'' May 4, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

The union raised $250,000 from the [[Arbeter Ring (Workmen's Circle)|Workmen's Circle]] and other organizations to support the striking faculty. Kugler took professors' case to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and sought an individual audience with [[Pope Paul VI]], whose encyclicals on workers' rights were repeatedly cited by the union. But the pope refused him an audience.&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;"Featherman File," ''The Forward,'' March 27, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tactics were tried as well. Some faculty sued the university for fraud for including their names in the 1966 catalog of classes.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, "Faculty Strikers Suing St. John's," ''New York Times,'' June 2, 1966; Currivan, "$100,000 Sought in St. John's Case," ''New York Times,'' October 12, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Pickets went up at the spring 1966 commencement and the fall 1966 opening convocation.&lt;ref&gt;Dallos, "Teachers Protest at St. John's Commencement," ''New York Times,'' June 13, 1966; Currivan, "St. John's Reopening Today With Faculty Strikers Resuming Picket Line," ''New York Times,'' September 19, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The strike ends==
In the early spring of 1967, as the strike threatened to widen to other Catholic universities in the country and state legislators opened hearings on the labor dispute, the university agreed to arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, "Catholic U. Classes Stopped as Protest Spreads in Faculty," ''New York Times,'' April 21, 1967; Johnston, "Legislative Panel Will Investigate Sale by L.I.U. and Dismissals at St. John's," ''New York Times,'' October 10, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike ended in June 1967. The union did not win recognition at St. John's, and in 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.&lt;ref&gt;"New Impasse Stalls Plans to Arbitrate St. John's Dispute," ''New York Times,'' April 6, 1967; Gansberg, "St. John's Dispute to Be Arbitrated," ''New York Times,'' June 20, 1967; Malcolm, "Arbitrators Absolve St. John's of Teachers' Antiunion Charge," ''New York Times,'' January 28, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and outcomes==
Although the strike was a failure in that it did not win reinstatement for the faculty, the strike established the AFT as the pre-eminent union organizing American higher education faculty.&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; Kugler quickly turned the UFCT's attention to other colleges and universities in the New York City area. In the next few years, under his leadership the union organized locals at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (FIT), [[Nassau Community College]] and [[Westchester Community College]].&lt;ref name="Hevesi"&gt;Hevesi, "Israel Kugler, Union Official Who Led Strike at St. John’s, Dies at 90," ''New York Times,'' October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Kugler began pushing for the UFCT to organize the faculty at CUNY. Backed by the AFT and the newly formed (and politically powerful) [[United Federation of Teachers]], UFCT not only won an agreement for a union election but won the December 6, 1968, election in the face of a determined challenge from the AAUP. The union won a second election (this time for non-[[tenure]]d faculty) nine days later, and a signed contract nine months later.&lt;ref&gt;Polishook, "Collective Bargaining and the City University of New York," ''Journal of Higher Education,'' May 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farber, "City U. Election On Union Stalled," ''New York Times,'' May 12, 1968; Clarity, "Union Wins Vote of C.U. Faculty," ''New York Times,'' December 7, 1968; Hechinger, "City U. Faculty to Cast 2d Vote On Union to Represent 4,500," ''New York Times,'' December 16, 1968; Handler, "City U. and Untenured Teachers Reach Agreement on a Contract," ''New York Times,'' September 11, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Kugler merged the UFCT with its long-time rival, the [[Legislative Conference of the City University]]. The two groups formed a new organization affiliated with the AFT, the Professional Staff Congress (PSC). As of 2007, the PSC represented more than 20,000 faculty and staff members at CUNY.&lt;ref name="Hevesi" /&gt;

Kugler later wrote a well-regarded article about the strike, "The 1966 Strike at St. John's University: A Memoir," which was published in ''[[Labor's Heritage]]'' in 1997.

'''St. Monica's Senior High School''', popularly known at '''Munche''' (Monica's), is a girls' second-cycle institution in [[Mampong]] in the [[Ashanti Region]] of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Staff | date = 14 July 2011 | title = St. Monica's SHS Excels |url = http://thechronicle.com.gh/st-monica%E2%80%99s-shs-excels| work = [[The Ghanaian Chronicle]] |access-date = 10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The school can be located on the Kumasi-Mampong Highway.  It is {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} from [[Kumasi]] and lies on a hilly area thus the area is always cold. It is bounded on the north by the [[Ghana Highways Authority]], Mampong; on the south by the [[List of hospitals in the Ashanti Region|Mampong Municipal Hospital]]; on the east by Mampong Babies' Home; and on the west by the Ejura-Mampong Highway.

==History==
The school's history is traced to Rt Rev [[John Aglionby (bishop)|John Orfeur Aglionby]], the [[Anglican Diocese of Accra|Anglican Bishop of the Gold Coast]] whose missionary work birthed the Convent of Our Lady and Saint Monica.

In 1926, the bishop invited the sisters of the [[Order of the Holy Paraclete]] (England) to set up a school for girl-child education.

'''Tartu Karlova Gymnaasium''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: Tartu Karlova Gümnaasium; abbreviated as '''TKG''') is a [[secondary school]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. The school was founded in 1875 by Pauline Jürgens.

== History ==
Tartu Karlova Gymnasium is one of the oldest schools in Tartu. Its roots go back as far as 1875 when Pauline Jürgens II founded her own private school. The name and the address have changed during that time. Today's building at Lina 2 street was finished in 1925 and was known as the "Tartu City 7th Primary School".
In 1967 the new part of the school was built and with new specialised music and history classes. Since then the school has been a highschool. On 1 September 1995, the name of the school was changed to the "Tartu Karlova Gymnasium".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.karlova.tartu.ee/index.php?linkid=72&amp;lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the '''Welsh Language Commissioner''' ({{Lang-cy|Comisiynydd y Gymraeg}}) was created by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 on 1 April 2012 with the appointment of [[Meri Huws]] as Wales' first Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-15186747|title=Language board chief Meri Huws is Welsh commissioner|last=|first=|date=5 October 2011|work=|access-date=18 November 2016|via=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://languagecommissioners.org/members.php?id=9|title=About the Member - Meri Huws|last=|first=|date=|website=International Association of Language Commissioners|publisher=International Association of Language Commissioners|access-date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commissioner's work is politically independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Welsh Language Commissioner's main aim is to promote and facilitate the use of the [[Welsh language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.org/English/Commissioner/Pages/Aim.aspx
| title = Aim of the Welsh Language Commissioner
| work = 
| publisher = Gwefan Comisiynydd y Gymraeg

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and by imposing standards on organisations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This, in turn, will lead to the establishment of rights for Welsh speakers.

According to the Commissioner's [[website]], there are two principles that underpin the work of the Commissioner, namely,
* Welsh should not be treated less favourably than the [[English language]] in Wales
* People should be able to live their lives in Wales through the medium of Welsh if they so wish.

== The Commissioner's Role ==
The Commissioner may do anything she considers appropriate to:
* Promote the use of Welsh
* Facilitate the use of Welsh
* Work towards ensuring that Welsh is treated no less favourably than English.

This includes promoting opportunities to use Welsh and encourage best practice in the use of Welsh by people dealing with other persons, or providing services to other persons. Areas of her work also includes legal issues, preparing and publishing reports, research, educational activities and written recommendations to Ministers of the [[Government of Wales]]. She can also give advice to people.

==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in [[Bangor, Maine]]. His mother, Clara (née Hartley), was of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Protestant Irish]] ancestry, and his father, Reuben Cohen, was a [[Russian Jewish]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]]; the two owned the Bangor Rye Bread Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2008/05/12/mother_of_former_maine_senator_clara_cohen_dies/ |title=Mother of former Maine senator, Clara Cohen, dies |publisher=Boston.com |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2009-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725131922/http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2008/05/12/mother_of_former_maine_senator_clara_cohen_dies/ |archivedate=July 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17237962/ |title='Love in Black and White' explores race - Relationships|publisher=MSNBC|date=2007-02-20|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Bangor High School in 1958, Cohen attended [[Bowdoin College]], graduating ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1962.  While a student at Bowdoin, Cohen was initiated as a brother of the Kappa chapter of the [[Psi Upsilon]] Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Alumni|url=http://www.psiu.org/alum/distinguishedalumni.html|publisher=Psi Upsilon Fraternity|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in high school and college, Cohen was a [[basketball]] player and was named to the Maine all-state high school and college basketball team, and at Bowdoin was inducted into the New England All-Star Hall of Fame. Cohen attended [[law school]] at the [[Boston University School of Law]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree ''cum laude'' in 1965.

==Legal, academic, and early political career==
He became an assistant county attorney for [[Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot County]] (1968–1970). In 1968 he became an instructor at [[Husson College]] in Bangor, and later was an instructor in [[business administration]] at the [[University of Maine]] (1968–1972).

Cohen served as the vice president of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association (1970–1972) and as a member of the Bangor School Board (1971–1972). He became a [[fellow]] at the [[Kennedy School of Government|John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University]] in 1972, and in 1975 was named as one of the [[United States Junior Chamber|U.S. Jaycee's]] "ten outstanding young men".

Cohen was elected to the Bangor City Council (1969–1972) and served as Bangor Mayor in 1971-72.

==House of Representatives and Senate==
In the [[United States House election, 1972|1972 election]], Cohen won a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], representing [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]], succeeding [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[William Hathaway]], who was elected to the US Senate. Cohen defeated Democratic State Senator [[Elmer H. Violette]] of Van Buren.

[[File:Senator William Cohen (R-ME).jpg|thumb|left|Senator William Cohen early in his career]]
During his first term in Congress, Cohen became deeply involved in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigation. As a member of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], he was one of the first Republicans to break with his party, and voted for the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] of President [[Richard Nixon]]. During this time, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him one of "America's 200 Future Leaders".

After three terms in the House, Cohen was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978, defeating incumbent [[William Hathaway]] in his first bid for reelection.  Cohen was reelected in 1984 and 1990, serving a total of 18 years in the Senate (1979–1997). In 1990, he defeated Democrat [[Neil Rolde]]. Cohen developed a reputation as a moderate Republican with liberal views on social issues, and has been described as "a career-long maverick with a reputation for fashioning compromise out of discord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/stories/cohen120696.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com: Republican Cohen Equally at Home With Policy and Poesy|author=|date=|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/01/22/an-outsider-set-to-take-over-pentagon/070867aa-70a7-4ed3-bfdb-c1f162e9f507/|title=AN 'OUTSIDER' SET TO TAKE OVER PENTAGON|first=Dana|last=Priest|date=22 January 1997|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Cohen investigated the federal government's process for acquiring information technology, and his report, ''Computer Chaos: Billions Wasted Buying Federal Computer Systems'', generated much discussion. He chose not to run for another Senate term in 1996; [[Susan Collins]], who had worked for Cohen, was elected to succeed him. (Former Maine senator, [[Olympia Snowe]], had also worked for Cohen while he was in the House of Representatives.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/maine-senators-may-not-like-each-other-much-but-they-share-love-of-state-job/2011/05/03/AFGwpn0F_story.html|title=Maine senators may not like each other much, but they share love of state, job|first=Martha|last=Sherrill|date=5 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the Senate, Cohen served on both the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Governmental Affairs Committee]] (1979–1997) and was a member of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] 1983–1991 and again 1995–1997, serving as Vice Chairman from 1987-1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/cohen.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com:  Politics -- The Administration, William S. Cohen|author=|date=|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the drafting of several notable laws related to defense matters, including the [[Competition in Contracting Act]] (1984), the [[Chapter 30 (G.I. Bill of Rights)|Montgomery G.I. Bill Act]] (1984), the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] (1986), the Intelligence Oversight Reform Act (1991), the [[Federal Acquisition Reform Act]] (1996), the Nunn-Cohen Act Amendment creating the [[United States Special Operations Command]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/from-world-war-ii-to-nunn-cohen-socom-history-part-1/|title=From World War II to Nunn-Cohen - Defense Media Network|author=|date=|website=defensemedianetwork.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Information Technology Management Reform Act]], also known as the [[Clinger-Cohen Act]] (1996).

==Secretary of Defense==
Cohen was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the position of Secretary of Defense during Clinton's second term, from 1997 to 2001, an instance of a cabinet appointment that [[List of United States political appointments across party lines|crossed party lines]].

As Secretary of Defense Cohen played a large role in directing the United States military actions in [[Iraq]] and [[Kosovo]], including the dismissal of [[Wesley Clark]] from his post as the [[NATO]] [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander]]. Both [[Operation Desert Fox]] in Iraq and [[Operation Allied Force]] in Kosovo were launched just months after [[al-Qaeda]] carried out the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|United States embassy bombings]] in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], in 1998.

===Nomination and confirmation===
On December 5, 1996, President Clinton announced his selection of Cohen as secretary of defense. Cohen, a Republican about to retire from the United States Senate, was the "right person," Clinton said, to build on the achievements of [[William Perry]], "to secure the bipartisan support America's armed forces must have and clearly deserve." In responding to his nomination, Cohen said that during his congressional career he had supported a nonpartisan [[national security]] policy and commended the president for appointing a Republican to his cabinet.

[[File:Clinton and Cohen meeting at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cohen and President [[Bill Clinton]] at [[The Pentagon]], September 1997]]
During his confirmation hearings, Cohen said he thought on occasion he might differ with Clinton on specific national security issues. He implicitly criticized the Clinton administration for lacking a clear strategy for leaving [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and stated that he thought U.S. troops should definitely be out by mid-1998. He also asserted that he would resist further budget cuts, retain the two regional conflicts strategy, and support spending increases for advanced weapons, even if it necessitated further cuts in military personnel. Cohen questioned whether savings from [[Base Realignment and Closure|base closings]] and acquisition reform could provide enough money for procurement of new weapons and equipment that the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] thought necessary in the next few years. He supported the expansion of NATO and looked on the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] as the most serious problem the United States faced.
[[File:HowardCohen97.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cohen and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] at [[The Pentagon]], June 27, 1997]]
After [[Advice and consent|confirmation]] by a unanimous Senate vote, Cohen was sworn in as the 20th Secretary of Defense on January 24, 1997. He then settled into a schedule much fuller than he had followed in the Senate. Routinely he arrived at the Pentagon before 7 a.m., received an intelligence briefing, and then met with the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] ([[John Hamre]] 1997–2000, [[Rudy de Leon]] 2000–01) and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (Gen. [[Hugh Shelton]]). The rest of the day he devoted to policy and budget briefings, visits with foreign and other dignitaries, and to what he termed "ABC" meetings at the White House with [[Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Sandy Berger]] as well as President [[Bill Clinton]]. He also traveled abroad several times during his first months in office.

===Defense budget===
One of Cohen's first major duties was to present to [[United States Congress|Congress]] the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense budget, which had been prepared under Secretary Perry. Cohen requested a budget of $250.7 billion, which represented 3 percent of the nation's estimated gross domestic product for FY 1998. Cohen stressed three top budget priorities: people (recruiting and retaining skilled people through regular military pay raises, new construction or modernization of barracks, and programs for child care, family support, morale, welfare, and recreation), readiness (support for force readiness, training, exercises, maintenance, supplies, and other essential needs), and modernization (development and upgrading of weapon and supporting systems to guarantee the combat superiority of U.S. forces). This meant increasing the funds available for procurement of new systems, with the target set at $60 billion by FY2001.

When he presented the FY1998 budget, Cohen noted that he would involve himself with the [[Quadrennial Defense Review]] (QDR), which would focus on the challenges to U.S. security and the nation's military needs over the next decade or more. When the QDR became public in May 1997, it did not fundamentally alter the budget, structure, and doctrine of the military. Many defense experts thought it gave insufficient attention to new forms of warfare, such as terrorist attacks, electronic sabotage, and the use of chemical and biological agents. Cohen stated that the Pentagon would retain the "two regional wars" [[Scenario planning|scenario]] adopted after the end of the [[Cold War]]. He decided to scale back purchases of [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighters]], including the Air Force's [[F-22 Raptor]] and the Navy's [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], as well as Navy surface ships. The review included cutting another 61,700 active duty service members—15,000 in the [[United States Army|Army]], 26,900 in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], 18,000 in the [[United States Navy|Navy]], and 1,800 in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], as well as 54,000 reserve forces, mainly in the [[Army National Guard]], and some 80,000 civilians department-wide. Cohen also recommended two more rounds of base closings in 1999 and 2001. The Pentagon hoped to save $15 billion annually over the next few years to make possible the purchase of new equipment and weapon systems without a substantial budget increase above the current level of $250 billion.

===International relations and situations===
[[File:William Cohen and S. R. Nathan at the Istana, Singapore.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Cohen and [[Sellapan Ramanathan]]]]
[[File:U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen in South Korea, January 1998.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Cohen, General [[John H. Tilelli, Jr.]], Commander in Chief, United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/U.S. Forces]]

As he settled into office, Cohen faced the question of the expansion of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], which he supported, and its relationship to Russia. At a summit meeting between President Clinton and [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in March 1997, Yeltsin acknowledged the inevitability of broader NATO membership. Two months later he agreed, after negotiations with NATO officials, to sign an accord providing for a new permanent council, to include Russia, the NATO secretary general, and a representative of the other NATO nations, to function as a forum in which Russia could air a wide range of security issues that concerned that country. Formal signing of this agreement would pave the way for a July 1997 invitation from NATO to several nations, probably including [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and the [[Czech Republic]], to join the organization.

The proposed U.S. [[missile defense]] system received attention at the Helsinki summit, where Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to an interpretation of the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] allowing the United States to proceed with a limited missile defense system currently under development. Specifically, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to distinguish between a national missile defense system, aimed against strategic weapons, not allowed by the ABMT, and a theater missile defense system to guard against shorter range missile attacks. Some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic missile defenses. The Helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the United States and Russia, a matter high on Cohen's agenda. Yeltsin and Clinton agreed on the need for early Russian ratification of the [[START I|Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START II) and negotiation of [[START III]] to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations.

[[File:Yoshiro Mori meets William Cohen 2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Cohen (left) and Japanese Prime Minister [[Yoshiro Mori]] pose for photographers prior to their meeting at the [[Kantei]] building in Tokyo, Japan, on September 22, 2000.]]

The continuation, at least until mid-1998, of the existing peacekeeping mission involving U.S. forces in Bosnia and the possibility that other such missions would arise worried Cohen, who earlier had expressed reservations about such operations. Humanitarian efforts that did not involve peacekeeping, such as in [[Rwanda]] in the recent past, also seemed likely. Other persistent national security problems, including tension with [[Iraq]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] area, [[Libya]] in [[North Africa]], and [[North Korea]] in [[East Asia]], could flare up again, as could the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].

In preparing future budgets, the challenge would be to find the right mix between money for operation and maintenance accounts on the one hand and modernization procurement funds on the other, while facing the prospect of a flat DoD budget of about $250 billion annually for the next decade or so. A relatively new problem that could affect the DoD budget was [[vertical integration]] in the defense industry. It occurred on a large scale in the 1990s as mergers of major defense contractors created a few huge dominant companies, particularly in the [[aerospace]] industry. They were called vertical because they incorporated most of the elements of the production process, including parts and subcomponents. Cohen and other Pentagon leaders began to worry that vertical integration could reduce competition and in the long run increase the costs of what the Department of Defense had to buy.

===Social issues===
Finally, Cohen had to address social issues that engaged the widest public interest. These issues included the status and treatment of [[lesbian]]s and [[gay]]s in the military, the role of women in combat as well as in other jobs in the services, [[racism]], and [[sexual harassment]].

==Recent years==
[[Image:William Cohen and Janet Langhart 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Cohen and his wife, author [[Janet Langhart]], August 2006]]
After leaving the Pentagon in 2001, Cohen founded ''[[The Cohen Group]]'', a business consulting and lobbyist firm, with three Pentagon officials, Bob Tyrer, Jim Bodner, and H.K. Park. Cohen was presented with the [[Woodrow Wilson Awards|Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service]] by the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Woodrow Wilson Center]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] on March 7, 2002, in [[New York City]].

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials.

Cohen has written several books, including mysteries, poetry, and (with [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]]) an analysis of the [[Iran-contra affair]]. He is a Chairman Emeritus of the [[US-Taiwan Business Council]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an article entitled "From Public Life to Private Business" about Cohen's abrupt transition to the business of Washington lobbying within "weeks of leaving office."&lt;ref&gt;May 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It discussed the affairs of the Cohen Group in greater detail and while alleging no specific impropriety, took a generally negative view of the former Senator and Secretary of Defense.

On August 21, 2006, Cohen's novel, ''Dragon Fire'', was released. The plot revolves around a secretary of defense who contends with a potential [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] threat from a foreign country. In December 2006 he released a memoir with his wife, author [[Janet Langhart]], entitled ''Love in Black and White.'' It is a memoir about race, religion, and the love Langhart and Cohen share over similar life circumstances and backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701514.html ''Names &amp; Faces,''] Friday, August 18, 2006; p. C03.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 2006, Cohen appeared on [[The Daily Show]] to promote his novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-august-22-2006/william-cohen|title=The Daily Show with Trevor Noah|author=|date=|website=Comedy Central|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2006, Cohen was interviewed by [[Brian Kilmeade]] on [[Fox &amp; Friends First]], primarily to promote his new novel, but towards the end of the broadcast he said: "I think there should be a commitment to universal service. I think that only a few people are really committed to this war against terrorism.... We ought to have a real call to national service to commit ourselves to some form of public service...to put us on a war footing mentality."

On January 3, 2007, Cohen appeared on [[CNN]] to support [[John Shalikashvili]]'s [[op-ed]] in support of ending the policy known as '[[Don't ask, don't tell]]' saying, "The vast majority of service members are personally comfortable working and interacting with gays and lesbians, and there is only so long that Congress can ignore the evidence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/01/03/4 Ex-Defense Secretary Cohen rips "don't ask"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070105170850/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/01/03/4 |date=2007-01-05 }}, Gay.com, January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 United States presidential election]], Cohen joined many Republicans in breaking with party ranks to [[List of Republicans opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|oppose]] the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|candidacy]] of Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]].

'''Yehuda Shinar''' is a [[graphologist]], [[life coach]], and the owner and CEO of the [[Shinar Institute]], established in Israel in 1976. The institute's expertise is in analyzing and evaluating job candidates for managerial positions throughout the world.

In 1996, Shinar established [[Winning Enterprises Ltd]] after studying and investigating how some people seem to achieve a lot in their lives and others do not, especially in the sporting arena.  Shinar and his colleagues used this information to develop a strategy for winning, focusing on their way of thinking, decision making dynamic and their one on one strategies.

In the sporting world, Shinar has worked with Sir [[Clive Woodward]] of the [[England]] rugby team, helping them to win the [[Rugby World Cup]], [[Tony Falkner]] of [[Blackburn Rovers]], helping them to win the [[National Academy League]], and the [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] football club to help them qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] in 2004-2005.
  
Shinar is also involved in lecturing and fostering winning strategies to organizations within Israel and abroad, including the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], the [[Scottish Institute of Sport]], [[Capital Radio]] and [[Nat West]].
