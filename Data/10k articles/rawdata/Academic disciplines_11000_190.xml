The '''American Association of Individual Investors''' is a nonprofit organization with about 150,000 members&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=190|title=Forbes.com Best of the Web - AAII|author=Forbes.com|work=Forbes.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204094757/http://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=190 |archivedate=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose purpose is to educate individual investors regarding stock market portfolios, financial planning, and retirement accounts.&lt;ref name="AAII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaii.com/aboutaaii/|title=About AAII|author=James Cloonan, PhD|work=AAII Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AAII "assists individuals in becoming effective managers of their own assets through programs of education, information and research." &lt;ref name="BBB"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbb.org/chicago/business-reviews/professional-services-general/american-association-of-individual-investors-in-chicago-il-1911#products
|title=BBB Review of American Association of Individual Investors|author=Better Business Bureau|work=BBB.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization markets itself as an unbiased source of investment information because of its not-for-profit status.

The organization was founded in 1978 by James Cloonan, Ph.D. Over the last thirty years, AAII's members report "investment returns that are consistently higher than those of the stock market as a whole" &lt;ref name="AAII" /&gt; (using the [[S&amp;P 500]] as reference).  Since 2003, AAII has maintained two real portfolios—a [[shadow stock]] portfolio and a mutual fund portfolio – for education purposes.  These portfolios' returns and contents are available online and, the site reports, have outperformed the market considerably over the course of their existence.&lt;ref name="AAII Portfolio Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/|title=Introduction to Model Portfolios|author=AAII.com|work=AAII Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
AAII.com is the organization's main outlet for their educational materials.  While it does offer some completely free information, requiring no registration or membership dues, a large portion of the site requires free registration or membership.  AAII's best and premium content is made available only to members, who pay fees starting at $29 a year.  For this fee, they receive the ''AAII Journal'' (the organization's monthly ad-free magazine), access to the organization's model portfolios, techniques for screening stocks, free investment courses, and other benefits.&lt;ref name="JoinAAII_page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaii.com/benefits/joinaaii/|work=AAII Website|title=Join AAII|author=AAII.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For members interested in using their computers as an investment resource, AAII offers the ''Computerized Investing'' journal and [[microsite]] for an additional annual fee.&lt;ref name="JoinAAII_page" /&gt;

'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|date=2014-02-21|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780544363793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history.

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Blindsight''' is the ability of people who are [[Cortical blindness|cortically blind]] due to lesions in their [[striate cortex]], also known as primary [[visual cortex]] or V1, to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see.&lt;ref name="Visual perception and awareness"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Celesia G | year = 2010 | title = Visual perception and awareness: a modular system | url = | journal = Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 62–67 | doi = 10.1027/0269-8803/a000014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of studies on blindsight are conducted on patients who have the conscious blindness on only one side of their [[visual field]]. Following the destruction of the striate cortex, patients are asked to detect, localize, and discriminate amongst visual stimuli that are presented to their blind side, often in a forced-response or guessing situation, even though they do not consciously recognize the visual stimulus. Research shows that blind patients achieve a higher accuracy than would be expected from chance alone. ''Type 1 blindsight'' is the term given to this ability to guess—at levels significantly above chance—aspects of a visual stimulus (such as location or type of movement) without any conscious awareness of any stimuli. ''Type 2 blindsight'' occurs when patients claim to have a feeling that there has been a change within their blind area—e.g. movement—but that it was not a visual [[percept]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence |last=Weiskrantz |year=1997 |title=Consciousness Lost and Found: A Neuropsychological Exploration |isbn=0-19-852301-7 |authorlink=Lawrence Weiskrantz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blindsight challenges the common belief that perceptions must enter consciousness to affect our behavior; showing that our behavior can be guided by sensory information of which we have no conscious awareness.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Physiology of Behavior|last=Carlson|first=Neil|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-0-205-23981-8|edition=11th|location=University of Massachusetts, Amherst|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be thought of as a converse of the form of [[anosognosia]] known as [[Anton–Babinski syndrome]], in which there is full cortical blindness along with the [[confabulation]] of visual experience.

== History ==
We owe much of our current understanding of blindsight to early experiments on [[monkeys]]. One monkey in particular, Helen, could be considered the "star monkey in visual research" because she was the original blindsight subject. Helen was a [[macaque monkey]] that had been decorticated; specifically, her [[primary visual cortex]] (V1) was completely removed, blinding her. Nevertheless, under certain specific situations, Helen exhibited sighted behavior. Her [[pupils]] would dilate and she would [[blink]] at stimuli that threatened her eyes. Furthermore, under certain experimental conditions, she could detect a variety of visual stimuli, such as the presence and location of objects, as well as shape, pattern, orientation, motion, and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Humphrey N | year = 1970 | title = What the frog's eye tells the monkey's brain | url = | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Evolution | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 324–337 | doi=10.1159/000125480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Humphrey N|first=|date=|year=1974|title=Vision in a monkey without striate cortex: A case study|url=http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/1974helen.pdf|journal=Perception|volume=3|issue=|pages=241–255|doi=10.1068/p030241|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[A History of the Mind]]|last=Humphrey|first=Nicholas|date=1992|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=|isbn=9780671686444|location=New York|pages=|oclc=25915998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}} In many cases, she was able to navigate her environment and interact with objects as if she were sighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blindsight and the Nature of Consciousness|last=Holt|first=Jason|date=2003|publisher=Broadview Press|year=|isbn=978-1-55111-351-7|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=|oclc=50755257}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar phenomenon was also discovered in humans. Subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or [[stroke]]s reported partial or total blindness. In spite of this, when they were prompted they could "guess" with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects, much like the animal subjects, and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them. The subjects never developed any kind of confidence in their abilities. Even when told of their successes, they would not begin to spontaneously make "guesses" about objects, but instead still required prompting. Furthermore, blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing Red: A Study in Consciousness|last=Humphrey|first=Nicholas|date=2006|publisher=Belknap Press|year=|isbn=978-0-674-02179-2|series=Mind/brain/behavior initiative|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=234101445}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Describing blindsight ==

Patients with blindsight have damage to the visual system that allows perception (the [[visual cortex]] of the brain and some of the [[nerve fibers]] that bring information to it from the [[eyes]]) rather than the system that controls eye movements.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"/&gt; This phenomenon shows how, after the more complex visual system is damaged, people can use the latter visual system of their brains to guide hand movements towards an object even though they cannot see what they are reaching for.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"/&gt; Hence, visual information can control behavior without producing a [[conscious]] sensation. This ability of those with blindsight to "see" objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain; yet it suggests that only certain parts of the brain play a special role in consciousness.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"/&gt;

Blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features, such as edges and motion, but cannot gain a holistic visual percept. This suggests that perceptual awareness is [[modular]] and that—in sighted individuals—there is a "binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept", which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and [[visual agnosia]].&lt;ref name="Visual perception and awareness" /&gt; Therefore, object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain, working independently from one another. The modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the "hidden perception" experienced in blindsight patients. Research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders, sharp onset/offset times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alexander I. |author2=Cowey A. | year = 2010 | title = Edges, colour and awareness in blindsight | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 520–533 | doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; motion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ffytche|first=D.H.|last2=[[Semir Zeki|Zeki]]|first2=S.|date=2011|title=The primary visual cortex, and feedback to it, are not necessary for conscious vision|url=|journal=Brain|volume=134|pages=247–257|doi=10.1093/brain/awq305|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low [[spatial frequency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sahraiea A. |author2=Hibbardb P. |author3=Trevethana C. |author4=Ritchiea K. |author5=Weiskrantz L. | year = 2010 | title = Consciousness of the first order in blindsight | journal = PNAS | volume = 107 | issue = 49| pages = 21217–21222 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1015652107 | pmid=21078979 | pmc=3000284}}&lt;/ref&gt; contribute to, but are not strictly necessary for, an object's salience in blindsight.

== Cause ==

There are three theories for the explanation of blindsight. The first states that after damage to area V1, other branches of the [[optic nerve]] deliver visual information to the [[superior colliculus]] and several other areas, including parts of the [[cerebral cortex]]. In turn, these areas might then control the blindsight responses.

Another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person's visual cortex may be damaged, tiny islands of functioning tissue remain. These islands aren't large enough to provide conscious perception, but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biological Psychology|last=Kalat|first=James W.|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|year=|isbn=9780495603009|edition=10th|location=Belmont, California|pages=169–170|oclc=236316740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] before the information is projected to the visual cortex. In a normal subject, these signals are used to merge the information from the eyes into a three-dimensional representation (which includes the position and velocity of individual objects relative to the organism), extract a vergence signal to benefit the precision (previously auxiliary) optical system, and extract a focus control signal for the [[Lens (anatomy)|lenses]] of the eyes. The [[Stereoscopic acuity|stereoscopic]] information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, J. (2004) Processes in Biological Vision Section 7.4 {{cite web |url=http://neuronresearch.net/vision/pdf/7Dynamics.pdf/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221000725/http://neuronresearch.net/vision/pdf/7Dynamics.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months, although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2005|title=Blindsight in children: Does it exist and can it be used to help the child?

== Evidence in animals ==

In a 1995 experiment, researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also suffered from blindsight. To do this, they had the monkeys complete a task similar to the tasks commonly used on human patients with the disorder. The monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to differentiate between trials where either an object in their visual field or nothing was present when a tone is played. Since blindsight causes people to not see anything in their right visual field, if the monkeys registered blank trials, or trials in which no object was presented, the same as trials in which something appeared on the right, then they would have responded the same way as a human with blindsight.{{Clarify|reason=oddly worded sentence|date=January 2018}} The monkeys did indeed perform very similar to human participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowey|first=Alan|last2=Stoerig|first2=P.|date=|year=1995|title=Blindsight in monkeys|url=http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/cogsci/cowey.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=373|issue=6511|pages=247–249|doi=10.1038/373247a0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys too could be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there. To do this, researchers used another standard test for humans with the condition. The test was to the one he previously used; however, for this trial the object would only be presented in the deficit visual field and would move. Starting from the center of the deficit visual field, the object would either move up, down, or to the right. The monkeys performed identically to humans on the test, getting them right almost every time. This showed that the monkey's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field, and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoerig|first=P.|last2=Cowey|first2=A.|date=|year=1997|title=Blindsight in man and monkey|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/1200535.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAawwggGoBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGZMIIBlQIBADCCAY4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMh_4fZq8XDt_cmCpRAgEQgIIBX67F91PP6UrpLVf39aOjcE74R9MUEamX52n0llQGoKxq0azmx4RZn5gHJMzSt73mkGkycOHHMwU4lpQhklWj6ypynRUl6vgHD5EyJowvWhu7w-6x4nsTTZY9Iw8t4C1Ip6RyjT63EVCNGsQeI1SDVMSyDxDzFh6sEZrH1XCaau5Zb6mDP9cFnic02l41qw2JUr22M0h5bFndikPVjq1oT1O7d_xnENu5oUjFCpj6uLznJ6XMJ8YephckVmaOMZuwdzTqMKHcgX7xoAU8vJOlZkgaJvEb_atjPKBBm9tKr57CXVm6pnkcL1tQeDeeYZQVRkhxRbeGeb4y9uPoq3VfwvUoAPQrnBDbrtC68so1-ImR_Yw2bR4JSS4sGTtRVOVr6NG7uOLWDBojpF7oBqt8fQtxPrjAjcwyyRCn5DAQoIFdv-EsZgR96DyPWLg5gXP49NVSQKbVpH7lcIW4vzpspg|journal=Brain|volume=120|issue=3|pages=535–559|doi=10.1093/brain/120.3.535|pmid=9126063|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight, GY. GY's striate cortical region was damaged through [[Physical trauma|trauma]] at the age of eight, though for the most part he retained full functionality, GY was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field. By comparing brain scars of both GY and the monkeys he had worked with, as well as their test results, the researchers concluded that the effects of striate cortical damage are the same in both species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowey|first=Alan|last2=Alexander|first2=I.|last3=Stoerig|first3=P.|title=A blindsight conundrum: How to respond when there is no correct response|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=870–878|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.031|pmid=18201733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

[[Lawrence Weiskrantz]] and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field, some observers do better than chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence |last=Weiskrantz |year=1986 |title=Blindsight: A Case Study and Implications |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-852192-8 |oclc=21677307 |authorlink=Lawrence Weiskrantz}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2018}} This ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus (for example, whether an 'X' or 'O' has been presented in the blind field).

[[Electrophysiological]] evidence from the late 1970s has shown that there is no direct retinal input from [[S-cones]] to the [[superior colliculus]], implying that the perception of [[color]] information should be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Monasterio|first=F.

Patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time. The movement of facial muscles used in smiling and frowning were measured and reacted in ways that matched the kind of emotion in the unseen image. Therefore, the emotions were recognized without involving conscious sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamietto|first1=Marco|last2=de Gelder|first2=Beatrice|date=October 2010|title=Neural bases of the non-conscious perception of emotional signals|url=https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/79483/11098/Tamietto-deGelder-NRN.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=11|issue=10|pages=697-709|doi=10.1038/nrn2889|issn=1471-0048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area V1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field, even though she could not report the sizes of the objects.&lt;ref name="Whitwell2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2011|title=Grasping the non-conscious: preserved grip scaling to unseen objects for immediate but not delayed grasping following a unilateral lesion to primary visual cortex.|url=|journal=Vision Res.|volume=51|issue=8|pages=908–24|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.02.005|pmid=21324336|via=|doi-access=free|vauthors=Whitwell RL, Striemer CL, Nicolle DA, Goodale MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another patient with unilateral lesion of area V1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field.

A 2008 study had patient GY discriminate between whether or not a stimulus was presented and state the opposite direction of travel for that stimulus. That is to say, if the stimulus was traveling upward, he was to indicate it was moving downward, and if it was moving downward he was to indicate that it moved upward. GY was able to do this with incredible accuracy in his left visual field; however, he consistently stated the wrong direction of travel in his deficit visual field. This indicated that though GY was aware of the movement, he was not able to apply the rule as stated by the researchers to his observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Persaud|first=Navindra|last2=Cowey|first2=Alan|title=Blindsight is unlike normal conscious vision: Evidence from an exclusion task.|journal=Consciousness &amp; Cognition|year=2008|volume=17|issue=3|pages=1050–1056|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2007.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers applied the same type of tests that were used to study blindsight in animals to a patient referred to as DB. The normal techniques that were used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects. DB was given forced-choice tasks to complete instead. The results of DB's guesses showed that DB was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level, despite not being visually aware of this. DB themselves chalked up the accuracy of their guesses to be merely coincidental.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Blindsight|title=Blindsight|last=Weiskrantz|first=Lawrence|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information, even unconscious information, may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex.&lt;ref name="Stoerig"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoerig|first=Petra|date=|year=1996|title=Varieties of vision: from blind responses to conscious recognition|url=|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|volume=19|pages=401–406|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10051-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli that humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field, shape, orientation and movement.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz" /&gt; But, in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged.&lt;ref name="Stoerig" /&gt; Blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information. So even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information, other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz" /&gt; The same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex. If an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged, it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect, functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact.&lt;ref name="Stoerig" /&gt;

Alexander and Cowey investigated how contrasting brightness of stimuli affects blindsight patients' ability to discern movement. Prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz" /&gt; The subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field. Both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=I.|last2=Cowey|first2=A.|date=|year=2012|title=Isoluminant coloured stimuli are undetectable in blindsight even when they move|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iona_Alexander/publication/233976642_Isoluminant_coloured_stimuli_are_undetectable_in_blindsight_even_when_they_move/links/5774fe0408ae1b18a7df9e77.pdf|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=225|pages=147–152|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3355-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test the effect of brightness on the subject's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots. They would alter the contrast of the brightness of the dots compared to the white background in each different trial to see if the participants performed better or worse when there was a larger discrepancy in brightness or not.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt; Their procedure was to have the participants face the display for a period of time and ask them to tell the researchers when the dots were moving. The subjects focused on the display through two equal length time intervals. They would tell the researchers whether they thought the dots were moving during the first or the second time interval.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt;
 
When the contrast in brightness between the background and the dots was higher, both of the subjects could discern motion more accurately than they would have statistically by just guessing. However one of the subjects was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast, but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt; When the contrast was highest the subjects were able to tell whether or not the dots were moving with very high rates of accuracy. Even when the dots were white, but still of a different brightness from the background, the subjects could still determine if they were moving or not. But, regardless of the dots' color the subjects could not tell when they were in motion or not when the white background and the dots were of similar brightness.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt;

Kentridge, Heywood, and Weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness. They wanted to see if their subject—who exhibited blindsight in other studies&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt;—could react more quickly when his/her attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it. The researchers wanted to show that being conscious of a stimulus and paying attention to it was not the same thing.&lt;ref name="Kentridge et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kentridge|first=R. W.|last2=Heywood|first2=C.A.|last3=Weiskrantz|first3=L.|date=|year=2004|title=Spatial attention speeds discrimination without awareness in blindsight|url=http://bob.kentridge.info/PDFs/2004/KentridgeHeywoodWeiskrantz2004.pdf|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=42|pages=831–835|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.11.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test the relationship between attention and awareness, they had the participant try to determine where a target was and whether it was oriented horizontally or vertically on a computer screen.&lt;ref name="Kentridge et al" /&gt; The target line would appear at one of two different locations and would be oriented in one of two directions. Before the target would appear an arrow would become visible on the screen and sometimes it would point to the correct position of the target line and less frequently it would not, this arrow was the cue for the subject. The participant would press a key to indicate whether the line was horizontal or vertical, and could then also indicate to an observer whether or not he/she actually had a feeling that any object was there or not—even if they couldn't see anything. The participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target, even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field. The study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object.&lt;ref name="Kentridge et al" /&gt;

In 2003, a patient known as TN lost use of his primary visual cortex, area V1. He had two successive [[strokes]], which knocked out the region in both his [[Left hemisphere|left]] and [[right hemisphere]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. After his strokes, ordinary tests of TN's sight turned up nothing. He could not even detect large objects moving right in front of his eyes. Researchers eventually began to notice that TN exhibited signs of blindsight and in 2008 decided to test their theory. They took TN into a hallway and asked him to walk through it without using the cane he always carried after having the strokes. TN was not aware at the time, but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight. To the researchers' delight, he moved around every obstacle with ease, at one point even pressing himself up against the wall to squeeze past a trashcan placed in his way. After navigating through the hallway, TN reported that he was just walking the way he wanted to, not because he knew anything was there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=de Gelder B.|first=|author2=Tamietto M.|author3=van Boxtel G.|date=|year=2008|title=Intact navigation skills after bilateral loss of striate cortex|url=|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|issue=24|pages=R1128–R1129|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.002|pmid=19108766|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case study, a girl had brought her grandfather in to see a [[neuropsychologist]]. The girl's grandfather, Mr. J., had had a stroke which had left him completely blind apart from a tiny spot in the middle of his visual field. The neuropsychologist, Dr. M., performed an exercise with him. The doctor helped Mr. J. to a chair, had him sit down, and then asked to borrow his cane. The doctor then asked, "Mr. J., please look straight ahead. Keep looking that way, and don't move your eyes or turn your head. I know that you can see a little bit straight ahead of you, and I don't want you to use that piece of vision for what I'm going to ask you to do. Fine. Now, I'd like you to reach out with your right hand [and] point to what I'm holding." Mr. J. then replied, "But I don't see anything—I'm blind!" The doctor then said, "I know, but please try, anyway." Mr. J then shrugged and pointed, and was surprised when his finger encountered the end of the cane which the doctor was pointing toward him. After this, Mr. J. said that "it was just luck". The doctor then turned the cane around so that the handle side was pointing towards Mr. J. He then asked for Mr. J. to grab hold of the cane. Mr. J. reached out with an open hand and grabbed hold of the cane. After this, the doctor said, "Good. Now put your hand down, please." The doctor then rotated the cane 90 degrees, so that the handle was oriented vertically. The doctor then asked Mr. J. to reach for the cane again. Mr. J. did this, and he turned his wrist so that his hand matched the orientation of the handle. This case study shows that—although (on a conscious level) Mr. J. was completely unaware of any visual abilities that he may have had—he was able to orient his grabbing motions as if he had no visual impairments.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4" /&gt;

== Brain regions involved ==
{{Medref|section|reason=only final sentence appears to be inline referenced|date=August 2015}}Visual processing in the brain goes through a series of stages. Destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation. The area of blindness – known as a scotoma – is in the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up to the entire hemifield. Visual processing occurs in the brain in a hierarchical series of stages (with much [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] and feedback between areas). The route from the [[retina]] through V1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex, though it is by far the largest; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass V1. What is surprising is that activity in these extrastriate areas is apparently insufficient to support visual awareness in the absence of V1.

To put it in a more complex way, recent physiological findings suggest that [[visual processing]] takes place along several independent, parallel pathways. One system processes information about shape, one about color, and one about movement, location and spatial organization. This information moves through an area of the brain called the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], located in the [[thalamus]], and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex, area V1 (also known as the [[striate cortex]] because of its striped appearance). People with damage to V1 report no conscious vision, no visual imagery, and no visual images in their dreams. However, some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though this too is controversial, with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without V1 or projections relating to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ffytche|first=Dominic H.|last2=Zeki|first2=Semir|date=2011-01-01|title=The primary visual cortex, and feedback to it, are not necessary for conscious vision|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=134|issue=1|pages=247–257|doi=10.1093/brain/awq305|issn=0006-8950|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superior colliculus and prefrontal cortex also have a major role in awareness of a visual stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hall N. J.|first=|author2=Colby C. L.|date=|year=2009|title=Response to blue visual stimuli in the macaque superior colliculus|url=|journal=Society for Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=|pages=520–533|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lateral geniculate nucleus ===
{{Synthesis|section|talksection=Causation of blindsight|date=January 2014}}
[[Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions]] defines the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as "one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine (visual) cortex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=[[Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions]]|last=|first=|date=2009|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|others=Mosby, Inc.|year=|isbn=9780323049375|edition=8th|location=St. Louis, Missouri|pages=|oclc=226911727}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Magnocellular pathway|magnocellular system]] of the LGN is less affected by the removal of V1, which suggests that it is because of this system in the LGN that blindsight occurs.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmid F. Leopold|author2=Mrowka M.|author3=Turchi S.|author4=Saunders J.|author5=Wilke R.|author6=Peters M.|author7=Ye A.|year=2010|title=Blindsight Depends on the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus|journal=Nature|volume=466|issue=|pages=373–376|doi=10.1038/nature09179|pmc=2904843|pmid=20574422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LGN is made up of 6 layers, including layers 1 &amp; 2, which are part of the magnocellular layers. The cells in these layers behave like that of M-retinal ganglion cells, are most sensitive to movement of visual stimuli and have large centre-surround [[receptive fields]].&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/s2/chapter15.html|title=Chapter 15: Visual Processing: Cortical Pathways|last=Dragoi|first=Valentin|date=1997|work=Neuroscience Online|publisher=The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  M-retinal ganglion cells project to the magnocellular layers.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;

What is seen in the left and right visual field is taken in by each eye and brought back to the optic disc via the nerve fibres of the retina.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt; From the optic disc, visual information travels through the optic nerve and into the [[optic chiasm]]. Visual information then enters the optic tract and travels to four different areas of the brain including the LGN, [[superior colliculus]], [[pretectum]] of the mid brain, and suprachiasmatic nucleus of the [[hypothalamus]]. Most axons from the LGN will then travel to the primary visual cortex.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] was employed to conduct brain scans in normal, healthy human volunteers to attempt to demonstrate that visual motion can bypass V1, through a connection from the LGN to the human middle temporal complex.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gaglianese E. Pietrini|first=|author2=Costagli A.|author3=Bernardi M.|author4=Ricciardi G.|date=|year=2012|title=Evidence of Direct Influence Between the Thalamus and hMT+ independent of V1 in the Human Brain as Measured by fMRI [Abstract]|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/45585124/Evidence_of_a_direct_influence_between_t20160512-24408-1tlnc8y.pdf|journal=NeuroImage|volume=60|issue=2|pages=1440–1447|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.093|pmid=22300813|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings concluded that there was an indeed a connection of visual motion information that went directly from the LGN to the hMT+ bypassing V1 completely.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" /&gt; Evidence also suggests that, following a traumatic injury to V1, there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the LGN to the extrastriate visual areas.&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cowey A|year=2010|title=Visual System: How Does Blindsight Arise?|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~tony/vns/readings/cowey-2010.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=17|pages=1–3|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.07.014|pmid=20833309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extrastriate visual areas include parts of the [[occipital lobe]] that surround V1.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt; In non-human primates, these often include V2, V3, and V4.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;

In a study conducted in primates, after partial [[ablation]] of area V1, areas V2 and V3 were still excited by visual stimulus.&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu" /&gt; Other evidence suggests that "the LGN projections that survive V1 removal are relatively sparse in density, but are nevertheless widespread and probably encompass all extrastriate visual areas," including V2, V4, V5 and the inferotemporal cortex region.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz, L. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weiskrantz L|year=1996|title=Blindsight Revisited|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=6|issue=|pages=215–220|doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(96)80075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury to the primary visual cortex, including lesions and other trauma, leads to the loss of visual experience.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; However, the residual vision that is left cannot be attributed to V1. According to the study done by Schmid et al., "thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information". This information was found through experiments using fMRI during activation and inactivation of the LGN and the contribution the LGN has on visual experience in monkeys with a V1 lesion. Furthermore, once the LGN was inactivated, virtually all of the extrastriate areas of the brain no longer showed a response on the fMRI.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; The information leads to a qualitative assessment that included "scotoma stimulation, with the LGN intact had fMRI activation of ~20% of that under normal conditions".&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; This finding agrees with the information obtained from, and fMRI images of, patients with blindsight.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt;

These findings run parallel with the theory that the LGN is what actually houses this residual vision upon damage of the VI. Also from the same study &lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; patient GY presented with blindsight. After research, it was discovered that the LGN is less affected by a V1 injury as many neurons are still reacting to lower-visual field stimulation.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; All residual vision was lost, however, when there is injury to the LGN.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; This further supports the idea that when the LGN is preserved upon injury of V1, it is what encompasses the "sight" portion of blindsight.

The LGN plays a major role in blindsight.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz, L. 1996" /&gt; Although injury to V1 does create a loss of vision, the LGN is credited for the residual vision that remains, substantiating the word "sight" in blindsight. The LGN has the ability to bypass V1 and still communicate to the extrastriate areas of the brain, creating the response to visual stimuli that we see in blindsight patients.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz, L. 1996" /&gt; Using the proper techniques such as fMRI and other indirect methodologies, blindsight can be attributed to V1 damage and a functioning LGN.

Carbon-neutral fuels are used in Germany and Iceland for [[Power storage#Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel|distributed storage of renewable energy]], minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency, and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines. Such [[renewable fuels]] could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels, enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; A 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant has been built in Germany and it is being scaled up to 10 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft |date=May 5, 2010 |title=Storing green electricity as natural gas |publisher=''fraunhofer.de'' |url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/04/green-electricity-storage-gas.html |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons. They can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide, which can be captured from power plants or the air, and hydrogen, which is created by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy. The fuel, often referred to as [[electrofuel]], stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Richard |author2=Eisaman |title=Energy Storage Via Carbon-Neutral Fuels Made From Carbon dioxide, Water, and Renewable Energy |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=2011 |url=http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |accessdate=18 October 2012 |doi=10.1109/jproc.2011.2168369 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=440–460 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508220516/http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.359.8746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal can also be used to produce the hydrogen, but that would not be a carbon-neutral source. Carbon dioxide can be captured and buried, making fossil fuels carbon-neutral, although not renewable. Carbon capture from exhaust gas can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative. Other hydrocarbons can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide which could then be stored while the hydrogen is used for energy or fuel, which would also be carbon-neutral.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleiner |first=kurt |title=Carbon Neutral Fuel; a new approach |journal=The Globe and Mail |date=17 January 2009 |pages=F4 |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=303830&amp;sr=HLEAD(CARBON-NEUTRAL+FUEL)+and+date+is+January+17%2C+2009 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most energy-efficient fuel to produce is [[hydrogen]] gas,&lt;ref name ="ubaposition"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/377/publikationen/uba_position_powertoliquid_engl.pdf |title =Integration of Power to Gas/Power to Liquids into the ongoing transformation process |date = June 2016|accessdate = August 10, 2017 |page =12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and which requires the fewest process steps to produce.

Methanol can be made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water. The stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. [[Methane]] can be produced in a similar reaction. Special precautions against methane leaks are important since methane is nearly 100 times as potent as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in terms of [[Global warming potential]]. More energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce [[dimethyl ether]]. This fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature. It is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation. It is nontoxic, but must be stored under pressure.&lt;ref name=Olah&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olah |first=George |author2=Alain Geoppert |author3=G. K.

All synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C, and at pressures of 20 to 50 bar. [[Catalyst]]s are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel. Such reactions are exothermic and use about 3&amp;nbsp;mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved. They also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Sources of carbon for recycling ==
The most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is [[flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion]] where it can be obtained for about USD $7.50 per ton.&lt;ref name=MacDowell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name= Pennline2010/&gt; Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been seen as economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting.&lt;ref name=Musadi2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Musadi |first=M.R. |last2=Martin |first2=P. |last3=Garforth |first3=A. |last4=Mann |first4=R. |date=2011 |title=Carbon neutral gasoline re-synthesised from on-board sequestrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Chemical Engineering Transactions |volume=24 |pages=1525–30 |doi=10.3303/CET1124255 |url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/11/24/255.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since carbonic acid in seawater is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with atmospheric carbon dioxide, extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiMascio |first=Felice |last2=Willauer |first2=Heather D. |authorlink2=Heather Willauer |last3=Hardy |first3=Dennis R. |last4=Lewis |first4=M.

Proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce [[carbonate]]s. These can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas and regenerate the caustic chemical. This process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production. Adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel. This method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide. The plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules. This may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional [[biofuel]] because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon. Its main disadvantage is, as with conventional ethanol production, it competes with food production.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Renewable and nuclear energy costs ==

Nighttime [[wind power]] is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the [[load curve]] for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per [[kilowatt-hour]] in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; Typically, [[wholesale]] electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfuelist.com/ Electricity Price] ''NewFuelist.com'' (compare to [http://dotyenergy.com/Images/windprice-2010-W.jpg off-peak wind power price graph.]) Retrieved September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than [[petroleum]] fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last=Holte |first=Laura L. |last2=Doty |first2=Glenn N. |last3=McCree |first3=David L. |last4=Doty |first4=Judy M. |last5=Doty |first5=F.

In 2010, a team of process chemists led by [[Heather Willauer]] of the U.S. Navy, estimates that 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 gallons of [[jet fuel]] per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue.

== Greenhouse gas remediation ==
Carbon-neutral fuels can lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere. Capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; This approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50% if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants. Most [[coal power plant|coal]] and [[natural gas power plant]]s have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with [[carbon dioxide scrubber]]s for [[carbon capture]] to recycle flue exhaust or for [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiPietro |first=Phil |last2=Nichols |first2=Chris |last3=Marquis |first3=Michael |date=January 2011 |title=''Coal-Fired Power Plants in the United States: Examination of the Costs of Retrofitting with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Technology, Revision 3'' |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy |type=report NETL-402/102309 |docket=DOE contract DE-AC26-04NT41817 |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/energy-analyses/pubs/GIS_CCS_retrofit.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=House2011/&gt; Such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess [[economic impacts of climate change]] if it were not done, but also to pay for itself as global fuel [[economic demand|demand]] growth and [[peak oil]] shortages increase the price of [[petroleum]] and [[Fungibility|fungible]] [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name=Goeppert2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lackner2012/&gt;

Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly from the air or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment, and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt; Use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely, assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel. Using synthetic hydrocarbons to produce synthetic materials such as plastics could result in permanent sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

== Traditional fuels, methanol or ethanol ==
{{See also|Methanol economy}}

Some authorities have recommended producing [[methanol]] instead of traditional transportation fuels. It is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested. Methanol has a higher [[octane rating]] than gasoline but a lower [[energy density]], and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own. It may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers. Direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by Caltech's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity.&lt;ref name=Olah /&gt; It is possible to convert methanol into gasoline, jet fuel or other hydrocarbons, but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt; Methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels, requiring automobile modifications on the order of USD $100 each to use it.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinberg1995&gt;{{Cite report |last=Steinberg |first=Meyer |date=August 1995 |title=''The Carnol Process for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mitigation from Power Plants and the Transportation Sector |publisher=Department of Advanced Technology, Brookhaven National Laboratory |location=Upton, New York |type=informal report BNL–62110 |docket=(Prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-76CH00016) |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/100204-X2uZUC/webviewable/100204.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a method using [[carbon spikes]], [[copper nanoparticle]]s and nitrogen that converts carbon dioxide to [[ethanol]] was developed.&lt;ref name="CO2_to_ethanol" /&gt;

A '''coronal plane''' (also known as the '''frontal plane''') is any vertical plane that divides the body into [[ventral]] and [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] (belly and back) sections.

It is one of the three main [[Anatomical terms of location#Planes|planes]] of the body used to describe the location of body parts in relation to each other.axis

==Details==
The coronal plane is an example of a [[Anatomical terms of location#General usage|longitudinal plane]], because it is perpendicular to the transverse plane. For a human, the mid-coronal plane would transect a standing body into two halves (front and back, or anterior and posterior) in an imaginary line that cuts through both shoulders. The description of the coronal plane applies to most animals as well as humans even though humans walk upright and the various planes are usually shown in the vertical orientation.

The '''sternal plane''' (''planum sternale'') is a coronal plane which transects the front of the [[Human sternum|sternum]].&lt;ref name="titleDefinition: sternal plane from Online Medical Dictionary"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?sternal+plane |title=Definition: sternal plane from Online Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-17 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Latin corona (“garland, crown”), from Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnē, “garland, wreath”).

'''Dansaekhwa''' ({{lang-ko|단색화}}), also known as "Tansaekhwa" refers to a loose grouping of paintings that emerged in Korean painting starting in the mid-1970s, when a group of artists began to push paint, soak canvas, drag pencils, rip paper, and otherwise manipulate the materials of painting. Tansaekhwa means ‘monochrome painting’ in Korean and was used by the critic Lee Yil in 1980 to refer to a group of largely non-figurative paintings painted in neutral hues.  Promoted in Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris, Tansaekhwa grew to be the international face of contemporary Korean art and a cornerstone of contemporary Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kee|first1=Joan|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|date=2013|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0966350391|pages=384|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures associated with Tansaekhwa include: [[Cho Yong-ik]], Chung Chang-Sup, [[Chung Sanghwa|Chung Sang-Hwa]], Ha Chonghyun, Heu Hwang, Kim Guiline, Kwon Young-woo, [[Lee Dong-youb|Lee 
Dong Youb]], [[Lee Ufan]], [[Park Seo-bo|Park Seobo]], Suh Seung-Wong, and Yun Hyong-keun.

==History==
Lee Ufan had moved to Japan in 1956, where he established himself with the Mono-ha movement in the late 1960s. In the mid-1970s he introduced his Korean peers to the Tokyo art scene. “Five Korean Artists, Five Kinds of White,” a group show held at Tokyo Gallery in May 1975, is often credited as the first major presentation of the works that later became known as Tansaekhwa. The five featured artists were Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong Youb, Heu Hwang, Suh Seung-won and Park Seobo.

==Recent attention==
In 2013, the first extended scholarly discussion of Tansaekhwa, written by Joan Kee, was published by the University of Minnesota Press. It was a finalist for the annual College Art Association Charles Rufus Morey Prize for the most distinguished book in the history of art, the first book on any aspect of modern and contemporary Asian art to receive this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322211016/http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |archive-date=2016-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jenny Jungsil|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|journal=Journal of Korean Studies|date=2014|volume=38|pages=157–160|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/594914|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, a spate of survey shows in Korea and the United States triggered renewed critical and commercial interest in Dansaekhwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Degen|first1=Natasha|last2= Kim|first2=Kibum|year= 2015|title=The Koreans at the Top of the Art World |website=New Yorker |url= http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-koreans-at-the-top-of-the-art-world |access-date= 2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common misconceptions may lead potential owners to believe that deaf dogs may be more likely to have an unpleasant disposition, or that the condition implies other brain abnormalities. Many people have successfully raised and trained deaf animals. Teaching a deaf dog may present unusual challenges, but inventiveness can overcome many of them. 

For example, deaf dogs, when out on a walk, a laser pointer could be used to attract the animals attention.&lt;ref name=Wilkes1 /&gt;

'''Deterritorialization''' ({{lang-fr|déterritorialisation}}) is a [[concept]] created by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). The term "deterritorialization" first occurs in French [[psychoanalytic]] theory to refer, broadly, to the fluid, dissipated and schizophrenic nature of human subjectivity in contemporary capitalist cultures ([[Deleuze]] &amp; [[Guattari]] 1972).

Its most common use, however, has been in relation to the process of [[cultural globalization]]. Though there are different inflections involved, the general implication that [[globalization]] needs to be understood in cultural-spatial terms as much as in institutional or political-economic ones is common to all accounts&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. In this broad sense, deterritorialization has affinities with the idea of the "disembedding" of social relations in, for example, [[Anthony Giddens]]'s (1990) analysis of the globalizing properties of [[modernity]].

==Overview==
''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) distinguishes between  [[wikt:relative|relative]] and an [[wikt:absolute|absolute]] deterritorialization. Relative deterritorialization is always accompanied by reterritorialization, while positive absolute deterritorialization is more akin to the construction of a "[[plane of immanence]]", akin to [[Spinoza]]'s [[ontological]] constitution of the world.{{Ref|Negri}} There is also a negative sort of absolute deterritorialization, for example in the [[subjectivation]] process (''the face''). 

The function of deterritorialization is defined as "the movement by which one leaves a territory", also known as a "line of flight"&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;. Still, deterritorialization "constitutes and extends" the territory itself&lt;ref&gt;Papastergiadis, N., 2018. The turbulence of migration: Globalization, deterritorialization and hybridity. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In anthropology==
When referring to culture, anthropologists use the term '''deterritorialized''' to refer to a weakening of ties between culture and place. This means the removal of cultural subjects and objects from a certain location in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=Holy Ignorance:  When Religion and Culture Part Ways|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-932802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies that certain cultural aspects tend to transcend specific territorial boundaries in a world that consists of things fundamentally in motion.

==In the context of cultural globalization==
In the context of [[cultural globalization]], some{{Weasel inline|date=September 2016}} argue deterritorialization is a cultural feature developed by the "[[mediatization]], migration, and [[commodification]] which characterize globalized [[modernity]]". This implies that by people working towards closer involvement with the whole of the world, and works towards lessening the gap with one another, one may be widening the gap with what is physically close to them.

According to the works of [[Arjun Appadurai]], this cultural distancing from the locality, is intensified when people are able to expand and alter their imagination through the mediatization of alien cultural conditions, making this culture of remote origin one of a familiar material. This makes it difficult for a local entity to sustain and retain its own local cultural identity, which also affects the national identity of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, G. M. (2002). ''The deterritorialization of cultural heritage'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun. (1990). ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Appadurai's 1990 essay "Disjuncture and Difference": "Deterritorialization, in general, is one of the central forces of the modern world because it brings laboring populations in to the lower-class sectors and spaces of relatively wealthy societies, while sometimes creating exaggerated and intensified senses of criticism or attachment to politics in the home state. Deterritorialization, whether of Hindus, Sikhs, Palestinians, or Ukrainians, is now at the core of a variety of global [[fundamentalism]]s, including [[Islamic]] and [[Hindu]] fundamentalism. In the Hindu case, for example, it is clear that the overseas movement of Indians has been exploited by a variety of interests both within and outside India to create a complicated network of finances and religious identifications, by which the problem of cultural reproduction for Hindus abroad has become tied to the politics of Hindu fundamentalism at home.

At the same time, deterritorialization creates new markets for film companies, art impressions, and travel agencies, which thrive on the end of the deterritorialized population for contact with its homeland. Naturally, these invented homelands, which constitute the [[mediascape]]s of deterritorialized groups, can often become sufficiently fantastic and one-sided that they provide the material for new ideoscapes in which ethnic conflicts can begin to erupt."  (Appadurai 1990:11–12)

===Deterritorialization and reterritorialization===
Deterritorialization and [[reterritorialization]] exist simultaneously. In [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]]'s follow-up to [[Anti-Oedipus]], [[A Thousand Plateaus]], they distinguish between relative deterritorialization, which is always accompanied by reterritorialization, and absolute deterritorialization, which gives rise to a plane of immanence. In both forms of deterritorialization, however, the idea of physical territory remains just that, an idea and reference point.

Mediatization works as a preferential source of deterritorialization, while it becomes a catalyser of other sources of deterritorialization (migrations, tourism, vast shopping centres, and economical transformations). As [[Tomlinson]] points out,&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, J. (1999): Globalization and Culture, Chicago. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mediatization is absolutely omnipresent in everyday contemporary cultural experiences, it therefore appears as clearly decisive in deterritorialized cultural experience. The aforementioned experience implies opening up to the world and amplifying cultural horizons through the globalized mass media. This means that globalization transforms the relation between the places where we live and our cultural activities, experiences and identities. Paradoxically, deterritorialization also includes reterritorialized manifestations, which García Canclini defines as "certain relative, partial territorial relocalizations of old and new symbolic productions".&lt;ref&gt;García Canclini, N. (1990): Culturas híbridas: estrategias para entrar y salir de la modernidad, Mexico. Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes/Grijalbo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the concept of glocalization proposed by Robertson, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute both sides of the same coin of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, R. (1992): Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture, London. Sage. – (2000): "Globalización: tiempo-espacio y homogeneidad-heterogeneidad", Zona Abierta, 92/93, pp. 213-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Deterritorialization speaks of the loss of the "natural" relation between culture and the social and geographic territories, and describes a deep transformation of the link between our everyday cultural experiences and our configuration as preferably local beings. As [[Giddens]] argues, "the very tissue of spatial experience alters, conjoining proximity and distance in ways that have few close parallels in prior ages". Nevertheless, it is very important not to interpret the deterritorialization of localized cultural experiences as an impoverishment of cultural interaction, but as a transformation produced by the impact the growing cultural transnational connections have on the local realm, which means that deterritorialization generates a [[relativization]] and a transformation of local cultural experiences, whether it is from the local event itself or by the projection of symbolical shapes from the local event.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1990) The Consequences of Modernity, Cambridge. Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement===
Although the process of across-boundaries flow was imbalanced, it cannot be denied that it has profound influence on politics, economics, and culture from every dimension. Although there were imbalanced power presences in different nations, it is undeniable that people will gradually realize that in addition to their own lives around are mutually implicated in the distant shore, but also to reconcile the impact between their lives around and the distant side. That is, the flow process of beyond the boundaries not only the representatives of strengthening interdependence, but also representatives that they both have the cognitive of [[globalization]]. It formed an easily comprehensive characteristics about "superterritorial" and "transworld". In other words, the original divide in the territorial boundaries between them have lost some authority, what is the main phenomenon of deterritorialization.&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, Jan Aart. 2005. Globalization: A Critical Introduction. Basingstoke/New York: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, no matter from what angle to explore globalization, deterritorialization has been a general consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Larner, Wendy and William Walters. 2004. "Globalization as Governmentality," Alternatives. Vol.29, pp. 495-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "deterritorialization" may have different meanings. [[Tomlinson]] had pointed out that many scholars use the vocabulary of deterritorialization to explain the process of globalization, however, there are still some scholars who prefer the use of related words, such as "[[delocalization]]" or "[[Forced migration|displacement]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Tomlinson. 1999. Globalization and Culture. pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized different point in the use of different terms, but basically we can understand the meaning of these words that is to understand the transformation between local and cultures of the global modernity. In the text of Tomlinson, however, we found that he uses "deterritorialization" to explain the phenomenon instead of using "delocalization". But we can unearth that "deterritorialization" was more focused on liberating the people from the "local", is a process which no longer just only affected by neighborhood and familiar local, but also deeply influenced by the distant place.

As sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] indicated, the most immediate experience of global modernity, in fact, is we stay in our own familiar environment but feel the feeling of living in different places because of globalization. Say in other words, the local has hardly affected by the distance place, however, under the impact of globalization, distant events made its influence reach into your daily life in the environment, which is the concept of "displacement". Due to the space experiences which were combined with neighboring and distant in people's daily life, it can be said that globalization has fundamentally changed our concept of the space.

===Disjunctive relationships===
However, communication technology may act not only to fill the field of local cultural significance and identity which corroded by deterritorialization, but also to establish global cultural politics. Politics of deterritorialization and the displacement of [[sociological]] will lead the struggle between state and nation.  One important new feature of global cultural politics, tied to the [[disjunctive population|disjunctive]] relationships among the various landscapes which proposed by Appadurai, is that state and nation are at each other's throats, and the hyphen that links them is now less an icon of conjuncture than an index of disjuncture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14147">'''Digital infinity''' is a technical term in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Alternative formulations are "discrete infinity" and "the infinite use of finite means". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits—irreducible atomic sound elements—are combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. 

[[Image:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'']]{{quotation|'Language is, at its core, a system that is both digital and infinite.

Linguistics and Cognitive Science: Problems and Mysteries. in Asa Kasher (ed.), ''The Chomskyan Turn.'' Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 26-53, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|‘It remains for us to examine the spiritual element of speech ... this marvelous invention of composing from twenty-five or thirty sounds an infinite variety of words, which, although not having any resemblance in themselves to that which passes through our minds, nevertheless do not fail to reveal to others all of the secrets of the mind, and to make intelligible to others who cannot penetrate into the mind all that we conceive and all of the diverse movements of our souls.’|{{Citation|title=''[[Antoine Arnauld]] and Claude Lancelot''}}&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Arnauld and Claude Lancelot, 1975 (1660). ''The Port-Royal Grammar.'' The Hague: Mouton, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Noam Chomsky]] cites [[Galileo]] as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is "the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts". In his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogo]]'', Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's "most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper." This is the greatest of all human inventions, Galileo continues, comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo...&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky" /&gt;

== The computational theory of mind ==
'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's '[[universal grammar]]' mechanism, conceived as a computational [[Language module|module]] inserted somehow into ''Homo sapiens''{{'}} otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition—central to the so-called '[[cognitive revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s—is generally attributed to [[Alan Turing]], who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. The idea of a thinking machine had previously been considered absurd, having been famously dismissed by [[René Descartes]] as ''theoretically'' impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Descartes, 1985 [1637]. 'Discourse on the Method.' In ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes.'' Translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141. &lt;/ref&gt; Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it.&lt;ref name="Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made ''universal thinking machine''—known nowadays as a '[[Turing machine]]'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since—examined closely enough—its possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then ''functionally'' the machine may be considered 'digital':&lt;ref name="Turing"/&gt; {{quotation|'The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.' |{{Citation|title=''Alan Turing''}}&lt;ref name="Alan Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a ''binary'' digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the [[Media (communication)|medium]] used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it ''does'' matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of ''digital'' computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages.

Digital computation and communication operates, then, independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) ''information'' on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical ''medium''—light, sound, electricity or whatever—chosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied—in the human case at least—the existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. 

{{quotation|'Information and computation reside in patterns of data and in relations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them. When you telephone your mother in another city, the message stays the same as it goes from your lips to her ears even as it physically changes its form, from vibrating air, to electricity in a wire, to charges in silicon, to flickering light in a fibre optic cable, to electromagnetic waves, and then back again in reverse order. ... Likewise, a given programme can run on computers made of vacuum tubes, electromagnetic switches, transistors, integrated circuits, or well-trained pigeons, and it accomplishes the same things for the same reasons.

This insight, first expressed by the mathematician Alan Turing, the computer scientists Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky, and the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor, is now called the [[computational theory of mind]]. It is one of the great ideas in intellectual history, for it solves one of the puzzles that make up the 'mind-body problem', how to connect the ethereal world of meaning and intention, the stuff of our mental lives, with a physical hunk of matter like the brain. ... For millennia this has been a paradox. ... The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox.'|{{Citation|title=''Steven Pinker''}}&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, 1997. ''How the Mind Works.'' London: Allen Lane, Penguin, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==A digital apparatus==
Turing did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with "mind". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably [[Hilary Putnam]]) took what seemed to be the next logical step—arguing that the human mind ''itself'' is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental "modules" are best understood that way.

[[Noam Chomsky]] rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the ''natural'' mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly ''natural'' science.

[[Image:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|right|The human speech apparatus in sagittal section]]In the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, "digital infinity" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, "voicing" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position—and you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as '[[distinctive features]]' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath [[Roman Jakobson]]. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components—a set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. 

Chomsky's original work was in [[Morphophonology|morphophonemics]]. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach—now hugely successful—far beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist—[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]—to apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky—who got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle—hoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 64-127.&lt;/ref&gt; If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device?

This led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of '[[generative semantics]]'—the proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' '''(+)''' position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' '''(-)'''. The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives—irreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth—are genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. While this idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties—sparking controversies culminating in the so-called '[[linguistics wars]]'&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. A. 1993. ''The Linguistics Wars.'' New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—it attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of ''natural'' science. No part of the discipline—not even semantics—need be contaminated any longer by association with such 'un-scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.

The '''Doctor of Architecture''' (D Arch) degree program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/school-view/?record_id=20569&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture/accredited-programs&lt;/ref&gt; The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/info/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional  graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.

Currently, the only University in the United States offering a Doctor of Architecture degree is the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. The Doctorate of Architecture was first accredited by NAAB in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the University of Hawaii program is open to students who have completed high school, transfer students who have completed some college-level work, and students who have completed Baccalaureate or advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the degree requires 120 undergraduate credits and 90 graduate credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==

===Historical context===
The Elements is held to be the work founding a tradition of the study of music based on practice, which is, to understand music by study to the ear.  [[Musicology]] as a discipline achieved nascency with the systematic study undertaken in the work, which treated music independently of those prior studies which held it in a position of something purely and only in relation to an understanding of the ''[[Wikt:kosmos|kosmos]]''.  In-as-much, the Elements is the first and earliest work on music in the classical Greek tradition.   Earliest considerations arose within the [[Pythagorean school]] c.500 and thinking dwelled on the mathematical nature of harmonia. Aristotle, whose [[Peripatetic school]] Aristoxenus belonged to, addressed the subject in his work ''[[On the Soul]]''. Dewhitt thinks Aristoxenus treatment of the subject was essentially to attempt to describe and locate the elements of the soul, and provide mathematical proofs for these.   Aristoxenus is thought contrary to the position of the Pythagoreans, he favoured an intellectual treatment of the subject which Aristotle had set out in his work, 
which is the exercise of [[inductive logic]] with attention to [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name="C.H.

Aristoxenus is thought the first to consider music in this respect, as a separate subject, due to this work.&lt;ref&gt;Lilian Voudouri&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The work is a theoretical treatise concerned with [[harmony]] and harmonics, and thus pertains to a burgeoning theory of [[euphonics]].  The study of harmonics is especially concerned with treating melody in order to find its components (the Greek word for melody is μέλος).&lt;ref name="A.D. Barker"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVWcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Burnyeat+translation+Aristoxenus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oMNm22fkQa&amp;sig=syq1MR_GGSedkD7EdhZGmg5-tiU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ms5MVb6OCMXX7Qap2oMw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Burnyeat%20translation%20Aristoxenus&amp;f=false|author=A.D.

In the first sentence of the treatise Aristoxenus identifies Harmony as belonging under the general scope of the study of the science of [[Melody]]. Aristoxenus considers notes to fall along a continuum available to [[auditory perception]].  Aristoxenus identified the three tetrachords in the treatise as ''[[diatonic|diatonic'', the ''chromatic]]'', and the ''[[enharmonic]]''.&lt;ref name="M.C.

The general considered attitude of Aristoxenus was to attempt an empirical study based therefore upon observation.  In-as-much his writing contains criticisms of predecessing appreciations and attitudes, of the Pythagorean and ''harmonikoi'',  on the problems of sound percptable as music.&lt;ref name="R Katz, C Dahlhaus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Godwin"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WpnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT402&amp;dq=Aristoxenus+Elements+Harmony&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m2RHVdHVFYrxaveEgJgI&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristoxenus%20Elements%20Harmony&amp;f=false|author=J Godwin|title=The Harmony of the Spheres: The Pythagorean Tradition in Music|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |date=1 Nov 1992 |isbn=1620550962| accessdate=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" A.

(5) Tonoi (Modes) - including the relations between them

(6) Modulation

(7) Construction / Composition

===Discussion===
The term dynamis seems to have been originated by Aristoxenus. Dynamis (dynameis) are conventionally understood to have, amongst other meanings, power and  potentiality. Sidoli contends in his review (c.f. ref.) that the initial use of  the concept by Aristoxenus was rather "elusive" in the context of the meaning intended by him.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Nis Ostenfeld, Plato (''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]] - Ergon and dynamis'')- [https://books.google.com/books?id=bqu1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT268&amp;lpg=PT268&amp;dq=dynameis++definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CsatTOqI2j&amp;sig=EhRILpHCIH_axMFxAbG02BXA2xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IcdMVeb4PMqX7QbTmoCoAQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dynameis%20%20definition&amp;f=false Forms, Matter and Mind] ''Volume 10 of Martinus Nijhoff philosophy library'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1982 {{ISBN|940097681X}} [Retrieved 2015-05-08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;definitions taken from [http://biblehub.com/greek/1411.htm bible hub] - [[Strong's Concordance]] &amp; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dynamis Merriam-Webster] [Retrieved 2015-05-08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan Sidoli, Andrew Barker"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-10-38.html|author=Nathan Sidoli, Andrew Barker |title=Andrew Barker, The Science of Harmonics in Classical Greece reviewed by Nathan Sidoli, Waseda University|publisher=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2009.10.38| accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exoticism''' (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions, and drew inspiration from them. This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticization'.

==History of exoticism==

First stimulated by Eastern trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, interest in non-western (particularly "Oriental", i.e. Middle Eastern or Asian) art by Europeans became more and more popular following [[European colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oshinsky|first=Sara J.|title=Exoticism in the Decorative Arts|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/exot/hd_exot.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences of Exoticism can be seen through numerous genres of this period, notably in music, painting, and decorative art. In music, exoticism is a genre in which the rhythms, melodies, or instrumentation are designed to evoke the atmosphere of far-off lands or ancient times (e.g. [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' and ''Tzigane for Violin and Orchestra'',  [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] ''Syrinx for Flute Solo'' or [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov's]] ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''). Like orientalist subjects in 19th-century painting, exoticism in the decorative arts and interior decoration was associated with fantasies of opulence.

Exoticism, by one definition, is "the charm of the unfamiliar". Scholar [[Alden Jones]] defines exoticism in art and literature as the representation of one culture for consumption by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article08060708.aspx|title=This Is Not a Cruise|author=Alden Jones|date=August 6, 2007|publisher=The Smart Set}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Segalen's important "Essay on Exoticism" reveals Exoticism as born of the age of imperialism, possessing both aesthetic and ontological value, while using it to uncover a significant cultural "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segalen|first=Victor|title=Essay on Exoticism: An Aesthetics of Diversity|year=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important and archetypical exoticist is the artist and writer [[Paul Gauguin]], whose visual representations of [[Tahiti]]an people and landscapes were targeted at a French audience. While exoticism is closely linked to [[Orientalism]], it is not a movement necessarily associated with a particular time period or culture. Exoticism may take the form of [[primitivism]], [[ethnocentrism]], or humanism.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. The revival of ancient Greek and Roman art left behind the Academy’s emphasis on naturalism, and incorporated a new found idealism not seen since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Robert|title=Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society|journal=Art Journal|year=1990|volume=49|issue=1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As classicism progressed, Ingres identified a newfound idealism and exoticism in his work. The Grand Odalisque, finished in 1814, was created to arouse the male view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Karen|title=The Spectatorship of the Affiche Illustrée and the Modern City of Paris, 1880-1900|journal=Journal of Design History|year=2012|volume=25|issue=1|page=24|doi=10.1093/jdh/epr044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of the exotic figure furthers Ingres’ use of symmetry and line by enabling the eye to cohesively move across the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth-Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ingres’ intention was to make the woman beautiful in his work, his model was a courtesan, which arouse debate.

Édouard Manet’s [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], finished in 1863, was based on Titian’s Venus of Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympia was a popular play about a courtesan called Olympia. This subject was extremely controversial for an artist to portray a woman like this because of traditional vision of the Academy.  Manet was being very different from the accepted academic style by outlining and flattening space that created a distortion of classical elements. Olympia is provocative in her nudity that implies she is naked, not nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is looking out in a very confrontational way, and setting the viewer as a man coming to the prostitute, although Olympia’s hand suggests she is not ready to engage with the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The African servant calls on racism and slavery in France, because showing someone of color participating in French life was unheard of, furthering the work's exotic nature.

The '''French Institute of Petroleum''' (in [[French (language)|French]]: '''''Institut français du pétrole, IFP''''') is a public research organisation in [[France]] founded in 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=French Institute of Petroleum (IFP)|url=http://www.zeroco2.no/projects/developers/french-institute-of-petroleum|journal=http://www.zeroco2.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Institute of Oil, Fuels and Lubricants''' (''Institut du pétrole, des carburants et des lubrifiants'').

The Institute is based at [[Rueil-Malmaison]] near [[Paris]], and has sites near [[Lyon]] and at [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]].  {{As of|2004}}, it had 1729 employees, a budget of 253 million euros, and was responsible for a post-graduate training centre, [[IFP School]] (also known as the '''''École du pétrole et des moteurs'''''), and an extensive industrial training programme, IFP Training.

IFP has designed several methods to assess the oil potential of a sedimentary rock, amongst others, the Rock-Eval technique using a standardized [[pyrolysis]] apparatus. This technique is used worldwide amongst petroleum companies to compare their results in the same way.

'''Hack Reactor''' is a [[software engineering]] [[Coding Bootcamp]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/schools/hack-reactor|title=Course Report: Hack Reactor|date=2016|website=Course Report|quote=Founded in 2012, Hack Reactor is a 12-week immersive coding school in San Francisco providing software engineering education, career placement services, and a lifelong network of professional peers.|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; education program founded in [[San Francisco]] by Anthony Phillips, Shawn Drost, Marcus Phillips, and Douglas Calhoun in 2012.&lt;ref name=TGM150411&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Alicia|title=Hack Reactor seeks to bridge the technology divide|url=http://techgenmag.com/2015/04/11/hack-reactor-seeks-to-bridge-the-technology-divide/|accessdate=2 July 2015|work=Tech Generation Magazine|date=11 April 2015|location=Long Beach, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their coding bootcamp is currently offered in 12-week Full-Time and 9-month Part-Time formats, in-person in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and Austin, as well as remotely, live online.

Cofounder Drost has described the program as, "optimized for people who want to be software engineers as their main, day-to-day work. Their life's work."&lt;ref name=Downs131013/&gt; The curriculum focuses on [[JavaScript]] and associated technologies including the MEAN stack, React and Backbone.&lt;ref name="BI130614"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hot-education-startups-2013-6?op=1|title=12 New Companies That Will Make Going To College Unnecessary|date=14 June 2013|work=[[Business Insider]]|last1=Russell|first1=Kyle|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techbeacon.com/complete-guide-top-24-coding-bootcamps|title=Complete Guide to the top 24 Coding Bootcamps|website=TechBeacon|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Hack Reactor acquired Austin-based [[MakerSquare]] as "their first deal in a plan to develop a network of coding bootcamps" in an effort to "make a large dent in transforming the old education system into one that focuses on student outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Kira M.|title=Coding Bootcamp Hack Reactor Acquires MakerSquare|url=http://tech.co/coding-bootcamp-hack-reactor-acquires-makersquare-2015-01|website=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, a pair of Hack Reactor alumni partnered with the company to open Telegraph Academy "to teach software engineering to under-represented minorities" and create a "growing community of diverse software engineers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraphacademy.com/|title=Telegraph Academy the Leading Coding School for People of Color.|website=Telegraph Academy|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dugdale|first1=Emily|title=Berkeley coding school aims to help close tech race gap|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/06/22/berkeley-coding-school-telegraph-academy-launches-aimed-at-people-of-color/|website=Berkeleyside|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Hack Reactor rebranded all of its schools to share the Hack Reactor name.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc-7.com/story/33548858/hack-reactor-unifies-its-network-of-coding-schools-under-flagship-brand|title=Hack Reactor Unifies Its Network of Coding Schools under Flagship Brand|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissions process ==
Hack Reactor's admissions standard has been described as "highly selective, only accepting ten to fifteen percent of applicants for each cohort."&lt;ref name="TGM150411" /&gt; Though many applicants who do not pass the first admission interview are encouraged to try again when they feel they are better prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Did-Hack-Reactor-become-a-group-full-of-elitists#ans13162184|title=Did Hack Reactor become a group full of elitists?|last1=Pethiyagoda|first1=Ruan|date=9 June 2015|website=Quora|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Hack Reactor has two admissions paths. Students can either self-study and pass a technical interview or join their Structured Study Program, a live class which includes preparation, readiness assessment and admittance.

The technical interview tests both technical skills (JavaScript basics such as objects, arrays, functions and the ability to solve basic coding problems using JavaScript) and soft skills, such as the student’s willingness and ability to learn.

Hack Reactor has created financial partnerships with SkillsFund and Climb Credit and to assist students with paying tuition.&lt;ref name="hackreactor.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hackreactor.com/questions|title=FAQ|website=Coding Bootcamp in San Francisco. JavaScript focused programming school.|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[WeFinance]] and Reactor Core (Hack Reactor's parent company) have launched a platform that allows anyone to lend to incoming students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wefinance.co/group/reactor_core|title=Lend to the Reactor Core Family|website=www.wefinance.co|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course Structure ==
Accepted students are assigned pre-course work, which takes "at least 50-80 hours" and is due prior to the start of their cohort.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hack Reactor’s course is offered in 12-week full-time and 9-month part-time formats. During the first half of the program, students work in pairs on two-day “sprints.” Pair and group work helps teach communication and collaboration skills. During this part of the course, the day typically starts with a “toy problem,” which is a programming challenge designed to illustrate core concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerpoweruser.com/article/19555/qa-with-phillip-alexander|title=Q&amp;A with Phillip Alexander|last=|first=|date=2016-12-28|website=Computer Power User|publisher=Computer Power User|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by a lecture in which the instructor frequently checks in with students to assess how well they understand the material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The JavaScript tools and technologies taught at Hack Reactor include [[AngularJS|Angular]], [[Node.js|Node]], [[MongoDB]], [[Express.js|Express]], [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], [[Backbone.js|Backbone]] and [[ECMAScript|ES6]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/hack-reactor-vs-makersquare-your-ultimate-guide|title=Hack Reactor vs MakerSquare: Your Ultimate Guide|website=www.coursereport.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this part of the course is for students to become “autonomous learners and programmers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/schools/hack-reactor#/news/instructor-spotlight-fred-zirdung-of-hack-reactor|title=Hack Reactor Reviews {{!}} Course Report|website=www.coursereport.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the course focuses on projects. Students complete “increasingly elaborate” coding projects of their own design, using whatever languages and frameworks they choose. Students often adopt technologies not taught in the course using “fundamentals and self-teaching methods” taught in the first half of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techbeacon.com/complete-guide-top-24-coding-bootcamps|title=Complete guide to the top 24 coding bootcamps|website=TechBeacon|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Outcomes ==
Co-Founder Shawn Drost says that Hack Reactor is "committed to being the leading coding immersive in terms of quality, student experience and student outcomes." In 2017, they joined a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization called the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR) as a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/hack-reactor-cirr-outcomes-reporting|title=CIRR Raises the Bar in Student Outcomes Reporting|work=Hack Reactor|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRR requires members to report "the outcomes of every enrolled student must be reported in a single, simple, clear report" using common standards and follow "CIRR Truth in Advertising policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cirr.org/standards|title=High standards and a commitment to transparency and accountability. - Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR)|website=cirr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hack Reactor Remote ==
In July 2014, Hack Reactor launched an online program, Hack Reactor Remote. This program has the same curriculum, course structure and teaching method as Hack Reactor’s onsite program. Students attend and participate in the lectures at the same time as the other students, work on the same assignments, and benefit from the same job search and placement resources as the onsite program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/16/hack-reactor-is-launching-an-online-coding-bootcamp-but-you-still-need-to-quit-life-to-do-it/|title=Hack Reactor is launching an online coding bootcamp, but you still need to quit life to do it|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack Reactor's Remote program has comparable student outcomes to its in-person campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/outcomes|title=Student Outcomes &amp; Graduate Performance|website=Hack Reactor|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Hack Reactor began offering a part-time version of their remote program, known as Hack Reactor Remote Part-Time.

== MakerSquare Acquisition ==
In January 2015, Hack Reactor acquired coding bootcamp MakerSquare, which had locations in Austin and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/coding-bootcamp-boom-continues-hack-reactor-buy/|title=Hack Reactor Expands Its Code Bootcamps by Acquiring a Rival|website=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; MakerSquare has since expanded into Los Angeles and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-makersquare-los-angeles-20150408-story.html|title=MakerSquare to open L.A. campus to train software engineers|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/makersquare-school-of-software-engineering-launches-new-york-city-campus-300233910.html|title=MakerSquare School of Software Engineering Launches New York City Campus|last=|first=|date=10 March 2016|website=PR Newswire|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MakerSquare has the same admissions process, hiring partner network, and the same curriculum with a few small modifications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In November 2016, they rebranded to share the Hack Reactor name.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Social Responsibility ==

=== Code.7370 ===
In collaboration with The Last Mile, Hack Reactor launched Code.7370, a coding program in San Quentin State Prison. Inmates have to apply to be a part of the program. Once accepted, they learn HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript for 8 hours a day, 4 days a week.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3038589/the-prison-coding-class-that-might-have-inmates-making-six-figures-on-their-release|title=The Prison Coding Class That Might Have Inmates Making Six Figures On Their Release|date=2014-11-17|website=Co.Exist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack Reactor instructors volunteered as teachers. In addition to class time students are also given time to work on personal projects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because inmates are not permitted access to the internet, Code.7370 operates by a proprietary programming platform that simulates a normal web environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelastmile.org/|title=The Last Mile – Paving The Road to Success|website=thelastmile.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Code.7370 is to reduce recidivism and help felons reenter the workforce.

=== ReBootKAMP ===
Hack Reactor helped launch ReBootKAMP, a coding bootcamp in Jordan that focuses on Syrian refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barakabits.com/2016/01/rebooting-lives-syrian-refugees-rebootkamp|title=Rebooting the lives of Syrian Refugees-ReBootKAMP - BarakaBits|date=2016-01-31|website=BarakaBits|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ReBootKAMP uses Hack Reactor’s curriculum, and received volunteer assistance from Hack Reactor staff and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rbk.org/|title=RBK {{!}} Empowering Youth For Positive Change|website=rbk.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ReBootKAMP executives also received training on coding bootcamp best practices from Hack Reactor and Reactor Core.

=== Hola&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; ===
In December 2017, Hack Reactor supported the launch of Hola&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, a coding bootcamp based in Mexico City focused on bringing new opportunities to recent returnees. Hola&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is powered by Hack Reactor curriculum and Hack Reactor alumni have been part of their teaching team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/founders-letter|title=5 Years Forward - Hack Reactor's Founders, CEO Celebrate Past, Present, and Great Future|work=Hack Reactor|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://holacode.com/ |title=Hola&amp;lt;code/&gt; |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbalism''' is the study of using plants for medicinal purposes and has dated back since the first humans arose around 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Fu-Shuang|last2=Weng|first2=Jing-Ke|date=2017-07-31|title=Demystifying traditional herbal medicine with modern approach|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants2017109.pdf|journal=Nature Plants|language=En|volume=3|issue=8|pages=17109|doi=10.1038/nplants.2017.109|issn=2055-0278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, [[herb]]s have been used by cultures across the world to treat a variety of ailments and diseases. As modern medicine has progressed, traditional practices of [[herbalism]] have been considered{{by whom|date= November 2018}} to be primitive and archaic. But with the rise of new technology, the invaluable information accumulated by this practice in combination with [[biotechnology]] could be used to open up new way of approaching medicine through expanding the current library of compounds to be used for pharmaceutical advancement and being able to develop new and effective treatments for complex diseases.

== History of herbalism ==
With the 400,000 of plant species known to date, there are many [[metabolite]]s derived from plants that can be applied to human biology from curing headaches to [[autoimmune disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://modernherbalmedicine.com/articles/natural-approaches-to-autoimmune-disorders.html|title=Natural Approaches to Autoimmune Disorders|website=modernherbalmedicine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[morphine]], a pain drug, comes from [[poppy]], while [[paclixatxel]], an anti-[[cancer]] drug, comes from [[pacific yew]]. Humans have used these properties of plants across numerous cultures and have accumulated a rich collection of data on the causes and effects of certain plants on the human body. This gave rise to the practice of herbalism, which in the past served as many cultures’ primary method of dealing with ailments.								
The first written records of herbalism date back to [[Ancient Egypt]] around 1,500 BC in the [[Papyrus Ebers]] where more than 800 plant medicines and their effects on the human body were documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ShenNongBenCaoLingTheDivineFarmersMateriaMedica/ShenNong%20Ben%20Cao%20ling(The%20Divine%20Farmers%20Materia%20Medica)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Shen Nong Ben Cao Ling(The Divine Farmers Materia Medica)"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compendium of Materia Medica, written by [[Li Shizhen]], a Chinese herbalist of the sixteenth century, contains information on 1,893 different herbs and 11,096 prescriptions, demonstrating the breadth of knowledge accumulated on herbalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/ebook/9780520959743/the-ben-cao-gang-mu|title=The Ben Cao Gang Mu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cultures, herbalism is often tied with spirituality. For example, in African culture, it is believed that healing is a religious act, while in the Chinese culture, vital energy (qi) and the balance between yin and yang play a crucial role in healing. Perhaps due to the lack of scientific evidence, herbalist practices has been disregarded, but it is no accident that so many cultures from across the world have chosen to treat disease through plants. Plants hold many biological solutions that can be applied to humans and paralleled with years of trial and error on behalf of herbalists to harness this information, herbalism has the potential to revolutionize modern medicine.								

== Modern herbalism ==
Currently, many of the treatments approved by the [[FDA]] are single-compounds and do not have the ability to treat complex issues such as cancer or [[type II diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patridge|first=Eric|last2=Gareiss|first2=Peter|last3=Kinch|first3=Michael S.|last4=Hoyer|first4=Denton|date=February 2016|title=An analysis of FDA-approved drugs: natural products and their derivatives|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617672|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=21|issue=2|pages=204–207|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2015.01.009|issn=1878-5832|pmid=25617672}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the prescriptions found in herbalism use multiple ingredients mixed in a specific ratio to be synergistic. This is known as the combinatorial effect and it is hypothesized that through multiple metabolites targeting many different sites, the simultaneous action has the potential to cure these complex diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiyohara|first=Hiroaki|last2=Matsumoto|first2=Tsukasa|last3=Yamada|first3=Haruki|date=June 2004|title=Combination Effects of Herbs in a Multi-herbal Formula: Expression of Juzen-taiho-to's Immuno-modulatory Activity on the Intestinal Immune System|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC526207/|journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=1|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1093/ecam/neh004|issn=1741-427X|pmid=15257329}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a treatment called Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 (FAHF-2) is currently under development to reduce [[peanut allergy|peanut allergies]]. Developed by Chinese scientist Xiu-Min Li, FAHF-2 was refined from an ancient traditional Chinese herbal prescription known as Wu Mei Wan, which was originally used to cure [[intestinal]] [[parasitic infection]]s but shares a similar mechanism as a [[food allergy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of nine different herbs and has shown in trial to be effective for curing food allergies. However, when these nine different herbs are used individually, the treatment is much less effective, demonstrating the power of the combinatorial effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Kamal D.|last2=Kattan|first2=Jacob D.|last3=Zou|first3=Zhong Mei|last4=Li|first4=Jing Hua|last5=Zhang|first5=Libang|last6=Wallenstein|first6=Sylvan|last7=Goldfarb|first7=Joseph|last8=Sampson|first8=Hugh A.|last9=Li|first9=Xiu-Min|date=January 2005|title=The Chinese herbal medicine formula FAHF-2 completely blocks anaphylactic reactions in a murine model of peanut allergy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637565|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=115|issue=1|pages=171–178|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.10.003|issn=0091-6749|pmid=15637565}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many herbal prescriptions use the combinatorial effect, if this phenomenon can be analyzed and understood, many kinds of diseases could be cured with just a single prescription. 

The power of herbalism has shown itself to be very promising, but perhaps in conjunction with new developments in biotechnology, it can be used to its full potential.

== Developments in biotechnology ==

=== Bioinformatic algorithms ===
[[Bioinformatics]] is the use of computers to solve biological problems specifically within the fields of [[macromolecular]] structures, [[genome]] sequences, and the results of functional genomics experiments, where large sets of data are involved. For example, they have been used to search a database of gene expression data sets from human cells treated with various small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Justin|last2=Crawford|first2=Emily D.|last3=Peck|first3=David|last4=Modell|first4=Joshua W.|last5=Blat|first5=Irene C.|last6=Wrobel|first6=Matthew J.|last7=Lerner|first7=Jim|last8=Brunet|first8=Jean-Philippe|last9=Subramanian|first9=Aravind|date=2006-09-29|title=The Connectivity Map: Using Gene-Expression Signatures to Connect Small Molecules, Genes, and Disease|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5795/1929|journal=Science|language=en|volume=313|issue=5795|pages=1929–1935|doi=10.1126/science.1132939|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17008526}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database allows researchers to find patterns between small molecules and their mechanisms of action and can be applied to the field of herbalism through identifying the medicinal properties of plant compounds. For instance, this technology aided in the discovery of [[celastrol]], a compound extracted from plant called ''[[Tripterygium wilfordi]]'' commonly used in traditional traditional Chinese medicine as a [[leptin]] sensitizer used to control obesity. Gene expression signatures of lean and obese mice were compared and through analysis researchers determined that celsastrol was the top compound in the database that correlated with anti-leptin resistance. Later, celastrol was tested in mice and shown to reduce obesity and could potentially be used as a treatment for obesity in humans. This example demonstrates the power of plant metabolites and how valuable knowledge of herbalism can as new technology such as bioinformatic algorithms are employed.

=== Crystalline sponge method ===
X-ray single-crystal diffraction is often used to identify and analyze structures of compounds which is an important step to analyzing existing herbal prescriptions to develop new medications. However, this method has key restrictions which limit its use. X-ray single-crystal diffraction requires the sample to be obtained as single [[crystal]]s and in larger quantities. The crystalline sponge method would allow the sample to be aqueous and also requires as little as 80 nanograms of the sample.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inokuma|first=Yasuhide|last2=Yoshioka|first2=Shota|last3=Ariyoshi|first3=Junko|last4=Arai|first4=Tatsuhiko|last5=Hitora|first5=Yuki|last6=Takada|first6=Kentaro|last7=Matsunaga|first7=Shigeki|last8=Rissanen|first8=Kari|last9=Fujita|first9=Makoto|date=2013-03-28|title=X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram scale using porous complexes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538828?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg|journal=Nature|volume=495|issue=7442|pages=461–466|doi=10.1038/nature11990|issn=1476-4687|pmid=23538828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology uses networked porous metal complexes which have high molecule-recognition ability that can absorb molecules from an aqueous solution and order them regularly in the crystal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This way, the molecule can be analyzed with x-ray diffraction and provides a much higher accuracy than [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With this technology, researchers were able to uncover the complete stereochemistry of miyakosyne A, a scarce natural marine product. Due to the small structural difference between one [[methylene]] unit, chemical and spectroscopic methods were not precise enough to determine its exact structure, making x-ray diffraction the only viable method. A tiny crystal sponge of approximately 100 by 100 by 100 µm3 was treated with 5 mg of miyakosyne A and analyzed with x-ray diffraction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allowed the complete structure of miyakosyne A to be revealed, making researchers hopeful for its application in a variety of its fields, including herbalism. As many organic compounds from plants must first be dried into a powder and in large quantities before analysis or analyzed through inaccurate methods such as NMR or mass spectrometry, the crystalline sponge method would greatly simplify the process of identifying compounds of interest. As a result, this would make it easier for researchers to study specific metabolites and their potential applications.

=== Combinatorial biosynthesis ===
Combinatorial biosynthesis is the use of engineered enzymes and pathways to produce different metabolites as opposed traditional chemical synthesis, which is costly, inefficient, and produces byproduct waste.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Huihua|last2=Liu|first2=Zihe|last3=Zhao|first3=Huimin|last4=Ang|first4=Ee Lui|date=2015-02-12|title=Recent advances in combinatorial biosynthesis for drug discovery|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334309/|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|volume=9|pages=823–833|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S63023|issn=1177-8881|pmc=4334309|pmid=25709407}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, in the context of herbalism, if a specific metabolite is scare in its herbal form, it can be produced through combinatorial synthesis to create a cheap and eco-friendly treatment. Currently, there are three major strategies for combinatorial biosynthesis: precursor-directed biosynthesis, enzyme-level modification, and pathway-level recombination.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Precursor-directed biosynthesis creates different metabolites through using different substrates through the same metabolic pathway. Because pathways are promiscuous and non-substrate specific, nonnative substrates can be integrated into the pathway to produce useful variations of metabolites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If this approach is used to manipulate the metabolic pathway of certain herbs, it could lead to new drug discovery.

The second strategy for combinatorial biosynthesis is enzyme-level modification, entailing either swapping entire domains, modules, or subunits, site-specific [[mutagenesis]], or directed evolution. Swapping entire domains, modules, or subunits of [[enzyme]]s is the classical approach of combinatorial biosynthesis and allows for the direct editing of enzymes in a specific pathway, resulting in new metabolites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Site-specific mutagenesis is the modification of individual amino acids in a sequence. Compared to the previous technique, it is less invasive, leading to higher yields of viable protein.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By introducing a single mutation, the substrate specificity of the protein can change, which could improve drugs and even make natural substances found in plants more effective at treating disease. Directed evolution takes a similar approach to site-specific mutagenesis, but creates larger alterations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result, new metabolites can emerge with and make existing treatments even more effective.

The final strategy for combinatorial biosynthesis is pathway-level recombination. This is the editing of the pathway itself. Pathway-level recombination is performed through using biosynthetic genes from different species of organisms to create a pathways in a host organism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This technique often used to edit yeast so they can produce metabolites of interest from rare herbs or plants.

'''Social work''' has its roots in the attempts of [[society]] at large to deal with the problem of poverty and inequality. Social work is intricately linked with the idea of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] work; but must be understood in broader terms. The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in all [[Major religious groups|major world religions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalenvision.org/forteachers/28/1258/ |title=Religion |accessdate=2008-04-09 |work=Middle School Lesson Plans |publisher=Global Envision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern antecedents==
Even before the rise of modern European states, the church was providing social services. When [[Constantine I]] legalized the [[Christian Church]] in the 4th century, the newly legitimised church set up burial societies, [[poorhouse]]s, homes for the aged, shelter for the homeless, hospitals, and [[orphanage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Clarence Flick|year=1919|title=The Rise of the Mediaeval Church and Its Influence on the Civilisation of Western Europe from the First to the Thirteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApLaUMO0ZycC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ishm2006.hu/scientific/abstract.php?ID=138G. Kalantzis (2006). The Historical Evolution of Social Medicine in Byzantium (330-1453 AD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=4A665169DCB94F67A7CF47ECC60F22C0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1316632 C. Gilleard (2007) Ageing &amp; Society — Old age in Byzantine society] (2007), 27: 623-642, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These were often funded, at least in part, from grants from the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Burckhardt, Jacob |title = The Age of Constantine the Great| publisher = Random House (Vintage) | year = 1967 | isbn = 0-520-04680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 580 AD the church had a system for circulating consumables to the poor: associated with each [[parish]] was a ''diaconium'' or office of the [[deacon]].&lt;!---probably well before 590 like maybe in the 1st century.---&gt; Monasteries also often served as comprehensive social service agencies, acting as hospitals, homes for the aged, orphanages,  travelers' aid stations.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Christian church had vast influence on European society and charity was considered to be a responsibility and a sign of one’s piety. This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the [[Early Modern Period]].

==Modern development==
It was not until the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.

The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860-1900) |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organisation Society]] in the mid-19th century. The
second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the [[settlement house]] movement.&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundational basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society.Boston:Allyn&amp;Bacon,2011.Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in 19th century England, and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"/&gt; (Today, it is common for social workers to find themselves dealing with consequences arising from other social problems such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination based on age or on physical or mental disability.)

===Poverty relief===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Poor Laws in the aftermath of the [[Black Death]] (pictured), when labour was in short supply, were concerned with making the able bodied work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uakron.edu/dotAsset/726694.pdf |title=Five Hundred Years of English Poor Laws, 1349–1834:Regulating the Working and Nonworking Poor |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-22}}Akron Law Review 30 (1996): 73–128&lt;/ref&gt;(also see: [[Sturdy beggar]])]]
With the decline of [[feudalism]] in 16th century England, the indigent poor came to be seen as a more direct threat to the social order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialworkdegreeguide.com/faq/what-is-the-history-of-the-social-work-profession&lt;/ref&gt; As they were often not associated to a particular feudal manor, the government moved towards the formation of an organized poverty relief system to care for them.

The origins of the [[English Poor Law]] system can be traced as far back as late medieval statutes dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. [[Monasteries]], the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level.&lt;ref name="victorianweb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html |title=The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early legislation was concerned with [[vagrants]] and making the [[able-bodied]] work, especially while labour was in short supply following the [[Black Death]].

The first complete code of poor relief was made in the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597]] and some provision for the "deserving poor" was eventually made in the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Elizabethan Poor Law]] of 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Higginbotham |url=http://workhouses.org/ |title=www.workhouses.org.uk |publisher=www.workhouses.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created a system administered at parish level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/poorlaw/plaa.htm |title=The Old Poor Law 1795–1834 |publisher=Historyhome.co.uk |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid for by levying local rates on rate payers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdlp.co.uk/resources/general/poor_law.htm |title=A Short Explanation of the English Poor Law |publisher=Mdlp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called '[[impotent poor]]', was in the form of a payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as [[outdoor relief]]. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish [[alms house]]s, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in [[House of Correction|Houses of Correction]] or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html |title=The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew in [[Colonial America]], [[almhouses]] were built to house vulnerable people with no other support, including people with a long term illness or older people without families.  The first recorded Almshouse was built in 1713 near [[Philadelphia]] by William Penn, and was only open to [[Quakers]]. A second one was built nearby in 1728, this time with public money. In 1736 New York opened the Poor House of the City of New York (later renamed [[Bellevue Hospital]]) and in 1737 [[New Orleans]] opened the Saint John's Hospital to serve the poor of the city.&lt;ref name=gehlert&gt;Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A. Browne (2006). Chapter Two: The Conceptual Underpinnings of social work in health care. ''Handbook of Health Social Work''. New Jersey:WILEY&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act]] completely overhauled the existing system in Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/changes.html |title=Changing attitudes towards poverty after 1815 |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and established a [[Poor Law Commission]] to oversee the national operation of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/plcommiss.html |title=The Poor Law Commission |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This included the forming together of small parishes into [[Poor Law Unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/status_page.jsp?unit_status=PLU |title=Administrative Units Typology &amp;#124; Status definition: Poor Law Union |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief. Although the aim of the legislation was to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the method of financing of the Poor Law system which continued to be paid for by levying a "poor rate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/savings.html |title=Savings on the poor rates made by the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the property owning middle classes.

Although the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] did not ban all forms of [[outdoor relief]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/victorianbritain/caring/default.htm |title=The National Archives Learning Curve &amp;#124; Victorian Britain &amp;#124; Caring Nation |publisher=Learningcurve.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041756/http://learningcurve.gov.uk/victorianbritain/caring/default.htm |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law authorities except in a [[workhouse]]. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were to be built in every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form [[Workhouse Unions]]. The [[Poor Law Commissioners]] were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.

===Private philanthropy===
[[File:Charity to Street Arab.jpg|150px|thumb|Social work involves ameliorating social problems such as poverty and homelessness.]]
The 19th century saw a great leap forward in technological and scientific achievement. There was also a great [[Urbanization|migration]] to urban areas throughout the [[Western world]], which led to many social problems. This galvanised the socially active, prosperous middle and upper classes to search for ways to ameliorate the physical and spiritual conditions of the poor underclasses.&lt;ref name="EDINBURGH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Work History |publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]] |url=http://www.socialwork.ed.ac.uk/social/history.html |accessdate=2008-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221085300/http://www.socialwork.ed.ac.uk/social/history.html |archivedate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was coupled with a religious revival, and many Protestant mission efforts (urban missions), attempted to resolve the problems inherent in large cities like poverty, prostitution, disease, and other afflictions. A new philosophy of "scientific charity" emerged, which stated charity should be "secular, rational and empirical as opposed to sectarian, sentimental, and dogmatic.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateII"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I.2 Missionaries &amp; Volunteers |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-2.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

During this time, rescue societies were initiated to find more appropriate means of self-support for women involved in prostitution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} State-built [[Mental asylum]]s were built from the 1840s to assist in taking care of the [[mentally ill]].

Most historians identify the [[Charity Organization Society]], founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |title=1800s |work=Family Action: About Us |accessdate=17 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. It supported the concept of self-help and limited government intervention to deal with the effects of poverty. The organisation claimed to use "scientific principles to root out scroungers and target relief where it was most needed".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Rosemary (2001). ''Poverty and Public Health 1815-1949''.

[[Alsager Hay Hill]] was prominent from its foundation, acting as honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and as an active member of the council until 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Hill, Alsager Hay (DNB12)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill also worked as an almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London. He campaigned about the many flaws in the [[poor laws]] and urged for a more scientific classification of paupers. His 1867 pamphlet, on ''Our Unemployed,'' was one of the earliest attempts to highlight the problem of systemic [[unemployment]];  he suggested a national system of labour registration. In 1871, Hill pioneered a system of [[labour exchange]]s in England, establishing 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,'. There, Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited ''Labour News'' to improve communication between masters and men seeking work.&lt;ref name=CNHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=History in the making|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/history-in-the-making/949883.article|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Construction News|date=5 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Octavia Hill]] is regarded by many as the founder of modern social work. She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.

[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]
She also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 "Hill, Octavia (1838–1912)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At first Hill believed, "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers."&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, Peter H., "Octavia Hill: An Appraisal", ''The Town Planning Review'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223–37&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: "Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless." She was an outspoken critic of the principles of "[[outdoor relief]]" or the [[Speenhamland system]] of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as "a profligate use of public funds."&lt;ref name=wyatt2&gt;Wyatt, R.J. (2000). ''Octavia Hill and The Crown Estate – a Continuing Legacy?'', [[The Crown Estate]] p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up of references on prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;

===Social action===
[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Toynbee Hall]] settlement house, [[Whitechapel]] was founded in 1884 as part of the [[Settlement movement]]. Pictured here in 1902.]]
A stress on social action that developed in the 1880s, was pioneered by the [[Settlement house]] movement.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateIII"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter II. Settlements (1880-1900) |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/2-1.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Octavia Hill's work. Her colleagues [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]], founded [[Toynbee Hall]], [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]]&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; in 1884 in Bethnal Green as the first university-sponsored settlement. Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.

The settlement was named after [[Arnold Toynbee]], an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]]. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and [[co-operative]]s. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.

In America, the settlement movement was established by [[Jane Addams]], a young medical student, and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]] in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Danilov|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|pages=356–357|chapter=Social Activists}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.&lt;ref&gt;Husock, H. (1993). "Bringing back the settlement house". ''Public Welfare'', 51(4).&lt;/ref&gt; The house was both a community service centre and a social research program.  Precursors to modern social work arose at Hull House as health professionals began to work with social determinants of poor health.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt; 

[[File:Bohemmian Youth East St. Louis.jpg|thumb|left|Bohemian immigrant youth at the [[Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House]] in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois.]]
The concept of the Settlement house movement was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Marshall, "[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]", ed. John K. Whitaker, ''Marshall Studies Bulletin'' 6 (1996): 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement movement focused on the causes of poverty through the "three Rs" - Research, Reform, and Residence. They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateIII"/&gt;

The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were "...a foundation for social work practice in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, J. M. (2008). Common space, safe place: Lived experiences of former settlement house participants from the West Town and Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago''  Dissertation Abstract International'', ''69''(5), 1682A. (UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important participant in the scheme was the philanthropist [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] who published his study ''Life and Labour of the People in London'' in 1889 while working at Toynbee Hall. The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.

===Further Development===
[[Image:Dublin Slum dwellers 1901 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Poverty in towns, slum dwellers in [[Dublin]], Ireland circa 1901.]]
By the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: "I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Rowntree, B S: "Poverty: A Study in Town Life", page 298. Macmillian and CO., 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money "necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.

In analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle&lt;ref&gt;Searle, G R: "A New England?", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html Joseph Rowntree Foundation Centenary: Poverty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011147/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html |date=2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.&lt;ref name="Social Work"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra|author2=Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url =http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127| accessdate =2008-02-19| pmid = 16858918 | doi=10.1093/sw/51.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question "is social work a profession?" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. [[Abraham Flexner]] spoke on the topic "Is Social Work a Profession?" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.&lt;ref name="UM-SSW"&gt;{{cite web|title = From Charitable Volunteers to Architects of Social Welfare: A Brief History of Social Work |publisher = [[University of Michigan]] |url =http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html |accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method..

==Medical Social Work==
[[File:Jane Addams profile.jpg|150px|thumbnail|100px|[[Jane Addams]] (1860–1935) was a founder of the [[Settlement movement|U.S. Settlement House movement]] and is considered one of the early influences on professional social work in the United States.]]
The first professional [[medical social work]]ers in England were called hospital almoners, and were based in medical institutions. The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered "deserving enough" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt;

The first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.

This approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt;  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.

==State Welfare==
[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]
As the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt; A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., “T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation’, History of Political Thought, 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., The Philosophy of T. H. Green (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt;

This strand began to coalesce into the [[social liberalism]] movement at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. In the early 1900s, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]] introduced various [[Liberal reforms|reforms]], including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Beveridge]], often called the 'architect of the welfare state', was pivotal in framing the debate about social work in the context of state welfare provision. His 1942 report on ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'',&lt;ref name="Original report title page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=William|title=Social Insurance and Allied Services|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|website=British Library|publisher=BL|accessdate=8 July 2014|ref=Original report title page|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233116/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; known commonly as the ''[[Beveridge Report]]'', identified five "Giant Evils" in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease, and went on to propose widespread reform to the system of social welfare to mitigate these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel‐Smith, "The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes." ''International Social Security Review'' (1992) 45#1‐2 pp 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The report proved very popular with a war-weary public, and went on to form the basis to the post-war expansion of the Welfare State and the creation of the [[National Health Service]], a free at the point of delivery healthcare provider.

==Today==
Currently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.

This is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Payne, M. (2011). ''Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice. Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">The concept of imagined (also referred as imaginative) geographies originated from [[Edward Said]], particularly his work on [[Orientalism (book)|critique on Orientalism]]. In this context, "imagined" does not mean to be “false” or “made-up”, but rather is used synonymous with “perceived”. Imagined geographies refers to the perception of a space created through certain imagery, texts, and/or [[discourse]]s&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Imagined geographies can be seen as a form of [[social constructionism]] on par with [[Benedict Anderson]]'s concept of [[imagined communities]]. Edward Said's notion of [[Orientalism]] is tied to the tumultuous dynamics of contemporary history. [[Orientalism]] is often referred to as the West's patronizing perceptions and depictions of the East, but more specifically towards [[Islamic]] and [[Confucian]] states. [[Orientalism]] has also been labeled to as the cornerstone of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]]&lt;ref&gt;Nash, C., 2014. Postcolonial geographies: spatial narratives of inequality and interconnection. In Envisioning human geographies (pp. 110-133). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite often being constructed on a national level, imagined geographies also occur domestically in nations and locally within regions, cities, etc.

==Orientalism==
{{main|Orientalism (book)}}

In his book ''Orientalism'', Edward Said argued that Western culture had produced a view of the "[[Orient]]" based on a particular imagination, popularized through [[academic]] [[Orientalism|Oriental studies]], [[travel writing]], [[anthropology]] and a [[Colonialism|colonial]] view of the Orient. This imagination included painting the orient as feminine- however, Said's view on the gendered nature has been criticized by other scholars due to a limited exploration of the construct.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne P. "Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch. 1, Imagining the World." London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 1993 lecture located at York University, Toronto, Canada, Said stressed the role culture plays in Orientalism-based imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=ESaid&gt;Edward Said. "Culture and Imperialism" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; By differentiating and elevating a national culture over another a validating process of "othering" is undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 "The Other". 328-329.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process underlies imagined geographies such as orientalism as it creates a set of preconceived notions for self-serving purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 "The Other"; Edward Said. "Culture and Imperialism" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In constructing itself as superior, the imperial force or colonizing agent is able to justify its actions as somehow necessary or beneficial to the "other".&lt;ref name=ESaid/&gt;

Despite the broad scope and affect of orientalism as an imagined geography, it and the underlying process of "othering" are discursive and thereby normalized within dominant, Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne P. Sharp. Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch.1 "Imagining the World". 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this sense that Orientalism may be reinforced in cultural texts such as art, film, literature, music, etc. where one-dimensional and often backwards constructions prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A prime source of cinematic examples is the documentary-film ''Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People''.&lt;ref name=Jhally&gt;Sut Jhally. Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People.&lt;/ref&gt; The film demonstrates the process of orientalism centric "othering" within Western films from the silent era to modern classics such as Disney's ''Aladdin''.&lt;ref name=Jhally/&gt; Inferior, backwards, and culturally stagnate constructions of Oriental "others" become normalized in the minds of Western consumers of cultural texts; reinforcing racist or insensitive beliefs and assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Orientalism'', Said says that Orientalism is an imagined geography because a) Europeans created one culture for the entirety of the 'Orient', and b) the 'Orient' was defined by text and not by the 'Orient'.

==Theory==
Said was heavily influenced by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], and those who have developed the theory of imagined geographies have linked these together. Foucault states that power and knowledge are always intertwined. Said then developed an idea of a relationship between power and descriptions. Imagined geographies are thus seen as a tool of [[power (sociology)|power]], of a means of controlling and subordinating areas. Power is seen as being in the hands of those who have the right to [[Objectification|objectify]] those that they are imagining. Imagined geographies were mostly based on myth and legend, often depicting monstrous "others". [[Edward Said]] elaborates that: “Europe is powerful and articulate; Asia is defeated and distant." &lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward.  “Imaginative Geography and Its Representations: Orientalizing the Oriental.”  Orientalism.  New York: Vintage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further writers to have been heavily influenced by the concept of imagined geographies including [[Derek Gregory]] and [[Gerard Toal|Gearóid Ó Tuathail]]. Gregory argues that the [[War on Terror]] shows a continuation of the same imagined geographies that Said uncovered. He claims that the [[Islamic]] world is portrayed as uncivilized; it is labeled as backward and failing. This justifies, in the view of those imagining, the military intervention that has been seen in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. [[Edward Said]] mentions that when [[Islam]] appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages, the response was conservative and defensive. Ó' Tuathail has argued that [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] knowledges are forms of imagined geography. Using the example of [[Halford Mackinder]]'s [[Heartland Theory]], he has shown how the presentation of Eastern Europe/Western Russia as a key geopolitical region after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] influenced actions such as the recreation of [[Poland]] and the [[Polish Corridor]] in the 1918 [[Treaty of Versailles]].

This theory has also been used to critique several geographies created; both historically and contemporarily—an example is [[Maria Todorova]]'s work ''[[Imagining the Balkans]]''. [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' has also been criticized as showing a whole set of imagined geographies.{{by whom|date=December 2012}} Halford Mackinder's "imperial gaze" has also been argued to be an important imagined geography [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rcjo/2000/00000011/00000001/art00005] that emphasised the importance of the [[British Empire]] over colonial peoples, and asserted the view of the geographical "expert" with the "[[God's eye view]]".

== Localities ==

=== Sami ===

This holds e. g. for [[Noaidi|shamanism among Sami groups]]. Some of their shamanistic beliefs and practice shared important features with [[Shamanism in Siberia|those of some Siberian cultures]].&lt;ref name=samsib&gt;Voigt 1966: 296&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their [[yoik]]s were sung on shamanistic rites,&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt; this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).&lt;ref name=swap&gt;Voigt 1966: 145&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, yoiks are sung in two different styles, one of these are sung only by young people. But the traditional one may be the other, the “mumbling” style, resembling to magic spells.&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surprising characteristics of yoiks can be explained by comparing the music [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, as observed in yoiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. Some yoiks intend to mimic natural sounds.&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel/&gt; This  can be contrasted to [[bel canto]], which intends to exploit human speech organs on the highest level to achieve an almost “superhuman” sound.&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===

[[Shamanism in Siberia]] is far from being homogeneous. In some of the various cultures there, mimicking natural sounds can be present: some instances of [[overtone singing]], and also certain shamanic songs of some cultures can be examples.

==== Samoyedic ====

The seance of [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]] shamans were accompanied by women imitating the sounds of the reindeer calf, (thought to provide fertility for those women).&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, A. Popov observed the Nganasan shaman Dyukhade Kosterkin imitating the sound of polar bear: the shaman was believed to have transformed into a polar bear.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obi-Ugric ====

A Russian traveler described a [[Khanty people|Khanty]] shamanic séance: it took place in the [[birch bark]] tent in full darkness. Only the song and the [[dombra]] music of the shaman could be heard: he invoked his spirits. It was mimicked as if the direction of the sound were moving: it sounded as if the shaman had flown around in the tent and left. Later, the voices of various animals (cuckoo, owl, [[hoopoe]], duck, squirrel) could be heard. Then it was imitated as if the shaman had flown back into the tent, singing his song.&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Altai ====

Among several peoples near the [[Altai Mountains]], the new drum of a shaman must go through a special ritual. This is regarded as “making the drum alive”: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and skin for the new drum narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a [[libation]]: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials “come to life” and speak with the voice of the shaman in the name of the tree and the deer. Among the [[Tubalar]], this means literally the imitation of the behavior and the voice of the animal by the shaman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli01|Eliade 2001]]: 164 (= Chpt 5 discussing the symbolics of shamanic drum and costume, the subsection about the drum)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Soyots|Soyot]] shamanic song, sounds of bird and wolf are imitated to represent helping spirits of the shaman.&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy''' (ISERP) is the research arm of the [[social sciences]] at [[Columbia University]], formerly known as the ''Paul F. Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences''. ISERP works to produce pioneering social science research and to shape public policy by integrating knowledge and methods across the social scientific disciplines. ISERP organizes an active intellectual community at Columbia University through its Faculty Fellows program, research centers, projects, and training initiatives.

== History ==
ISERP is the direct descendant of the [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] (BASR), established at [[Columbia University]] in 1944 by sociologist [[Paul F. Lazarsfeld]]. One of the first social science institutes in the nation, the Bureau made landmark contributions to communications research, public opinion polling, organizational studies, and social science methodology. BASR’s tradition was carried on by the  Paul F. Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences, established in 1976 after Lazarsfeld’s death and later renamed to honor him. Under directors Harold Watts, Jonathan Cole, and Harrison White, the Lazarsfeld Center expanded its interdisciplinary reach and established particular strengths in the sociology of science and network analysis.

The Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences was one of the centers incorporated into the Institute at its founding in 1999 as the Institute for Social and Economic Theory and Research (ISETR). Also joining ISETR were the Center for Urban Research and Policy, founded in 1992, and several new research centers.  In January 2001, ISETR merged with the Office of Sponsored Research to become the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |title=About ISERP |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Columbia University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213054517/http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellowship==
The fellowship of ISERP is drawn from faculty of the departments of Anthropology, Economics, History, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Statistics, as well as of [[Barnard College]], the Earth Institute, [[Teachers College]], the Mailman School of Public Health and the Schools of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Business, International and Public Affairs, Law, and Social Work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |title=About ISERP |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Columbia University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213054517/http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/ |archivedate=2008-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:interstitial space.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Figure 1. Hypothetical interstitial space design for a medical facility.]]An '''interstitial space''' is an intermediate space located between regular-use floors, commonly located in hospitals and laboratory-type buildings to allow space for the mechanical systems of the building.  By providing this space, laboratory and hospital rooms may be easily rearranged throughout their lifecycles and therefore reduce lifecycle cost.

==Description==

An interstitial space is useful when the mechanical system of the building is highly sophisticated and changing the space on the primary floors is a distinct possibility.  The heights of these spaces are generally six to eight feet and allow easy access for repair or alteration.&lt;ref&gt;Hospital and Healthcare Facility Design: 2nd Edition. Richard L. Miller and Earl S. Swensson. W W Norton &amp; Co Inc., 2002, pp. 51&amp;ndash;52&lt;/ref&gt;  If changes or maintenance need to be performed in the interstitial space, the primary space does not need to be shut down, which is important in buildings like hospitals where the equipment in the space must operate constantly.  Unlike traditionally built buildings, where the mechanical space is located in the basement or on the top floor, the interstitial space needs few vertical penetrations and therefore leaves more open space on the primary floor.  The entire floor plan of these buildings can be more open because there are fewer fixed vertical penetrations through the floor and walls.

Another way to use an interstitial space is to incorporate a design that divides the functions of the building into groups and localizes them.  The Zeidler Partnership Architects’ (ZPA) design of the [[William Osler Health Centre]] (WOHC) in [[Brampton, Ontario]], is one example of this design.  (Note: this was designed but ZPA was not awarded the project.)  The groups in this design are based on similar structural and mechanical systems.  Flexible design allows for easy expansion or redesign in the future.  Horizontal expansion is especially easy because of the interstitial space between the surgical suite and the emergency floors, where the mechanical system functions are the most crucial in this building.  Double floor height is used to maintain the horizontal flow of connections throughout the rest of the building without causing any interference with other building systems.

==History==

The idea of using an interstitial space was started in the 1960s by professors at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]’s College of Architecture.  Their concept was to standardize spaces and allow for rapid changes in medical facilities.  While the spaces for building systems like plumbing, mechanical, and electrical systems were not as large as today’s, it was an important beginning of an idea to separate the systems by floor.  The first building to actually use an interstitial space design was [[Louis Kahn]]’s Salk Institute of Biological Studies in [[La Jolla, California]].  The design allowed the building to keep up with ever-changing technology.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Fine and Stephen Vanderber. Healthcare In An Era Of Radical Transformation. Yale University Press, 2000, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;  From there, designs progressed to concepts created by ZPA; a firm who has completed over 40 healthcare and lab facilities for buildings using an interstitial space design.&lt;ref&gt;Planning for Change: Hospital Design Theories in Practice (http://www.aia.org/nwsltr_print.cfm?pagename=aah_jrnl_20051019_change). Retrieved on 2008-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, many firms have drawn inspiration from ZPA and use their concept to develop their own design.  Some designs cover the whole floor area and some, like the WOHC, are partial interstitial spaces.

==Pros and cons of using an interstitial space==

===Pros===

Interstitial spaces are exceedingly useful when a building needs to be re-modeled.  In a medical or lab facility, technology improves incredibly fast and no one can predict what equipment buildings will need to be designed for in the future.  With an interstitial space, room layouts in the primary floor may be altered much more easily than traditionally designed buildings since there are fewer service stacks penetrating the floors.  The walls can be arranged and rearranged freely.  If a drastic renovation must occur, only one floor at a time has to be shut down for renovation, instead of the whole building.  The cost of the building is reduced significantly since major equipment does not have to be changed during a renovation.   Lifecycle cost includes anything that pertains to the building from when it is in its schematic design phase until it is demolished.  A chart of the cost distribution is shown in figure 2.  If the equipment itself must be [[retrofitted]], it can be done faster, since the spaces have ample area to work and are separated by floor.  The lifetime of the building may also be increased, since the adaptable spaces may be retrofitted instead of needing to be torn down for a redesigned building.

[[Image:Lifecycle building cost pie chart.jpg|frame|center|600px|Figure 2. Lifecycle building cost pie chart.]]

Separating the building systems from the primary space can also be helpful during construction.  If sequenced correctly, it can decrease the installation time of major equipment significantly.  Each trade may work on one floor and move to the next after another is finished.  Also, wall, ceiling, and floor finishes may be worked on while the building systems are installed as opposed to a traditionally designed building where they would have to wait for more equipment to be installed.

Another advantage of using an interstitial space is that easy access to the equipment in them may encourage preventative maintenance.  If a more efficient system can be installed easily, it can again reduce lifecycle cost.

===Cons===

The largest and most well known negative of interstitial spaces is a high first cost.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Riley and Sandra Vondrak. Interstitial Space Design In Modern Laboratories. Journal of Architectural Engineering, Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2005, pp. 60-70&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding more floors increases the amount of material used for floor decks, walls, etc.  The construction expense becomes much larger when anything is added because it affects many other systems in the building.  One main thing that increases is the amount of façade material necessary to cover the skin of the building.  Depending on that material, the cost and time of construction could be largely inflated.

Equipment costs can become a large deterrent of owners also.  Several smaller pieces of equipment must be purchased for each floor instead of one large piece for the whole building.  The large piece of equipment is much cheaper than all of the small pieces combined in almost every case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">The '''Janus Experiments''' investigated the effects of exposure to [[neutron radiation]] and [[gamma radiation]] on mice and dogs. They consisted of ten large scale experiments conducted at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] from 1972 to 1989. To explore various relationships, the studies varied radiation type, dose rates, total dose and [[fractionation]]. The work formed the basis of dozens of publications in the medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grahn|first1=D|last2=Wright|first2=B.J.|last3=Carnes|first3=B.A.|last4=Williamson|first4=F.S.|last5=Fox|first5=C|title=Studies of acute and chronic radiation injury at the Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 1970-1992: The JANUS Program Survival and Pathology Data|date=1995|doi=10.2172/10124634|osti=10124634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original studies were funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]]. Later grants from [[NASA]] and additional funding from the Department of Energy enabled researchers at [[Northwestern University]] to make the data public through mouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Paunesku|editor1-first=David|title=Janus Mouse Tissue Search|journal=Northwestern University, Department of Radiation Oncology|date=September 2007|url=http://janus.northwestern.edu/janus2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Haley|editor1-first=Benjamin|title=Janus Dog Tissue Search|journal=Northwestern University, Department of Radiation Oncology|date=February 2009|url=http://janus.northwestern.edu/dog_tissues/}}&lt;/ref&gt; portals that permit radiation researchers to search for and request specific tissues from the studies' archives. These resources continue to be used in studies of radio-sensitivity, for example, at the laboratory of Gayle Woloschak at Northwestern University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Paunesku, Tatjana|author2=Zhang, Yueru|author3=Gemmell, M.

Studies of the survival and causes of death of the control groups of mice and dogs, which were not exposed to radiation, were the basis of the development by [[S. Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce A. Carnes of their biodemographic theory of intrinsic mortality.

'''Juana María Rodríguez''' is a professor of Ethnic Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, and Performance Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Her scholarly writing in [[queer theory]], [[critical race theory]], and [[performance studies]] highlights the intersection of race, gender, sexuality and embodiment in constructing subjectivity.

== Biography ==
Born Juana María de la Caridad Rodríguez y Hernández in [[Placetas|Placetas, Cuba]], Rodríguez emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her family.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces''. New York: NYU Press, 2003, p. 126.
&lt;/ref&gt; She has two siblings: and her sister [[Dinorah de Jesús Rodriguez|Dinorah de Jesús Rodríguez]],an experimental filmmaker and visual artist who works between Havana and Miami, and her brother René. Rodríguez identifies as queer and bisexual, and has published work about what she terms "bisexual erasure."&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "Queer Politics, Bisexual Erasure: Sexuality at the Nexus of Race, Gender, and Statistics." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 169–182. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
Describing herself as an "accidental academic" in reference to her working class upbringing, Rodríguez attended [[City College of San Francisco]] before graduating with a Bachelor's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in Liberal Studies. Her graduate degrees include a Masters in English and Comparative Literature from [[Columbia University]], and a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied with [[Norma Alarcón]], [[Judith Butler]], VèVè A. Clark, and [[Gerald Vizenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/faculty-profile-associate-professor-juana-mar%C3%AD-rodr%C3%ADguez-gender-womens-studies|title=FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Associate Professor Juana María Rodríguez, Gender &amp; Women's Studies|last=CRG Editor|first=|date=Fall 2009|website=Faultlines|publisher=Center for Race and Gender|access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Rodríguez was an Assistant Professor of English at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and an Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]] where she served as Director of the Cultural Studies Graduate Group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heymiyuki.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/beyond-the-ivory-tower-interviews-with-academics-1-with-juana-maria-rodriguez/|title=Beyond the Ivory Tower: Interviews with Academics #1 with Juana María Rodríguez|last=Baker|first=Miyuki|date=November 30, 2015|website=|publisher=Word Press|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Berkeley, she is affiliated with the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for New Media, the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture and the [[Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society|Haas Institute for a Fair and Equitable Society]], where she was a founding member of the LGBTQ Citizen Cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, she was appointed to the [[University of California]] President's Advisory Committee on LGBT Students, Staff, and Faculty Member by [[Janet Napolitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/lgbt-advisory-group-advances-recommendations-make-campuses-more-inclusive|title=LGBT advisory group advances recommendations to make campuses more inclusive|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2014|website=University of California|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic contributions ==
The author of two books, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) and ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU 2014), Rodríguez has also published essays in ''[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|GLQ: a Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]]; Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory; [[Radical History Review]]; PMLA; [[MELUS]]; Profession'' and others''.'' Rodríguez's work is considered part of queer of color critique, an intervention into [[queer theory]] that argues that sexuality can not be understood or analyzed outside of the ways it is mutually constituted by race and other dimensions of difference.

=== ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ===
Rodríguez's first book, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) introduced the idea of queer ''[[latinidad]]'' as a way to disarticulate the ways that history, geography, colonialism, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, legal status, immigration status, class, color, and the politics of location exist to complicate facile notions of Latino identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that book, Rodríguez identifies three case studies that involve different understandings of ethnic and sexual identity: activism through the queer Latino/a HIV prevention agency [[Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida]]; law through the [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]] case of Marcelo Tenorio, a gay Brazilian who was granted political asylum in the United States based on sexual persecution; and cyberspace by examining the internet chatrooms of the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat) an early form of digital connectivity.

==== Queering Spanish language ====
In her chapter on the IRC, "'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-Slut" in ''Queer Latinidad'', Rodríguez documents the use of the "@" or arroba in words like Latin@, amig@s, or nostr@s seen in the Spanish language digital spaces she studied, as a "creative linguistic intervention in the highly gendered structure of Spanish." She writes, "Unlike the slash in words such as Latinos/as or amigas/os, which maintains a gender binary while attempting to be inclusive, the @ or "at sign," literally marks where an individual is at in terms of gender."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also discussed the use of the "x" in terms such as Latinx and other approaches to the ungendering or queering of Spanish, although she also argues that gender can also be a site of pleasure and affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Sarah Hayley, and Oscar NÑ. "Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language." ''Latino USA''. N.p., 29 Jan. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' ===
Rodriguez's second book ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU Press 2014) looks at queer kinship practices, [[sodomy law]]s in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latin dance]] styles, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[pornography]], [[burlesque]], [[San Francisco Pride|queer pride]] marches, alongside sexual practices such as [[BDSM]], [[polyamory]], daddy-play, and [[Butch and femme|butch-femme]] role playing to examine the relationship between sexual politics and sexual practices. In the book and elsewhere, she highlights how the [[Respectability politics|politics of respectability]] that surround sexuality inhibit the potential for more radical interventions into public policy and law around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Sara. "Faculty Profile: Juana María Rodríguez on Sexuality in Public Discourse | Haas Institute." ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society''. N.p., 21 Mar. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, she uses the idea of [[gesture]] to emphasize non-verbal ways of communicating gendered and ethnic identity, and as a metaphor to think about activist practices that are partial, in-process and incomplete. The book features queer performance artist [[Xandra Ibarra]], and explores the taboo subject of racialized sexual violence.

==== Sexual practices ====
Rodríguez's work is often specifically praised for the ways in which it deals explicitly with queer sexual practices and forms of gender expression such as butch and femme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dorrance, Jess. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings." ''Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory'' 0.0 (2016): 1–3. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016"&gt;Dominguez, Pier. "The Potentiality of the Latina Femme Gesture." ''GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies'' 22.1 (2016): 143–145. ''glq.dukejournals.org''. Web. 10 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim. "No Sex Please, We're American." ''American Literary History'' (2015): ajv030. ''alh.oxfordjournals.org''. Web. 17 June 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently uses her own sexual experiences, or what she terms "sexual archives" to illuminate her ideas on racialized abjection, feminine subjection, sexual vulnerability, and femme identity. In her writing, she often references the sensory, particularly touch, as a way to articulate an embodied sexual practice and a writing practice rooted in sociality.&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dahl, Ulrika. "The Latina Femme Promise of Vulnerability and Access." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 191–196.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrido, Anahi Russo. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings by Juana María Rodríguez." ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' 42.1 (2016): 296–297. ''journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; In reviews of her work, reviewers frequently remark on her lyrical use of language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Other accomplishments ==

=== Awards ===
In 2015, her book, ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' won the Alan Bray Memorial Book Prize, by the GL/Q Caucus of the [[Modern Language Association]] and was a [[27th Lambda Literary Awards|Lambda Literary Foundation Finalist for LGBT Studies]].

At the University of California, Berkeley, she has won the Social Science Division, Distinguished Teaching Award and the Graduate Assembly's Faculty Mentor Award.

=== Professional affiliations ===
A member of the [[American Studies Association]], the [[Modern Language Association]], and the [[National Women's Studies Association]], she was chair of the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Status of Literatures of People of Color in the United States and edited a collection of essays entitled the "Affirmative Activism Project"&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "The Affirmative Activism Project." ''Profession'' (2007): 156–167.

An '''MD–MS program''' is a [[dual degree]] [[graduate school]] program awarding both a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) and a [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree. Post-graduate diploma holders and [[Diplomate of National Board]] (India) candidates can upgrade to an MD-MS degree through opportunities such as post-graduate–up-gradation programs.

== Description ==
An MD-MS Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tauedu.org/masters-in-medicine.html |title=M.D./M.S. Programs - Education - Texila American University |publisher=Tauedu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tutor]]-based program in which students are trained by research professionals on modern innovations in the healthcare industry. The MD-MS degree is designed for people who intend to pursue clinical practice and want to develop their research skills in a related area of engineering. It is well suited for students who desire a better understanding of the types of technology they may employ as practicing physicians. The MD-MS degree program provides a funded research experience in engineering that is expected to lead to research publishing. The program also provides practice in engineering design and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/academics/graduate/mdms/ |title=M.D./M.S. Program &amp;#124; Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth |publisher=Engineering.dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire course is developed to be mentor-based, enabling the students to be coached by experts attached to a recommended medical center. Most of the courses take place online, via distance learning, leaving professionals free to study without leaving their jobs.

=== Eligibility ===
* Candidates who have appeared and cleared the [[Diplomate of National Board|DNB]] exams 
* Doctors with a post-graduate diploma/degree can study for the PG-up-gradation program

=== Duration ===
Requirements for the combined MD and master's degrees are equivalent to those of the separate degrees of the Doctor of Medicine of the School of Medicine and the specific Master of Science degree at a particular campus. The dual degree program can usually be completed within five to six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medschool.umaryland.edu/osr/student_md_masters.asp |title=Combined MD/Master's Programs: Office of Student Research: University of Maryland School of Medicine |publisher=Medschool.umaryland.edu |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation ===
Evaluation of the course is assessed by the guide and university through [[thesis]]/[[dissertation]] submitted by the student based on their research project done.

==Examples ==
Biomedical Informatics (BMI) applies statistical techniques and technologies to the medical and health sciences.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008&gt;{{cite web |title=MS Programs - Education - Stanford University School of Medicine |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |publisher=Med.stanford.edu |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503050513/http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiology involves the study of disease — and the predisposing conditions for disease — among human populations in all parts of the world, with an emphasis on approaches to improving levels of health. The MS Program in Epidemiology is presented by the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Health Services Research (HSR) is concerned with the analysis of health policy in the public and private sectors. The MS Program in HSR is part of the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Medicine (MOM) includes experience in clinical medicine with a view to foster translational research. Students who pursue the MS in Medicine while engaged in their doctoral programs will be highly knowledgeable about human biology and disease, and thus more able to translate scientific discoveries into useful medical advances.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling is a program that trains students to understand the molecular, clinical and psychological implications of differences in the human genome, and to translate these intricacies to health care professionals, laboratory researchers and patients/families. Graduates of this program will be eligible for board certification by the American Board of Genetic Counselling.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

'''Museum anthropology''' is a domain of scholarship and professional practice in the discipline of [[anthropology]].

==Characteristics==
A distinctive characteristic of museum anthropology is that it cross-cuts anthropology's sub-fields ([[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]]) as these are understood in North American anthropology. All of these areas are sometimes pursued in museum contexts (usually on the basis of research work with systematic collections) and all can be (and are) explicated in museum-based exhibitions and public programs. Some museum anthropologists work full or part-time in museum contexts while others are anthropologists (employed in diverse settings) interested in studying museums as social institutions in cultural and historical context. These two sets of concerns—collections-based scholarship and the study of museums—provide the core around which the domain of museum anthropology has self-organized.

One theme prominent in recent museum anthropology research concerns reconnecting older collections of ethnographic objects curated in museum contexts with the present-day source communities from which these objects were gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Laura L. Peers and Alison K. Brown, eds. (2003) ''Museums and Source Communities: A Routledge Reader''. (London: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison K. Brown and Laura L. Peers (2006) ''Pictures Bring Us Messages: Photographs and Histories from the Kainai Nation''. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is the development of museums and cultural centers by indigenous peoples in their own home communities.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Pierce Erikson with Helma Ward and Kirk Wachendorf (2002) ''Voices of a Thousand People: The Makah Cultural and Research Center''. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyneira Isaac (2007) ''Mediating Knowledges: Origins of a Zuni Tribal Museum''. (Tucson: University of Arizona Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Christen (2007) Following the Nyinkka: Relations of Respect and Obligations to Act in the Collaborative Work of Aboriginal Cultural Centers. ''Museum Anthropology'' 30(2):101–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other relationships==
There is much traffic between museum anthropology and the related, overlapping, and neighboring domains of (general) [[archaeology]], [[museum folklore]], [[material culture studies]], [[historical anthropology]], [[visual anthropology]], the [[anthropology of art]], and the [[history of anthropology]], as well as the [[art history]] of non-western societies and the field of [[museum studies]].

==Journals==
The journals ''[[Museum Anthropology (journal)|Museum Anthropology]]'', ''Journal of Museum Ethnography'', ''[[Gradhiva]]'', and ''[[Museum Anthropology Review]]'' are closely identified with museum anthropology as a field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0892-8339 Museum Anthropology]. Wiley.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gradhiva.revues.org/ Gradhiva]. Gradhiva.revues.org.

Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum anthropology and ethnography==
Drawing upon critiques of ethnographic representation in written genres, museum anthropologists have asked questions about the strategies used to represent histories and cultures in museum exhibitions and related forms of display (such as worlds fairs).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Handler and Eric Gable (1997) ''The New History in an Old Museum: Creating the Past at Colonial Williamsburg''. (Durham: Duke University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1998) ''Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage''. (Berkeley: University of California Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Related is historical work in which museum anthropologists seek to better understand the contexts, histories and biographies that shaped both the field and the collections that contemporary curators steward.&lt;ref&gt;Amiria Henare (2005) ''Museums, Anthropology and Imperial Exchange''. (New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard Krech III, ed. (1999) ''Collecting Native America, 1870–1960''. (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Jacknis (2002) ''The Storage Box of Tradition: Kwakiutl Art, Anthropologists, and Museums, 1881–1981''. (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Such historical concerns in turn intersect with work addressing repatriation claims and broader cultural property issues as these relate to museums.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Fine-Dare (2002) ''Grave injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA''. (Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Brown (2003) ''Who Owns Native Culture?'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of museum collections as a resource for research aimed at understanding ethnographic and culture historical questions in the lives of particular communities has long been the core motivation for collecting by anthropology museums. Such work has been central throughout the history of the field, but new developments in digital technologies (and the rise of the so-called [[digital humanities]]) together with the transformations that have motivated the new research interests just mentioned have generated an intensification of such work. A general revitalization of material culture studies is a further factor conditioning the renewal of collections-based research in the present period. The fruits of this work include new digital archives and databases, as well as published studies focusing on particular groups, object forms, and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chacoarchive.org/ The Chaco Research Archive].

== United Kingdom and North America ==
Professional organizations central to the museum anthropology domain include the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] (a section of the American Anthropological Association) in the United States and the [[Museum Ethnographers Group]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.museumethnographersgroup.org.uk/ Making connections through world collections]. Museum Ethnographers Group. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumanthropology.org/ The Council for Museum Anthropology]. Museumanthropology.org (2009-07-02). Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom and in North America, most universities that possess both anthropology degree programs and campus-based museums of anthropology will also offer specific training and coursework in museum anthropology. Specialized training for graduate students in collections-based research in museum anthropology (focusing on ethnographic rather than archaeological, biological, or linguistics collections) is provided in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA), an initiative funded by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.si.edu/summerinstitute/index.htm Smithsonian Institution Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology].

'''Nanoengineering''' is the practice of [[engineering]] on the [[nanoscale]]. It derives its name from the [[nanometre]], a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter.

Nanoengineering is largely a synonym for [[nanotechnology]], but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field.

==Degree programs==

{{Seealso|Nanotechnology education}}

The first nanoengineering program  was started at the [[University of Toronto]] within the Engineering Science program as one of the options of study in the final years. In 2003, the [[Lund Institute of Technology]] started a program in Nanoengineering. In 2004, the [[College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering]] at [[SUNY Polytechnic Institute]] was established on the campus of the [[University at Albany]]. In 2005, the [[University of Waterloo]] established a unique program which offers a full degree in Nanotechnology Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.nanotech.uwaterloo.ca/About_Nano_at_UW/
| title = Welcome to Nanotechnology Engineering at UW

| accessdate = 2008-10-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisiana Tech University]] started the first program in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006 the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] started a Bachelor and a Master program NanoEngineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.uni-due.de/nanoengineering/| title = NanoEngineering at University of Duisburg-Essen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike early NanoEngineering programs, the first Nanoengineering Department in the world, offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees, was established by the  [[University of California, San Diego]] in 2007.
In 2009, the [[University of Toronto]] began offering all Options of study in Engineering Science as degrees, bringing the second nanoengineering degree to Canada. Rice University  established in 2016 a Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering (MSNE).
DTU Nanotech - the Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology - is a department at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] established in 1990.

In 2013, [[Wayne State University]] began offering a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Certificate Program, which is funded by a Nanoengineering Undergraduate Education (NUE) grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]. The primary goal is to offer specialized undergraduate training in nanotechnology. Other goals are: 1) to teach emerging technologies at the undergraduate level, 2) to train a new adaptive workforce, and 3) to retrain working engineers and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.wayne.edu/nano/about.php/|title=Wayne State University Nanoengineering Certificate Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

* [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) - Can be used to both image, and to manipulate structures as small as a single atom.
* [[Molecular self-assembly]] - Arbitrary sequences of [[DNA]] can now be synthesized cheaply in bulk, and used to create custom proteins or regular patterns of amino acids. Similarly, DNA strands can bind to other DNA strands, allowing simple structures to be created.

[[Image:Wea02616 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|right|The National Data Buoy Center just after Hurricane Katrina]] 

The '''National Data Buoy Center''' ('''NDBC''') is a part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[National Weather Service]] (NWS). NDBC designs, develops, operates, and maintains a network of data collecting [[buoys]] and coastal stations. The NBDC is located in southern Mississippi as a tenant at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], a [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) facility.

== Operations ==
NDBC employs [[engineer]]s, [[meteorologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, and other professionals. 

NDBC provides hourly observations from a network of about 90 buoys and 60 [[Coastal Marine Automated Network]] (C-MAN) stations to help meet these needs. All stations measure [[wind]] speed, direction, and gust; [[atmospheric pressure]]; and air [[temperature]]. In addition, all [[weather buoy|buoy]] stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure [[sea surface temperature]] and [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations.

A new task is the operation of the '''DART''' ([[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]]) buoys.  DART is a fleet of tsunami detecting buoys.

Another task adopted in 2005 is '''TAO''' ([[Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project]]) buoys. TAO is a fleet of over 50 buoys moored in the Pacific Ocean.  These buoys are designed to help detect and predict [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] and [[La Niña]]. 

All buoys and many C-MAN stations located in offshore areas operate on marine batteries which are charged by [[solar cell]]s. Sensors are calibrated in wind tunnels or environmental chambers, and later tested with the onboard station microprocessors, called payloads, on test stands at the outside sensor test facility. Final calibration and testing of the completed buoy systems are accomplished in the onsite canal. All buoys are serviced about every two years for routine maintenance and to install newly calibrated sensors. 
[[Image:Discus buoy 42001.jpg|thumb|right|A typical deep-sea NDBC discus buoy in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]

The observations from moored buoys and C-MAN stations are transmitted hourly through NOAA [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]]s (GOES) to a ground receiving facility at [[Wallops Island, Virginia]], operated by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). Additionally, some buoys and C-MAN stations may use the [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium satellite system]] to transmit data. The data is recorded and processed by the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]].

Through a Memorandum of Agreement, the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) remains a critically important partner to NDBC, supplying transportation for buoy deployments, retrievals, and other maintenance.

== History ==
The National Data Buoy Development Program (NDBDP), created in 1967, was placed under the control of the USCG.

In 1970, NOAA was formed and the NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) was created within the National Ocean Service (NOS) and located in Mississippi. In 1982, the NDBO was renamed NDBC and was placed under NOAA's NWS.

The first buoys deployed by NDBC were the large 12-m discus hulls constructed of steel. These were generally deployed in deep water off the U.S. East Coast and in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. 

By 1979, 16 stations were deployed in the Pacific, 7 in the Atlantic, and 3 in the Gulf of Mexico. Eight more stations were deployed in the Great Lakes after 1979.

In 1995, development of the [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]] (DART) system began, with deployment beginning in 2000. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis, additional dart buoys were deployed.

== Location ==
NDBC's main office is located in southern Mississippi at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], a [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) facility. This site was chosen because it contains an excellent pre-existing industrial facility which is adjacent to a canal with deep-water access to the Gulf of Mexico. Other offices are located in Sterling, Virginia.

The '''Network of International Business Schools''' ('''NIBS''') is an association of university-level [[business school|schools of business]] that promotes the incorporation of a strong international dimension into [[management]] training and [[Educational accreditation|accredits]] schools that offer internationally oriented business [[Curriculum|curricula]].  NIBS and its various member institutions advocate for the creation of business education programs that integrate internationalist skills and perspectives, including the practice of foreign languages, the study of comparative management techniques, and the experience of working and studying abroad.  They also facilitate cooperation between educational institutions in different countries, on the premise that this contributes to better relations between nations by deepening understanding of other cultures and social practices.  NIBS was formed in 1993 and currently has approximately 70 member institutions in over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nibsweb.org/members.html |title= Member Schools |work= nibsweb.org |accessdate= April 11, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140946/http://www.nibsweb.org/members.html |archivedate= April 13, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of NIBS recognize each other’s qualifications, have a common goal of collaboration, and encourage participation in the following:

* Student exchanges/interactions 
* Faculty exchanges/interactions 
* Exchanges of ideas for teaching programs 
* Joint teaching and research programs

The current president of NIBS is Hans van Oudheusden, who also serves as Head of International Relations at the School of Financial Management, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Previously, the position was held by Dr. David Gillingham, who served in the role from its inception in 1993 until 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= David Gillingham Award|url= http://www.nibsweb.org/david-gillingham-award.html|accessdate= 11 April 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141520/http://www.nibsweb.org/david-gillingham-award.html|archivedate= 13 April 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Ian Charles, who led the organization from 2012 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= IBA Associate Dean is the new NIBS President|url= http://uk.iba.dk/news/143-iba-associate-dean-is-the-new-nibs-president/#143|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

Since 2008, a key function of the organization has been the accreditation of internationally oriented [[business school|schools of business]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nibsweb.org/accreditation/ |title=Accreditation|work= nibsweb.org |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NIBS accreditation is not intended to compete with long-established accreditation bodies, such as the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), or the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS); rather, it focuses on the degree to which the business school has become international in all facets of its organization. The NIBS accreditation scheme is thus generally regarded as a supplement to other accreditations, as well as a signal that an institution is committed to "deep" internationalization.

Any full member school of NIBS may apply for accreditation, which consists of a three-step process: completion of a self-assessment questionnaire on internationalization; a visit by an accreditation team; and a decision by the NIBS Board of Directors.  As of March 2018, a total of 24 institutions have been accredited by NIBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nibsweb.org/about/member-schools/ |title=Member Schools|work= nibsweb.org |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

The 2017 event will be held in [[Leeds]], UK, and will focus on the role of business schools in preparing students for a rapidly changing global economy. NIBS is also publisher of the ''NIBS Journal'', a peer-reviewed academic journal focused on advancing business theory and practice with relevance to international managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://beacon.salisbury.edu/nibsjournal/aboutnibsjournal.htm |title= The NIBS Journal Mission |work= salisbury.edu |accessdate= April 16, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180857/http://beacon.salisbury.edu/nibsjournal/aboutnibsjournal.htm |archivedate= April 16, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization also sponsors two student competitions aimed at cultivating skills in international business and raising awareness of the importance of an international perspective to management: A business plan competition, and a business [[case competition]].

===NIBS Worldwide Case Competition===
[[File:Students present at the NIBS Worldwide Case Competition.jpg|thumb|Presentation at the 2012 NIBS Worldwide Case Competition in Rotterdam, Netherlands]]
Founded in 1996, the NIBS Worldwide Case Competition is among the longest-running undergraduate business case competitions in the world.  In the current format, adopted in 2013, the event begins with a qualifying round, consisting of a written case analysis conducted under controlled conditions at participating universities.  The results of this qualifying round are then used to select the 16 teams that will advance to the championship round, which is held in a host city that rotates from year to year.  Past hosts of the championship round include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10230">In [[Big Bang]] [[cosmology]], '''neutrino decoupling''' refers to the epoch at which neutrinos ceased interacting with [[baryonic matter]], and thereby ceased influencing the dynamics of the universe at early times.&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to decoupling, [[neutrino]]s were in [[thermal equilibrium]] with [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s, which was maintained through the [[weak interaction]]. Decoupling occurred approximately at the time when the rate of those weak interactions was slower than the rate of [[expansion of the universe]]. Alternatively, it was the time when the time scale for weak interactions became greater than the age of the [[universe]] at that time. Neutrino decoupling took place approximately one second after the Big Bang, when the [[temperature]] of the universe was approximately 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[kelvin]]s, or 1 [[MeV]].&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later cosmic microwave background emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. They form the [[cosmic neutrino background]] (abbreviated CvB or CNB). The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so the CNB may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt; However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the CNB exists.

==Derivation of decoupling time==
Neutrinos are scattered (interfering with [[free streaming]]) by their interactions with [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s, such as the reaction

&lt;math&gt;e^- + e^+ \longleftrightarrow \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_e&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximate rate of these interactions is set by the [[number density]] of electrons and positrons, the averaged product of the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for interaction and the [[velocity]] of the particles. The number density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] electrons and positrons depends on the cube of the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;n \propto T^3&lt;/math&gt;. The product of the cross section and velocity for weak interactions for temperatures (energies) below W/Z boson masses (~100 GeV) is given approximately by &lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim G_F^2 T^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fermi's constant]] (as is standard in [[particle physics]] calculations, factors of the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are set equal to 1). Putting it all together, the rate of weak interactions &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = n \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim G_F^2 T^5&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be compared to the expansion rate which is given by the [[Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, with

&lt;math&gt;H = \sqrt{\frac{8\pi}{3}G \rho}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[energy density]] of the universe. At this point in cosmic history, the energy density is dominated by radiation, so that &lt;math&gt;\rho \propto T^4&lt;/math&gt;. As the rate of weak interaction depends more strongly on temperature, it will fall more quickly as the universe cools. Thus when the two rates are approximately equal (dropping terms of order [[unity (mathematics)|unity]], including an effective [[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] term which counts the number of states of particles which are interacting) gives the approximate temperature at which neutrinos decouple:

&lt;math&gt; G_F^2 T^5 \sim \sqrt{G T^4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving for temperature gives

&lt;math&gt;T \sim \left( \frac{\sqrt{G}}{G_F^2} \right) ^{1/3} \sim 1~\textrm{MeV}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;Bernstein (1989), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While this is a very rough derivation, it illustrates the important physical phenomena which determined when neutrinos decoupled.

==Observational evidence==
While neutrino decoupling can not be observed directly, it is expected to have left behind a [[cosmic neutrino background]], analogous to the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] which was emitted at a much later epoch. "The detection of the neutrino background is far beyond the capabilities of the present generation of neutrino detectors."&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; There is data, however, which indirectly indicates the presence of a neutrino background. One piece of evidence is damping of the angular [[power spectrum]] of the CMB, which results from anisotropies in the neutrino background.&lt;ref&gt;Trotta (2005), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indirect measurement of neutrino decoupling is allowed by the role that neutrino decoupling plays in setting the ratio of [[neutron]]s to [[proton]]s. Before decoupling, the number of neutrons and protons are maintained in their equilibrium abundances by weak interactions, specifically [[beta decay]] and [[electron capture]] (or inverse beta decay) according to

&lt;math&gt;n \leftrightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;p + e^- \leftrightarrow \nu_e + n&lt;/math&gt;.

Once the rate of weak interactions is slower than the characteristic rate of the expansion of the universe, this equilibrium cannot be maintained, and the abundance of neutrons to protons "freezes in," at a value

&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{n}{n + p}\right] = 0.21&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

This value is simply found by evaluating the [[Boltzmann factor]] for neutrons and protons at decoupling time, according to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_n(T)}{n_p(T)} = \exp\left(\frac{-\Delta m}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass difference between neutrons and protons and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at decoupling.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt; This ratio is critical to the synthesis of [[atom]]s during [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], the process which formed the majority of [[helium]] atoms in the universe, as it "is the dominant factor in determining the amount of helium produced."&lt;ref&gt;Grupen (2005), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; As helium atoms are stable, the neutrons are locked in, and [[beta decay]] of neutrons into protons, electrons, and neutrinos can no longer occur. Thus the abundance of neutrons remained essentially fixed to the present day. This abundance can be measured by [[astronomer]]s, and, as it was determined by the ratio of neutrons to protons at neutrino decoupling, the helium abundance indirectly measures the temperature at which neutrino decoupling took place, and is in agreement with the figure derived above.&lt;ref&gt;Longair (2006), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect evidence from phase changes to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)===

Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] - ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301 First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background] -
Follin, Knox, Millea, Pan, pub. 
Phys. Rev. Lett. 26 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

An '''Oblivious RAM (ORAM) simulator''' is a [[compiler]] that transforms [[algorithms]] in such a way that the resulting algorithms preserve the [[Input/output|input]]-[[output (computing)|output]] behavior of the original algorithm but the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of [[memory]] access pattern of the transformed algorithm is independent of the memory access pattern of the original algorithm. The definition of ORAMs is motivated by the fact that an adversary can obtain nontrivial information about the execution of a program and the nature of the [[data]] that it is dealing with, just by observing the pattern in which various locations of memory are accessed during its execution. An adversary can get this information even if the data values are all [[encryption|encrypted]]. The definition suits equally well to the settings of protected programs running on unprotected [[shared memory]] as well as a client running a program on its system by accessing previously stored data on a [[remote server]]. The concept was formulated by [[Oded Goldreich]] in 1987.&lt;ref name = "G87"&gt;[[Oded Goldreich]]. 1987. Towards a theory of software protection and simulation by oblivious RAMs. In Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (STOC '87), Alfred V. Aho (Ed.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 182-194. {{DOI|10.1145/28395.28416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Early solutions required the server to store  data items and each access to a data item actually required  data requests. Later work of Pinkas and Reinman brought this down to storage and requests, but their solution was insecure but an improvement later made this secure. There is a theoretical lower bound on the number of requests because the overhead arises out of which data oblivious sorting algorithm one chooses.&lt;ref&gt;Elette Boyle and [[Moni Naor]]. 2016. Is There an Oblivious RAM Lower Bound?. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS '16). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 357-368. {{DOI|10.1145/2840728.2840761}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Definition==

A [[Turing machine]] (TM), the mathematical abstraction of a real computer (program), is said to be [[Turing machine equivalents#Oblivious Turing machines|oblivious]] if for any two inputs of the same length, the motions of the tape heads remain the same. [[Nick Pippenger|Pippenger]] and Fischer&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Pippenger and Michael J. Fischer. 1979. Relations among complexity measures. Journal of ACM. DOI = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=322138&lt;/ref&gt; proved that every TM with running time &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt; can be made oblivious and that the running time of the oblivious TM is &lt;math&gt;O(T(n)\log T(n))&lt;/math&gt;. A more realistic model of computation is the [[RAM model]]. In the RAM model of computation, there is a [[CPU]] that can execute the basic mathematical, logical and control instructions. The CPU is also associated with a few [[Processor register|registers]] and a physical random access [[memory]], where it stores the operands of its instructions. The CPU in addition has instructions to read the contents of a memory cell and write a specific value to a memory cell. The definition of ORAMs capture a similar notion of obliviousness memory accesses in this model.

Informally, an ORAM is an algorithm at the interface of a protected CPU and the physical RAM such that it acts like a RAM to the CPU by querying the physical RAM for the CPU while hiding information about the actual memory access pattern of the CPU from the physical RAM. In other words, the distribution of memory accesses of two programs that make the same number of memory accesses to the RAM are indistinguishable from each other. This description will still make sense if the CPU is replaced by a client with a small storage and the physical RAM is replaced with a remote server with a large storage capacity, where the data of the client resides.

The following is a formal definition of ORAMs.&lt;ref name="CP13"&gt;Kai-Min Chung and Rafael Pass. 2013. A simple ORAM. IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive. DOI = http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/243&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; denote a program requiring a memory of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; when executing on an input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; has instructions for basic mathematical and control operations in addition to two special instructions &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; reads the value at location &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt; writes the value &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The sequence of memory cell accessed by a program &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; during its execution is called its memory access pattern and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi}(n,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial-time algorithm]], &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an Oblivious RAM (ORAM) compiler with computational overhead &lt;math&gt;c(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and memory overhead &lt;math&gt;m(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;n\in N&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic RAM program]] &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; with memory-size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; outputs a program &lt;math&gt;\Pi_0&lt;/math&gt; with memory-size &lt;math&gt;m(n)\cdot n&lt;/math&gt; such that for any input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the running-time of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_0(n, x)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by &lt;math&gt;c(n)\cdot T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the running-time of &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n, x)&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a [[negligible function]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that the following properties hold:
* '''Correctness:''' For any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and any string &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0, 1\}^*&lt;/math&gt;, with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1- \mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n, x) = \Pi_0(n, x)&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Obliviousness:''' For any two programs &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1, \Pi_2&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and any two inputs, &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2 \in \{0, 1\}^*&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|\tilde{\Pi}_1(n, x_1)| = |\tilde{\Pi}_2(n, x_2)|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{\Pi}_1}'(n, x_1)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-close to &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{\Pi}_2}'(n, x_2)&lt;/math&gt; in [[statistical distance]], where &lt;math&gt;{\Pi_1}' = C(n, \Pi_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\Pi_2}' = C(n, \Pi_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the above definition uses the notion of [[Information-theoretic security|statistical security]]. One can also have a similar definition for the notion of [[Semantic security|computational security]].

==History of ORAMs==

ORAMs were introduced by [[Oded Goldreich|Goldreich]] and [[Rafail Ostrovsky|Ostrovsky]]&lt;ref name = "G87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O90"&gt;Rafail  Ostrovsky.   Efficient  computation  on  oblivious  rams.   In Proceedings  of the 22nd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, May 13–17, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GO96"&gt;Oded Goldreich and Rafail Ostrovsky.  Software protection and simulation on oblivious rams. Journal of ACM.1996&lt;/ref&gt; where in the key motivation was stated as software protection from an adversary who can observe the memory access pattern (but not the contents of the memory).

The main result in this work&lt;ref name="GO96"/&gt; is that there exists an ORAM compiler that uses &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; server space and incurs a running time overhead of &lt;math&gt;2^{O(\sqrt{\log n \log \log n})}&lt;/math&gt; when making a program that uses &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; memory cells oblivious. This work initiated a series of works in the construction of oblivious RAMs that is going on till date. There are several attributes that need to be considered when we compare various ORAM constructions. The most important parameters of an ORAM construction are the amounts of client storage, the amount of server storage and the time overhead in making one memory access. Based on these attributes, the construction of Kushilevitz et al.&lt;ref name="KLO12"&gt;Eyal Kushilevitz, Steve Lu, and Rafail Ostrovsky.  On the (in) security of hash-based oblivious ram and a new balancing scheme.  In Proceedings of the twenty-third  annual  ACM-SIAM  symposium  on  Discrete  Algorithms. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; is the best known ORAM construction. It achieves &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; client storage, &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; server storage and &lt;math&gt;o(\log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; access overhead.

Another important attribute of an ORAM construction is whether the access overhead is [[amortized]] or [[worst-case]]. Several of the earlier ORAM constructions have good amortized access overhead guarantees, but have &lt;math&gt;\Omega(N)&lt;/math&gt; worst-case access overheads. Some of the ORAM constructions with [[Time complexity#Polylogarithmic time|polylogarithmic]] worst-case computational overheads are.&lt;ref name ="KLO12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OS97"&gt;Rafail Ostrovsky and Victor Shoup.

They also noted that this oracle could be replaced by a pseudorandom function whose seed is a secret key stored by the client, if one assumes the existence of one-way functions.

Perfectly secure oblivious RAM without random oracles. In Theory of  Cryptography Conference,  TCC. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; were aimed at removing this assumption completely. The authors of&lt;ref name = "DMN11" /&gt; also achieve an access overhead of &lt;math&gt;O(\log^3 n)&lt;/math&gt;, which is just a log-factor away from the best known ORAM access overhead.

While most of the earlier works focus on proving security computationally, there are more recent works&lt;ref name ="CP13" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="SCSL11" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="A10" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="DMN11" /&gt; that use the stronger statistical notion of security.

One of the only known lower bounds on the access overhead of ORAMs is due to Goldreich et al.&lt;ref name ="GO96" /&gt; They show a &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\log{n})&lt;/math&gt; lower bound for ORAM access overhead, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the data size. There is also a conditional lower bound on the access overhead of ORAMs due to Boyle et al.&lt;ref name ="BN16"&gt;Elette Boyle and Moni Naor.  Is there an oblivious RAM lower bound?  In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; that relates this quantity with that of the size of sorting networks.

==ORAM Constructions==

===Trivial construction===

A trivial ORAM simulator construction, for each read or write operation, reads from and writes to every single element in the array, only performing a meaningful action for the address specified in that single operation. The trivial solution thus, scans through the entire memory for each operation. This scheme incurs a time overhead of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; for each memory operation, where {{mvar|n}} is the size of the memory.

===A simple ORAM scheme===

A simple version of a statistically secure ORAM compiler constructed by Chung and Pass&lt;ref name = "CP13"/&gt; is described in the following along with an overview of the proof of its correctness. The compiler on input {{mvar|n}} and a program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} with its memory requirement {{mvar|n}}, outputs an equivalent oblivious program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}.

If the input program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} uses {{mvar|r}} registers, the output program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} will need &lt;math&gt;r+n/{\alpha}+\text{poly}\log{n}&lt;/math&gt; registers, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter of the construction. {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} uses &lt;math&gt;O(n \text{ poly} \log n)&lt;/math&gt; memory and its (worst-case) access overhead is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ORAM compiler is very simple to describe. Suppose that the original program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} has instructions for basic mathematical and control operations in addition to two special instructions &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; reads the value at location {{mvar|l}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt; writes the value {{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|l}}. The ORAM compiler, when constructing {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}, simply replaces each {{sans-serif|read}} and {{sans-serif|write}} instructions with subroutines {{sans-serif|Oread}} and {{sans-serif|Owrite}} and keeps the rest of the program the same. It may be noted that this construction can be made to work even for memory requests coming in an [[Online algorithm|online]] fashion.

[[File:ORAM-view.pdf|thumb|The ORAM compiler substitutes the read and write instructions in the original program with subroutines Oread and Owrite.]]

====Memory organization of the oblivious program====

The program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} stores a complete binary tree {{mvar|T}} of depth &lt;math&gt;d=\log (n/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; in its memory. Each node in {{mvar|T}} is represented by a binary string of length at most {{mvar|d}}. The root is the empty string, denoted by {{mvar|&amp;lambda;}}. The left and right children of a node represented by the string &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} thinks of the memory of {{math|&amp;Pi;}} as being partitioned into blocks, where each block is a contiguous sequence of memory cells of size {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}}. Thus, there are at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil n /\alpha \rceil&lt;/math&gt; blocks in total. In other words, the memory cell {{mvar|r}} corresponds to block &lt;math&gt;b=\lfloor r/\alpha \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.

At any point of time, there is an association between the blocks and the leaves in {{mvar|T}}.
To keep track of this association, {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} also stores a data structure called position map, denoted by &lt;math&gt;Pos&lt;/math&gt;, using &lt;math&gt;O(n/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; registers. This data structure, for each block {{mvar|b}}, stores the leaf of {{mvar|T}} associated with {{mvar|b}} in &lt;math&gt;Pos(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Each node in {{mvar|T}} contains an array with at most {{mvar|K}} triples. Each triple is of the form &lt;math&gt;(b,Pos(b),v)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|b}} is a block identifier and {{mvar|v}} is the contents of the block. Here, {{mvar|K}} is a security parameter and is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly} \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Description of the oblivious program====

The program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} starts by initializing its memory as well as registers to {{math|&amp;perp;}}. Describing the procedures {{sans-serif|Owrite}} and {{sans-serif|Oread}} is enough to complete the description of {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}. The sub-routine {{sans-serif|Owrite}} is given below. The inputs to the sub-routine are a memory location &lt;math&gt;l \in [n]&lt;/math&gt; and the value {{mvar|v}} to be stored at the location {{mvar|l}}. It has three main phases, namely FETCH, PUT_BACK and FLUSH.

     '''input:''' a location {{mvar|l}}, a value {{mvar|v}}

     '''Procedure FETCH'''     // &lt;u&gt;Search for the required block.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;b\leftarrow \lfloor l/ \alpha \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;          // &lt;u&gt;{{mvar|b}} is the block containing {{mvar|l}}.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;i\leftarrow l\mod \alpha&lt;/math&gt;          // &lt;u&gt;{{mvar|i}} is {{mvar|l}}'s component in the block {{mvar|b}}.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;pos\leftarrow Pos(b)&lt;/math&gt;
          '''if''' &lt;math&gt;pos =\perp&lt;/math&gt; '''then''' &lt;math&gt;pos\leftarrow_R [n/ \alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.          // &lt;u&gt;Set &lt;math&gt;pos&lt;/math&gt; to a uniformly random leaf in {{mvar|T}}.&lt;/u&gt;
          flag &lt;math&gt;\leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.
          '''for''' each node {{mvar|N}} on the path the path from root to &lt;math&gt;pos&lt;/math&gt; '''do'''
               '''if''' {{mvar|N}} has a triple of the form &lt;math&gt;(b,pos,x)&lt;/math&gt; '''then'''
                    Remove &lt;math&gt;(b,pos,x)&lt;/math&gt; from {{mvar|N}}, store {{mvar|x}} in a register, and write back the updated {{mvar|N}} to {{mvar|T}}.
                    flag &lt;math&gt;\leftarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;.
               '''else'''
                    Write back {{mvar|N}} to {{mvar|T}}.
     '''Procedure PUT_BACK'''     // &lt;u&gt;Add back the updated block at the root.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;pos'\leftarrow_R [n/ \alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.     // &lt;u&gt;Set &lt;math&gt;pos'&lt;/math&gt; to a uniformly random leaf in {{mvar|T}}.&lt;/u&gt;
          '''if''' flag&lt;math&gt;=1&lt;/math&gt; '''then'''
               Set &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; to be same as {{mvar|x}} except for {{mvar|v}} at the {{mvar|i}}-th position.
          '''else'''
               Set &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; to be a block with {{mvar|v}} at {{mvar|i}}-th position and {{math|&amp;perp;}}'s everywhere else.
          '''if''' there is space left in the root '''then'''
               Add the triple &lt;math&gt;(b,pos',x')&lt;/math&gt; to the root of {{mvar|T}}.
          '''else'''
               Abort outputting '''overflow'''.
     '''Procedure FLUSH'''     // &lt;u&gt;Push the blocks present in a random path as far down as possible.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;pos^*\leftarrow_R [n/ \alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.     // &lt;u&gt;Set &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt; to a uniformly random leaf in {{mvar|T}}.&lt;/u&gt;
          '''for''' each triple &lt;math&gt;(b'',pos'',v'')&lt;/math&gt; in the nodes traversed the path from root to &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt;
               Push down this triple to the node {{mvar|N}} that corresponds to the longest common prefix of &lt;math&gt;pos''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt;.
               '''if''' at any point some bucket is about to overflow '''then'''
                    Abort outputting '''overflow'''.

The task of the FETCH phase is to look for the location {{mvar|l}} in the tree {{mvar|T}}. Suppose &lt;math&gt;pos&lt;/math&gt; is the leaf associated with the block containing location {{mvar|l}}. For each node {{mvar|N}} in {{mvar|T}} on the path from root to &lt;math&gt;pos&lt;/math&gt;, this procedure goes over all triples in {{mvar|N}} and looks for the triple corresponding to the block containing {{mvar|l}}. If it finds that triple in {{mvar|N}}, it removes the triple from {{mvar|N}} and writes back the updated state of {{mvar|N}}.  Otherwise, it simply writes back the whole node {{mvar|N}}.

In the next phase, it updates the block containing {{mvar|l}} with the new value {{mvar|v}}, associates that block with a freshly sampled uniformly random leaf of the tree, writes back the updated triple to the root of {{mvar|T}}.

The last phase, which is called FLUSH, is an additional operation to release the memory cells in the root and other higher internal nodes. Specifically, the algorithm chooses a uniformly random leaf &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt; and then tries to push down every node as much as possible along the path from root to &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt;. It aborts outputting an overflow if at any point some bucket is about to overflow its capacity.

The sub-routine {{sans-serif|Oread}} is similar to {{sans-serif|Owrite}}. For the {{sans-serif|Oread}} sub-routine, the input is just a memory location &lt;math&gt;l \in [n]&lt;/math&gt; and it is almost the same as {{sans-serif|Owrite}}. In the FETCH stage, if it does not find a triple corresponding to the location {{mvar|l}}, it returns {{math|&amp;perp;}} as the value at location {{mvar|l}}. In the PUT_BACK phase, it will write back the same block that it read to the root, after associating it with a freshly sampled uniformly random leaf.

====Correctness of the simple ORAM scheme====

Let {{mvar|C}} stand for the ORAM compiler that was described above. Given a program {{math|&amp;Pi;}}, let {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} denote &lt;math&gt;C(\Pi)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the execution of the program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} on an input {{mvar|x}} using {{mvar|n}} memory cells. Also, let &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi}(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the memory access pattern of &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n,x)&lt;/math&gt;. Let {{mvar|&amp;mu;}} denote a function such that for any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, for any program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} and for any input &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that &lt;math&gt;\Pi'(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; outputs an overflow is at most &lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The following lemma is easy to see from the description of {{mvar|C}}.

;Equivalence Lemma: Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt;. Given a program {{math|&amp;Pi;}}, with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1 - \mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the output of &lt;math&gt;\Pi'(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; is identical to the output of &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to see that each {{sans-serif|Owrite}} and {{sans-serif|Oread}} operation traverses root to leaf paths in {{mvar|T}} chosen uniformly and independently at random. 
This fact implies that the distribution of memory access patterns of any two programs that make the same number of memory accesses are indistinguishable, if they both do not overflow.

;Obliviousness Lemma: Given two programs {{tmath|\Pi_1}} and {{tmath|\Pi_2}} and two inputs &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2 \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|\tilde{\Pi_1}(x_1,n)| = |\tilde{\Pi_2}(x_2,n)|&lt;/math&gt;, with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1 - 2\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the access patterns &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi_1'}(x_1,n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi_2'}(x_2,n)&lt;/math&gt; are identical.

The following lemma completes the proof of correctness of the ORAM scheme.

;Overflow Lemma:There exists a negligible function {{mvar|&amp;mu;}} such that for very program {{math|&amp;Pi;}}, every {{mvar|n}} and input {{mvar|x}}, the program &lt;math&gt;\Pi'(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; outputs overflow with probability at most &lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Computational and memory overheads====

During each {{sans-serif|Oread}} and {{sans-serif|Owrite}} operation, two random root-to-leaf paths of {{mvar|T}} are fully explored by {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}. This takes &lt;math&gt;O(K\cdot\log (n/\alpha))&lt;/math&gt; time. This is the same as the computational overhead, and is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt; since {{mvar|K}} is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The total memory used up by {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} is equal to the size of {{mvar|T}}. Each triple stored in the tree has &lt;math&gt;\alpha + 2&lt;/math&gt; words in it and thus there are &lt;math&gt;K(\alpha + 2)&lt;/math&gt; words per node of the tree. Since the total number of nodes in the tree is &lt;math&gt;O(n/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, the total memory size is &lt;math&gt;O(nK)&lt;/math&gt; words, which is &lt;math&gt;O(n\text{ poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the memory overhead of the construction is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- 
==Definition==
Suppose RAM: &lt;math&gt;[1, 2, 3, ..., n]&lt;/math&gt;;

Sequence: S= &lt;math&gt;[OP_1, OP_2, OP_3, ..., OP_m]&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;OP_i&lt;/math&gt; is read [address] or write [address, data] operation;

There are various sequences of operations that result in the same configuration of RAM. We want an algorithm that, given sequence S, produces another [[sequence]] S’ that performs the same task in a RAM-Oblivious way. In other words, the access pattern of S' is independent of S. Thus, the RAM is Oblivious RAM.

The definition of a memory oblivious algorithm is as follows: “A program P is ‘memory oblivious’ if the memory access pattern is independent of input S”. Formally speaking, let Access Pattern AP(x) be the sequence of memory accesses for program P with input x.

P is memory oblivious means &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y ((x\neq y)\and(\left\vert x \right\vert = \left\vert y \right\vert)) \Longrightarrow AP(x) \approx AP(y)&lt;/math&gt;

This definition of memory oblivious helps us state the definition of Oblivious RAM problem as: Given a program P, what is the most efficient program Q=P such that Q is memory oblivious. In this case, once the inputs are same, we can get identical outputs.

==Formal Definition==
We begin by defining the access pattern at the sequence of memory locations which the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] accesses during computation. This definition applies also to an oracle-CPU (The CPU interaction with MEMORY is a sequence of triples &lt;math&gt;(i, a, v)&lt;/math&gt; of “instruction”, “address” and “values” respectively).

Definition of Access Pattern: The access pattern, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^k(y)&lt;/math&gt;, of a deterministic &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}} is a sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_1,...,a_i,...)&lt;/math&gt;, such that for every {{mvar|i}}, the &lt;math&gt;i-th&lt;/math&gt; message sent by &lt;math&gt;CPU_k&lt;/math&gt;, when interacting with &lt;math&gt;MEM_k(y)&lt;/math&gt;, is of the form&lt;math&gt;(.,a_i,.)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we can define the access pattern of an &lt;math&gt;oracle-RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on a specific input {{mvar|y}} and access to a specific function {{mvar|f}}.

Considering the probabilistic-RAMs, we define a [[random variable]] which for every possible function {{mvar|f}} assigns the access pattern which corresponds to computations in which the RAM has access to this function.

Definition of Access Pattern of a Probabilistic-RAM: The access pattern, denoted &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y)}&lt;/math&gt;, of a probabilistic-&lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}} is a random variable which assumes the value of the access pattern of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on a specific input {{mvar|y}} and access to a uniformly selected function {{mvar|f}}.

Now, we are ready to define an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;. We define an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt; to be a probabilistic &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; for which the [[probability distribution]] of the sequence of [[memory address]]es accessed during an execution depends only on the [[running time]](i.e., is independent of particular input).

Formal definition of &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;: For every &lt;math&gt;k\in N&lt;/math&gt;, we define an oblivious &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; as a probabilistic-&lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following condition. For every two strings, &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\left\vert {\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_1)} \right\vert&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\vert {\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_2)} \right\vert&lt;/math&gt; are identically distributed then so are &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_2)}&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, the sequence of memory accesses of an oblivious &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; reveals no information about the input( to the &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;), beyond the running-time for the input.

===Oblivious simulation===
Now that we have define both &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;, it is left only specify what is meant by an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;Simulation&lt;/math&gt;of an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; program on an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;, our notion of simulation is minimal one: it only requires that both machines compute the same function. The &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; simulation presented in the sequel are simulations in a much stronger sense: specifically, they are “on-line”. On the other hand, an oblivious simulation of a &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; is not merely a simulation by an oblivious RAM. In addition, we require that inputs having identical running-time on the original &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt;, maintain identical running-time on the Oblivious &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt;, so that the obliviously condition applies to them in a non-vacuous manner. For the sake of simplicity, we present only definition for oblivious simulation of deterministic RAMs.

Definition of &lt;math&gt;Oblivious&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;Simulation&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt;: Given &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;,  we say that a &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, obliviously simulates &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; if the following conditions hold.

1.    The &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; simulates &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; with probability 1. In other words, for every input y, and every choice of an oracle function {{mvar|f}}, the output of &lt;math&gt;oracle-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, on input {{mvar|y}} and access to oracle {{mvar|f}}, equals the output of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}}.

2.    The &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; is oblivious. (We stress that we refer here to the access pattern of &lt;math&gt;RAM'_{K'}&lt;/math&gt; on a fixed input and a randomly chosen oracle function.)

3.    The random variable representing the running-time of &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;  is fully specifies by the running-time &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; (on input {{mvar|y}}).(Here again we refer to the behavior of &lt;math&gt;RAM'_{K'}&lt;/math&gt; on fixed input and a randomly chosen oracle function.)

Hence, the access pattern in an oblivious simulation (which is a random variable defined over the choice of the random oracle) has a distribution depending only on the running-time of the original machine. Namely, let &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the access pattern in an oblivious simulation of the computation of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}}. Then, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_2)}&lt;/math&gt; are identically distributed if the running-time of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on these inputs (i,e., &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;) is identical.

We note that in order to define oblivious simulations of &lt;math&gt;oracle-RAMs&lt;/math&gt;, we have to supply the simulating &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; with two oracles (i.e., one identical to the oracle of the simulated machine and the other being a random oracle). Besides, these two oracles can be incorporated into one, but in any case the formulation will be slightly more cumbersome.

We need to define the overhead of oblivious simulation.

Definition of Overhead of Oblivious Simulations:

Given &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose that a &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, obliviously simulates the computation of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;, and let y: &lt;math&gt;g: \Bbbk\mapsto\Bbbk&lt;/math&gt; be a function. We say that the overhead of the simulation is at most {{mvar|g}} if, for every {{mvar|y}}, the expected running-time of &lt;math&gt;RAM'_{K'}&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}} is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;g(T)\cdot T&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|T}} denoted the running-time of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}}.

===Solution===

====Computer model construction====
* Two parts: [[Computer memory|Memory]] and [[Central processing unit|Processors]]
* Internal memory of process: &lt;math&gt;c\log\left\vert Memory \right\vert&lt;/math&gt;
* Interaction:  &lt;math&gt;fetch(address)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;store(address, value)&lt;/math&gt;
* Processor has access to random oracle
* Computation starts with a program and an input in &lt;math&gt;Memory&lt;/math&gt;
* One step: fetch one cell - update value and Processor memory - store

====Oblivious execution====
We want to hide orders of access to cells of &lt;math&gt;Memory&lt;/math&gt;, thus we define Oblivious Execution as for all programs of size {{mvar|m}} working in time {{mvar|t}}, an order of fetch/store address is the same. The weaker requirement is for all programs of size {{mvar|m}} working in time {{mvar|t}}, order of fetch/store address has the same distribution.

====Basic solution====

=====Naive simulation=====
# We store encrypted pairs(address, value) in memory cells 
# For every fetch/store we scan through all memory. If the address is wrong, re-encrypt and store the data, otherwise, do the job which means encrypt and store the results.
Cost of simulation: &lt;math&gt;tm&lt;/math&gt; time, {{mvar|m}} memory

=====Square root solution=====
We need to protect order of accesses and number of accesses. Because &lt;math&gt;Memory = Main Part (m + \sqrt{m}) \mid Shelter \sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt;, the idea comes that: firstly we divide computation in epochs of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; steps each. Then on each original step, we make one fetch to the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt; and scan through all the &lt;math&gt;Shelter&lt;/math&gt;.

Square Root simulation 
# Store input in the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt;
# Add &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; dummy cells to the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt;
# for every epoch of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; steps
## Permute all cells in the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt;(using [[permutation]] {{math|&amp;Pi;}} from random oracle)
## For each process({{mvar|i}}) scan through the &lt;math&gt;Shelter&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;i-th&lt;/math&gt; element is not founded, fetch it from &lt;math&gt;\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise fetch next dummy cell
## Update(Obliviously) the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt; using the &lt;math&gt;Shelter&lt;/math&gt; values
Cost of simulation: &lt;math&gt;t\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;math&gt;m + 2\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; memory

=====Buffer solution=====
Buffer solution refers to Oblivious [[Hash table|Hash Table]]. Suppose we have a memory of initial program: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, v_1), ..., (a_m, v_m)&lt;/math&gt;
# Take a [[hash function]] h : &lt;math&gt;[1...m]\rightarrow[1...m]&lt;/math&gt;
# Prepare &lt;math&gt;m \times \log m&lt;/math&gt; table
# Put &lt;math&gt;(a_i, v_i)&lt;/math&gt; to a random free call in &lt;math&gt;h(a_i)-th&lt;/math&gt; column
# The chance of overflow is less than &lt;math&gt;1/m&lt;/math&gt;
Simulation:
# Construct (obliviously) a hash table
# For every step &lt;math&gt;fetch(i)&lt;/math&gt; of initial program
## Scan through &lt;math&gt;h(i)&lt;/math&gt; column
## Update the target cell
Cost of simulation : &lt;math&gt;t \log m&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;math&gt;m \log m&lt;/math&gt; memory

====Hierarchical construction====
Data structure : [[Oblivious data structure|Oblivious Data Structure]]
* &lt;math&gt;k-buffer&lt;/math&gt; = table &lt;math&gt;2^k \times k&lt;/math&gt;
* Hierarchical Buffer Structure = &lt;math&gt;1-buffer, ..., \log t-buffer&lt;/math&gt;
* Initial position : input in last buffer, all others are empty

=====Hierarchical simulation=====
Simulation of processing cell {{mvar|i}}:
# Scan through &lt;math&gt;1-buffer&lt;/math&gt;
# For every j scan through &lt;math&gt;h(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;-th column in &lt;math&gt;j-buffer&lt;/math&gt;
# Put the updated value to the first buffer

=====Periodic rehashing=====
Refreshing the data structure:
# Every &lt;math&gt;2^{j-1}&lt;/math&gt; steps unify {{mvar|j}}-th and &lt;math&gt;j-1&lt;/math&gt;-th buffer
# Delete doubles
# Using new hash function put all data to &lt;math&gt;j-th&lt;/math&gt; level
Invariant: For every moment of time for every {{mvar|I}} buffers from 1 to {{mvar|I}} all together contain at most &lt;math&gt;2^{I-1}&lt;/math&gt; elements.

Cost of simulation: &lt;math&gt;O(t \cdot (\log t)^3)&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;math&gt;O(m \cdot (\log m)^2)&lt;/math&gt; memory

Omitted details: realization of oblivious hashing and random oracle

===Sorting network===
When allowing for parallel comparators, we can trivially sort an array in O(n) time. But there are much better [[sorting networks]]. Optimally, there is a way to getting O(n logn) comparisons in O(logn) parallel time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/800061.808726| title = An {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} sorting network| work = Proceedings of the fifteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing | conference = [[Symposium on Theory of Computing|STOC]] '83| pages = 1–9| year = 1983| last1 = Ajtai | first1 = M. |author-link1 = Miklós Ajtai| last2 = Komlós | first2 = J. |author-link2 = János Komlós (mathematician)| last3 = Szemerédi | first3 = E. |author-link3 = Endre Szemerédi| isbn = 0-89791-099-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

'''Programme level''' refers to the [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] level that an [[sound|audio]] source is transmitted or recorded at, and is important in audio if listeners of [[Compact Disc]]s (CDs), [[radio]] and [[television]] are to get the best experience, without excessive [[noise]] in quiet periods or distortion of loud sounds. Programme level is often measured using a [[peak programme meter]] or a [[VU meter]].

The level of an audio signal is among the most basic of measurements, and yet widespread misunderstanding and disagreement about programme levels has become arguably the greatest single obstacle to high quality [[sound reproduction]].

== How it works ==
Live sound covers an enormous range of levels, but this is not something that can be demonstrated with a conventional [[sound level meter]]. Sound level meters respond quite slowly, even on a "fast" setting: they use a [[root mean square]] (RMS) rectifier which by definition must take a slow running average of the square of the input voltage. Music is complex, and constantly varying, with brief peaks originating from many sources including the initial impact of sticks on [[cymbal]]s and [[drum]]s. A loud [[Band (music)|band]] might measure 100&amp;nbsp;[[dB SPL]] on a sound level meter, yet have peaks reaching 130&amp;nbsp;dB SPL or higher.

A recording system must handle these peaks; they can be measured using a peak responding meter with an integration time of 0.5&amp;nbsp;ms or less (not a standard IEC type PPM which has a longer integration time).

The [[sound level meter]] is useless for properly assessing noise levels, since the commonly used [[A-weighting]] is based on equal-loudness contours for pure tones, and is not valid for the random noise.

The subjective [[loudness]] of noise is best measured using a noise-meter to the [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] standard. The chart below shows, on this basis, the real range of live music, and then the level capabilities of various stages in the audio chain, from [[microphone]] to [[loudspeaker]].

== Analysing programme levels ==
[[File:Lindos10.svg|thumb]]
This chart is based on the assumption that what goes in should come out—true high-fidelity—and so an [[Alignment level|Alignment Level]] (AL) corresponding to 100&amp;nbsp;dB SPL has been assumed throughout. Any lower level would imply severe clipping at the first stage; the master recording. Top quality [[microphone]]s do not present a problem; most will handle 130&amp;nbsp;dB SPL without severe [[distortion]], and a few manage more than 140&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.

The [[master recording]] process, using current 24-bit techniques, offers around 99&amp;nbsp;dB of "true" dynamic range (based on the ''ITU-R&amp;nbsp;468 noise weighting'' standard); identical to the dynamic range of a good studio microphone, though very few recordings will use just one microphone, and so the noise on most recordings is likely to be the sum of several microphones after mixing, and probably at least 6&amp;nbsp;dB worse than shown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14544">'''Reductive dechlorination''' is [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of [[chlorinated]] organic compounds by [[chemical reduction]] with release of inorganic [[chloride]] ions by [[reductive dehalogenases]].

== Biological ==
In a biological context [[chlorine]] behaves similarly to other [[atom]]s in the [[halogen]] chemical series, and thus reductive dechlorination can be considered to fall within a somewhat broader class of biological reactions known as [[reductive dehalogenation]] reactions, in which the removal of a halogen substituent from an organic molecule occurs with a simultaneous addition of electrons to the molecule. This can be further subdivided into two types of reaction processes, the first of which, hydrogenolysis, is the replacement of the halogen atom with a [[hydrogen]] atom. The second, vicinal reduction (sometimes called, dihaloelimination), involves the removal of two halogen atoms that are adjacent on the same [[alkane]] or [[alkene]] molecule, leading to the formation of an additional carbon-carbon bond.&lt;ref&gt;Mohn and Tiedje. Microbial reductive dehalogenation. Microbiol Rev (1992) vol. 56 (3) pp. 482-507 {{PMID|1406492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological reductive dechlorination is often catalyzed by certain species of [[bacteria]]. Sometimes the bacterial species are highly specialized for organochlorine respiration and even a particular electron donor, as in the case of ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' and ''[[Dehalobacter]]''. In other examples, such as ''[[Anaeromyxobacter]]'', bacteria have been isolated that are capable of using a variety of electron donors and acceptors, with a subset of possible electron acceptors being organochlorines.&lt;ref&gt;Smidt and de Vos. Anaerobic microbial dehalogenation. Annu Rev Microbiol (2004) vol. 58 pp. 43-73 {{PMID|15487929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These reactions depend on a molecule which tends to be [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170131080152.htm very aggressively sought after] by some microbes, [[vitamin B12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/with-help-from-bacteria-biochemists-learn-how-to-break-up-environmental-toxins | title=The Secret to Degrading PCBs and Dioxins is in How Bacteria Breathe| date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioremediation using reductive dechlorination'''

In many instances, microbiological reductive dechlorination of chlorinated organic molecules is important for [[bioremediation]] of polluted groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-10-01|title=Reductive Dehalogenases Come of Age in Biological Destruction of Organohalides|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779915001560|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=595–610|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|pmid=26409778|issn=0167-7799|last1=Jugder|first1=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Lee|first3=Matthew|last4=Manefield|first4=Michael|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Bohl|first3=Susanne|last4=Lee|first4=Matthew|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.|last6=Manefield|first6=Michael|date=2016|title=Organohalide Respiring Bacteria and Reductive Dehalogenases: Key Tools in Organohalide Bioremediation|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=English|volume=7|pages=249|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00249|pmid=26973626|pmc=4771760|issn=1664-302X}}&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly important example for public health&lt;ref&gt;Kielhorn et al.

Environ Health Perspect (2000) vol. 108 (7) pp. 579-88 {{PMID|10905993}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the organochloride respiration of the dry-cleaning solvent, [[tetrachloroethylene]] (PCE), and the engine degreasing solvent [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE) by naturally occurring [[anaerobic bacteria]], often members of the candidate genera ''Dehalococcoides''. Bioremediation of these [[chloroethene]]s can occur when other microorganisms at the contaminated site provide H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a natural byproduct of various [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] reactions. The dechlorinating bacteria use this H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as their electron donor, ultimately replacing [[chlorine]] atoms in the chloroethenes with hydrogen atoms via hydrogenolytic reductive dechlorination. If the soil and groundwater contain enough organic electron donor and the appropriate strains of ''Dehalococcoides'', this process can proceed until all of the chlorine atoms are removed, and TCE is dechlorinated completely via [[dichloroethene]] (DCE) and [[vinyl chloride]] (VC) to [[ethene]], a harmless end-product.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty. Breathing with chlorinated solvents. Science (1997) vol. 276 (5318) pp. 1521-2 {{PMID|9190688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a [[chloroform]]-degrading reductive dehalogenase enzyme has been reported in a ''[[Dehalobacter]]'' member. The chloroform reductive dehalogenase, termed TmrA, was found to be transcriptional up-regulated in response to chloroform respiration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Wong|first3=Yie Kuan|last4=Braidy|first4=Nady|last5=Manefield|first5=Michael|last6=Marquis|first6=Christopher P.|last7=Lee|first7=Matthew|date=2016-08-10|title=Genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses ofDehalobacterUNSWDHB in response to chloroform|journal=Environmental Microbiology Reports|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=814–824|doi=10.1111/1758-2229.12444|pmid=27452500|issn=1758-2229}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the enzyme can be obtained both in native&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Bohl|first2=Susanne|last3=Lebhar|first3=Helene|last4=Healey|first4=Robert D.|last5=Manefield|first5=Mike|last6=Marquis|first6=Christopher P.|last7=Lee|first7=Matthew|date=2017-06-20|title=A bacterial chloroform reductive dehalogenase: purification and biochemical characterization|journal=Microbial Biotechnology|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=1640–1648|doi=10.1111/1751-7915.12745|issn=1751-7915|pmc=5658581|pmid=28631300}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Recombinant protein production|recombinant]] forms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Payne|first2=Karl A.

Additionally, reductive dechlorination can be further used in bioremediation of other [[toxin]]s such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]]. The reductive dechlorination of PCBs is performed by anaerobic microorganisms that utilize the PCB as an electron sink. The result of this is the reduction of the "meta" site, followed by the "para" site, and finally the "ortho" site, leading to a dechlorinated product.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=Rayford B.|last2=May|first2=Harold D.|last3=Sowers|first3=Kevin R.|date=2011-10-15|title=Enhanced Reductive Dechlorination of Polychlorinated Biphenyl Impacted Sediment by Bioaugmentation with a Dehalorespiring Bacterium|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=20|pages=8772–8779|doi=10.1021/es201553c|pmid=21902247|issn=0013-936X|pmc=3210572|bibcode=2011EnST...45.8772P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiedje|first1=James M.|last2=Quensen|first2=John F.|last3=Chee-Sanford|first3=Joann|last4=Schimel|first4=Joshua P.|last5=Boyd|first5=Stephen A.|title=Microbial reductive dechlorination of PCBs|journal=Biodegradation|date=1994|volume=4|issue=4|pages=231–240|doi=10.1007/BF00695971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=QUENSEN|first1=J.

==Electrochemical==

The [[electrochemical reduction]] of chlorinated chemicals such as [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]) can be carried out by [[electrolysis]] in appropriate solvents, such as mixtures of water and alcohol. Some of the key components of an electrolytic cell are types of electrodes, electrolyte mediums, and use of mediators. The [[cathode]] transfers electrons to the molecule, which decomposes to produce the corresponding hydrocarbon (hydrogen atoms substitute the original chlorine atoms) and free chloride ions. For instance, the reductive dechlorination of CFCs is complete and produces several [[Hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] plus chloride.

Hydrodechlorination (HDC) is a type of reductive dechlorination that is useful due to its high reaction rate. It uses H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the reducing agent over a range of potential electrode reactors and [[Catalysis|catalysts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoke|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Gramiccioni|first2=Gary A.|last3=Balko|first3=Edward N.|title=Catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0926337392800544|journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental|volume=1|issue=4|pages=285–296|doi=10.1016/0926-3373(92)80054-4|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the types of [[Catalysis|catalysts]] studied such as [[precious metal]]s (Pt, Pd, Rh), [[transition metal]]s (Ni and Mo), and [[Oxide|metal oxides]], a preference for [[precious metal]]s overrides the others.As an example, palladium (Pd) often adopts a lattice formation which can easily embed hydrogen gas making it more accessible to be readily oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=I.

As catalysts are depleted, chlorine poisoning on surfaces can sometimes be observed, and on rare occasions, metal [[sintering]] and [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] occurs as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Xiumin|date=2005|title=Reductive Dehalogenation of Gas-phase Trichloroethylene using Heterogeneous Catalytic and Electrochemical Methods|url=http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/193594|journal=University of Arizona Campus Repository|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrochemical reduction can be performed at ambient pressure and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemical degradation methods for wastes and pollutants : environmental and industrial applications|date=2003|publisher=M. Dekker|others=Tarr, Matthew A.|isbn=978-0203912553|location=New York|oclc=54061528}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will not disrupt microbial environments or raise extra cost for remediation. The process of dechlorination can be highly controlled to avoid toxic chlorinated intermediates and byproducts such as [[dioxin]]s from [[incineration]]. [[Trichloroethylene]] (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) are common targets of treatment which are directly converted to environmentally benign products. Chlorinated alkenes and alkanes are converted to hydrogen chloride (HCl) which is then neutralized with a base.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, even though there are many potential benefits to adopting this method, research have mainly been conducted in a laboratory setting with a few cases of field studies making it not yet well established.

== Radiation ==

It is known that by gamma irradiation of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s that they can be converted into [[biphenyl]] and inorganic [[chloride]], this is formally a reduction of the organic compound as hydrogen is added. See the [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]] page for more details of this destruction method. This reductive destruction method works for many organochlorine compounds, for instance [[carbon tetrachloride]] when irradiated tends to form [[chloroform]] and chloride anions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14411">'''Reversible computing''' is a model of [[computing]] where the [[computational process]] to some extent is reversible, i.e., time-invertible. In a model of computation that uses [[deterministic]] [[State transition system|transitions]] from one state of the abstract machine to another, a necessary condition for reversibility is that the relation of the mapping from (nonzero-probability) states to their successors must be [[injective function|one-to-one]]. Reversible computing is a form of [[unconventional computing]].

==Reversibility==
There are two major, closely related types of reversibility that are of particular interest for this purpose: ''physical reversibility'' and ''logical reversibility''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/&lt;/ref&gt;

A process is said to be ''physically reversible'' if it results in no increase in physical [[entropy]]; it is ''[[isentropic]]''.  There is a style of circuit design ideally exhibiting this property that is referred to as '''charge recovery logic''', [[adiabatic circuit]]s, or '''[[adiabatic]] computing'''.  Although ''in practice'' no nonstationary physical process can be ''exactly'' physically reversible or isentropic, there is no known limit to the closeness with which we can approach perfect reversibility, in systems that are sufficiently well isolated from interactions with unknown external environments, when the laws of physics describing the system's evolution are precisely known.

Probably the largest motivation for the study of technologies aimed at actually implementing reversible computing is that they offer what is predicted to be the only potential way to improve the [[computational energy efficiency]] of computers beyond the fundamental [[von Neumann-Landauer limit]]&lt;ref name="neumann"&gt;J. von Neumann, ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', Univ. of Illinois Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; of ''kT'' ln(2) energy dissipated per irreversible [[bit operation]].  Although the Landauer limit was millions of times below the energy consumption of computers in the 2000s and thousands of times less in the 2010s,&lt;ref&gt;Bérut, Antoine, et al. "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7388/abs/nature10872.html Experimental verification of Landauer's principle linking information and thermodynamics.]" Nature 483.7388 (2012): 187-189: "''From a technological perspective, energy dissipation per logic operation in present-day silicon-based digital circuits is about a factor of 1,000 greater than the ultimate Landauer limit, but is predicted to quickly attain it within the next couple of decades''"&lt;/ref&gt; proponents of reversible computing argue that this can be attributed largely to architectural overheads which effectively magnify the impact of Landauer's limit in practical circuit designs, so that it may prove difficult for practical technology to progress very far beyond current levels of energy efficiency if reversible computing principles are not used.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Frank, "Foundations of Generalized Reversible Computing," to be published at the 9th Conference on Reversible Computation, Jul. 6-7, 2017, Kolkata, India.  Preprint available at https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/docs/grc-rc17-preprint2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to thermodynamics==
As was first argued by [[Rolf Landauer]] of [[IBM]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Landauer, "Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process," IBM Journal of Research and Development, vol. 5, pp. 183-191, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in order for a computational process to be physically reversible, it must also be ''logically reversible''. [[Landauer's principle]] is the rigorously valid observation that the oblivious erasure of ''n'' bits of known information must always incur a cost of ''nkT'' ln(2) in thermodynamic [[entropy]].  A discrete, deterministic computational process is said to be logically reversible if the transition function that maps old computational states to new ones is a [[one-to-one function]]; i.e. the output logical states uniquely determine the input logical states of the computational operation.

For computational processes that are nondeterministic (in the sense of being probabilistic or random), the relation between old and new states is not a [[single-valued function]], and the requirement needed to obtain physical reversibility becomes a slightly weaker condition, namely that the size of a given ensemble of possible initial computational states does not decrease, on average, as the computation proceeds forwards.

==Physical reversibility==
Landauer's principle (and indeed, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] itself) can also be understood to be a direct [[logical consequence]] of the underlying reversibility of [[physics]], as is reflected in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|general Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics]], and in the [[time evolution|unitary time-evolution operator]] of [[quantum mechanics]] more specifically.

The implementation of reversible computing thus amounts to learning how to characterize and control the physical dynamics of mechanisms to carry out desired computational operations so precisely that we can accumulate a negligible total amount of uncertainty regarding the complete physical state of the mechanism, per each logic operation that is performed. In other words, we would need to precisely track the state of the active energy that is involved in carrying out computational operations within the machine, and design the machine in such a way that the majority of this energy is recovered in an organized form that can be reused for subsequent operations, rather than being permitted to dissipate into the form of heat.

Although achieving this goal presents a significant challenge for the design, manufacturing, and characterization of ultra-precise new physical mechanisms for [[computing]], there is at present no fundamental reason to think that this goal cannot eventually be accomplished, allowing us to someday build computers that generate much less than 1 bit's worth of physical entropy (and dissipate much less than ''kT'' ln 2 energy to heat) for each useful logical operation that they carry out internally.

Today, the field has a substantial body of academic literature behind it. A wide variety of reversible device concepts, [[logic gate]]s, [[electronic circuit]]s, processor architectures, [[programming language]]s, and application [[algorithm]]s have been designed and analyzed by [[physicist]]s, [[electrical engineer]]s, and [[computer scientist]]s.

This field of research awaits the detailed development of a high-quality, cost-effective, nearly reversible logic device technology, one that includes highly energy-efficient [[clocking]] and [[synchronization]] mechanisms, or avoids the need for these through asynchronous design. This sort of solid engineering progress will be needed before the large body of theoretical research on reversible computing can find practical application in enabling real computer technology to circumvent the various near-term barriers to its energy efficiency, including the von Neumann-Landauer bound.  This may only be circumvented by the use of logically reversible computing, due to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]].

==Logical reversibility==
To implement reversible computation, estimate its cost, and to judge its limits, it can be formalized in terms of gate-level circuits.  A simplified model of such circuits is one in which inputs are consumed (however, note that real logic gates as implemented e.g. in [[CMOS]] do not do this).  In this modeling framework, an [[inverter (logic gate)]] (NOT) gate is reversible because it can be ''undone''. The [[exclusive or]] (XOR) gate is irreversible because its two inputs cannot be unambiguously reconstructed from its single output. However, a reversible version of the XOR gate—the [[controlled NOT gate]] (CNOT)—can be defined by preserving one of the inputs. The three-input variant of the CNOT gate is called the [[Toffoli gate]]. It preserves two of its inputs ''a,b'' and replaces the third ''c'' by &lt;math&gt;c\oplus (a\cdot b)&lt;/math&gt;. With &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;, this gives the AND function, and with &lt;math&gt;a\cdot b=1&lt;/math&gt; this gives the NOT function. Thus, the Toffoli gate is universal and can implement any reversible [[Boolean function]] (given enough zero-initialized ancillary bits). More generally, reversible gates that consume their input have no more inputs than outputs. A reversible circuit connects reversible gates without [[fanout]]s and loops. Therefore, such circuits contain equal numbers of input and output wires, each going through an entire circuit. Similarly, in the Turing machine model of computation, a reversible Turing machine is one whose transition function is invertible, so that each machine state has at most one predecessor.

[[:fr:Yves Lecerf|Yves Lecerf]] proposed a reversible Turing machine in a 1963 paper,&lt;ref&gt;Lecerf (Y.) : Logique Mathématique : Machines de Turing réversibles. Comptes rendus des séances de l'académie des sciences, 257:2597--2600, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently unaware of Landauer's principle, did not pursue the subject further, devoting most of the rest of his career to ethnolinguistics.  In 1973 Charles H. Bennett, at IBM Research, showed that a universal Turing machine could be made both logically and thermodynamically reversible,&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Bennett, "[http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/bennett1973.pdf Logical reversibility of computation]", IBM Journal of Research and Development, vol. 17, no. 6, pp. 525-532, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore able in principle to perform arbitrarily much computation per unit of physical energy dissipated, in the limit of zero speed.  In 1982 [[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Tommaso Toffoli]] proposed the [[Billiard ball computer]], a mechanism using classical hard spheres to do reversible computations at finite speed with zero dissipation, but requiring perfect initial alignment of the balls' trajectories, and Bennett's review&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Bennett, "The Thermodynamics of Computation -- A Review," International Journal of Theoretical Physics, vol. 21, no. 12, pp. 905-940, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; compared these "Brownian" and "ballistic" paradigms for reversible computation. Aside from the motivation of energy-efficient computation, reversible logic gates offered practical improvements of [[bit manipulation|bit-manipulation]] transforms in cryptography and computer graphics. Since the 1980s, reversible circuits have attracted interest as components of [[quantum algorithm]]s, and more recently in photonic and nano-computing technologies where some switching devices offer no [[signal gain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4632">'''Ring Tone Text Transfer Language''' ('''RTTTL''') was developed by [[Nokia]]{{Citation needed|reason=Nokia Smart Messaging specification or early Nokia ringtone software (PC Composer) does not mention/support RTTTL; however, RTTTL was already in use those times by "NokRing" by John Mostelo.|date=February 2010}} to be used to transfer [[ringtone]]s to [[cellphone]] by Nokia.

The RTTTL format is a string divided into three sections: name, default value, and data.

The ''jintu'' section consists of a string describing the name of the ringtone. It can be no longer than 10 characters, and cannot contain a colon ":" character. (However, since the [[Smart Messaging]] specification allows names up to 15 characters in length, some applications processing RTTTL also do so.)

The ''default value'' section is a set of values separated by commas, where each value contains a key and a value separated by an ''='' character, which describes certain defaults which should be adhered to during the execution of the ringtone. Possible names are
* '''d''' - [[duration (music)|duration]]
* '''o''' - [[octave]]
* '''b''' - [[beat (music)|beat]], [[tempo]]

The ''data'' section consists of a set of character strings separated by commas, where each string  contains a ''duration'', ''pitch'', ''octave'' and optional ''dotting'' (which increases the duration of the note by one half).

The format of RTTTL notation is similar to the [[Music Macro Language]] found in [[BASIC]] implementations present on many early microcomputers.

==Technical specification==
To be recognized by ringtone programs, an RTTTL/Nokring format ringtone must contain three specific elements: name, settings, and notes.

For example, here is the RTTTL ringtone for Haunted House:

&lt;code&gt;HauntHouse: d=4,o=5,b=108: 2a4, 2e, 2d#, 2b4, 2a4, 2c, 2d, 2a#4, 2e., e, 1f4, 1a4, 1d#, 2e., d, 2c., b4, 1a4, 1p, 2a4, 2e, 2d#, 2b4, 2a4, 2c, 2d, 2a#4, 2e., e, 1f4, 1a4, 1d#, 2e., d, 2c., b4, 1a4&lt;/code&gt;

The three parts are separated by a colon.

* '''Part 1:''' name of the ringtone (here: "HauntHouse"), a string of characters represents the name of the ringtone
* '''Part 2:''' settings (here: d=4,o=5,b=108), where "d=" is the default duration of a note. In this case, the "4" means that each note with no duration specifier (see below) is by default considered a [[quarter note]]. "8" would mean an [[eighth note]], and so on. Accordingly, "o=" is the default [[octave]]. There are four octaves in the Nokring/RTTTL format. And "b=" is the [[tempo]], in "beats per minute".
* '''Part 3:''' the notes. Each note is separated by a comma and includes, in sequence: a duration specifier, a standard music note, either a, b, c, d, e, f or g, and an octave specifier. If no duration or octave specifier are present, the default applies.

=== Durations ===

Standard musical durations are denoted by the following notations:
* '''1''' - [[whole note]]
* '''2''' - [[half note]]
* '''4''' - [[quarter note]]
* '''8''' - [[eighth note]]
* '''16''' - [[sixteenth note]]
* '''32''' - [[thirty-second note]]

[[dotted note|Dotted]] [[rhythm]] patterns can be formed by appending a period (".") character to the end of a duration/beat/octave element.

=== Pitch ===

* '''P''' - rest or pause
* '''A''' - A
* '''A#''' - A♯ / B♭
* '''B''' - B / C♭
* '''C''' - C 
* '''C#''' - C♯ / D♭
* '''D''' - D
* '''D#''' - D♯ / E♭
* '''E''' - E / F♭
* '''F''' - F / E♯
* '''F#''' - F♯ / G♭
* '''G''' - G
* '''G#''' - G♯ / A♭

=== Octave ===

The RTTTL format allows octaves starting from the A below middle C and going up four octaves. This corresponds with the inability of [[cellphone]]s to reproduce certain [[pitch (music)|tone]]s audibly. These octaves are numbered from lowest pitch to highest pitch from 4 to 7.

The [[octave]] should be left out of the notation in the case of a rest or pause in the pattern.

== Example ==

An example of the RTTTL format would be
&lt;code&gt;
 fifth:d=4,o=5,b=63:8P,8G5,8G5,8G5,2D#5&lt;/code&gt;

'''Ronald William Prest Drever''' (26 October 1931 – 7 March 2017) was a Scottish experimental physicist. He was a professor emeritus at the [[California Institute of Technology]], co-founded the [[LIGO]] project, and was a co-inventor of the [[Pound–Drever–Hall technique]] for [[laser]] stabilisation, as well as the [[Hughes–Drever experiment]].   This work was instrumental in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection]] of [[gravitational wave]]s in September 2015.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/12153127/British-scientist-who-played-key-role-in-gravitational-waves-research-is-suffering-from-dementia.html | title=British scientist who played key role in gravitational waves research is suffering from dementia | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | date=12 February 2016 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=Knapton, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Gravitational Waves Exist: The Inside Story of How Scientists Finally Found Them|url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gravitational-waves-exist-heres-how-scientists-finally-found-them|newspaper = [[The New Yorker]]|access-date = 2016-02-11|issn = 0028-792X|first = Nicola|last = Twilley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abbott, B.P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

Drever died on 7 March 2017, aged 85,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39212305|title=Gravitational waves pioneer Ronald Drever dies|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=Jonathan Amos|date=8 March 2017|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven months before his colleagues [[Rainer Weiss]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[Barry Barish]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their work on the observation of gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physics 2017 press release|publisher=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed that he would have won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] in the place of [[Barry Barish]] had he not died before the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel Committee]] made their decision.

==Education==
Drever was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] followed by [[University of Glasgow]] where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH26945&amp;type=P|title=The University of Glasgow Story: Ronald Drever|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205233911/http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH26945&amp;type=P|archivedate=2016-12-05|website=universitystory.gla.ac.uk|publisher=University of Glasgow|location=Glasgow|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a  [[PhD]] in 1959 for research on orbital electron capture using proportional counters.&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Ronald William Prest |last=Drever |title=Studies of orbital electron capture using proportional counters |publisher=University of Glasgow |date=1959 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/298416389 |oclc=298416389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
After receiving his PhD from the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1959, Drever initiated the Glasgow project to detect gravitational waves in the sixties,&lt;ref name="JCG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11953833.Sir_John_Gunn_University_professor_who_specialised_in_science_research/?_r=0 | title=Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory | publisher=[[The Herald Scotland]]| work=The Herald Scotland | date=23 August 2002 | accessdate=28 December 2017 | author=Prof R G Moorhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he established the University’s first dedicated gravitational wave research group in 1970.&lt;ref name="BEQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_566307_en.html?_r=0 | title=£500K BEQUEST MAKES SPLASH WITH GLASGOW GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SCIENTISTS | publisher=[[University of Glasgow]]| work=gla.ac.uk | date=28 December 2017 | accessdate=28 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same year Drever was recruited to form a gravitational wave program at [[Caltech]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html?_r=0 | title=Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]| work=New York Times | date=11 February 2016 | accessdate=12 February 2016 | author=OVERBYE, DENNIS , CORUM, JONATHAN  and DRAKEFORD, JASON}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Drever left [[Glasgow]] to work full-time at [[Caltech]].&lt;ref name="BEX"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_566307_en.html?_r=0 | title=£500K BEQUEST MAKES SPLASH WITH GLASGOW GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SCIENTISTS | publisher=[[University of Glasgow]]| work=gla.ac.uk | date=28 December 2017 | accessdate=28 December 2017 | author=Prof R G Moorhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drever's contributions to the design and implementation of the LIGO interferometers were critically important to their ability to function in the extreme sensitivity realm required for detection of gravitational waves (10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; strain).

Drever's final work involved the development of magnetically levitated optical tables for seismic isolation of experimental apparatus.&lt;ref name="CIT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/2076/1/AUGaipcp00.pdf | title= Measurements of Mechanical Q in Levitated Paramagnetic Crystals | publisher=Caltech|work=Amaldi Conference 2000 | date=2000 |author1=S.

{{unreferenced|date=March 2012}}
'''Star counts''' are bookkeeping surveys of [[star]]s and the [[statistics|statistical]] and [[geometry|geometrical]] methods used to correct the survey data for [[Wiktionary:bias#Etymology|bias]]. The surveys are most often made of nearby stars in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].

One of the interests of astronomy is to determine how many stars there are of each of several types that stars can be categorized into, and how these stars are distributed in space.

==Reasons for star counts==
When performing star counts, astronomers consider many different categories that have been created to classify a few stars that have been well studied. One of the hopes of studying the results of star counts is to discover new categories. Different counts typically seek to categorize stars for only a few of the qualities listed below, and determine how common each considered quality is and how stars of that kind are distributed.

* '''Temperature''': In astronomy, temperature is usually shown using the [[spectral type|letter codes]] '''O B A F G K M''' running from 'blue' (type&amp;nbsp;'''O''', actually bluish white) through white (type&amp;nbsp;'''F''') to 'red' (type&amp;nbsp;'''M''', actually ruddy orange). Types&amp;nbsp;'''L''' and '''T''' are used for [[brown dwarfs]], whose 'colors' are in the [[infrared]].
* '''Size''': Size is usually designated by Roman numerals '''I''' ([[supergiants]]) through '''V''' (dwarfs).
* '''Age''': Stars are usually grouped into ''Population&amp;nbsp;I'' (young) and ''Population&amp;nbsp;II'' (old).
* '''Location''': In the Milky Way Galaxy the groups are described as ''[[Thin disk population|thin disk]]'', ''thick disk'', ''central bulge'', and ''halo''.
* '''Multiplicity''': Most stars are members of double star, or triple star, or even double-double star systems. Our own sun appears to be unusual for ''not'' having a companion star.

There are many finer subdivisions in all of the above categories.

==Bias==
There are many unavoidable problems in counting stars for the purpose of getting an accurate picture of the distribution of stars in space. The effects of our point of view in the galaxy, the obscuring clouds of gas and dust in the galaxy, and especially the extreme range of inherent brightness, create a biased view of stars.

* Stars vary far more in [[Wiktionary:intrinsic#Etymology|intrinsic]] brightness than they do in distance.
* Our line of sight through the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] is interrupted by great clouds of gas and dust, which block our view of stars more than a few thousand [[light-year]]s away.
* The [[Sun]] is located in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy, in the northern edge of the ''thin disk'' and on the inner edge of a [[spiral arm]] called the [[Orion Arm|Orion–Cygnus Arm]]. There is good reason to believe that stars in the galaxy's thin disk are different from thicker part of the disk, and from the bulge and the halo. Some stars are obviously more common in spiral arms than in the disk in between the arms.

Knowing that these effects create bias, astronomers analyzing star counts attempt to find how much bias each effect has caused and then compensate for it as well as they can.

==Inherent luminosity complications==
The greatest problem biasing star counts is the extreme differences in inherent brightness of different sizes.

Heavy, bright stars (both [[giant stars|giants]] and blue [[dwarf star|dwarfs]]) are the most common stars listed in general [[star catalog]]s, even though on average they are obviously rare in space. Small dim stars ([[red dwarf]]s) seem to be the most common stars in space, at least locally, but can only be seen with large telescopes, and then only when they are within a few tens of light-years from Earth.

For example, the [[blue giant]] [[zeta Puppis|ζ&amp;nbsp;Puppis]] is 400&amp;nbsp;million times more [[luminosity|luminous]] than the nearest star, a [[red dwarf]] named [[Alpha Centauri|Proxima]], or ''[[Alpha centauri|α&amp;nbsp;Centauri]]&amp;nbsp;C''. Even though Proxima is only 4.2&amp;nbsp;light-years away from us, it is so dim that it cannot be seen with the naked eye (one of its companions, ''α&amp;nbsp;Centauri&amp;nbsp;A'', is visible). The star ''ζ&amp;nbsp;Puppis'' is one of the brightest of the visible extreme blue supergiants. It is so bright that it appears to be a second magnitude star, even though ζ Puppis is 1,399 light-years away.

[[Image:cuttlefish.png|thumb|upright|[[Cuttlefish]] with 2 tentacles and 8 arms]]

In [[zoology]], a '''tentacle'''  is a flexible, mobile, elongated [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] present in some species of [[animal]]s, most of them [[invertebrate]]s. In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs. Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like [[muscular hydrostat]]s. Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding. Many are [[Sensory system|sensory organs]], variously receptive to [[somatosensory system|touch]], [[visual perception|vision]], or to the [[Chemoreceptor|smell or taste]] of particular foods or threats. Examples of such tentacles are the "eye stalks" of various kinds of [[snail]]s. Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions.

A tentacle is similar to a [[cirrus (biology)|cirrus]], but a cirrus is an organ that usually lacks the tentacle's strength, size, flexibility, or sensitivity.  A [[nautilus]] has cirri, but a [[squid]] has tentacles.

{{anchor|tentillum}}The word '''tentillum''' literally means "little tentacle". However, irrespective of size, it usually refers to a side branch of a larger tentacle. In some cases such tentilla are specialised for particular functions; for example, in the [[Cnidaria]] tentilla usually bear [[cnidocyte]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zsao&amp;selected=definitie&amp;menuentry=woordenlijst&amp;record=tentilla Marine Species Identification Portal : Zooplankton of the South Atlantic Ocean : Glossary : tentilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231841/http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zsao&amp;selected=definitie&amp;menuentry=woordenlijst&amp;record=tentilla |date=2 December 2013 }}.

==Invertebrates==

===Molluscs===
{{See also|Cephalopod limb}}
[[Image:Snail-front-0A.jpg|thumb|right|Front view of land snail showing upper and lower sets of tentacles]]
[[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|350 px|Abalone showing pallial tentacles]]
Many molluscs have tentacles of one form or another. The most familiar are those of the [[Pulmonata|pulmonate land snails]], which usually have two sets of tentacles on the head: when extended the upper pair have eyes at their tips; the lower pair are [[chemoreceptor]]s. Both pairs are fully retractable [[muscular hydrostat]]s, but they are not used for manipulation or prey capture.

Some marine snails such as [[abalone]] and top snails, [[Trochidae]], have numerous small tentacles around the edge of the [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. These are known as ''pallial tentacles''.&lt;ref name=bou/&gt;

Among [[cephalopod]]s, squid have spectacular tentacles. They take the form of highly mobile muscular hydrostats with various appendages such as suction disks and sometimes thorny hooks. Up to the early twentieth century "tentacles" were interchangeably called "arms".&lt;ref name= "CNH3"&gt;Cooke, A. H.; Shipley, Arthur Everett et al. (1895). ''The Cambridge Natural History Volume 34: Molluscs, Trilobites, Brachiopods  etc.'' Macmillan Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern convention however, is to speak of appendages as "tentacles" when they have relatively thin "[[peduncle (anatomy)|peduncles]]" or "stalks" with "clubs" at their tips. In contrast the convention refers to the relatively shorter appendages as "arms". By this definition the eight appendages of octopuses, though quite long, count as arms.&lt;ref name=bou&gt;{{cite web |author= Boumis R |title= Animals With Tentacles |url= http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-tentacles-2495.html |year= 2013 |work= Pawnation |publisher= AOL Inc. |accessdate= 2013-06-08 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020936/http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-tentacles-2495.html |archivedate= 3 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tentacles of the [[giant squid]] and [[colossal squid]] have powerful suckers and pointed teeth at the ends. The teeth of the giant squid resemble [[crown cork|bottle caps]] and function like tiny [[hole saw]]s, while the tentacles of the colossal squid wield two long rows of swiveling, tri-pointed hooks.

===Cnidarians and ctenophores===
[[Cnidarian]]s, such as [[jellyfish]], [[sea anemone]]s, ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and [[coral]] have numerous hair-like tentacles. Cnidarians have huge numbers of [[cnidocyte]]s on their tentacles. In [[jellyfish|medusoid form]], the body floats on water so that the tentacles hang down in a ring around the mouth. In [[polyp]] form, such as sea anemone and coral, the body is below with the tentacles pointed upwards.

Many species of the jellyfish-like [[ctenophore]]s have two tentacles, while some have none. Their tentacles have adhesive structures called ''[[colloblast]]s'' or ''lasso cells''. The colloblasts burst open when prey comes in contact with the tentacle, releasing sticky threads that secure the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Bird J | title= CNIDARIANS: SIMPLE ANIMALS WITH A STING! | url= http://www.oceanicresearch.org/education/wonders/cnidarian.html | date= 5 June 2007 | work= oceanicresearch.org | publisher= Oceanic Research Group | accessdate= 2013-06-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130707024559/http://www.oceanicresearch.org/education/wonders/cnidarian.html | archivedate= 7 July 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tentacles of the [[Lion's mane jellyfish]] may be up to 120 feet (37 meters) long. They are hollow and are arranged in 8 groups of between 70 and 150. The longer tentacles are equipped with cnidocytes whose venom paralyses and kills prey. The smaller tentacles guide food into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Kosner AW | title= Lion's Mane Jellyfish Image: This Is (Literally) How Things Blow Up On The Internet! | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/07/10/lions-mane-jellyfish-image-this-is-literally-how-things-blow-up-on-the-internet/2/ | date= 10 July 2012 | work=[[Forbes]] | accessdate= 2013-06-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130625154715/http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/07/10/lions-mane-jellyfish-image-this-is-literally-how-things-blow-up-on-the-internet/2/ | archivedate= 25 June 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wild Facts|title=Wild Fact #419 – One Large Jelly – Lion's Mane Jellyfish|url=http://www.wild-facts.com/2011/wild-fact-419-one-large-jelly-lions-mane-jellyfish/|date=29 November 2011|work=wild-facts.com|publisher=|accessdate=2013-06-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219091103/http://www.wild-facts.com/2011/wild-fact-419-one-large-jelly-lions-mane-jellyfish/|archivedate=19 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bryozoa===

[[Bryozoa]] (moss animals) are tiny creatures with tentacles around their mouths. The tentacles are almost cylindrical and have bands of cilia which create a water current towards the mouth. The animal extracts edible material from the flow of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author= Claus N | title= Bryozoa (Ectoprocta: 'Moss' Animals) | url= http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0001613.html | date= May 2013 | work= els.net | publisher= eLS.

[[Trypanorhynch]] [[cestode]]s are parasitic in fish. Their [[scolex]] shows four tentacles which are covered by spines. These tentacles help the adult cestode to attach to the intestine of the shark or ray that they parasitize. The same tentacles are also present in the larvae.&lt;ref name="BeveridgeBray2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beveridge|first1=Ian|last2=Bray|first2=Rodney A.|last3=Cribb|first3=Thomas H.|last4=Justine|first4=Jean-Lou|title=Diversity of trypanorhynch metacestodes in teleost fishes from coral reefs off eastern Australia and New Caledonia|journal=Parasite|volume=21|year=2014|pages=60|issn=1776-1042|doi=10.1051/parasite/2014060|pmid=25402635|pmc=4234045|url=http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2014/01/parasite140092/parasite140092.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109144048/https://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2014/01/parasite140092/parasite140092.html|archivedate=9 January 2018|df=dmy-all}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphibians==
The legless [[amphibian]]s called [[caecilian]]s have two short tentacles, one on each side of the head, between their eyes and nostrils. The current opinion is that these tentacles supplement the normal sense of smell, possibly for navigation and to locate prey underground.&lt;ref name=bou/&gt;

==Mammals==
The [[star-nosed mole]], ''Condylura cristata'', of [[North America]], has 22 short but conspicuous tentacles around its nose. They are mobile and extremely sensitive, helping the animal to find its way about the burrow and detect prey. They are about 1–4&amp;nbsp;mm long and hold about 25,000 [[Somatosensory system|touch receptors]] called [[Eimer's organ]]s, perhaps giving this mole the most delicate sense of touch among mammals.&lt;ref name=bou/&gt;

'''The Proteolysis MAP''' ('''PMAP''') is an integrated [[web resource]] focused on [[protease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Igarashi | first1 = Y | last2 = Heureux | first2 = E | last3 = Doctor | first3 = KS | last4 = Talwar | first4 = P | last5 = Gramatikova | first5 = S | last6 = Gramatikoff | first6 = K | last7 = Zhang | first7 = Y | last8 = Blinov | first8 = M | last9 = Ibragimova | first9 = SS | last10 = Boyd | first10 = S | last11 = Ratnikov | first11 = B | last12 = Cieplak | first12 = P | last13 = Godzik | first13 = A | last14 = Smith | first14 = JW | last15 = Osterman | first15 = AL | last16 = Eroshkin | first16 = AM | year = 2008 | title = PMAP: databases for analyzing proteolytic events and pathways | journal = [[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume = 37| issue = | pages = D611–D618| doi=10.1093/nar/gkn683 | pmid=18842634 | pmc=2686432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
PMAP is to aid the protease researchers in reasoning about [[proteolytic]] [[metabolic network|networks]] and [[metabolic pathways]].

==History and funding==
PMAP was originally created at the [[Burnham Institute for Medical Research]], La Jolla, California.  In 2004 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) selected a team led by [[Jeffrey W. Smith]], to establish the Center on Proteolytic Pathways (CPP).  As part of the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical research, the center develops technology to study the behavior of proteins and to disburse that knowledge to the scientific community at large.

==Focal point==
Proteases are a class of [[enzymes]] that regulate much of what happens in the [[human body]], both inside the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and out, by cleaving [[peptide bonds]] in [[proteins]].  Through this activity, they govern the four essential cell functions: [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]], [[motility]], division and [[cell death]] — and activate important [[extracellular]] episodes, such as the [[biochemical cascade]] effect in [[blood clotting]].  Simply stated, life could not exist without them. Extensive on-line classification system for proteases (also referred as peptidases) is deposited in the [[MEROPS]] database.

==The goal==
Proteolytic pathways, or proteolysis, are the series of events controlled by proteases that occur in response to specific stimuli.  In addition to the clotting of blood, the production of [[insulin]] can be viewed as a proteolytic pathway, as the activation, regulation and inhibition of that protein is the result of proteases reacting to changing [[glucose]] levels and triggering other proteases downstream.

==Database content==
PMAP integrates five databases.
ProteaseDB and SubstrateDB, are driven by an automated annotation pipeline that generates dynamic ‘Molecule Pages’, rich in molecular information. CutDB&lt;ref&gt;Igarashi Y, Eroshkin A, Gramatikova S, Gramatikoff K, Zhang Y, Smith JW, Osterman AL, Godzik A. CutDB: a proteolytic event database. [[Nucleic Acids Research]]. 2007 D546-9&lt;/ref&gt; has information on more than 6,600 proteolytic events, and ProfileDB is dedicated to information of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] recognition specificity of proteases.  PathwayDB, just begun accumulation of [[metabolic pathways]] whose function can be dynamically modeled in a rule-based manner.  Hypothetical networks are inferred by semi-automated culling from the literature.  Additionally, protease software tools are available for the analysis of individual proteases and [[proteome]]-wide data sets.

==Usage==
Popular destinations in PMAP are Protease Molecule Pages and Substrate Molecule Pages. Protease Molecule Pages show recent news in [[PubMed]] literature of the protease, known [[proteolytic events]], [[protein domain]] location and [[protein structure]] view, as well as a cross annotation in other [[bioinformatic]] databases section. Substrate Molecule Pages display protein domains and experimentally derived protease cut-sites for a given protein target of interest.

'''Travellingua''', also known as the '''Language and Culture Explorers’ Club''', is a project which was supported by the [[European Commission]] under Socrates Lingua 1 (Promotion of Language Learning) action.
The project was implemented from 1 November 2006 to 30 September 2008.

==Outputs==
The official website (''www.travellingua.eu'') has 5 main parts:
# LEARN: A linguistic part with the Phrase book and audio material in 5 languages ([[English language|English]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]);
# EXPLORE: a part which gives basic information about 4 countries, their cultures and languages ([[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]);
# SHARE: a part where the material (phrase book and [[MP3]] files) can be downloaded for free and learners share their knowledge and experience in language learning and travelling;
# CONSULT: a linguistic part where any learner can ask a general question about language learning or a specific language (Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish) and get a professional answer from a linguist. Answers then are posted for the general public;
# CONTINUE STUDIES: a part which gives useful links (with free linguistic resources, [[European Union|EU]]-sponsored linguistic projects are presented among them) for those who decide to continue self-studying Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish or to find more information about travelling.

==Results==
As a '''result''' of this project:
* there will be more people having survival-level [[linguistic competence]] of the target languages and being able to use it while travelling or working abroad;
* there will be more people self-studying other European languages (especially from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic group]]);
* less popular European countries and languages will be promoted.

'''Tubers''' are enlarged structures in some [[plant]] species used as [[storage organ]]s for [[nutrient]]s. They are used for the plant's [[perennation]] (survival of the winter or dry months), to provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season, and as a means of [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name="rooting_cuttings_of_tropical_trees"&gt;{{Citation  | title = Rooting cuttings of tropical trees | year = 1994 | publisher = Commonwealth Science Council | location = London  | isbn = 978-0-85092-394-0 | pages = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stem tubers'' form from thickened [[rhizome]]s (underground stems) or [[stolon]]s (horizontal connections between organisms). Common plant species with stem tubers include [[potato]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]. Some sources also treat modified lateral [[root]]s (''root tubers'') under the definition; these are encountered in [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], and [[dahlia]].

==Terminology==
The term originates from Latin ''tuber'', meaning "lump, bump, swelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tuber |title=Tuber |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215121743/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tuber |archivedate=2016-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources define the term "tuber" to mean only structures derived from [[Plant stem|stems]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mauseth |first=James D. |title=Botany : An Introduction to Plant Biology | edition=5th | year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4496-6580-7 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Learning |location=Sudbury, MA}}, p. 672&lt;/ref&gt; others use the term for structures derived from stems or [[root]]s.&lt;ref name=Been10&gt;{{Citation |last=Beentje |first=Henk |year=2010 |title=The Kew Plant Glossary |location=Richmond, Surrey |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |isbn=978-1-84246-422-9 }}, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stem tubers == &lt;!-- "Stem tuber" redirects here; do not change section title without fixing this --&gt;
A '''stem tuber''' forms from thickened [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]]s. The top sides of the tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves and the under sides produce roots. They tend to form at the sides of the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. The underground stem tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The offsprings or new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form at the end of a hypogeogenous (initiated below ground) rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies, except for the new offspring stem tubers which have one dominant bud, which in spring regrows a new shoot producing stems and leaves, in summer the tubers decay and new tubers begin to grow. Some plants also form smaller tubers and/or [[tubercule]]s which act like seeds, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers are long-lived, such as those of tuberous [[begonia]], but many plants have tubers that survive only until the plants have fully leafed out, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shriveled-up husk.

[[File:Starr 010725-9001 Anredera cordifolia.jpg|thumb|upright|Flowers and tuber of ''Anredera cordifolia'']]

Stem tubers generally start off as enlargements of the [[hypocotyl]] section of a seedling but also sometimes include the first node or two of the [[epicotyl]] and the upper section of the root. The stem tuber has a vertical orientation with one or a few vegetative buds on the top and fibrous roots produced on the bottom from a basal section, typically the stem tuber has an oblong rounded shape.

The tuber has all the parts of a normal stem, including nodes and internodes. The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the stolon. The terminal bud is produced at the farthest point away from the stolon attachment and tubers thus show the same [[apical dominance]] as a normal stem. Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged [[parenchyma]] like cells. The inside of a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.

The tuber is produced in one growing season and used to perennate the plant and as a means of [[Plant propagation|propagation]]. When fall comes, the above-ground structure of the plant dies, but the tubers survive over winter underground until spring, when they regenerate new shoots that use the stored food in the tuber to grow. As the main shoot develops from the tuber, the base of the shoot close to the tuber produces adventitious roots and lateral buds on the shoot. The shoot also produces stolons that are long [[etiolated]] stems. The stolon elongates during long days with the presence of high [[auxins]] levels that prevent root growth off of the stolon. Before new tuber formation begins, the stolon must be a certain age. The enzyme lipoxygenase makes a hormone, [[jasmonic acid]], which is involved in the control of potato tuber development.

The stolons are easily recognized when potato plants are grown from seeds. As the plants grow, stolons are produced around the soil surface from the nodes. The tubers form close to the soil surface and sometimes even on top of the ground. When potatoes are cultivated, the tubers are cut into pieces and planted much deeper into the soil. Planting the pieces deeper creates more area for the plants to generate the tubers and their size increases. The pieces sprout shoots that grow to the surface. These shoots are rhizome-like and generate short stolons from the nodes while in the ground.  When the shoots reach the soil surface, they produce roots and shoots that grow into the green plant.

== Root tubers == &lt;!-- "Root tuber" redirects here! Do not change section title without fixing this. --&gt;
[[File:Ipomoea batatasL ja01.jpg|thumb|350px|Freshly dug sweet potato plants with tubers.]]
A '''tuberous root''' or storage root, is a modified lateral [[root]], enlarged to function as a [[storage organ]]. The  enlarged area of the root-tuber, or storage root, can be produced at the end or middle of a root or involve the entire root. It is thus different in origin but similar in function and appearance to a stem tuber. Examples of plants with notable tuberous roots include the [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], and [[dahlia]].

Root tubers are [[perennating organ]]s, thickened roots that store nutrients over periods when the plant cannot actively grow, thus permitting survival from one year to the next. The massive enlargement of secondary roots typically represented by sweet potato (''[[Ipomoea batatas]]''), have the internal and external cell and tissue structures of a normal root, they produce [[adventitious roots]] and stems which again produce adventitious roots.&lt;ref name=Davis1994&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Davis | first1 = Edited by Tim D.| last2 = Haissig | first2 = Bruce E.| year = 1994| title = Biology of adventitious root formation| volume = | pages = 17 | isbn = 978-0-306-44627-6| publisher = Plenum Press| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In root-tubers, there are no nodes and internodes or reduced leaves. Root tubers have one end called the proximal end, which is the end that was attached to the old plant; this end has crown tissue that produces buds which grow into new stems and foliage.&lt;ref name=Kyte1996&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kyte | first1 = Lydiane | last2 = Kleyn | first2 = John | year = 1996 | title = Plants from test tubes : an introduction to micropropagation | volume =  | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 978-0-88192-361-2 | publisher = Timber Press | location = Portland, Or. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other end of the root tuber is called the distal end, and it normally produces unmodified roots. In stem tubers the order is reversed, with the distal end producing stems. Tuberous roots are biennial in duration: the first year the plant produces root-tubers, and at the end of the growing season, the plant shoots often die, leaving the newly generated tubers. The next growing season, the root-tubers produce new shoots. As the shoots of the new plant grow, the stored reserves of the root-tuber are consumed in the production of new roots, stems, and reproductive organs; any remaining root tissue dies concurrently to the plant's regeneration of next generation of root-tubers.

Root tubers, along with other storage tissues that plants produce, are consumed by animals as a rich source of nutrients. The root-tubers of Arrowhead plants of the genus ''[[Sagittaria]]'' are eaten by ducks.&lt;ref name=Hammerson2004&gt;{{Citation | last = Hammerson | first =  Geoffrey A. | year = 2004 | title = Connecticut wildlife : biodiversity, natural history, and conservation | volume =  | pages = 89 | isbn = 978-1-58465-369-1 | publisher = University Press of New England | location = Hanover }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants with root tubers are propagated in late summer to late winter by digging up the tubers and separating them, making sure that each piece has some crown tissue for replanting.

Universalism, in [[human geography]], signals the position that ideas of development produced in Western social sciences hold for all times and places.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. (2000) Universalism, in R. Johnston, D. Gregory, G. Pratt and M. Wats(eds), “The Dictionary of Human Geography". Oxford: Blackwell, 869-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Universalist thinking began in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when philosophers decided on "truths" that could explain occurrences rationally and accurately. [[Development geography]], human geography and other disciplines seek to find and critique universal "truths". Critics suggest that Universalism has created a world knowledge hierarchy placing Western Europe, North America and the rest of the "developed" world at the top, as the centre of knowledge, and placing the rest of the globe below, as ignorant and needing to be educated. The hierarchy reiterates the [[core-periphery]] notion, examining it in terms of knowledge differentials across space.

==Origins==
As intellectuals began to question traditional understandings of the world and think on a global scale, new "truths" were created to help explain the world as placeless, free of cultural specificity, abstract and apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, V.L., "Making Development Geography". London: Hodder Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;   They began to manifest themselves in development policies, political apparatuses, and other institutions. In the late 19th and 20th century, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote that "the truths of [modern] science are independent of any local context", echoing the Enlightenment's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe, thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim E., "Selected Writings".Cambridge: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood, which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal "truths".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is not authentically true at all.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, T.  ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global diffusion==
As universal "truth" claims gained acceptance among Western intellectuals, they began an important transition into the school system.  [[Michel Foucault]] describes the 17th- and-18th century school systems as being important because of highly complex systems of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As "truth" claims were taught to children, they became embedded within societal and political apparatuses. Once cemented within such institutions, they were able to flourish and remain.

Through the imperialist expansion by the west and the successive [[colonisation]] around the globe, supposed universal "truths" began to diffuse across borders, space and place.  Once colonies were set up and dominant hegemons were in place the processes of the west began to be the processes of the world and the necessary steps to [[modernisation]].

==Changing truths==
The realization that the truths may not be universal across different spaces was an important factor in the 1970s, when questions arose of nationally varying styles of science. By the mid-1980s, geographical sensibility towards science increased, seeking to show that locality and spatial situation needed to be remembered to understand how scientific knowledge was made, became credible and flowed globally.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. ''Placing the View from Nowhere: Historical and Sociological Problems in the Location of Science''. Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; It has been with that new situational approach to knowledge formation that allowed geographers to begin analyses of [[epistemology]] with relation to place and confront "truth" formation with a more culturally ecological ([[cultural ecology]]) approach.

==Foucaulta  truths==
Important to universalism in geography is understanding how knowledge becomes accepted as truth. Foucault discusses truth in terms of "societal regimes of truth" and explains that truths are made up by societies by selecting "the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true" and creating and controlling "the mechanisms that enable us to distinguish between true and false statements".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 131&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on about the relationship between truth and systems of power and how they produce and maintain such regimes of truth.

The '''White Coat Ceremony''' ('''WCC''') is a relatively new [[ritual]] in some [[medical]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]), [[dentistry|dental]], [[optometry]], [[audiology]],  [[chiropractic]], dietetic,  [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[podiatry|podiatric]], [[pharmacy]], [[physician assistant]], pathologists' assistant,  [[nursing]], naturopathic and [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] schools that marks the [[student]]'s transition from the study of preclinical to clinical health sciences.  At some schools, where students begin meeting patients early in their education, the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins. It is an example of a [[matriculation]].

WCCs typically involve a formal "coating" of students.

==Description==

Over 100 medical schools in the United States now have a WCC, and many students now consider it a [[rite of passage]] in the journey toward a healthcare career.  Some schools also use this as a graduation from the entire program. For example, [[Moreno Valley College]] has a White Coat Ceremony for the Physician Assistant students at the end of their final term, where the short coats are discarded and long coats are given as a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats.

According to some{{who|date=June 2012}}, WCCs have taken on a quasi-religious significance, that symbolizes a "conversion" of a [[lay person]] into a member of the healthcare profession&lt;ref name=veatch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veatch RM |title=White coat ceremonies: a second opinion |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11834749 |doi= 10.1136/jme.28.1.5|url=http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11834749 |pmc=1733513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is similar to a priest's ordination to the [[priesthood]], although it is notable that the white coat is a recent adoption by the medical profession. However, in many medical schools around the world students begin wearing their white coats during first year anatomy class, so there is no official white coat ceremony.

In the nineteenth century respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the [[quackery]] and [[Medieval medicine|mysticism]] of ni kineteenth century medicine.  To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist - the white laboratory coat.&lt;ref&gt;Jones VA, "The White Coat: Why not Follow Suit?" JAMA. 1999;281:478. [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/281/5/478 Full Text].&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the more recent association of the white coat with medicine since its continued adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23.

WCCs originated in [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;Warren, Peter M. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/18/local/me-23619 For New Medical Students, White Coats Are a Warmup]" ''Los Angeles Times'', 18 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but the first full-fledged ceremony was at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt; In 1993, Dr. [[Arnold P.

Since starting in the US, several medical schools in countries outside of the United States (such as [[Iran]], Israel, Canada, [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Brazil]] and [[Poland]]) have also started holding WCCs. The ceremony is no longer limited to medical students; starting in 1995, US pharmacy schools started holding WCCs, with the difference that most pharmacy students receive their coats at the end of their first academic year. In 2003 a survey found that the majority of US pharmacy schools hold WCCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown DL, Ferrill MJ, Pankaskie MC |title=White coat ceremonies in US schools of pharmacy |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=1414–9 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14519030 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D124 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold-sponsored version of the WCC, or a similar rite of passage, is currently used by 97 percent of Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-accredited schools of medicine in the United States, and takes place at medical and osteopathic schools in 13 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanism-in-medicine.org/programs/rituals/white-coat-ceremony/|title=The Arnold P.

'''Women in music''' describes the role of women as [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critic]]s/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements (e.g., [[women's music]], which is music written and performed by women for women), events and genres related to [[Woman|women]], [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women constitute a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being [[singer-songwriter]]s), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critic]]s and rock instrumentalists. Notable women artists in pop, such as [[Bjork]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have commented about [[sexism]] and [[gender discrimination]] in the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics|title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics|first=Anwen|last=Crawford|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=7 April 2018|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|first = Karen |last = Mizoguchi|title = Lady Gaga Calls Music Industry a 'F---king Boys Club' |work = People|date = 12 December 2015|url =  http://www.people.com/article/lady-gaga-music-industry-boys-club-billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a recent study led by Dr. Smith announced that "...over the last six years, the representation of women in the music industry has been even lower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/arts/music/music-industry-gender-study-women-artists-producers.html|title=Gender Diversity in the Music Industry?

Women constitute a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Julian|last1=  Schaap |first2= Pauwke |last2 =Berkers|title = Grunting Alone?

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap|title=CBC Music|website=music.cbc.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|conductor of an orchestra]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica|last=Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a profession which has been called "one of the last [[glass ceiling]]s in the [[music industry]]".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;  In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the most recorded artists is a woman, [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer who is best known as a [[playback singer]] in Hindi cinema.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

==Songwriters==

{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=[l]ike most aspects of the... music business [in the 1960s], songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women... were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done... [and women] were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music]. |author=Erika Abrams in ''Rebeat'', 28 January 2015}}
A songwriter is an individual who writes the [[lyrics]], [[melody|melodies]] and [[chord progression]]s for songs, typically for a [[popular music]] genre such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] or [[country music]]. A songwriter can also be called a [[composer]], although the latter term tends to be mainly used for individuals from the classical music genre.

===19th century-early 20th century===
"Only a few of the many women [songwriters] in America had their music published and heard during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; According to Richard A. Reublin and Richard G. Beil, the "lack of mention of women [songwriters] is a glaring and embarrassing omission in our musical heritage."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Women "struggled to write and publish music in the man's world of 20th century [[Tin Pan Alley]]. Prior to 1900 and even after, it was expected that "women would perform music, not make music."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; In 1880, Chicago music critic George P. Upton wrote the book ''Women In Music'', in which he argued that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to the "biological predisposition" of women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; As part of women's role in music education, women wrote hymns and children's music. The "secular music in print in America before 1825 shows only about 70 works by women." In the mid 19th century, notable women songwriters emerged, including [[Faustina Hasse Hodges]], Susan Parkhurst, [[Augusta Browne]] and [[Marion Dix Sullivan]]. By 1900, there were many more women songwriters, but "many were still forced to use pseudonyms or initials" to hide the fact that they were women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

[[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] was the "preeminent woman composer of the late 1800's and well into the middle of the twentieth century... [making her] the first million selling woman" songwriter.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Maude Nugent (1877–1958) wrote "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" in 1896. She also penned "Down At Rosie Reilly's Flat", "My Irish Daisy" and "Mary From Tipperary".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Charlotte Blake (1885–1979) was a staff writer for at the Whitney Warner Publishing Co., in Detroit, Michigan. Initially, the company billed her as "C. Blake" to hide her gender, but by 1906 ads used her full name.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; [[Caro Roma]] (1866–1937) was the gender-ambiguous pseudonym for [[Carrie Northly]]. She was "one of America's more well known and popular composers of the Tin Pan Alley era." Her songs include "Can't Yo' Heah Me Calling", "Faded Rose", "The Angelus", "Thinking of Thee" and "Resignation".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; About 95% of the songwriters in British [[music hall]] during the early 1900s were men; however, about 30% of the singers were women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Mullen.

===Jazz in the 20th century===
[[File:Lil Armstrong Billboard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] (1898-1971) was a notable jazz songwriter.]]
While [[jazz]] songwriting has long been a male-dominated field, there have been a few notable [[Women in Jazz|women jazz songwriters]]. In the 1930s, [[Ann Ronell]] (1905–1993) wrote several hit songs. She is known for her 1932 hit song "[[Willow Weep for Me]]" and the 1933 Disney song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?".&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt; [[Irene Higginbotham]] (1918–1988) wrote almost 50 songs, her best-known being "Good Morning Heartache".&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/03/jazz-women-songwriters-gioia/|title=Five women songwriters who helped shape the sound of jazz |website= OUPblog|date=12 March 2013|first = Ted|last = Gioia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Fields]] (1905–1974) wrote the lyrics for over 400 songs, some of which were played by [[Duke Ellington]]. She co-wrote "[[The Way You Look Tonight]]" with [[Jerome Kern]], which won the 1936 Oscar for Best Song. She co-wrote several jazz standards with [[Jimmy McHugh]], such as "[[Exactly Like You (song)|Exactly Like You]]," "[[On the Sunny Side of the Street]]" and "[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love]]."&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt; [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] (1898–1971) played piano in [[King Oliver]]'s Creole Jazz Band. Her most famous song, "Struttin' with Some Barbecue" has been recorded 500 times. Her other notable songs are "Doin' the Suzie Q," "Just for a Thrill" and "Bad Boy".&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt; While [[Billie Holiday]] (1915–1959) is best known as a singer, she co-wrote "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]" and "[[Don't Explain (song)|Don't Explain]]" with [[Arthur Herzog, Jr.]] and she penned the blues song "[[Fine and Mellow (song)|Fine and Mellow]]."&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt;

===Pop in the 1960s===

[[Laura Nyro]] penned "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]", "Eli's Coming"  and "[[And When I Die]]". She stated "I'm not interested in conventional limitations when it comes to my songwriting….I may bring a certain [[feminist]] perspective to my songwriting."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

===New wave of female singer-songwriters===
By the late 1960s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.  These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in [[Newsweek]], July, 1969, "The Girls: Letting Go": "What is common to them – to [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lotti Golden]], to [[Laura Nyro]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Janis Ian]] and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery. [[Grace Slick]] a former model, was widely known in rock and roll history for her role in San Francisco's burgeoning psychedelic music scene in the mid–1960s." In ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 January 2017, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter — politics, drugs, disappointment, the isolation of the itinerant performer, and urban life.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/26/from-joni-mitchell-to-laura-marling-how-female-troubadours-changed-music|title=From Joni Mitchell to Laura Marling: how female troubadours changed music|first=Laura|last=Barton|date=26 January 2017|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native New Yorker, [[Lotti Golden]], in her Atlantic debut album ''[[Motor-Cycle (album)|Motor-Cycle]]'', chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late '60s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the singer-songwriter, informing generations of women singer-songwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2664&amp;from=search |via= JoniMitchell.com Library|title= THE GIRLS—LETTING GO|work= Newsweek|date= 14 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Musical theatre===
In [[musical theatre]], "female songwriters are rare in an industry dominated by males on the creative end. Work by male songwriters is more often produced, and it was only [in 2015] that an all-female writing team made history by winning the [[Tony Award for Best Score]]."&lt;ref name="Playbill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/its-revving-up-the-next-generation-of-female-songwriters-share-their-hopes-for-the-future-355460 |title="It's Revving Up" – The Next Generation of Female Songwriters Share Their Hopes for the Future|last1=Gioia|first1=Michael  |last2= |first2= |date=2 August 2015 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill|access-date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, for the first time, an all-female writing team of [[Lisa Kron]] (Best Book) and [[Jeanine Tesori]] and Kron (Best Original Score)&lt;ref name="playbill.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/fun-home-duo-make-history-as-first-all-female-writing-team-to-win-the-tony-350678#sthash.Pe3xUFFi.dpuf |title=Fun Home Duo Make History as First All-Female Writing Team to Win the Tony |last1=Purcell |first1=Carey |last2= |first2= |date=7 June 2015 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill |access-date=7 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the [[Tony Award for Best Score]] for ''[[Fun Home (musical)|Fun Home]]'', although work by male songwriters continues to be produced more often.&lt;ref name="Playbill"/&gt; In 2013, [[Cyndi Lauper]] was the "first female composer to win the [Tony for] Best Score without a male collaborator" for writing the music and lyrics for ''[[Kinky Boots (musical)|Kinky Boots]]''.&lt;ref name="playbill.com"/&gt; Notable female songwriters in musical theatre include singer-songwriter and actress [[Lauren Pritchard (singer)|Lauren Pritchard]], who wrote ''Songbird''; Zoe Sarnak, who wrote ''A Lasting Impression'' and ''The Years Between''; and Katie Thompson, who would like to "see women characters... that are complicated and strong and vulnerable."&lt;ref name="Playbill"/&gt; Thompson stated that in the musical theatre industry, "when you fight for something as a woman, especially an artistic thing ..you are either perceived as being a bitch or you are perceived [as] 'emotional'", a label that enables others to dismiss you.&lt;ref name="Playbill"/&gt;

===Black women===
According to [[LaShonda Katrice Barnett]], a college and university teacher and author of a book on black women songwriters, of the "over 380 members of the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], just 2 are black women ([[Sylvia Moy]] and [[Valerie Simpson]])". Barnett asks "[w]hy are there so few prominent black women songwriters?"&lt;ref name="songfacts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/black_women_songwriters/ |title=Black Women Songwriters |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett states that two important black women songwriters are [[Abbey Lincoln]], a rare example of a jazz singer who wrote her own albums and [[Cassandra Wilson]], who records both her own songs and "covers" of famous artists.&lt;ref name="songfacts.com"/&gt;

==Composers==
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|upright|220px|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
{{See also|List of female composers by birth date}}
American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard  'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Abbey|last = Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=Spacebomb: Truth lies somewhere in between |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt;

===Medieval era===
{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|description=From ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179) was a German [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]], composer, writer, philosopher, and [[visionary]].&lt;ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001"&gt;Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and an early [[morality play]].  Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum.'' The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], using soaring melodies that pushed the boundaries of the more traditional [[Gregorian chant]].

[[Maddalena Casulana]] (1544–1590) was an Italian composer, [[lute]]nist and singer.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative names: Madalena Casulana di Mezarii, Madalena Casula.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first work dates from 1566: four madrigals in a collection, ''Il Desiderio'', which she produced in [[Florence]]. Two years later she published in [[Venice]] her first book of madrigals for four voices, ''Il primo libro di madrigali'', which is the first printed, published work by a woman in Western music history.&lt;ref name="Bridges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005155|title=Casulana [Mezari], Maddalena - Grove Music|website=Oxfordmusicinline.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was close to [[Isabella de' Medici]] and dedicated some of her music to her. In 1570, 1583 and 1586 she published other books of madrigals. In the dedication to her first book of madrigals, she shows her feelings about being a female composer at a time when this was rare: "[I] want to show the world, as much as I can in this profession of music, the vain error of men that they alone possess the gifts of intellect and artistry, and that such gifts are never given to women." 
Her style is [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] and [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] and her melodic lines are singable and attentive to the text. Other composers of the time, such as [[Philippe de Monte]], thought highly of her.

[[Caterina Assandra]] (1590–1618) was an Italian composer and [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]. She became famous as an organist and published various works.&lt;ref&gt;''Women Composers: Music Through the Ages.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165459/http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assandra composed a number of [[motet]]s and organ pieces. She studied [[counterpoint]] with Benedetto Re, one of the leading teachers at [[Pavia Cathedral]]. She composed a collection of [[motet]]s in the new [[concertato]] style in [[Milan]] in 1609, an imitative eight-voice ''[[Salve Regina]]'' in 1611, and a [[motet]], ''Audite verbum Dominum,'' for four voices in 1618. She composed traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is ''Duo seraphim.'' Her motet ''O Salutaris hodie,'' included in ''Motetti'' op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include the [[violone]], a bowed stringed instrument.

===Baroque era===
[[File:Orazio Gentileschi - Il suonatore di liuto (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Lute Player'' by [[Orazio Gentileschi]], presumed to be a portrait of Francesca Caccini]]
[[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641) was an Italian composer, singer, [[lute]]nist, poet, and music teacher. Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the "best singer in all of France". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute "comedy-ballet". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.

[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer. As a child, her considerable vocal talents were displayed to a wide audience. She was also compositionally gifted, and her father arranged for her to study with composer [[Francesco Cavalli]]. Strozzi was said to be "the most prolific composer – man or woman – of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the Middle of the century".{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=135}} Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs.{{sfn|Heller|2006}} She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=138}} Nearly three-quarters of her printed works were written for [[soprano]], but she also published works for other voices.{{sfn|Kendrick|2002}} Her compositions are firmly rooted in the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' tradition. Strozzi's music evokes the spirit of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]], heir of [[Monteverdi]].  However, her style is more lyrical, and more dependent on sheer vocal sound.{{sfn|Rosand|1986|p=170}} Many of the texts for her early pieces were written by her father Giulio. Later texts were written by her father's colleagues, and for many compositions she may have written her own texts.

[[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) was a French composer, musician and [[harpsichordist]]. She was born into a family of musicians and master instrument-makers. A child prodigy, she performed on the [[harpsichord]] before King [[Louis XIV]]. She became a musician in the Royal Court and taught, composed, and gave concerts at home and throughout Paris, to great acclaim.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;[[Catherine Cessac]].

[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/14084].&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the few well-known female composers of her time, and unlike many of her contemporaries, she composed in a wide variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Cyr. "Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre: Myth or Marvel? Seeking the Composer's Individuality." The Musical Times. Vol. 149, No. 1905 (Winter, 2008), pp. 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her talent and achievements were acknowledged by [[Titon du Tillet]], who accorded her a place on his ''Mount Parnassus'' when she was only 26 years old, next to Lalande and Marais and directly below Lully. Her works include a ballet, an opera (''[[Céphale et Procris (Jacquet de la Guerre)|Céphale et Procris]]''), [[trio sonata]]s, harpsichord pieces, ''Sonates pour le viollon et pour le clavecin'' and vocal works such as her ''[[Cantates]] françoises sur des sujets tirez de l'Ecriture''.

[[Harriett Abrams]] (1758–1821) was an English composer and [[soprano]]. As a singer, she was praised for her performances of [[George Frideric Handel]]. She studied singing, [[music theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] with composer [[Thomas Arne]] before making her opera début in 1775 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780–1790. Abrams composed several songs, two of which, "The Orphan's Prayer" and "Crazy Jane", became popular. She published two sets of Italian and English [[canzonet]]s, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental [[ballad]]s. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]].&lt;ref name="Grove1"&gt;Olive Baldwin, Thelma Wilson: "Harriett Abrams", ''Grove Music Online'' ed.

[[Maria Teresa Agnesi]] (1720–1795) was an Italian composer.  Though she was most famous for her compositions, she was also an accomplished [[harpsichordist]] and singer. The majority of her surviving compositions were written for keyboard, the voice, or both. Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which was progressive and enlightened in [[women's rights]]. Her patron was [[Maria Theresia]], holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis]], a gifted composer and contemporary. Her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. She composed operas, including heroic drama and serious drama styles. She also wrote arias, concertos and sonatas for keyboard, small ensemble and voice.

[[Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia|Princess Anna Amalia]] (1723–1787) was a Prussian composer and score curator. She learned to play the harpsichord, flute, and violin as a young woman. She became the Abbess of Quedlinburg in 1755.&lt;ref name="huberty"&gt;{{cite book | title=L'Allemagne Dynastique, Tome V -- Hohenzollern-Waldeck | publisher=Laballery |author1=Huberty, Michel |author2=Giraud, Alain |author3=Magdelaine, F. and B. | year=1989 | location=France | pages=162, 172| isbn=2-901138-05-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent most of her time in Berlin, where she devoted herself to music, and became a musical patron and composer. As a composer she achieved a modest amount of fame and is most known for her smaller chamber works, which included trios, marches, cantatas, songs and fugues. In 1758, she studied musical theory and composition with [[Johann Kirnberger|Johann Philipp Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. She composed chamber music such as flute sonatas. More, she set the text of Ramler's [[Passion cantata]] ''Der Tod Jesu'' ("The Death of Jesus") to music. She was also a collector of music, preserving over 600 volumes of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Karl Heinrich Graun]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], among others. Her works of [[curator|curation]] are a significant contribution to [[Western culture]].

[[Elisabeth Olin]] (1740–1828) was a Swedish opera singer and composer. She debuted as Alfhild in ''Syrinx'' referred to as Sweden's first native [[Opéra comique|Opera comique]], at ''[[Bollhuset]]'' in 1747. She became a famed vocalist in the regular public concerts at ''[[Riddarhuset]]'' in [[Stockholm]], and published her own compositions; she was one of the Swedish composers who wrote one composition each for the collection ''Gustaviade. En hjältedikt i tolv sånger'' ('Gustaviade. A heroic poem of twelve songs') from 1768; where she wrote the composition number eight.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Ivarsdotter Johnsson och Leif Jonsson: Musiken i Sverige.

''Anacréon'', her first opera, received a private performance at the residence of the [[Count of Provence]] in 1781. In 1784, her opera ''Tibulle et Délie'' was performed at the Paris Opera. In 1792, her two-act [[opéra comique]], ''Plaire, c'est commander'' was performed at the [[Théâtre Montansier]].

[[Anna Bon]] (1739–1767?) was an Italian composer and performer.

[[Marianne von Martinez]] (1744–1812) was an Austrian composer, singer and pianist. [[Metastasio]] noticed her precocious talents and came to oversee her musical education, which included keyboard lessons from [[Haydn]], singing lessons with [[Porpora]] and composition lessons with [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and the Imperial court composer [[Giuseppe Bonno]]. She was a native speaker of both Italian and German and knew French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Godt, 541&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she played for the Imperial court, where she "attracted attention with her beautiful voice and her keyboard playing".&lt;ref&gt;Wessely, [[New Grove]], "Marianne von Martinez", online edition cited below&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, she was frequently asked to perform before the Empress [[Maria Theresa]].&lt;ref&gt;Godt 1995, 538&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the works that Marianna composed are set for solo voice. She wrote a number of secular cantatas and two oratorios to Italian texts. Surviving compositions include four [[mass]]es, six [[motet]]s, and three litanies for choir. She wrote in the Italian style, as was typical for the early [[classical music era|Classical]] period in Vienna.  Her harpsichord performance practice was compared to the style of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]]. Her Italian oratorio ''Isacco figura del redentore'' was premiered by massive forces in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl (1856:60)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fanny Hensel 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Mendelssohn, 1842, by [[Moritz Daniel Oppenheim]]]]

[[Maria Szymanowska]] (1789–1831) was a well-known Polish composer and pianist. She wrote in many of the same genres as fellow Pole [[Frederic Chopin]] (1810–1849). Szymanowska maintained connections with several famous nineteenth-century people, including [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Poland's greatest poet.

[[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) was one of the best-known women composers of the 1800s. She showed prodigious musical ability as a child and began to write music. Even though famous visitors to her family home were equally impressed by Fanny and her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], Fanny was limited by prevailing attitudes of the time toward women. Her father was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that "[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82&lt;/ref&gt; Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for [musical] authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it'.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113
&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Clara Schumann]] (1819–1896) was a German composer and concert pianist who had a 61-year concert career, which changed the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public. From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Frédéric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently "praised her extravagantly" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.&lt;ref name="Nancya250"&gt;Reich (1986), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; She was named a ''Königliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' ("Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.&lt;ref name="Nancya250" /&gt;

She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. &lt;!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:

{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before. But to have children, and a husband who is always living in the realm of imagination, does not go together with composing. She cannot work at it regularly, and I am often disturbed to think how many profound ideas are lost because she cannot work them out'.}}{{cn|date=February 2018}}--&gt;

====Individuals and bandleaders====
[[File:Suzi Quatro plays a bass guitar while she sings at AIS Arena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Suzi Quatro]] is a singer, bassist and bandleader. When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]

Women have a high prominence in many [[popular music]] styles as singers. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. "[P]laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; As well, rock music "is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, there has been a gendered "distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation" in music.&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"/&gt; "[S]everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated – hence, inferior – pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex... – plays a crucial role."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; In the 1960s pop music scene, "[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;{{cite journal

====All-female bands and girl groups====
An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in [[popular music]] genres such as rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]] and related genres which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a [[girl group]], in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt; While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.

A [[girl group]] is a music act featuring several female singers who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female [[pop music]] singing groups which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and the [[British Invasion]], many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups - A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalist groups [[Sugababes]] and [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as "girl bands" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud Meet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] ''OK'' magazine, 20 March 2009; [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008; while instrumentalists [[Girlschool]] are termed a "[[girl group]]" [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie Database; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s-1960s====
In the [[Jazz Age]] and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, [[The Ingenues]], The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and "Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators" were popular.[[Ina Ray Hutton]] led an all-girl band, the [[Melodears]], from 1934 to 1939.  Eunice Westmoreland, under the name [[Rita Rio]], led an all-female band appearing on [[NBC Radio]] and for [[Vitaphone]] and [[RKO]]. A Polish group [[Filipinki]] was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2 |title=Wyborcza.pl |publisher=Szczecin.gazeta.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217153333/http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2# |archive-date=17 December 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were [[Goldie &amp; the Gingerbreads]], to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1964, [[The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|The Pleasure Seekers]] with [[Suzi Quatro]] to Hideout Records in 1964 and [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, [[The Feminine Complex]] to Athena Records in 1968, and [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when [[Mo Ostin]] signed them to [[Warner Bros. Records]].  There were also others, such as [[The Liverbirds]] (1962–1967), [[the Ace of Cups]] (1967), [[The Heart Beats]] (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970).

====1970s-1980s====
In 1971 [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with "Charity Ball" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], recorded the first of a string of albums. [[The Runaways]] were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members [[Joan Jett]], [[Cherie Currie]] and [[Lita Ford]] all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands.  On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1982 "The Billboard Hot 100 1982"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Jett]]'s ''[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]'' at No. 3 and [[the Go-Go's]] ''[[We Got the Beat]]'' at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money.

[[File:Viv Albertine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Punk guitarist [[Viv Albertine]].]]
In the United Kingdom, the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]] in the late 1970s with its "anyone can do it" ethos led to women making significant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Caroline|title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion|date=1977|publisher=Omnibus/Hawthorne Books|location=London|isbn=978-0801561290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Judy|title=15 Essential Women Punk Rock Icons|url=http://flavorwire.com/199630/15-essential-women-punk-icons|website=Flavorwire|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. "That was the beauty of the punk thing," [[Chrissie Hynde]] later said." [Sexual] discrimination didn't exist in that scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Punk and Post-Punk Music|url=http://www.biography.com/people/groups/women-of-punk-and-post-punk-music|website=Biography.com|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This participation played a role in the historical development of punk music, especially in the U.S. and U.K. at that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Women in Punk?|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/whywomeninpunk.htm|website=Women in Punk|publisher=Punk77.co.uk|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music: Female Musicians of the Punk Era|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate/Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-1845539573|url=http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;isbn=9780754657736&amp;lang=cy-GB|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woronzoff|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music' Is an Important Work, But a Replay of the Same Old Themes|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/161962-the-lost-women-of-rock-music...-by-helen-reddington/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues "[i]t would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conference proceedings (September 2001)|title=No Future?|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=University of Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=Introduction: The Lost Women of Rock Music|date=1977|publisher=Ashgate|location=London|isbn=9780754657736|url=http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Lost_Women_of_Rock_Music_Intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Rotten]] wrote that "During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ...

Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist [[Viv Albertine]], who stated that "the A&amp;R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously..

The all-female [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Girlschool]], from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, [[Kathy Valentine]] departed to join the all-female band [[The Go-Go's]], switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled "The St. Valentines Day Massacre" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates [[Motörhead]] under the name [[Headgirl]]. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom. Women in the heavy metal genre tend to have to limit themselves due to the genre being very male orientated.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, R.L. (2016).

=====Grunge=====
While there is a perception that the groups in the 1980s and 1990s [[alternative rock]] genre of [[grunge]] were "overwhelmingly male" (e.g., [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), "[w]omen were totally represented" in grunge bands such as [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], STP, [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Courtney Love]]'s group [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], the latter an "[[All female band|all-female Minneapolis band]]", and grunge was "inextricably linked with [[Riot Grrrl]]", an underground [[feminist]] [[punk rock|punk]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain|title=Ten myths about grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain |last=True |first=Everett |date= 24 August 2011|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=29 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and drummers [[Patty Schemel]] ([[Hole (band)|Hole]] and Courtney Love projects) and [[Lori Barbero]] of [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://90srock.about.com/od/top-picks/tp/The-Greatest-Drummers-of-the-90s.htm|title=The 10 Greatest Drummers of the '90s|website=90srockmusic.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s-2000s====
In the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting [[Bonnie Raitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tina Weymouth]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tina Weymouth &amp; David Byrne, The Talking Heads" (cover story), ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; on their covers. While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.

In the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  "bad" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. [[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more "lunar viewpoint" in their roles as musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Boder, Christopher. "The Hole Story", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70. October 1991. "Most women in rock are only repeating what men have done. The women in this band are not doing that. We're coming at things from a more feminine, lunar, viewpoint."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the punk, female-led [[Riot Grrrl]] genre was associated with bands such as [[Bratmobile]] and [[Bikini Kill]].

====2000s-2010s====
In the 2000s, all female and female fronted bands started using their influence to promote feminism and females in the music industry. Bands like The Distillers, fronted by Brody Dalle, influenced the rise of street punk. St. Vincent started gaining more traction and eventually appeared on the cover of Guitar World magazine. St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the lack of female representation in music has been a major controversial point in the industry. Female musicians and bands are constantly overlooked in favor of male artists, however many people in the music industry have been making an effort to change this.

===Jazz===
[[File:Mary Lou Williams (Gottlieb 09231) - Crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mary Lou Williams]] (1910–1981) was a pianist, composer and arranger who played [[jazz]], classical and [[Gospel music|gospel]] music. She wrote hundreds of compositions and arrangements and recorded more than one hundred records.]]
Historically, the majority of well-known [[Women in jazz|women performers in jazz]] have been singers, such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Dinah Washington]]. ''Culture Trip'' notes that women in jazz have been "too often confined to the role of chanteuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasch|first1=Mirac|title=The Top 10 Female Jazz Musicians You Should Know|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-top-10-female-jazz-musicians-you-should-know/|accessdate=3 April 2016|publisher=Culture Trip|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many notable instrumental performers. In some cases, these musicians are also composers and bandleaders:
* [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (b. 1929): bandleader, pianist, arranger, composer
* [[Regina Carter]]: [[jazz violin]]
* [[Melba Liston]]: trombonist and arranger
* [[Vi Redd]] (b. 1928): alto saxophonist 
* [[Melissa Aldana]]: tenor saxophonist 
* [[Emily Remler]]: jazz guitar
* [[Mimi Fox]]: jazz guitar
*[[Sweet Emma Barrett]]
*[[Terri Lyne Carrington]] (drums)
*[[Carla Bley]] (piano)
*[[Mary Lou Williams]] (piano)
*[[Billie Pierce]] (piano)
*[[Jeanette Kimball]] (piano)
*[[Lovie Austin]] (piano and bandleader)
*[[Joelle Khoury]] (piano and composer)

There have also been [[all-female band|all-female jazz bands]] such as [[The International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

===Classical music===
Instrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.

Many album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, "often using risqué images".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;

====Orchestra====
[[File:Music. Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08057.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1942]]
Historically, orchestras tended to be almost exclusively male, with the exception of the harp player, as the harp was considered a "women's instrument". A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the "lighter instruments", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias In International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that "ethnic and gender uniformity" gave their orchestra a better sound.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has "gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity" in the orchestra.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO member stated that men "carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO performer stated that "pregnancy brings problems.  It brings disorder.  Another important argument against women is that they can bring the solidarity of the men in question. You find that in all men's groups."

The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (of the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by [[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) As late as February 1996, first flautist Dieter Flury told [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] was a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=25 February 1996 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarah Chang before performing.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Classical violinist [[Sarah Chang]] before performing a 2005 solo concert]]

In 1997, the orchestra was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and International Association of Women in Music. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-appoints-first-ever-female-concertmaster-opera-austria |title = Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster|work = [[France 24]]|date = 8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership, compared to 14% in the Berlin Philharmonic, 30% in the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and 36% in the [[New York Philharmonic]]. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s. She said it chooses "the best we get," implying that full gender equity would take time as older members retire and new ones audition under gender-neutral conditions.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czech Philharmonic]] excludes women and the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] "has a history of gender discrimination."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists. Brass, percussion, and [[Double bass|string-bass]] orchestra sections are still predominantly male."&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hannah|last=Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soloists====
In classical music, soloists may perform unaccompanied solos on their instrument, as occurs with pianists who play works for solo piano or stringed instruments who play Baroque suites for one instrument (e.g., [[Bach suites for solo cello]]). In many cases, though, soloists are accompanied, either by a pianist, a small [[chamber music]] ensemble, or, in the case of a concerto, by a full symphony orchestra. In the 2014–2015 season, the majority of concerto soloists who performed with major Canadian orchestras were male. In the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], 67% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], 74% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], 79% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]], 84% of the concerto soloists were male.&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; When the CBC news story on the gender balance of concerto soloists was released, the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, [[Bramwell Tovey]], disputed the accuracy of the news story in regards to his orchestra, arguing that the article only took a single season into account.

==Singers==

===Popular music===
[[File:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Amsterdam 2 (23823323680).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is often referred to as the artist who changed the role of women in popular music.]]

Singers in popular music perform the vocals for bands and other music groups, which may range in size from a [[Musical duo|duo]] or a [[power trio]] to a large jazz [[big band]]. Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show. Two well-known examples of pop singers who perform elaborate dance routines in their live shows are [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and [[Britney Spears]].

Singer-songwriter and music producer [[Bjork]] has commented on how "women's labor and expertise—inside and outside of the music industry—go unnoticed." She has stated that "[I]t's invisible, what women do," and "[I]t's not rewarded as much."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Bjork states "that her male collaborators are typically credited for the sound of her records; because on stage she mainly sings, there is a widespread assumption that she neither produces [as a music producer] nor plays an instrument."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; In 2015, "while accepting the Woman of the Year honor at this year's Billboard Women in Music event", [[Lady Gaga]] commented on the "difficulties of being a female recording artist." She said it "is really hard sometimes for women in music. It's like a f[uck]ing boys club that we just can't get in to." She stated that she "tried for so long... to be taken seriously as a musician for my intelligence more than my body", yet she felt that others in the industry did not believe that women could have a "musical background... [or] understand what you're doing because you're a female."&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book  states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Not only do female artists feel the pressure to please their male counterparts but it is also difficult for female DJs to fit in, in a male-dominated field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ricochet.media/en/48/DJs-tackle-gender-bias|title=Female DJs tackle gender bias {{!}} Ricochet|work=Ricochet|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|180 px |[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the "Queen of Funk."]]
Despite [[funk]]'s popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis," most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that "[[Betty Davis]] is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility"&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Keyes, "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis" 35.&lt;/ref&gt; (35). Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], and [[Betty Davis]].

Below are some of the top-earning female singers in the [[2010s in music|2010s]]. Another way of selecting the most notable singers for this section would be by [[Music criticism|critical acclaim]], but this is a more subjective criteria than earnings. Almost all of these singers are also songwriters, and some are also music producers:

[[Classic female blues]] was an early form of [[blues music]] popular in the 1920s. An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.

[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude "Ma" Rainey]] (1886–1939), known as the "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and [[comedy]] around 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; New York-based cabaret singer [[Mamie Smith]] recorded "Crazy Blues" in 1920, which sold over 75,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith became known as "America's First Lady of the Blues". In 1920, the vaudeville singer [[Lucille Hegamin]] became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "The Jazz Me Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethel Waters]], [[Alberta Hunter]], [[Mary Stafford (singer)|Mary Stafford]], [[Katie Crippen]], [[Edith Wilson (singer)|Edith Wilson]], and [[Esther Bigeou]], among others, made their first recordings before the end of 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sheldon. ''Blues Who's Who'' (Revised Ed.). New York: Da Capo Press, 1994. pp. 48, 137, 254, 484, 540, 580.&lt;/ref&gt; These blues recordings were typically labeled as "[[race records]]" to distinguish them from records sold to white audiences. Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jesse R., and Abrol Fairweather. ''Blues: Thinking Deep about Feeling Low''. Hoboken, N.J. Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.

The most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the "Empress of the Blues". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country music ===
Gender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: "Bro-Country", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular "Bro-Country" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time. Dr. Eric Rasumssen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, "talking more about women’s appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters."

"Bro-Country" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important.

===Jazz===

While woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the  Cool jazz era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]].

Classical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the "color" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the "color" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.

L. Macy (Accessed 9 February 2009), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Anderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.

Women play an important role in [[world music]], a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the world, including [[ethnic music]] and [[traditional music]] from Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and other regions, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition intermingle (e.g., mixtures of Western pop and ethnic music). The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|booktitle=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian actress, singer and dancer [[Carmen Miranda]] became known in the West as [[Exotism|exotic]] supplement in Hollywood films in the 1930s, akin to dancer [[Josephine Baker]] before, and the voice of [[exotica]] [[Yma Sumac]] after her. In the 1960s [[Elis Regina]] was the most prominent female singer in the [[Bossa Nova]] of Brazilian music that influenced popular music around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s Argentinian folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], South African [[Miriam Makeba]] or Greek [[Maria Farantouri]] were also recognized for their engagement against the oppressive political situation in their home states. Sosa singing "[[Gracias a la vida]]", Makeba's "[[Pata Pata]]", and Farantouri's collaboration with composer [[Mikis Theodorakis]] were musical icons of the struggle for [[human rights]]. The "Queen of Salsa" [[Celia Cruz]] immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1966.

With the rising interest in the then so-called world music in the 1980s old recordings of long established artists were re-discovered for a global audience and distributed worldwide; well known in their home country –sometimes stars with legendary status– like Arabic singers [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Asmahan]], and [[Fairuz]], the Algerian [[Raï]] singer [[Cheikha Rimitti]], [[Asha Bhosle]], most prolific playback singer for [[Bollywood]] film soundtracks, Romani [[Esma Redžepova]], Mexican [[ranchera]] singer [[Chavela Vargas]], and the [[Mahotella Queens]] from South Africa; or they were recorded for the first time (by Caucasian males) like [[Cesária Évora]] from Cape Verde, [[Stella Chiweshe]] from Zimbabwe and Afro-Peruvian [[Susana Baca]].

There are many notable women world music performers, including: [[Ann Savoy]], [[Bi Kidude]], [[Brenda Fassie]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Chava Alberstein]], [[Cleoma Breaux Falcon]], [[Dolly Collins]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Frehel]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Genoa Keawe]], [[Googoosh]], [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Lola Beltrán]], [[Lucha Reyes (Peruvian singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[Lucilla Galeazzi]] (The Mammas), [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Maria Tanase]], [[Mariam Doumbia]], [[Nada Mamula]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Oumou Sangare]], [[Rita Marley]], [[Rosa Passos]], [[Roza Eskenazi]], [[Safiye Ayla]], [[Salamat Sadikova]], [[Selda Bagcan]], [[Shirley Collins]], [[Valya Balkanska]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Warda Al-Jazairia|Warda]], and [[Zap Mama]].

==Eastern music==

===Arabic music===
[[File:ComedianpartyBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of musicians, including women performers, from a Baghdad [[musical theatre]] group in the 1920s]]
[[Arabic music]], which has [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] origins,&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age of the Moor''. By [[Ivan van Sertima]]. 1992. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|1-56000-581-5}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt;
is an amalgam of the music of the [[Arab people]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the music of all the varied peoples that make up the Arab world. In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means "a player upon an instrument". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a "learned female". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.

In the 9th century,  using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and "learned female" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.

===Chinese music===

In [[Chinese music]], music was a major activity for women during Ancient times, especially for learned women. Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by [[scholars]] and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.&lt;ref&gt;《胡笳十八拍》&lt;/ref&gt;

Women musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.

The [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.

Nowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several [[girl groups]] have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show. These groups have achieved significant success, with the debut [[Extended play|EP]] of Rocket Girls selling over 1.6 million copies.&lt;ref name="Tencent"/&gt; Despite this though, solo Chinese female artists continue to be much more popular overall in the country, as they have traditionally been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=-100&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most recently popular solo Chinese female singers include 胡66, [[Ada Zhuang]], [[Kelly Yu]], 陳粒 ([[:zh:陳粒|zh]]), [[Feng Timo]], [[Bibi Zhou]], 双笙, [[Tia Ray]], 金玟岐 ([[:zh:金玟岐|zh]]) and [[Jane Zhang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=1&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian music===
[[File:Ms subbulakshmi.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The Indian Carnatic classical singer [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]] (1916–2004)]]
[[Indian classical music]] is the [[art music]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the [[Hindu]] hymns. This chanting style evolved into [[jatis]] and eventually into [[raga]]s. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. The major composers from the historical Indian classical music tradition were men. Modern women vocalists include [[D. K. Pattammal]], [[M. S. Subbalakshmi]], [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Hirabai Barodekar]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Kishori Amonkar]], [[Malini Rajurkar]], [[Mogubai Kurdikar]], [[Prabha Atre]], [[Roshan Ara Begum]] and [[Shruti Sadolikar Katkar]]. One woman instrumentalist is [[Annapurna Devi]].

In [[Indian folk music]], [[lavani]] is a music genre popular in [[Maharashtra]] that is traditionally performed by women.
[[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਭੰਗੜਾ) is a form of [[dance]]-oriented [[folk music]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The present musical style is derived from non traditional musical accompaniment to the riffs of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] called by the same name. The female dance of [[Punjab region]] is known as [[Giddha]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਗਿੱਧਾ).

In the [[music of Bollywood]] (the centre of India's film industry) and other regional film industries in India, women [[playback singer]]s have had a significant role, with the sisters [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosle]], who have mainly worked in Hindi films, often referred to as two of the best-known and most prolific playback singers in India. In 2011, Bhosle was officially acknowledged by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the most recorded artist in music history.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

===Iranian music===
[[File:Parisa.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Fātemeh Vā'ezi ({{lang-fa|فاطمه واعظی}}) (born 1950), commonly known by her stage name Parīsā ({{lang-fa| پریسا}}), is a [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical]] vocalist and musician.]]

Since the [[Iranian revolution]], Iranian female solo vocalists have been permitted to perform for female audiences. Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905-1959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923-2004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].

The classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name "Parisa") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group  Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students. Both Ghashang and Vaezi have criticized the patriarchal power structure in Iran for its treatment of female musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Javaheri, 'With These Problems of Life, There Is No Time for Art,' trans. Maryam Habibian, Zanan, No. 36 (1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian folk-music performers include [[Sima Bina]], [[Darya Dadvar]], [[Monika Jalili]], [[Ziba Shirazi]], [[Zohreh Jooya]], and [[Shusha Guppy|Shushā Guppy]]. Iranian pop performers include [[Googoosh]], [[Hayedeh]], [[Mahasti]], [[Leila Forouhar]], [[Pooran (singer)|Pooran]], and [[Laleh Pourkarim]]. World music performers include [[Azam Ali]] and [[Cyminology|Cymin Samawatie]].

===Musicologists and music historians===
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian and [[feminist]] who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

Other notable women scholars include:

*[[Eva Badura-Skoda]]
*[[Margaret Bent]]
*[[Suzanne Cusick]]
*[[Ursula Günther]]

===Ethnomusicologists===
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]

===Music educators===

{{Main|Women in music education}}
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the latter half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

The majority of professional orchestra [[Conducting|conductors]] are male; ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last [[glass ceilings]] in the music industry".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt; A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the [[Paris National Opera|National Opéra in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Victor Tribot Laspière | title=Une main ferme à l’Orchestre national de France | url=http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/ou-sont-les-femmes-dans-la-musique-7766 | work=France Musique | date=2013-10-02 | accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/11-of-best-female-conductors |title=11 of today's top women conductors |publisher=Classical-Music.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of female conductors have become top-ranked international conductors. In January 2005, Australian conductor [[Simone Young]] became the first woman to conduct the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]. In 2008 [[Marin Alsop]], a protégé of [[Leonard Bernstein]], became the first woman to become the music director and principal conductor of a major US orchestra when she won the top job at the [[Baltimore Symphony]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture - Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were "protests from a large swathe of the Baltimore Symphony when she was first named Music Director", but since that time, "plaudits [have] roll[ed] in."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; In 2014, Alsop was the first woman conductor to lead the [[Last Night of the Proms]] concert–one of the most important classical music events in Britain–in its 118-year history.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

[[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first [[African-American]] woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005. She is the founder and music director of the Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, the first multi-ethnic professional [[orchestra]] in [[Philadelphia]]. A graduate of [[Wellesley College]] and the [[University of Chicago]], she is a [[Conducting|conductor]], [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. From 2001-2004, she was the assistant conductor of The [[Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22jeri+lynne+johnson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6vLxS8CJM8GB8gb0sZzvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jeri%20lynne%20johnson%22&amp;f=false|title=Sisters in the Spotlight|date=March 2003|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has led orchestras around the world including the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra|Colorado Symphony]], [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Symphony]] (UK), and the Weimar Staatskapelle (Germany). Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, "The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in [[music school]]; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;

===Sexism and gender discrimination===
Women conductors faced sexism and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. "To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B. Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.music.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2151:women-orchestral-conductors-in-america-the-struggle-for-acceptance%E2%80%94an-historical-view-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present&amp;Itemid=124] {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other all-women orchestras were founded in the early decades of the 20th century, and women conductors led these groups.

Women conductors continue to face sexism and gender discrimination in the early decades of the 21st century. In the 2010s, several notable male conductors and musicians made sexist statements about women conductors. In 2013, "[[Vasily Petrenko]], the principal conductor of the [[Oslo Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]], provoked outrage when he told a Norwegian newspaper that 'orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Charlotte Higgins |author2=chief arts writer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/male-conductors-better-orchestras-vasily-petrenko |title=Male conductors are better for orchestras, says Vasily Petrenko &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "when women have families, it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business".&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; [[Bruno Mantovani]], the director of the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gave an interview in which he made sexist statements about women conductors. Mantovani raised the "problem of [[maternity]]" and he questioned the ability of women to withstand the physical challenges and stresses of the profession, which he claimed involve "conducting, taking a plane, taking another plane, conducting again."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; [[Yuri Temirkanov]], the music director of the [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic]], made sexist statements about women conductors in a September 2013 interview, stating that "The essence of the conductor's profession is strength. The essence of a woman is weakness."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Finnish conductor [[Jorma Panula]] made sexist statements about women conductors in 2014; he stated that "women [conductors are not]… getting any better – only worse", which he called a "purely biological question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/04/05/editorial-cbc-classical-music-gender-gap-article-poses-new-questions/ |title=Musical Toronto |publisher=Musical Toronto |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant". Crawford notes that the "most famous rock-music critics—[[Robert Christgau]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]]—are all male".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour".&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Steve, ed. (2002). Pop Music and the Press. Temple University Press. ASIN B00EKYXY0K. {{ISBN|9781566399661}}. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As well, there are relatively few women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around...15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England  |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd  |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=20 March 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American music critic [[Ann Powers]], as a female critic and journalist for a popular, male-dominated industry, has written critiques the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3696 |title=Why I Write: Ann Powers Reflects on Writing About Rock|website=Nwp.org|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockhall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6485_guest-blog-ann-powers/|title=Pop music critic Ann Powers searches for the language of rock and roll|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop-music critic at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where she succeeded [[Robert Hilburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick MacDonald, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002848360_aebriefs07.html Ann Powers named L.A.

Anwen Crawford, a writer for ''[[The Monthly]]'' contributed to Jessica Hopper's book of essays and profiles entitled ''The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic''.&lt;ref name="thefader.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/06/03/the-world-doesnt-need-more-female-music-critics|title=The World Doesn’t Need More Female Music Critics|website=Thefader.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford's article "explores women's long struggle for visibility and recognition in the field of rock criticism, even though we've been helping to pioneer it from the start".&lt;ref name="thefader.com"/&gt; Crawford states that "[t]he record store, the guitar shop, and now social media: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess"; "[f]emale expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience]... and becoming a recognized "expert" (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery."&lt;ref name="thefader.com"/&gt;

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
"The National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia... completed a large study of arts journalism in America [in 2005]. They found that 'the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female.'" However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm |title=Women Music Critics |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=2005-06-11 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne |title=Time to bring down the curtain on stage critics' sexism &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other musical professions==

===Record producing and sound engineering===
A 2013 ''Sound on Sound'' article stated that there are "few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ncube states that "[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; "Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the [[Grammys]]" and none won either award.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19284058 |title=Why are female record producers so rare? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Women who want to enter the [producing] field face a boys' club, or a [[guild]] mentality".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The UK "Music Producers' Guild says less than 4% of its members are women" and at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, "only 6% of the students enrolled on its sound technology course are female."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Speaking about the 1970s, Tom Jones mentions in his recent autobiography "We had [[Lynsey de Paul]], a big star, though she fell out with [[Gordon Mills]] for wanting to produce her own records" - however, she managed to do this and eventually produced male artists such as ex-Move singer [[Carl Wayne]] and [[Lenny Zakatek]], as well as [[Vera Lynn]] and [[Shirley Bassey]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Tom Jones (2015). Over The Top and Back: The Autobiography. {{ISBN|978-1592409617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ruth Saxelby's article "Why aren't more women becoming music producers?", she states that "beats aren't gendered, so why do women represent less than 5% of music producers and engineers"? Saxelby interviewed 13 women who work as music producers to seek the potential causes of this situation.&lt;ref name=Fader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/30/why-arent-more-women-becoming-music-producers|title=Why aren't more women becoming music producers?|date=30 October 2014|work=The FADER|first=Ruth|last=Saxelby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatima Al Qadiri from New York states that "women are expected to be the sexualized commercial object for sale in music, and production and engineering [are fields where women are] rarely [able to be] objectified for financial gain [by the music industry]"; as such, the industry does not use women producers or engineers.&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Qadiri said barriers to women in production and sound engineering include "misogyny, sexism, unequal pay,...[and] pressure to make your body (rather than your music) the central focus of your career."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Caroline Polachek from New York states that "an artist is not as likely to bring in a woman to produce his track as a man, not because of a bias against women per se, but because on some level it's playing safe: a killer producer, history tells us, looks like a man."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

[[WondaGurl]] from Toronto states that "there aren't many female producer and engineers, because they find this side of the business to be mostly male-dominated and many woman do not like to have to compete with men."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Holly Herndon from San Francisco states that "[m]usic, despite common misconceptions, is quite conservative. The archetypes don't seem to ever really change...Every year we get a diva, a dancer,...a girl next door, a fashion queen, a dainty songstress; all younger updates on a previous [year's] model. No room for new archetypes [such as women producers]." Herndon points out that [[Missy Elliott]] "exists outside of those narrow roles..."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Asma Maroof from Los Angeles says women are "intimidated by such a male-driven profession."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

Tokimonsta, also from Los Angeles, states that "our culture has systematically engrained this idea that technology is more of a man's thing."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Ikonika from London, UK, states that the music industry is "sexist and racist".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Anna Lunoe from Sydney, Australia, states that "more girls [should be] exposed to introductory production workshops" and "production mentoring programs that are... aimed at promising young female engineers".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Leila from London, UK, states that "[t]here have been a fair few [female producers and engineers]", from [[Delia Derbyshire]] to [[Tina Weymouth]] to Susan Day to Missy Elliot to [[Zavoloka]]. Leila suggests that to increase the number of women in music production and sound engineering, girls should be given training in computers and software coding.

One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923-2004). She founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956 after a few years of recording demos at [[Sam Phillips]]' Memphis Recording Service and [[Sun Records Studio]]. Unable to break into the [[Sun Records]] label's stable of male artists, she received the advice and assistance of [[RCA Records]]' [[Chet Atkins]] in forming this new label to release her music.

===DJs and turntablists ===

[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event]]
Women in music are often seen mainly in singing roles in [[popular music]] and there are relatively few women [[DJ]]s or [[turntablist]]s in [[hip hop music]], [[house music]], [[nu metal]] and other genres where DJs and turntablists participate. Indeed, all of these genres are very male-dominated. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs, such as audio engineering and production.  In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women battle; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces." &lt;ref name="Farrugia"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia |first=Rebekah |publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male technophilia."&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oldenziel|first=Ruth A. |date=1997 |title=Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain|url=|journal=Technology and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riot Grrrl===
[[File:Carrie Brownstein.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Carrie Brownstein]] from the punk-indie band [[Sleater-Kinney]], performing at Vegoose in 2005]]
[[Riot grrrl]] is an [[underground music|underground]] [[feminist]] [[hardcore punk]] movement that originally started in the early 1990s, in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1080646/its-riot-grrrl-day-in-boston-here-are-songs-to-rock-out-to-at-work|title=Boston wins 'Most Feminist City' with Riot Grrrl Day — we made a playlist to celebrate|date=9 April 2015|website=Sheknows.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the greater [[Pacific Northwest]], noticeably in [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]], which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Leonard. "Riot grrrl." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, [[domestic abuse]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], racism, [[patriarchy]], and female [[empowerment]]. Bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Cake Like]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and also [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13 |archivedate=23 February 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Dickless%20riot&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Dickless&amp;f=false|first=Marisa|last=Meltzer|page=42 |title=Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and [[genre]], riot grrrl is a [[subculture]] involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

The use of the word "girl" was meant to indicate a time when girls are least influenced by societal pressures and therefore have the strongest self-esteem – childhood. The anger behind the movement was noted by the alternate spelling of the word as "grrrl", which sounds like a growl.&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt;

They partook in a new type of punk feminism that promoted the idea of do-it-yourself, exchanging [[manifesto]]s and trading mixed tapes of favorite bands to get the word out.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Mimi Thi|date=2012-07-01|title=Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were tired of women being erased from history or having their experiences misinterpreted and ignored by others. In, response to patriarchal violence, adultism, and [[heterocentrism]],&lt;ref name="Kearney"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=1995|title=Riot Grrrl: It's Not Just Music, It's Not Just Punk|url=|journal=Spectator|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl engaged in negative emotional expressions and rhetoric similar to that of feminism and the punk aesthetic. The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love – "girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves".

The accompanying slogan "every girl is a riot grrrl" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of "fanzines").&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt; [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to "it’s all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they’ll send them to each other", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.

In the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing "SLUT" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"/&gt; While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, "the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access."&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.

===Festivals===
Women's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for [[lesbian]]s. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May, 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19740326.2.55&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 — Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated its fortieth year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2–5 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival - July 5-8, 2018     Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that "promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities. While most attendees are women, men can attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org/wia/membership-and-donation/|title=Membership and Contributions - National Womens Music Festival|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] was created in 1976, and became the largest festival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999:28&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a festival that focuses on music is the Women in Music Festival held by the [[University of Rochester]]'s [[Eastman School of Music]]. The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania León]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.

Many other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.

While women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of [[lesbian]] and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives. Since the festivals are organized by women, for women, daycare and childcare facilities are typically provided. Festivals often provide a safe space for [[coming of age]] rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lilith Fair====

[[Lilith Fair]] was a [[concert tour]] and travelling music festival that consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. It was founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |website=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLachlan organized the festival after she became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | first=Donna | last=Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=28 July 1998 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together – in McLachlan's home town, on 14 September 1996 – went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the medieval Jewish legend that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife. In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16&amp;nbsp;million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt; Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;
The festival received several pejorative nicknames, including "Breast-fest", "Girlapalooza", and "Clam Jam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071698/fea_lilith.shtml]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_popular,5.html |title=ARTS : Music: Popular |publisher=Glbtq.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
