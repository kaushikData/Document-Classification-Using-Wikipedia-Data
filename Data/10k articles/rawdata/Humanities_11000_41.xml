'''''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey''''' is a book first published in [[1969 in literature|1969]] by [[folklore|folklorist]] [[Kathryn Tucker Windham]] and Margaret Gillis Figh. The book contains thirteen [[ghost story|ghost stories]] from the U.S. state of [[Alabama]]. The book was the first in a series of seven ''Jeffrey'' books, most featuring ghost stories from a [[Southern United States|Southern state]]. Jeffrey in the book's title refers to a [[ghost]] that allegedly haunts Windham's home.&lt;ref name="WINDHAM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kathryn Tucker Windham |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1582 |date=30 June 2008 |first=Frances Osborn |last=Robb |publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"&gt;{{cite news| first=Jeremy| last=Gray| url=http://www.uasystem.ua.edu/Administration/News%20clips/Clips%20110405.pdf| title=The tale of the tale-teller| publisher=The Birmingham News| date=2005-10-30| accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the book and Jeffrey==
The foreword of the book describes how Windham came to be interested in ghost stories. It began with ghostly incidents in the Windham family home in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] that Windham attributed to a spirit she dubbed "Jeffrey". At first, the family heard footsteps in rooms that would later be found empty. A supposed photograph of Jeffrey, included in the book, was taken inside the home. On the night the picture was made, some young people visiting the house decided to play with a [[Ouija|Ouija board]], trying to contact Jeffrey. When they developed the photos taken that night, a shadowy vaguely human-like shape was seen beside a girl in the photograph. Soon after it was taken Windham contacted Figh, who was a noted collector of ghost stories, to ask about Jeffrey. Out of that meeting, the idea of ''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey'' was born.&lt;ref name="JEFFREY"&gt;{{cite book | last =Windham | first =Kathryn Tucker |author2=Figh, Margaret Gillis | year =1969 | title =13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey | publisher =Strode Publishers | isbn =0-8173-0376-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface to the book, Windham says that although there are many ghost stories in Alabama, she wanted to choose stories for her book that had "entertained many generations" and were "a treasured part of Southern folklore". Windham sought stories from which she could describe not only the ghost, but also the community and lifestyles of the people who first reported the haunting. Windham spends as much time describing the people and places around the ghost stories as she does the ghost itself.&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"/&gt;

==Stories included==
* [[Rocky Hill Castle|The Ghost of the Angry Architect]]
* [[Dr. John R. Drish House|Death Lights in the Tower]]
* The Faithful Vigil at [[Kenworthy Hall|Carlisle Hall]]
* The Specter in the Maze at [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]]
* [[Eliza Battle|The Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee]]
* The Unquiet Ghost at [[Gaineswood]]
* The Face in the [[Pickens County Courthouse (Alabama)|Courthouse]] Window
* [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile's]] Pipe-Smoking Captain

* [[Bill Sketoe|The Hole That Will Not Stay Filled]]
* [[Red Lady of Huntingdon College|Huntingdon College's Red Lady]]
* The Crying Spirit at the Well
* The Dancing Ghost of [[Grancer Harrison]]

==Controversy==
Despite being very popular in Alabama, the book attracted some controversy from certain Christians in the state who said that the book promoted beliefs incompatible with Christianity. In fact, Windham said that she had received letters from people telling her she is doomed to hell for writing the ''Jeffrey'' books.&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"/&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', Windham responded to these claims, saying "If I'm going to hell — and I can't deny that, because it's not for me to judge — it won't be for telling ghost stories; I have far greater shortcomings than that."&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey'' has been adapted into a stage musical by Don Everett Garrett and Kevin Francis Finn.&lt;ref name="REDMTC"&gt;{{cite web |title=13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey |url=http://www.redmountaintheatre.org/1011-13-alabama-ghosts-and-jeffrey.html |publisher=Red Mountain Theatre Company |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Tucker Windham gave her blessing for the adaptation and saw the premiere at Red Mountain Theatre Company's Cabaret Theatre in October 2010, prior to her death. The musical is now available to schools and arts organizations from the authors.

'''''Almond Blossoms''''' is from a group of several paintings made in 1888 and 1890 by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Arles]] and [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], [[southern France]] of blossoming [[almond]] trees. Flowering trees were special to van Gogh.  They represented awakening and hope.  He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of [[Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]], and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut]]s. ''Almond Blossom'' was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] and sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo]].

==Southern France==
In 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career.  In connection with their painting ''[[Farmhouse in Provence]]'' (1888), the [[National Gallery of Art]] notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that would wash out detail and simplify forms,
reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was "the Japan of the South." Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts.  Pairs of complements—the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky — almost vibrate against each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |work=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830—1900) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Gallery of Art |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |page=12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 [[fruit tree]]s in the orchards were about to bloom.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=49| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[blossom]]s of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him,&lt;ref name=VGM671&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3128&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Almond Blossom, 1890  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees.&lt;ref name=VGM557&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0035V1962 |title=Almond Tree in Blossom, 1888   |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day.&lt;ref name=Fell&gt;{{cite book| author=Fell, D |year=2001 |title=Van Gogh's Gardens | location=United Kingdom |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=25 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around April 21 he wrote to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], that he "will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming."&lt;ref name=VGM557/&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Japonaiserie Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige)''&lt;br&gt;by Vincent van Gogh, 1887 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], [[Amsterdam]] (F371)]]
Van Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese [[woodcut|wood block]] prints.  [[Hiroshige]]'s  ''[[Plum Park in Kameido]]'' demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow.  Van Gogh used the term ''[[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|Japonaiserie]]'' to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]], and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]].  Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called ''[[ukiyo-e]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=54 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Wallace70"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853—1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=70 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, "Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop."&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=200 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern region and the flowering trees seems to awakened van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer.  He wrote, "I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety."  While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | pages=43–44| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book''==
Vincent wrote to Theo, "Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,"  and he has "two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it."  The two studies are ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass'' and ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/466.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh.

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''==
Although [[fruit tree]]s were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles,&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt; the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2515&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en |title=Sprig of Flowering Almond Blossom in a Glass, 1888 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt;

In ''Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life'', [[Bruce Ross]] evaluates the [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] effect on van Gogh's work, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Van Gogh's bright ''Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass'' embodies these streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is set in a simple glass.  The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space.  There is no formal decorative intent.  Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as if a symbol of hope.  Van Gogh has transformed the still  life with the help of these values.  He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility.  His use of bright color reflects this.  There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, [[ikebana]], in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life | author=Ross, B | editor=Trutty-Coohill, P  | publisher=Springer | location=Heidelberg, London, and New York | year=2010 | pages=215–216| chapter=Vincent van Gogh's Irises: Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights | isbn=978-90-481-9159-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmIacB5qVZ0C&amp;pg=PA215|quote=These streams include: 1) French impressionist's practice of using unadorned objects from life and 2) use of space between objects as objects themselves to the point of over-orchestration. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Almond Blossom''==
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Almond blossom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''Almond blossom'', 1890 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], (F671)]]  
In mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, "The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 14 March 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits   |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In ''Almond Tree in Blossom'', Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of [[divisionism]] for a sparkling surface effect.  The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rendering of ''Almond Blossom'' is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.

Theo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890 to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife.  He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;

Vincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo's]] baby,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/627.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to His Mother. Written c. 20 February 1890 in Saint-Rémy. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt; The close-up of the branches brings to mind [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s proposition that "even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;  The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights: Lectures and Essays on Philosophy, Literature and the Arts | author=Ross, B | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | location=New York | year=208 | page=52 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HvvB-xrxxUC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barbebleue.jpg|thumb|Bluebeard, his wife, and the keys in a 19th-century illustration by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

"'''Bluebeard'''" ([[French language|French]]: ''Barbe bleue'') is a French [[Folklore|folktale]], the most famous surviving version of which was written by [[Charles Perrault]] and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bluebeard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clpav.fr/perrault.htm |title=Charles Perrault (1628-1703)|publisher=CLPAV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tale tells the story of a wealthy violent man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors. "[[The White Dove (French fairy tale)|The White Dove]]", "[[The Robber Bridegroom (fairy tale)|The Robber Bridegroom]]" and "[[Fitcher's Bird]]" (also called "Fowler's Fowl") are tales similar to "Bluebeard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BLUEBEARD, THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM, AND FITCHER'S BIRD |url=https://jml023grimmtodisney.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/bluebeard-the-robber-bridegroom-and-fitchers-bird/ |website=JML: GRIMM TO DISNEY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The White Dove: A French Bluebeard |url=http://talesoffaerie.blogspot.com/2012/01/white-dove-french-bluebeard.html |website=Tales of Faerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notoriety of the tale is such that [[Merriam-Webster]] gives the word "Bluebeard" the definition of "a man who marries and kills one wife after another," and the verb "bluebearding" has even appeared as a way to describe the habit of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Words We're Watching: 'Bluebeard,' the Verb |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-were-watching-bluebeard-the-verb |website=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Bluebeard is a wealthy and powerful, yet frighteningly ugly, nobleman who has been married several times to beautiful women who have all mysteriously vanished. When Bluebeard visits his neighbor and asks to marry one of his daughters, the girls are terrified. After hosting a wonderful banquet, he chooses the youngest daughter to be his wife - against her will - and she goes to live with him in his rich and luxurious palace in the countryside, away from her family.

Bluebeard announces that he must leave for the country and gives the keys of the château (castle) to his wife. She is able to open any door in the house with them, each of which contain some of his riches, except for an underground chamber that he strictly forbids her to enter lest she suffer his wrath. He then goes away and leaves the house and the keys in her hands. She invites her sister, Anne, and her friends and cousins over for a party. However, she is eventually overcome with the desire to see what the forbidden room holds, and she sneaks away from the party and ventures into the room.

She immediately discovers the room is flooded with blood and the murdered corpses of Bluebeard's former wives hanging on hooks from the walls. Horrified, she drops the key in the blood and flees the room. She tries to wash the blood from the key, but the key is magical and the blood cannot be removed. Fearing for her life, she reveals her husband's secret to her visiting sister, and they plan to both flee the next morning, but Bluebeard unexpectedly comes back and finds the bloody key. In a blind rage, he threatens to kill her on the spot, but she asks for one last prayer with her sister Anne. At the last moment, as Bluebeard is about to deliver the fatal blow, the brothers of the wife and her sister Anne arrive and kill Bluebeard. The wife inherits his fortune and castle, and has the dead wives buried. She uses the fortune to have her other siblings married, and eventually remarries herself, to a man she loves, and moves on from her horrible experience with Bluebeard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perrault |first1=Charles |title=Bluebeard |url=http://childhoodreading.com/bluebeard/ |website=Childhood Reading.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Although best known as a folktale, the character of Bluebeard appears to derive from legends related to historical individuals in [[Brittany]]. One source is believed to have been the 15th-century [[Breton people|Breton]] and convicted [[serial killer]] [[Gilles de Rais]], a nobleman who fought alongside [[Joan of Arc]] and became both Marshal of France and her official protector, then, was burned as a murderous witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
|author=MARGARET ALICE MURRAY |title=THE WITCH-CULT IN WESTERN EUROPE: A Study in Anthropology; Clarendon Press, Oxford,  |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/wcwe/index.htm |page=267 |year=1921 |ISBN=0-19-820744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gilles de Rais did not kill his wife, nor were any bodies found on his property, and the crimes for which he was convicted involved the sexually-driven, brutal murder of children rather than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paoletti |first1=Gabe |title=Gilles De Rais, The Child Serial Killer Who Fought Alongside Joan Of Arc |url=http://allthatsinteresting.com/gilles-de-rais |website=All That is Interesting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible source stems from the story of the early Breton king [[Conomor|Conomor the Accursed]] and his wife [[Saint Tryphine|Tryphine]]. This is recorded in a biography of [[St. Gildas]], written five centuries after his death in the sixth century. It describes how after Conomor married Tryphine, she was warned by the [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]]s of his previous wives that he murders them when they become pregnant.  Pregnant, she flees; he catches and beheads her, but St. Gildas miraculously restores her to life, and when he brings her to Conomor, the walls of his castle collapse and kill him.  Conomor is a historical figure, known locally as a [[werewolf]], and various local churches are dedicated to [[Saint Tryphine]] and her son, [[Saint Tremeur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| ISBN = 0-374-15901-7 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's blue beard stands for the marvelous and the exotic, for aristocracy (Bluebeard was a wealthy nobleman with [[Nobility|blue blood]]), and for Bluebeard's status as an outsider, a libertine, and a ruffian ("barbe," the French word for beard, relates to "barbarian").

The fatal effects of female curiosity have long been the subject of story and legend. [[Eve]], [[Lot's wife]], [[Pandora]], and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]] are all examples of mythic stories where women's curiosity is punished by dire consequences. The Bluebeard story also echoes the story of [[The Fall of Man|The Fall]]. In giving his wife the keys to his castle, Bluebeard is acting the part of the serpent, and therefore of the devil, and his wife the part of the victim held by the serpent's gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridgewater |first1=Patrick |title=The German Gothic Novel in Anglo-German Perspective |date=2013 |publisher=Rodopi |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, hidden or forbidden chambers were not unknown in pre-Perrault literature. In Basile's ''[[Pentamerone]]'', the tale ''[[The Three Crowns]]'' tells of a Princess Marchetta entering a room after being forbidden by an ogress, and in ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' Prince Agib is given a hundred keys to a hundred doors but forbidden to enter the golden door, which he does with terrible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Agib |url=http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Dixon/dixon02_20.htm |website=More Fairy Tales From The Arabian Nights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars interpret the Bluebeard story as a fable preaching obedience to wives (as [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s moral suggests), [[folklorist]] [[Maria Tatar]] has suggested that the tale encourages women not to unquestioningly follow patriarchal rules. Women breaking men's rules in the fairy tale can be seen as a metaphor for women breaking society's rules and being punished for their transgression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jónsdóttir |first1=Margrét Snæfríður |title=Madam Has a Word to Say |url=https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/21033/1/Margret_BA_Madam_Has_a_Word_to_Say.pdf |website=Skemann.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key can be seen as a sign of disobedience or transgression; it can also be seen as a sign that one should not trust their husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tatar |first1=Maria |title=The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company| date=2002|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungian [[Analytical psychology|psychoanalyst]] [[Clarissa Pinkola Estés]] refers to the key as ''the key of knowing'' which gives the wife consciousness. She can choose to not open the door and live as a naive young woman. Instead, she has chosen to open the door of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Estés |first1=Clarissa Pinkola |title=Women who Run with the Wolves |publisher=Ballantine Books |date=1995|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For folklorist [[Bruno Bettelheim]], ''Bluebeard'' can only be considered a fairy tale because of the magical bleeding key; otherwise, it would just be a monstrous horror story.  Bettelheim sees the key as associated with the male sexual organ, "particularly the first intercourse when the hymen is broken and blood gets on it." For Bettelheim, the blood on the key is a symbol of the wife's indiscretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bettelheim |first1=Bruno |title=The Uses of Enchantment |date=1977 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For scholar Philip Lewis, the key offered to the wife by Bluebeard represents his superiority, since he knows something she does not. The blood on the key indicates that she now has knowledge. She has erased the difference between them, and in order to return her to her previous state, he must kill her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hermansson |first1=Casie |title=Bluebeard.

==Aarne–Thompson classification==
According to the [[Aarne–Thompson]] system of classifying folktale plots, the tale of Bluebeard is type 312.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Heidi Anne Heiner|url = http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/other.html|title = Tales Similar to Bluebeard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Another such tale is ''[[The White Dove (French fairy tale)|The White Dove]]'', an oral French variant.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Delarue, ''The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., p. 359, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;  The type is closely related to Aarne–Thompson type 311 in which the heroine rescues herself and her sisters, in such tales as ''[[Fitcher's Bird]]'', ''[[The Old Dame and Her Hen]]'', and ''[[How the Devil Married Three Sisters]]''.  The tales where the [[youngest daughter]] rescues herself and the other sisters from the villain is in fact far more common in oral traditions than this type, where the heroine's brother rescues her.  Other such tales do exist, however; the brother is sometimes aided in the rescue by marvelous dogs or wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some European variants of the ballad ''[[Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight]]'', [[Child ballad]] 4, closely resemble this tale.  This is particularly noteworthy among some German variants, where the heroine calls for help much like Sister Anne calls for help to her brothers in Perrault's ''Bluebeard''.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads''; v 1, New York: Dover Publications, p 47, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bluebeard's wives==
It is not explained why Bluebeard murdered his first bride; she could not have entered the forbidden room and found a dead wife. But some scholars have theorized that he was testing his wife's obedience, and that she was killed not for what she discovered there, but because she disobeyed his orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Philip |title=Seeing Through the Mother Goose Tales |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1812 version published in ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'', [[Wilhelm Grimm]], on p.&amp;nbsp;XLI of the annotations, makes the following handwritten comment: "It seems in all Märchen [fairy tales] of Bluebeard, wherein his Blutrunst [flowing of blood] has not rightly explained, the idea to be the basis of himself through bathing in blood to cure of the blue beard; as the lepers. That is also why it is written that the blood is collected in basins."

[[Maurice Maeterlinck]] wrote extensively on Bluebeard and in his plays names at least six former wives: Sélysette from ''Aglavaine et Sélysette'' (1896), Alladine from ''Alladine et Palomides'' (1894), both Ygraine and Bellangère from ''La mort de Tintagiles'' (1894), Mélisande from ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', and Ariane from ''[[Ariane et Barbe-bleue]]'' (1907).

In [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s opera ''[[Barbe-bleue (opera)|Barbe-bleue]]'' (1866), the five previous wives are Héloïse, Eléonore, Isaure, Rosalinde and Blanche, with the sixth and final wife being a peasant girl, Boulotte, who finally reveals his secret when he attempts to have her killed so that he can marry Princess Hermia.

[[Béla Bartók]]'s opera ''[[Bluebeard's Castle|A Kékszakállú herceg vára]]'' (1911), with a libretto by [[Béla Balázs]], names "Judith" as wife number four.

[[Anatole France]]'s short story "The Seven Wives of Bluebeard" names Jeanne de Lespoisse as the last wife before Bluebeard's death. The other wives were Collette Passage, Jeanne de la Cloche, Gigonne, Blanche de Gibeaumex,  Angèle de la Garandine, and Alix de Pontalcin.

In [[Edward Dmytryk]]'s film ''[[Bluebeard (1972 film)|Bluebeard]]'' (1972), Baron von Sepper ([[Richard Burton]]) is an Austrian aristocrat known as Bluebeard for his blue-toned beard and his appetite for beautiful wives, and his wife is an American named Anne.

In [[Charles Dickens]]' short story ''Captain Murderer'', the titular character is described as "an offshoot of the Bluebeard family", and is far more bloodthirsty than most Bluebeards: he cannibalises each wife a month after marriage. He meets his demise after his sister-in-law, in revenge for the death of her sister, marries him and consumes a deadly poison just before he devours her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dickens |first1=Charles |title=Captain Murderer |url=https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0955.html#dickens |website=The Robber Bridegroom  and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anatole France]]'s ''The Seven Wives of Bluebeard'', Bluebeard is the victim of the tale, and his wives the perpetrators. Bluebeard is a generous, kind-hearted, wealthy nobleman called Bertrand de Montragoux who marries a succession of grotesque, adulterous, difficult, or simple-minded wives. His first six wives all die, flee, or are sent away under unfortunate circumstances, none of which are his fault. His seventh wife deceives him with another lover and murders him for his wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=France |first1=Anatole |title=The Seven Wives of Bluebeard |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25411/25411-h/25411-h.htm |website=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Angela Carter]]'s [[The Bloody Chamber]], Bluebeard is a 1920s decadent with a collection of erotic drawings, and Bluebeard's's wife is rescued by her mother who rides in on a horse and shoots Bluebeard between the eyes, rather than by her brothers as in the original fairy tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Acocella |first1=Joan |title=Angela Carter's Feminist Mythology |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/angela-carters-feminist-mythology |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Joyce Carol Oates]]' short story, "Blue-Bearded Lover", the most recent wife is well aware of Bluebeard's murdered wives: she does not unlock the door to the forbidden room, and therefore avoids death herself. She remains with Bluebeard despite knowing he is a murderer, and gives birth to Bluebeard's children. The book has been interpreted as a feminist struggle for sexual power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freeman-Slade |first1=Jessica |title=Once Children |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/once-children/ |website=Los Angeles Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Helen Oyeyemi]]'s ''Mr. Fox'', Mr. Fox is a writer of slasher novels, engaged to a woman named Mary. Mary's father scared her as a little girl by telling her of all the women that were killed by disobeying men. Mary questions Mr. Fox about why he writes about killing women who have transgressed patriarchal laws, making him aware of how his words normalize domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bender |first1=Aimee |title=A Writer of Slasher Books Finds More Than a Muse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/books/review/mr-fox-by-helen-oyeyemi-book-review.html |website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Bluebeard (Vonnegut novel)|Bluebeard]]'' features a painter who calls himself Bluebeard, and who considers his art studio to be a forbidden chamber where his girlfriend Circe Berman is not allowed to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moynahan |first1=Julian |title=A Prisoner of War in the Hamptons|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/28/lifetimes/vonnegut-bluebird.html |website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Donald Barthelme]]'s ''Bluebeard'', the wife believes that the carcasses of Bluebeard's previous six wives are behind the door. She loses the key and her lover hides the three duplicates. One afternoon Bluebeard insists that she open the door, so she borrows his key. Inside, she finds the decaying carcasses of six zebras dressed in [[Coco Chanel]] gowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barthelme |first1=Donald |title=Bluebeard |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1986/06/16/bluebeard-3 |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In theatre===
* [[Pantomime]] versions of the tale were staged at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London as early as 1798, and famous editions there were by [[E. L. Blanchard]] in 1879 and starred [[Dan Leno]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA176  "A dictionary of the drama: a guide to the plays, play-wrights, players, and playhouses of the United Kingdom and America"], Chatto &amp; Windus, 1904, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these productions orientalized the tale by setting it in the [[Ottoman Empire]], often giving the wife the name Fatima. The popularity of the pantomime made orientalized depictions of Bluebeard common in English illustrations throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century.

The term "'''capitalist realism'''" has been used, particularly in [[Germany]], to describe commodity-based art, from [[Pop Art]] in the 1950s and 1960s to the commodity art of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary [[corporate capitalism]] in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term "[[socialist realism]]".

==In art==
Although attested earlier,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by [[Abraham Polonsky]] of [[Edward Dmytryk|Edward Dmytryk's]] ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'': William Pechter and Abraham Polonsky, 'Abraham Polonsky and "Force of Evil"', ''Film Quarterly'', 15.3 [Special Issue on Hollywood] (Spring, 1962), 47-54 (p. 53); https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase "capitalist realism" was first used in the title of the 1963 [[art exhibition]] in [[Düsseldorf, Germany|Düsseldorf]], ''Demonstration for Capitalist Realism'', which featured the work of [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Wolf Vostell]], and [[:de:Konrad Fischer (Maler)|Konrad Lueg]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh. ''A World History of Art'', Laurence King Publishing, p847. {{ISBN|1-85669-451-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop&lt;ref name="Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2014/07/living-with-pop-a-reproduction-of-capitalist-realism-at-artists-space/ | title=Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space | publisher=The New York Observer | date=23 July 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Pollack,  Maika | quote=It was a reaction to Pop from a postwar Germany divided between East and West.}}&lt;/ref&gt; counterparts. The recent rise in [[Pop art|Pop Art]] in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.

==Sigmar Polke==
{{main|Sigmar Polke}}

Capitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist [[Sigmar Polke]].&lt;ref name="German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061203694.html | title=German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69 | publisher=The Washington Post | date=13 June 2010 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Schudel, Matt | quote=In the 1960s, Mr. Polke was at the vanguard of a German artistic movement called capitalist realism, along with fellow painter Gerhard Richter -- who later expressed reservations about his colleague's work, saying "he refuses to accept any borders, any limits."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Thomas. ''The Rise of the Sixties: American and European Art in the age of Dissent'' {{ISBN|1856694267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Schudson==
{{main|Michael Schudson}}

In the mid-1980s, [[Michael Schudson]] used the term "capitalist realism" to describe mainstream practices in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter seven of Schudson's ''Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion'' compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, 'Advertising as Capitalist Realism', in ''Advertising, The Uneasy Persuasion: Its Dubious Impact on American Society'' (New York: Basic Books, 1984), pp. 209-33 (repr. in ''
Advertising &amp; Society Review'', vol. 1, issue 1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Harry; MacRury, Isin; Botterill, Jackie. ''The Dynamics of Advertising'', Routledge, 2000, p99. {{ISBN|90-5823-085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mark Fisher==
{{main|Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?}}

The term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book ''[[Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009); {{ISBN|978-1-84694-317-1}} (pbk.); 1846943175 (pbk.).&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher argues that the term "capitalist realism" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His argument is a response to, and critique of, [[neo-liberalism]] and new forms of government which apply the logic of [[capitalism]] and the market to all aspects of governance.

His ideology refers to a perceived "widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Winchester, UK|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the [[Althusserian]] conception of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1846943171|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism. Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=O Books|year=2009|isbn=9781846943171|location=|pages=8|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposes that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is there no Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business [[ontology]]' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009, pg15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Prominently Mark Fisher and Jeremy Gilbert, 'Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony: A Dialogue', ''New Formations'', 80--81 (2013), 89--101 DOI:10.3898/NEWF.80/81.05.2013; ''Reading Capitalist Realism'', ed. by Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Joachim Hambro''' (7 June 1914 – 19 February 1985) was a Norwegian novelist, journalist, essayist, translator and [[Romance studies|Romance philologist]]. The son of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]] politician [[C. J. Hambro]], he embarked on a [[philological]] career, graduating in 1939. During the [[Second World War]] he taught at [[Oslo Commerce School]] and the Norwegian College in Uppsala. After the war, he taught [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] at [[University of Paris-Sorbonne|Sorbonne]], whilst also working as Paris correspondent for the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] and a few Norwegian daily newspapers.

Born into a well-read and educated family, Hambro developed a penchant for [[French literature]], marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of [[English literature]] in the Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel ''De frafalnes klubb'', Hambro published trilogies and other novels for the next two decades. He had a keen interest in [[linguistics]]; in the 1969 book ''Ting, tanke, tale'' he problematized [[Philosophy of language|linguistic questions]] in a popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the [[Norwegian Association of Literary Translators]] in the early 1960s.

The younger Carl Hambro was educated at [[Fagerborg Upper Secondary School]], whence he [[examen artium|graduated]] in 1932, following Latin studies.&lt;ref name="stud1932"&gt;Tryggve Juul Møller, "Hambro, Carl Joachim," in ''Studentene fra 1932'' (Oslo: Bokkomiteen for Studentene fra 1932, 1957), {{oclc|791195813}}, p.&amp;nbsp;131.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst his school contemporaries were [[Niels Christian Brøgger]], who became an essayist and novelist, and [[Kaare Martin]], a future Nazi politician.&lt;ref&gt;Møller, "Fagerborg skole, Oslo – Latin," in ''Studentene fra 1932'', p.&amp;nbsp;441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalistic and educational career===
Having made study trips to London and Paris in the mid-1930s, Hambro graduated with a [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1939.&lt;ref name="stud1932" /&gt; In the summer of that year, on 15 July, he married Wenche Rynning-Koren (born 1916).&lt;ref name="filolog" /&gt; Upon the outbreak of war, he was employed at the [[Oslo Commerce School]], where he lectured until 1943. Hambro spent the latter part of the war in [[Uppsala, Sweden]], where he taught at the Norwegian College and chaired the local Norwegian Society (1943–1944). After the war he returned to Oslo, teaching at the Commerce School until 1946. He had lectured in [[French literature]] at the [[Norwegian College of Libraries and Information|Norwegian Library College]] in two spells, during and after the war: from 1940 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1946.&lt;ref name="filolog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stud1932" /&gt; For the rest of the decade he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne, France.&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt; He also worked as a correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (1946–1948), ''[[Dagbladet]]'' (1946–1948), ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' (1948–1949) and ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'' (1949–1951).&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Solheim, ed., ''Pressefolk. Biografiske opplysninger om Norsk Presseforbunds medlemmer'', 3rd ed, (Oslo: [[Norwegian Press Association]], 1950),
 {{oclc|62624370}}, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1951 to 1952 he was a press worker for the Research Councils in Norway and for the Norwegian delegation to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="stud1932" /&gt; In that decade he mainly acted as cultural counsellor at the Norwegian embassy in London.&lt;ref name="bokklubben"&gt;Egil Tveterås, "Hambro, Carl Joachim, f. 7. juni 1914," in ''Bokklubbens 3-binds leksikon'', 2nd&amp;nbsp;ed., (Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 1984 [1982]), {{ISBN|82-574-0341-5}}, p.&amp;nbsp;505.&lt;/ref&gt; Employed in 1952, he acted in that position for seven years, whereupon he returned to Oslo.&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt; He was assistant teacher in French at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1963 to 1965;&lt;ref name="hvem" /&gt; in that position he bemoaned the compentence of his students in their own [[mother tongue]], maintaining that the Norwegian language should be used more in foreign-language education.&lt;ref&gt;"Studentene dårligere i norsk enn før?," ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', 22 April 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary career and death===
Hambro made his literary debut in 1958 with the non-fiction book ''Frankrike'' ("France"), and released his first novel two years later.&lt;ref name="hvem" /&gt; The novel, entitled ''De frafalnes klubb'' ("The Club of the Estranged"), was favourably commented upon by contemporary critics, but failed to arouse much subsequent interest from scholars.&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jensen" /&gt; Hambro's reputation as a novelist rests more on his trilogy about the fictional character Nico Dietmeyer, deemed a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' by academics. That work, serialised in the 1960s, was Hambro's first major commercial success, and has been reviewed in detail both by contemporaneous commentators and modern literary scholars.&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="andersen" /&gt; After a few unsuccessful novels in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hambro turned his writings towards non-fiction, especially focusing on linguistics and politics, fields of interest that he had inherited from his father, who became fascinated by [[Sanskrit]] and East Asian poetry during his philology studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hambro, ''C.J. Hambro: Liv og drøm'', pp.&amp;nbsp;30&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Hambro's most well-known and successful book within linguistics was the 1969 ''Ting, tanke, tale'' ("Thing, Thought, Speech"), followed by ''Språket i funksjon'' ("Language in Operation") in 1972.&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prosa" /&gt;

Having divorced Rynning Koren, Hambro eventually married Christine Holter (born 1931).&lt;ref name="hvem"&gt;"Hambro, Carl Joachim," ''Hvem er hvem?'', ed. B. Steenstrup, 11th ed., (Oslo: Aschehoug, 1973), p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his wives bore him the daughter [[Ellen Hambro]], who would later become director of Norway's [[Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency|Climate and Pollution Agency]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://snl.no/Ellen_Hambro Ellen Hambro]," ''Store norske leksikon'' (web edition), accessed 6 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Joachim Hambro died on 19 February 1985&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; and was buried in [[Grefsen]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/index.php?language=engelsk Cemeteries in Norway]," DIS-Norge, accessed 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hambro's obituarist [[Finn Jor]] described him as a man fond of debate with a keen interest in societal issues, yet who was no front person in public dialogue, not possessing the eloquence of his father.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Authorship==
In 1958, Hambro released a non-fiction book titled ''Frankrike'' ({{lang-en|France}}), as a tribute to the country where he had spent most of his early adulthood.&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt; His love for France was not inherited from his parents, however: the elder Carl Joachim and Dudu were fervent anglophiles, the former having both written and translated English-language works, and the latter having been a voracious reader of Anglo-American novelists ranging from [[Rudyard Kipling]] to [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref name="father" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hambro, ''C.J. Hambro: Liv og drøm'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34, 44–45, 65, 114–16, 213.

His debut novel, the satirical ''De frafalnes klubb'', was published in 1960.&lt;ref name="rottem"&gt;[[Øystein Rottem]], ''Inn i medietidsalderen: 1965-80'', vol.&amp;nbsp;2 of ''Norges litteraturhistorie: etterkrigslitteraturen'' (Oslo: Cappelen, 1997), {{isbn|9788202154776}}, p.&amp;nbsp;71f&lt;/ref&gt; It tells a story of some disillusioned cynics in Paris who create a new philosophical and literary "[[-ism]],"&lt;ref name="rottem" /&gt; which gains worldwide popularity.&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt; According to reviewer [[Brikt Jensen]], Hambro offered a critique of "the modern type of man [who embraces] the first philosophical system that comes to his sight."&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;[[Brikt Jensen]], "Elegant satire," ''Verdens Gang'', 17 November 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen also commended Hambro for his "un-Norwegian" perspective, calling him a "distinguished European."&lt;ref name="jensen" /&gt; The literary scholar [[Willy Dahl]] opined that the novel denoted Hambro's declared scepticism towards "every sort of intellectual or political pigeonholing,"&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt; a scepticism that he shared with his father C. J. Hambro, whose disdain for radical and totalitarian ideologies was well known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Sejersted]], ''Sosialdemokratiets tidsalder'' (Oslo: Pax Forlag, 2005), part 2 of ''Norge og Sverige gjennom 200 år'', {{ISBN|82-530-2753-2}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;90, 509.&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Hambro was also, according to literary scholar [[Per Thomas Andersen]], vital for the next literary work of the younger Hambro: he provided biographical context for a trilogy comprising the novels ''Frels oss fra det gode'' (1963; "Deliver us from the good"), ''Utfor stryket'' (1964; "Down the River") and ''Vi vil oss en drøm'' (1966; "We Want a Dream"), which describe the adolescence of a young man named Nico Dietmeyer.&lt;ref name="andersen"&gt;[[Per Thomas Andersen]], ''Norsk litteraturhistorie'' (Oslo: Universitetsforlaget, 2001), {{ISBN|82-00-12836-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="last"&gt;Ragnhild Lorentzen, "Carl Hambros Oslo-roman," ''Verdens Gang'', 23 November 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; Living in the upper-class society of [[East End and West End of Oslo|Western Oslo]] in the 1930s, Dietmeyer has an authoritarian father who commits adultery, despite emphasising ''[[decorum]]'' in his own moral system.&lt;ref name="rottem" /&gt; The first of them was favourably reviewed by [[Brikt Jensen]] in ''Verdens Gang'', who called it "a declaration of love for Oslo";&lt;ref&gt;[[Brikt Jensen]], "En bok om anelsenes tid...," ''Verdens Gang'', 26 October 1963, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; reviewing for the same newspaper, Ragnhild Lorentzen gave the next novel a laudatory review, praising Hambro for having taken an important task upon his shoulders, whilst also criticising him for blurring the line between adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lorentzen, "Helt eller morder?," ''Verdens Gang'', 20 November 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl argues that these novels constitute an unpretentious, yet perspicacious criticism of conformity in that milieu, whilst Andersen considers them to be stories about double standards and liberation from one's own father.&lt;ref name="andersen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dahl"&gt;[[Willy Dahl]], ''Vår egen tid'', vol.&amp;nbsp;6 of ''Norges litteraturhistorie'', ed. [[Edvard Beyer|E.

* Tor Obrestad, "Gymnasiaster - hvorhen, hvorfor?" ''Verdens Gang'', 10 September 1966, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; The last novel of his trilogy about Nico Dietmeyer was released in November of the same year; Lorentzen considered the first part of the book to be somewhat verbose and anticipative, concluding her review by calling the novel an unoriginal yet well written book.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; In 1967 Hambro continued with ''Bjørnen sover'' ("The Bear Is Sleeping"), a marriage novel that disappointed the critics,&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Andrew Nilsen "Oslo-planet," ''Verdens Gang'', 3 November 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; before releasing his [[semantic]] and [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] study ''Ting, tanke, tale'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt; The journalist Iver Tore Svenning recognized that work as one of the very few successful attempts at a popular scientific treatment of [[structural linguistics]],&lt;ref name="70ar" /&gt; a view supported by Dahl.&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt; Hambro's last novels were ''Nødhavn'' ("Harbour of Refuge") and ''Lekkasje'' ("Leakage"), released in 1971 and 1974.&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Finn Jor, "Carl Hambro (obituary)," ''Aftenposten'', 20 February 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; The former book is about a love affair between an erstwhile [[cultural radicalism|cultural radical]] and a young woman with aggressive political opinions. The affair makes, according to Dahl, the cultural radical think about his nonconformist past, yet he abandons it, and seeks safety in the [[bourgeoisie class]].&lt;ref name="dahl" /&gt;

He nevertheless continued to write, albeit in the non-fiction genre: in the 1970s he penned numerous articles on political and literary topics for Norwegian newspapers and periodicals.&lt;ref name="snl" /&gt; He especially contributed to the periodicals ''[[Vinduet]]'' and ''[[Samtiden]]''.&lt;ref name="stud1932" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hambro, "Sartres nye skuespill ''Le Diable et le Bon Dieu''," in ''[[Vinduet]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;5, no. 7, 1951, pp.&amp;nbsp;547–56, cited in:

The '''Church of the Seat of Mary''', Greek: ''Ecclesia Kathismatis'', from '''Kathisma''' "Seat", which is also the name mostly used in literature, was a 5th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church in the [[Holy Land]], located between [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]]. It was built on the supposed resting place of [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] on the road to Bethlehem mentioned in the [[Proto-Gospel of James]]. The church was built when [[Marian devotion]] first rose to great importance, following the [[Council of Ephesus]] of 431. It is the first church known to have been dedicated to the [[Theotokos]] (Mary the God-bearer) in the entire Byzantine Empire.{{Disputed inline|talk=Talk:House of the Virgin Mary#Questionable|for=conflict with [[House of the Virgin Mary#Archaeology|House of the Virgin Mary § Archaeology]]|date=September 2018}}

==Discovery==
Its remains were discovered accidentally during construction work of [[Highway 60 (Israel)|Highway 60]] in 1992 near [[Mar Elias Monastery]]. The course of the highway was shifted to avoid damage to the site, so that the ruins are now just off the road, at the municipal border between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.  
The site was excavated in 1997.

==History==
Archaeological excavations revealed a large church, originally built in the 5th century and restored in the 6th.
It was turned into a mosque in the 8th century, and destroyed shortly after.

The building had an octagonal floor plan measuring 43 m x 52 m, comparable to that of the 4th-century [[Church of the Nativity]] in Bethlehem and other Byzantine churches, imitated in the construction of the Muslim [[Dome of the Rock]] in the late 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Avner, Rina "The Dome of the Rock in Light of the development of Concentric Martyria in Jerusalem"  in ''Muqarnas: An annual on the visual cultures of the Islamic World'' Vol 27 (2010), 43f.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rooms of the church were paved in coloured mosaics of floral and geometric designs, some of them added in the 8th century.

==Ancient sources==
The 6th-century ''[[De Situ Terrae Sanctae]]'' claims that the influential Byzantine court official [[Urbicius (eunuch)|Urbicius]] had the rock cut into rectangular shape, like an altar, and intended to have it moved to Constantinople, but no-one was able to move it.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Gildemeister (1882),  [https://archive.org/stream/theodosiusdesit00theogoog#page/n32/mode/2up p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

The church is mentioned in a 6th-century ''Life'' of [[Theodosius the Cenobiarch]]. According to this text, both the church and the monastery of Kathisma were built by a wealthy widow called Ikelia  (''Iqilia, Hicelia'') during the reign of bishop [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] (r. 450&amp;ndash;458). Theodosius is said to have lived in the monastery as a young monk.

'''Cognitive Sociolinguistics''' is an emerging field of [[linguistics]] that aims to account for [[linguistic variation]] in social settings with a cognitive explanatory framework. The goal of cognitive sociolinguists is to build a mental model of society, individuals, institutions and their relations to one another. Cognitive sociolinguists also strive to combine theories and methods used in [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[sociolinguistics]] so as to provide a more productive framework for future research on language variation. This burgeoning field concerning social implications on cognitive linguistics has yet received universal recognition.&lt;ref name="refname1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive sociolinguistics: Language variation, cultural models, social systems|year=2008|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110196252|pages=1–4|editor=Gitte Kristiansen and Rene Dirven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|4}}

==Development==
Cognitive sociolinguistics understands how social meaning is transmitted and changed, all with a mental model framework.&lt;ref&gt;Geeraerts, Dirk, 2003.  Cultural models of linguistic standardization. In: Rene ́ Dirven, Martin Pütz and Roslyn Frank (eds.), Cognitive Models in Language and Thought, 25-68. Cognitive Linguistics research 24&lt;/ref&gt;
This notion was first formally introduced as an independent field of research by Gitte Kristiansen and Rene Dirven.&lt;ref name="refname1" /&gt; Later, Dirk Geeraers, an advocate of cognitive sociolinguistics, identified the field of investigation in three areas: behavior, attitudes, and evolution. Behavior seeks to understand socially structured variation in actual language use, while attitude attempts to understand how variation is perceived by speakers.
In response to some criticism to this emerging field, he argues that the combination of cognition and sociolinguistics is relevant and important to our understanding of language because many aspects of language, such as [[allophones]] and [[phonemes]], convey social meaning. Furthermore, meaning is also conveyed by the categorization of social groups and social [[stereotyping]], all of which stem from a mental model.

==Relevant theories==

===Essentialism versus non-essentialism===
The following theories are respectively tied to: 1. the concerns of cognitive linguistics, a semantic perspective and usage-based nature; 2. the tradition of sociolinguistics which describes the socially interactive nature of linguistic communication. The theories serve to lay bare the two distinct linguistic fields and introduce the need for a combination of the two—a cognitive sociolinguistic perspective.

*'''[[Essentialism]]''' is an Aristotelian concept that states that words have or should have a single definite or salient meaning that is unchangeable. This view states that for any specific kind of entity, there is a set of characteristics or properties all of which any entity of that kind must possess. This notion most often manifests itself in explicit what-is-questions, like "what is science?", or "what is ethical?". This view is challenged by certain cognitive sociolinguists who argue that this view only leads to further complications. For example, an individual may say "a hill is a small mountain", however, this may lead to a further discussion on what is 'small' and what is a 'mountain'.
*'''[[Non-essentialism]]''' argues that "there is no essence or set of common, predetermined qualities belonging to entities in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/research/n287.xml |title=Nonessentialism : SAGE Knowledge |publisher=Knowledge.sagepub.com |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karol Janicki asserts that concepts and most words are 'fuzzy' and will cause confusion, and that there is not a single definition of a word. Thus, meanings of words are context dependent. Janicki further asserts that definitions, when given, should not be read 'from the left to the right', but rather 'from the right to the left', as in 'a small mountain is called a hill,' which defines a mountain without trying to distinguish the 'essence of a hill'.&lt;ref name="Janicki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janicki|first=Karol|title=Cognitive sociolinguistics: Language variation, cultural models, social systems|year=2008|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110196252|pages=517–541|editor=Gitte Kristiansen and Rene Dirven|chapter=How cognitive linguists can help to solve political problems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage-based variations===

Different from the view of language being abstractly stored in human minds, usage-based variation is a result of [[phonological]], [[morphosyntactic]], [[semantic]], and discourse-functional factors. The Processing Hypothesis of online speech states that when an individual is processing a statement in their minds, they will choose the participle placement that will require less processing effort. "For most variables, this means that the erg particle will precede the direct object when the direct object requires a lot of processing effort, whereas the verb particle will follow the direct object when the latter requires little processing effort."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He thought up a new and complicated theory of syntactic change.
In the case above, it is more natural to say the first sentence which results in the particle coming before the direct object because it is complex and requires more processing effort.&lt;ref&gt;Kris Heylen, Jose Tummers and Dirk Geeraerts, 2008, Methodological issues in corpus-based cognitive linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

====A case study: Dutch presentatives====
In the Dutch language, adjunct-initial presentatives do not require the particle ''er'' in the post-verbal position. For example,
* Op de  hoek  van de  straat is (er) een winkel
* On the corner of  the strew is (there) a shop
* "At the corner of the street, there is a shop"
Grondelaers interprets the function of ''er'' in adjunct-initial preventatives in the light of Langacker's reference point theory. His results from the data suggest the presence of ''er'' reflects how well the initial adjunct and the verb serve as a reference point to situate the subject referent. "With the insertion of ''er'', the speaker signals that the hearer cannot situate the subject referent very well on the basis of the adjunct and the verb, thus preparing the hearer for a subject that will require a lot of processing." &lt;ref&gt;Krist Helyen, Jose Tummers, Dirk Geeraerts, 2008, Methodological issues in corpus-based cognitive linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;

==A case study in polysemy--adjective ''awesome''==

===Introduction===
A case study was conducted to show the benefits of cognitive sociolinguistic approach in investigating lexical polysemy (Robinson 2010). The advantage of such an approach was exemplified in people's different [[#usage-based variations]] in conceptualizations of the adjective ''awesome''.

===Experiment design===

[[File:Use of adjective awesome.png|thumb|Use of adjective awesome]]
In the study, 72 English speakers were interviewed. They were locally born in South Yorkshire and ranged from age 11 to 92. To get the usage-based meanings of awesome, people were asked “who or what is awesome?” and after the volunteer's answer, a second question is posed, “why is ___ awesome?” Then, the response to that question shows the volunteer's usage-based conception of awesome.

The results analyzed in a cognitive semantics fashion confirms that awesome is a clustered with overlapping senses such as “great” “impressive” and “terrible”, as shown in the graph on the right. However, such analysis is sufficient only when the community is homogenous. Additionally, it is hard to observe patterns of language change and tendencies of usage. Sociolinguistic approach is, therefore, needed for a more thorough analysis of the data. Traditional sociolinguistic parameters—age, gender, socio-economic status—are taken into consideration. Figure 2 is a graph showing the usage of awesome in the context of age. It shows ploysemous flexibility: not every meaning is equally representative within a polysemous category; not every meaning is equally salient for every speaker, even within the same speech community, which is important in the context of the value of socio-cognitive research. It extends the prototypical nature of meaning to  (Rosch 1975, Geeraerts 1989) . It proposes methods towards usage-based concepts rather than abstract ones because each person's experiences in the worlds shape their understandings differently.

There is a clear pattern when we map the cognitive semantic analysis (as in Figure 1) onto the sociolinguistic analysis (as in Figure 2), that the use of the adjective is related to the speakers' age. Further, in the cognitive sociolinguistic fashioned analysis of external factors, there emerges a need of building a multifactorial statistical model. It measures the effect of multiple factors on the use of the senses of awesome at the same time. (In this case, the researchers employed logistic regression analysis, considering age group, gender, education, occupation and neighborhood environment.)
This process of building a model to figure out what happens—how different factors contribute—to each individual (group) is an embodiment of the cognitive sociolinguistic approach of analysis.

===Results from the statistical model===

Logistic regression analysis evidences the use of awesome 'great' can be modeled from the age and gender of speakers, with age having a more significant overall effect than gender; awesome 'impressive' can be modeled from age, gender and potentially their living environment; no prediction can be made regarding the overall effect of external factors on the use of the meaning 'terrible'.

===Analysis of the results===
Age being significant in most variation, therefore, indicates the semantic change based on the apparent time construct. This is not novel to sociolinguistics, as Labov's (1963) Martha's Vineyard study was the pioneer work in this area. In the awesome study, as well, real-time evidence (from the Oxford English Dictionary Online, for example,) proves the semantic change interpreted from the case study, that “great” is becoming the core meaning of awesome, and that “terrible” is archaic since it is only active in older members. Based on the cognitive sociolinguistic approach, the overlapping of senses shows diachronic succession (e.g. awesome 'terrible' &gt; 'impressive' &gt; 'great', with 'impressive' as a neutral transition, as opposed to 'terrible' &gt; 'great' ). Additionally, the overlapping readings only occur “as expected” (e.g. the archaic sense of awesome 'terrible' occurs in the adjacent younger generation of its users—age 60 and up, not to the youngest generations.)
Socio-cognitive analysis also helps us identify the responsible speakers for innovation as well as speakers who resist innovation: in this case, the age group of 31-60 first started using the sense “great”, and people over 60 are resisting the innovation since some are still using the oldest sense “terrible”.

===Conclusion of the study===
The socio-cognitive analysis, as an interdisciplinary perspective, serves to present the systematic relationship between the semantic category fluctuations and the socio-demography of a community. The observations in the case study above contribute to validate the socio-cognitive field. As shown above, it organizes a “conceptual mess” and interpret it in a variationist framework. The complex cognitive polyemy forms regular patterns once it was mapped on the socio-demography of the community. The cognitive sociolinguistic approach, therefore, brings solutions to language research at a methodological and an analytical level (Robinson 2010).

==Application of cognitive sociolinguistic models==

{{Empty section|date=January 2014}}

==Cultural models==

===Rationalist versus romantic models===
The Rationalist Model of Language sees language as a logical item. It states that language is strictly a means of communication, an act of social participation, and language variation as an obstacle to emancipation. The Romantic Model of Language understands language as a means of human expression of themselves and their identities. Language variation, according to this model, is also a means to express social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Geeraerts, 2003, The Inevitability of Cognitive Sociolinguistics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Polzenhagen and Rene Dirven 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural cognition===
Cultural cognition has two integral aspects—conceptualization and language.
Lexical, morpho-syntactic and pragmatic differences cross-linguistically or cross-dialectally are often motivated by conceptualizations which manifest cultural norms, knowledge and experiences in history&lt;ref&gt;Sharifian 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enfield 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it is the individual mind that is responsible for the connection of the two, the ultimate level of cultural cognition is not fixed representations in each member’s mind, but, at an emergent level, is the properties which arise from interactions among members of a cultural group or a speech community.&lt;ref name="Sharifian 2008"&gt;Sharifian 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Model of Cultural Recognition.png|thumb|Cognitive Sociolinguistics]]
The oval section is a representation of cultural cognition on the emergent level. The cognition emerges from the interactions among members of the same group. They may share part of the elements of the collective cultural cognition, as seen in the lower section which reflects the heterogeneous distribution of cultural cognition across individuals’ minds. This is a more dynamic fluid view that goes beyond the individual level of mind and counters the essentialist views of culture.

===Components of cultural models===
Cultural models comprises a network of categories, schemas and metaphors:&lt;ref name="Sharifian 2008"/&gt;

* ''Category'': x is a kind of y.
* ''Schema'': conceptual knowledge, based on other kinds of relationships (e.g. temporal, spatial, thematic, functional, etc.)
:Essentially, cultural models are schemas of a relatively higher degree of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;D’Andrade, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example of a cultural model: American marriage====
* ''Category'': wedding gift
* ''Schema'': giving away
* ''Metaphor'': marriage as a journey.
&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social problem and cultural models===
'''A Rationalist Model: Aboriginal English in Australia'''

Aboriginal English is a mixture of Australian indigenous languages and Anglo-Australian English. Studies have shown that the educational systems in Australia subscribe to the rationalist model by promoting the learning of Standard Australian English as the key to success in their society. As a result, there has been miscommunication in school settings, where teachers approach to aboriginal students with a standardization mindset. However, cognitive sociolinguists’ effort in this is to present the specific schemas and underlying cultural conceptualizations to account for linguistic differences between the two dialects.

In the study, both the Aboriginal Australian and the Anglo-Australian students were asked to elaborate on the give stimuli word "home". Aboriginal children associated "home" with members of their extended family, family obligations, without much limit of time and space. However, the Anglo-Australian children referred to physical buildings and commodities (e.g. TV) as their "home". The lexical difference resides in the conceptualization difference between the two cultural groups, where Aboriginal people’s conceptualizations profile the company of the extended family as opposed to the Anglo-Australian sense of "home" that is usually a building and its contents, bound by space and time.

The study posed implications for improvement of the educational system in Australia. This cognitive sociolinguistic approach brings forth the conflict between the two cultural models—rationalist and romantic, and serves to potentially solve the social problem in a community.

'''A Romantic Model: Chinese English'''

Institutionalized second language varieties of English demonstrate the phenomenon of language contact in that it displays the different embodiment of the same language in different speech communities. Instead of considering these varieties as non-standard and evasive, the cognitive sociolinguistic approach is to account for the motivation and underlying reason for the behavior differences in language (as opposed to the structuralists’ view in a Saussurian model where only the "langue", as a self-contained system, is of scientific interest). For example, In [[Chinese English]], metaphorical expressions such as "sons and daughters of the Chinese nation", "our cousins in Mainland China" (used by people from [[Hong Kong]]) and "big brother" (referring to a recruiter or protector in a Chinese secret society&lt;ref&gt;Bolton 2002: 46, citing from Grolier International Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;) express the conceptualization "the nation is a family".

Syntactically, there is construction grammar incorporating Chinese culture such as ancestral worship:&lt;ref&gt;Troublesome Night 3, Meih Ah Laser Disc Co. Ltd. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
	
:(1) We want to burn a paper woman to Ken [a 22 year old male, who had died], let’s go.
:(2) Mr. Wong is so rich, he won’t live a [sic.] small house after his death. So we must burn him a big villa ... I worry that he would feel lonely. So I will burn him two concubines.

In the examples above, the ditransitive or double- object construction (offer somebody something) is here lexically realized by the culturally determined expressions burn somebody (a paper replica of) a villa, which is one of the mourning rituals for the spirits of the deceased.

In dealing with the World Englishes, the cognitive sociolinguistic approach is one that combines corpus linguistic methods these developed in conceptual metaphor theory and blending theory.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociopolitical model==
The use of language in politics, now and throughout history, plays a significant role in the development of many political issues, controversies, and conflicts. Essentialist and non-essentialist views of language play a crucial role in political discourse in that the definition of a word or concept may be understood as being either too broad or too narrow by one party or another.

One example of such a debacle is the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal of 1998, in which former [[United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was charged with having "sexual relations" with [[Monica Lewinsky]]. The definition of "sexual relations" was called into question as the term was ambiguous (i.e. whether "oral sex" should be included or excluded from the definition of "sexual relations"). The President denied the allegations on the grounds that the definition of "sexual relations" given in the legal deposition of the trial did not constitute "oral sex" on the person being deposed.&lt;ref name="Janicki" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, 1998: A29&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Constantinople-kamensky.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|"Constantinople", a 'ferro-concrete poem' from ''Tango with Cows'' by the Russian Futurist Vasily Kamensky, 1914]]

'''Concrete''', '''pattern''', or '''shape poetry''' is an arrangement of linguistic elements in which the typographical effect is more important in conveying meaning than verbal significance. It is sometimes referred to as [[visual poetry]], a term that has now developed a distinct meaning of its own. As such, concrete poetry relates more to the visual than to the verbal arts and there is a considerable overlap in the kind of product to which it refers. Historically, however, concrete poetry has developed from a long tradition of shaped poems in which the words are arranged in such a way as to depict their subject.

==Development==
Though the term ‘concrete poetry’ is modern, the idea of using letter arrangements to enhance the meaning of a poem is old. Such shaped poetry was popular in Greek [[Alexandria]] during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, although only the handful which were collected together in the [[Greek Anthology]] now survive. Examples include poems by [[Simmias of Rhodes]] in the shape of an egg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://art.famsf.org/andrew-hoyem/egg-simias-rhodes-translated-w-r-paton-plate-1-portfolio-shaped-poetry-san-francisco |title=Egg by Simias of Rhodes, translated by W.

The post-Classical revival of shaped poetry seems to begin with the ''[[Gerechtigkeitsspirale]]'' (spiral of justice), a [[relief carving]] of a poem at the pilgrimage church of [[St. Valentin, Kiedrich|St. Valentin]] in the German town of [[Hesse]]. The text is carved in the form of a [[spiral]] on the front of one of the church [[pew]]s&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of several decorative designs there created in 1510 by master carpenter [[:de:Erhart Falckener|Erhart Falckener]].

[[File:GeorgeHerbertEasterWingsPatternPoem1633.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[George Herbert]]'s "Easter Wings" (1633), printed sideways on facing pages so that the lines would call to mind angels flying with outstretched wings]]
Early religious examples of shaped poems in English include "[[Easter Wings]]" and "[[The Altar (Herbert poem)|The Altar]]" in [[George Herbert]]’s ''The Temple'' (1633)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/h/herbert/temple/Altar.html |title=George Herbert: The Altar (1633) |website=Ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]’s "This crosstree here", which is set in the shape of a cross, from his ''Noble Numbers'' (1647).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/herrick/crosstree.htm |title=Robert Herrick. Noble Numbers. 268 |website=Luminarium.org |date=2001-04-17 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative religious precursor is [[Micrography]], a technique for creating visual images used by Hebrew artists, which involves organizing small arrangements of Biblical texts such that they form images which illustrate the subject of the text. Micrography allows the creation of images of natural objects by Jews without directly breaking the prohibition of creating "graven images" that might be interpreted as [[idolatry]]. The technique is now used by both religious and secular artists and is similar to the use of Arabic texts in [[Islamic calligraphy#Modern examples|Islamic calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/#!/home|format=JPG|title=Arabic Calligraphy|website=Arabicalligraphy.com|accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European secular examples include poems in the shape of wine flagons by [[Rabelais]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dive_Bouteille_-_Cinqui%C3%A8me_livre.jpg|title=Français : Illustration se trouvant à la fin du Cinquième livre de François Rabelais.|first=|last=Unknown|date=20 May 2014|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles-François Panard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://art.famsf.org/andrew-hoyem/bottle-charles-fran%C3%A7ois-panard-translated-glenn-todd-plate-10-portfolio-shaped-poetry |title=Bottle by Charles François Panard, translated by Glenn Todd, plate 10 in the portfolio Shaped Poetry (San Francisco: Arion Press, 1981) - Andrew Hoyem, Glenn Todd, Arion Press &amp;#124; FAMSF Explore the Art |website=Art.famsf.org |date=1993-12-02 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Slovene [[France Prešeren]]'s "A Toast" (Zdravljica, 1844) with stanzas in the shape of wine-glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zdravica-%C5%A1t4-rokopis1.jpg |title=The Manuscript of Zdravica by France Prešeren|via=Wikimedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was taken up at the start of the 20th century by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in his ''[[Calligrammes]]'' (1918), with poems in, among others, the shape of a necktie, a fountain and raindrops running down a window.
 
In that era also there were typographical experiments by members of avant-garde movements such as [[Futurism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] in which lay-out moved from an auxiliary expression of meaning to artistic primacy. Thus the significance of the [[sound poetry]] in Marinetti’s [[Zang Tumb Tumb]] (1912) is expressed through pictorial means. Similarly in Germany Raoul Hausmann claimed that the typographic style of his 'Phonemes' allowed the reader to recognise what sound was intended.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Scholz, "Relations between sound poetry and visual poetry", in ''Visible Language'' 35.1, 2001, [http://www.rainerlinz.net/NMA/repr/Duke.html p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia the Futurist poet [[Vasily Kamensky]] went so far as to term the typography of his ''[[Tango with Cows]]'', published in 1914, 'ferro-concrete poems' (''zhelezobetonnye poemy''), long before the name became current elsewhere. 

A further move away from overt meaning occurred where ‘poems’ were simplified to a simple arrangement of the letters of the alphabet. [[Louis Aragon]], for example, exhibited the sequence from a to z and titled it "Suicide" (1926), while [[Kurt Schwitters]]’ "ZA (elementary)" has the alphabet in reverse,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mayer, ''Alphabetic and Letter Poems'', London 1978, pp.51-2&lt;/ref&gt; and the Catalan writer Josep Maria Junoy  (1885-1955) placed just the letters Z and A at the top and bottom of the page under the title "Ars Poetica".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BT39hCpLXoI/TPA8uOtMVuI/AAAAAAAAEo4/RdEO1FvRY2g/s1600/Junoy+-+cal%25C2%25B7ligrames.jpg |format=JPG |title=Art Poetica |website=1.bp.blogspot.com |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war concrete poetry==
During the early 1950s two Brazilian artistic groups producing severely abstract and impersonal work were joined by poets linked to the [[São Paulo]] magazine ''Noigandres'' who began to treat language in an equally abstract way. Their work was termed "concrete poetry" after they exhibited along with the artists in the National Exhibition of [[Concrete Art]] (1956/57). The poets included [[Augusto de Campos]], [[Haroldo de Campos]] and [[Décio Pignatari]], who were joined in the exhibition by [[Ferreira Gullar]], Ronaldo Azeredo and Wlademir Dias Pino from [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1958 a Brazilian concrete poetry manifesto was published and an anthology in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ciberletras/v17/cluver.htm |title=The Noigandres Poets and Concrete Art |website=Lehman.cuny.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houédard claimed that it was the 1962 publication in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' of a letter from the Portuguese E.M. de Melo e Castro that awakened British writers such as himself, [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] and [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] to the possibilities of Concrete Poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were by this time other European writers producing similar work, principally [[Eugen Gomringer]], who considered that a poem should be "a reality in itself" rather than a statement about reality,&lt;ref&gt;"From Line to Constellation", 1954, trans. by Mike Weaver in ''Image Magazine'', Dec. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and "as easily understood as signs in airports and traffic signs".&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in defining such a style is admitted by Houédard’s statement that "a printed concrete poem is ambiguously both typographic-poetry and poetic-typography".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mayer, "Concrete poems just are", [http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/concrete-poems-just-are ''Eye Magazine'' 20], Spring 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0256-Stuttgart Finlay-11-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Ian Hamilton Finlay sculpture in Stuttgart, 1975; the word ''schiff'' (ship) is carved in reverse and can only be decoded when it floats reflected on water]]  
Another difficulty of definition is caused by the way such works cross artistic boundaries into the areas of music and sculpture, or can alternatively be defined as [[sound poetry]], [[visual poetry]], [[found poetry]] and typewriter art.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riddell’s 1975 anthology ''Typewriter Art'' is [http://monoskop.org/images/8/8b/Riddell_Alan_ed_Typewriter_Art.pdf available online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Chopin]]’s work was related to his musical treatment of the word. Kenelm Cox (1927-68) was a kinetic artist "interested in the linear, serial aspects of visual experience but particularly in the process of change," whose revolving machines transcended the static page in being able to express this.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbing, ''GLOUP &amp; WOUP''&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Hamilton Finlay’s concrete poetry began on the page but then moved increasingly towards three dimensional figuration and afterwards to [[site-specific art]] in the creation of his sculpture garden at [[Little Sparta]]. The Italian [[Maurizio Nannucci]]'s ''Dattilogrammmi'' experiments (1964/1965) were also transitional, preluding his move into [[light art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mam-st-etienne.fr/index.php?rubrique=403 |title=Maurizio NANNUCCI : more information |website=Mam-st-etienne.fr |date=2012-09-30 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bob Cobbing]], who was also a sound poet, had been experimenting with typewriter and duplicator since 1942. Of its possibilities in suggesting the physical dimension of the auditory process, he declared that "One can get the measure of a poem with the typewriter’s accurate left/right &amp; up &amp; down movements; but superimposition by means of stencil and duplicator enable one to dance to this measure."&lt;ref&gt;Finch, pp.45-6&lt;/ref&gt; Houédard’s entirely different work was also produced principally on the typewriter but approximates more to painterly and sculptural procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=f |url=http://socks-studio.com/2014/06/15/the-shape-of-poetry-2-dom-sylvester-houedards-typestracts |title=The Shape of Poetry /2 : Dom Sylvester Houédard’s ‘Typestracts’ – SOCKS |website=Socks-studio.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; So too does that of the American [[Minimalism|Minimalist]] artist [[Carl André]], beginning from about 1958 and in parallel with his changing artistic procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://socks-studio.com/2014/04/17/the-shape-of-poetry-carl-andres-typed-works |title=The Shape of Poetry: Carl Andre’s Typed Works – SOCKS |website=Socks-studio.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in Italy Adriano Spatola (1941-88) developed the artistic fragmentation of language using various visual techniques in his ''Zeroglifico'' (1965/6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiviomauriziospatola.com/prod/pdf_storici/S00192.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adriano Spatola e la poesia concreta: Zeroglifico (Sampietro, Bologna 1966) |website=Archiviomauriziospatola.com |accessdate=2017-04-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Edwin Morgan’s experiments with concrete poetry covered several other aspects of it, including elements of found poetry ‘discovered’ by misreading and isolating elements from printed sources. "Most people have probably had the experience of scanning a newspaper page quickly and taking a message from it quite different from the intended one. I began looking deliberately for such hidden messages…preferably with the visual or typographical element part of the point."&lt;ref&gt;The section Newspoems 1965-71 in ''Themes on a Variation'', Manchester 1988, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X7huBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT121&amp;ots=5WvoC9jkhf&amp;dq=%22Newspoems%22%20%20Morgan&amp;pg=PT132#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Newspoems%22%20%20Morgan&amp;f=false pp.63-112]&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of the search for unintended concordances of meaning emerges in [[A Humument]], the lifework of the visual artist [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]], who uses painterly and decorative procedures to isolate them on the page.

Despite such blurring of artistic boundaries, concrete poetry can be viewed as taking its place in a predominantly visual tradition stretching over more than two millennia that seeks to draw attention to the word in the space of the page, and to the spaces between words, as an aid to emphasising their significance.&lt;ref&gt;"Reading space in visual poetry", ''Writing Technologies'', Vol.4 2012, [https://www.ntu.ac.uk/writing_technologies/current_journal/124937.pdf, pp.75-106]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporatism''' is the organization of a society by [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations, on the basis of their common interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IKn2y2yS014C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=%22system+of+social+organization+that+has+at+its+base+the+grouping+of+men+according+to+the+community+of+their+natural+interests%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22system%20of%20social%20organization%20that%20has%20at%20its%20base%20the%20grouping%20of%20men%20according%20to%20the%20community%20of%20their%20natural%20interests%22&amp;f=false|title=Corporatism and Comparative Politics: The Other Great Ism|publisher=M.E.

In 1881, [[Pope Leo XIII]] commissioned theologians and social thinkers to study corporatism and provide a definition for it. In 1884 in [[Freiburg]], the commission declared that corporatism was a "system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt; Corporatism is related to the [[sociology|sociological]] concept of [[structural functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Adler, Franklin Hugh Pp. 349"&gt;Adler, Franklin Hugh.''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906–34''.

Corporatism may also refer to economic [[tripartism]] involving negotiations between business, labour and state interest groups to establish economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Slomp.

==Common types==
===Kinship corporatism===
[[Kinship]]-based corporatism emphasizing [[clan]], ethnic and family identification has been a common phenomenon in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] societies based upon families and clans in East Asia and Southeast Asia have been considered types of corporatism. [[China]] has strong elements of [[clan corporatism]] in its society involving legal norms concerning family relations.&lt;ref&gt;Bao-Er. China's Neo-traditional Rights of the Child. Blaxland, Australia: Lulu.com, 2006. Pp. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]]ic societies often feature strong clans which form the basis for a community-based corporatist society.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J 1996. Pp. 10"/&gt; [[Family business]]es are common worldwide in capitalist societies.

===Corporatism in the Roman Catholic Church===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] sponsored the creation of various institutions including brotherhoods, monasteries, religious orders and military associations, especially during the [[Crusades]], to sponsor association between these groups. In [[Italy]], various function-based groups and institutions were created, including universities, [[guild]]s for artisans and craftspeople and other professional associations.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 31"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the guild system is a particularly important aspect of the history of corporatism because it involved the allocation of power to regulate trade and prices to guilds, which is an important aspect of corporatist economic models of economic management and [[class collaboration]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 31" /&gt;

Corporatism's popularity increased in the late 19th century and a corporatist internationale was formed in 1890, followed by the publishing of ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' by the Catholic Church that for the first time declared the Church's blessing to trade unions and recommended for organized labour to be recognized by politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporatist unions in Europe were endorsed by the Catholic Church to challenge the [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] and other radical unions, with the corporatist unions being fairly conservative in comparison to their radical rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholic corporatist states include Austria under the leadership of Federal Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and Ecuador under the leadership of [[Garcia Moreno]]. The economic vision outlined in ''Rerum novarum'' and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' also influenced the regime of [[Juan Perón]] and [[Justicialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bethell |first1=Leslie |title=Argentina Since Independence |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rein |first1=Monica |title=Politics and Education in Argentina, 1946-1962 |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |quote=The Church's social concept presented an alternative to the Marxist and capitalist positions, both of which it saw as misguided.

===Biology===
In social psychology and biology, researchers have found the presence of [[corporate group]] social organization amongst animal species.&lt;ref name="Murchison, Carl Allanmore 1967. Pp. 150"/&gt; Research has shown that [[penguin]]s are known to reside in densely populated corporate breeding colonies.&lt;ref name="Murchison, Carl Allanmore 1967. Pp. 150"/&gt;

===Politics and political economy===

{{State monopoly capitalism}}

====Communitarian corporatism====
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right)]]
Ancient Greece developed early concepts of corporatism. [[Plato]] developed the concept of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] corporatist system of natural-based classes and natural [[Social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] that would be organized based on function, such that groups would cooperate to achieve social harmony by emphasizing [[collective]] interests while rejecting individual interests.&lt;ref name="Adler, Franklin Hugh Pp. 349"/&gt;

In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' , [[Aristotle]] also described society as being divided along natural classes and functional purposes that were priests, rulers, slaves and warriors.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 29"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Rome adopted Greek concepts of corporatism into their own version of corporatism but also added the concept of political representation on the basis of function that divided representatives into military, professional and religious groups and created institutions for each group known as ''[[wikt:colegio|colegios]]''&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 29"/&gt; ({{lang-la|[[wikt#Latin:collegium|collegia]]}}). See [[collegium (ancient Rome)]].

====Absolutist corporatism====
Absolute monarchies during the late Middle Ages gradually subordinated corporatist systems and corporate groups to the authority of centralized and [[Autocracy|absolutist]] governments, resulting in corporatism being used to enforce [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 33"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French Revolution, the existing absolutist corporatist system was abolished due to its endorsement of social hierarchy and special "corporate privilege" for the Roman Catholic Church. The new French government considered corporatism's emphasis on group rights as inconsistent with the government's promotion of individual rights. Subsequently corporatist systems and corporate privilege throughout Europe were abolished in response to the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 33"/&gt; From 1789 to the 1850s, most supporters of corporatism were [[Reactionary|reactionaries]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of reactionary corporatists favoured corporatism in order to end liberal [[capitalism]] and restore the [[feudalism|feudal system]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"&gt;R. J. Barry Jones. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F''. Taylor &amp; Frances, 2001. Pp. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progressive corporatism====
From the 1850s onward, [[Progressivism|progressive]] corporatism developed in response to [[classical liberalism]] and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt; These corporatists supported providing group rights to members of the middle classes and working classes in order to secure cooperation among the classes. This was in opposition to the Marxist conception of [[class conflict]]. By the 1870s and 1880s, corporatism experienced a revival in Europe with the creation of workers' unions that were committed to negotiations with employers.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt;

In his work ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' ("Community and Society") of 1887, [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] began a major revival of corporatist philosophy associated with the development of [[neo-medievalism]] and increased promotion of [[guild socialism]] and causing major changes of theoretical [[sociology]]. Tönnies claims that [[Organicism|organic]] communities based upon clans, communes, families and professional groups are disrupted by the mechanical society of economic classes imposed by capitalism.&lt;ref name="Peter F. Klarén 1986. Pp. 221"&gt;Peter F. Klarén, Thomas J. Bossert. Promise of development: theories of change in Latin America. Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press, 1986. Pp. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Socialists used Tönnies' theory to promote their notion of ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community").&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ludwig Carsten, Hermann Graml. ''The German resistance to Hitler''. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press. Pp. 93&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tönnies opposed [[Nazism]] and joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1932 to oppose fascism in Germany and was deprived of his honorary professorship by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Tönnies, José Harris. ''Community and civil society''. Cambridge University Press, 2001 (first edition in 1887 as ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft''). Pp. xxxii-xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corporate solidarism====
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] advocated a form of corporatism termed "solidarism" that advocated creating an [[Organicism|organic]] [[social solidarity]] of society through functional representation.&lt;ref name="Antony Black 1984. P226"&gt;Antony Black, pp. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarism was based upon Durkheim's view that the dynamic of human society as a [[collective]] is distinct from that of an individual, in that society is what places upon individuals their cultural and social attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Black, pp. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim claimed that in the economy solidarism would alter the division of labour by changing it from the mechanical [[social solidarity|solidarity]] to organic solidarity. Durkheim claimed that the existing industrial [[Capitalism|capitalist]] division of labour caused "juridical and moral ''[[anomie]]''" which had no norms or agreed procedures to resolve conflicts resulting in chronic confrontation between employers and trade unions.&lt;ref name="Antony Black 1984. P226"/&gt; Durkheim believed that this anomie caused social [[dislocation]] and claimed that by this "[i]t is the law of the strongest which rules, and there is inevitably a chronic state of war, latent or acute".&lt;ref name="Antony Black 1984. P226"/&gt; As a result, Durkheim claimed it is a moral obligation of the members of society to end this situation by creating a moral organic solidarity based upon professions as organized into a single public institution.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Black, pp. 226, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal corporatism====
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of [[John Stuart Mill]]]]
The idea of [[liberal corporatism]] has also been attributed to English liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] who discussed corporatist-like economic associations as needing to "predominate" in society to create equality for labourers and give them influence with management by [[economic democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Samuel. ''The commercial society: foundations and challenges in a global age''. Lanham,USA; Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, 2007. Pp. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some other types of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or [[individualism]], but believes that the capitalist companies are social institutions that should require their managers to do more than maximize [[net income]] by recognizing the needs of their employees.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

This liberal corporatist ethic is similar to [[Taylorism]], but endorses democratization of capitalist companies. Liberal corporatists believe that inclusion of all members in the election of management in effect reconciles "ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality".&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt; Liberal corporatism began to gain disciples in the United States during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt;

Liberal corporatism was an influential component of the [[progressivism in the United States]] that has been referred to as "interest group liberalism".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the [[New Deal]] economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in [[Keynesianism]] and even [[Fordism]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"/&gt;

====Fascist corporatism====
{{Fascism sidebar}}
{{see also|Preussentum und Sozialismus}}
Fascism's theory of economic corporatism involved management of sectors of the economy by government or privately-controlled organizations (corporations).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Each trade union or employer corporation would theoretically represent its professional concerns, especially by negotiation of labour contracts and the like. It was theorized that this method could result in [[Class collaboration|harmony amongst social classes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Mazower]], ''Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century'' p. 29 {{ISBN|0-679-43809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, authors have noted that historically ''de facto'' economic corporatism was also used to reduce opposition and reward political loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;"Fascism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 15 April 2010 [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-219369].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy from 1922 until 1943, corporatism became influential amongst Italian nationalists led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. The [[Charter of Carnaro]] gained much popularity as the prototype of a "corporative state", having displayed much within its tenets as a [[Gremialismo|guild system]] combining the concepts of autonomy and authority in a special synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parlato|first=Giuseppe|title=La sinistra fascista|publisher=Il Mulino|year=2000|location=Bologna|pages=88|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfredo Rocco]] spoke of a corporative state and declared corporatist ideology in detail. Rocco would later become a member of the Italian fascist regime.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. 1996. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC] Routledge. Pp. 64 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC&amp;q=Alfredo+Rocco#search] {{ISBN|1-85728-595-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian Fascism]] involved a corporatist political system in which the economy was [[Tripartism|collectively managed]] by employers, workers and state officials by formal mechanisms at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right'' (2002) by Peter Jonathan Davies and Derek Lynch, Routledge (UK), {{ISBN|0-415-21494-7}} p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; It supporters claimed that corporatism could better recognize or "incorporate" every divergent interest into the state organically, unlike majority-rules democracy which they said could marginalize specific interests. This total consideration was the inspiration for their use of the term "[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]", described without coercion (which is connotated in the modern meaning) in the 1932 ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' as thus: {{quote|When brought within the orbit of the State, Fascism recognizes the real needs which gave rise to socialism and trade unionism, giving them due weight in the guild or corporative system in which divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized in the unity of the State.&lt;ref name=doctrine&gt;[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm Mussolini{{spaced ndash}}The Doctrine of Fascism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|[The state] is not simply a mechanism which limits the sphere of the supposed liberties of the individual... Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State... Far from crushing the individual, the Fascist State multiplies his energies, just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers.&lt;ref name=doctrine /&gt;}}

A popular slogan of the Italian Fascists under Mussolini was "Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato" ("everything for the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state").

This prospect of Italian fascist corporatism claimed to be the direct heir of [[Georges Sorel]]'s [[Sorelianism|revolutionary syndicalism]]&lt;!-- The form? --&gt;, such that each interest was to form as its own entity with separate organizing parameters according to their own standards, but only within the corporative model of Italian fascism each was supposed to be incorporated through the auspices and organizing ability of a statist construct. This was by their reasoning the only possible way to achieve such a function, i.e. when resolved in the capability of an indissoluble state. Much of the corporatist influence upon Italian Fascism was partly due to the Fascists' attempts to gain endorsement by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] that itself sponsored corporatism.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Philip 2003. P. 170"&gt;Morgan, Philip. ''Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945''. Routledge, 2003. P. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fascism's corporatism was a top-down model of state control over the economy while the Roman Catholic Church's corporatism favoured a bottom-up corporatism, whereby groups such as families and professional groups would voluntarily work together.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Philip 2003. P. 170" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul H. ''Authoritarian regimes in Latin America: dictators, despots, and tyrants''. Lanham, Maryland, USA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006. Pp. 131. "Fascism differed from Catholic corporatism by assigning the state the role of final arbiter, in the event that employer and labor syndicates failed to agree."&lt;/ref&gt; The fascist state corporatism (of Roman Catholic Italy) influenced the governments and economies of a not only other Roman Catholic-majority countries, such as the governments of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in [[Austria]] and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in [[Portugal]], but also [[Konstantin Päts]] and [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] in non-Catholic [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. Fascists in non-Catholic countries also supported Italian Fascist corporatism, including [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], who commended corporatism and said that "it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole".&lt;ref name="Robert Eccleshall 1994. P. 208"&gt;Robert Eccleshall, Vincent Geoghegan, Richard Jay, Michael Kenny, Iain Mackenzie, Rick Wilford. ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction''. 2nd ed. Routledge, 1994. P. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosley also considered corporatism as an attack on ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and "international finance".&lt;ref name="Robert Eccleshall 1994. P. 208" /&gt;

The corporatist state Salazar [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|established in Portugal]] was not associated with Mussolini—quite the opposite as he banished the fascist party in Portugal and distanced himself from all of Europe's fascist regimes. Portugal during Salazar's reign was considered Catholic corporatism. Portugal remained neutral throughout World War II. Salazar also had a strong dislike of Marxism and liberalism.

In 1933, Salazar stated: "Our Dictatorship clearly resembles a fascist dictatorship in the reinforcement of authority, in the war declared against certain principles of democracy, in its accentuated nationalist character, in its preoccupation of social order. However, it differs from it in its process of renovation. The fascist dictatorship tends towards a pagan [[Caesarism]], towards a state that knows no limits of a legal or moral order, which marches towards its goal without meeting complications or obstacles. The Portuguese New State, on the contrary, cannot avoid, not think of avoiding, certain limits of a moral order which it may consider indispensable to maintain in its favour of its reforming action".&lt;ref&gt;''Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review'' Vol. 92, No. 368, Winter, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-corporatism====
During the post-[[World War II]] reconstruction period in Europe, corporatism was favoured by [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] (often under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]]), [[National conservatism|national conservatives]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] in opposition to liberal capitalism. This type of corporatism became unfashionable but revived again in the 1960s and 1970s as "neo-corporatism" in response to the new economic threat of [[stagflation|recession-inflation]].

Neo-corporatism favoured economic [[tripartism]] which involved strong labour unions, employers' unions and governments that cooperated as "[[social partners]]" to negotiate and manage a national economy.&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243" /&gt; [[Social corporatism|Social corporatist]] systems instituted in Europe after World War II include the [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] system of the [[social market economy]] in Germany, the [[Social Partnership|social partnership]] in Ireland, the [[polder model]] in the Netherlands (although arguably the polder model already was present at the end of World War I, it was not until after World War II that a social service system gained foothold there), the concertation system in Italy, the [[Rhine capitalism|Rhine model]] in Switzerland and the Benelux countries and the [[Nordic model]] in Scandinavia.

Attempts in the United States to create neo-corporatist capital-labor arrangements were unsuccessfully advocated by [[Gary Hart]] and [[Michael Dukakis]] in the 1980s. As Secretary of Labor during the Clinton administration, [[Robert Reich]] promoted neo-corporatist reforms.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 194"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese corporatism====
Chinese corporatism, as described by [[Jonathan Unger]] and Anita Chan in their essay ''China, Corporatism, and the East Asian Model'', is the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ips.cap.anu.edu.au/psc/ccc/publications/papers/JUAC_China_Corporatism.pdf "China，Corporatism，and the East Asian Model"]. By Jonathan Unger and Anita Chan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;[A]t the national level the state recognizes one and only one organization (say, a national labour union, a business association, a farmers' association) as the sole representative of the sectoral interests of the individuals, enterprises or institutions that comprise that organization's assigned constituency. The state determines which organizations will be recognized as legitimate and forms an unequal partnership of sorts with such organizations. The associations sometimes even get channelled into the policy-making processes and often help implement state policy on the government's behalf.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By establishing itself as the arbiter of legitimacy and assigning responsibility for a particular [[constituency]] with one sole organization, the state limits the number of players with which it must negotiate its policies and co-opts their leadership into policing their own members. This arrangement is not limited to economic organizations such as business groups and social organizations.

The use of corporatism as a framework to understand the central state's behaviour in China has been criticized by authors such as Bruce Gilley and William Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gilley (2011) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2011.565181#.UhTA27FzZrQ Paradigms of Chinese Politics: Kicking Society Back Out]", ''Journal of Contemporary China'' 20(70).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hurst (2007) "The City as the Focus: The Analysis of Contemporary Chinese Urban Politics’, ''China Information'' 20(30).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath have argued the framework is still useful for analyzing China's local state behaviour and its engagement with social actors.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath (2014) “[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2211248 The Local Corporatist State and NGO Relations in China]”, ''Journal of Contemporary China'' 23(87).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath (2013) ''The [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415640725/ Chinese Corporatist State: Adaptation, Survival and Resistance]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reza Hasmath and Jennifer Hsu (2009) ''[http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/china-in-an-era-of-transition-reza-hasmath/?K=9780230613508 China in an Era of Transition: Understanding Contemporary State and Society Actors]''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying how the government engages with NGOs in particular has been a key part of the analysis of how local authorities in China have adapted and employed corporatist measures. Hsu and Hasmath argue that corporatist measures "continue to be employed by local authorities as an effective means of ensuring the potency and relevance of the local state in a rapidly changing sector," while the state itself continues to retreat from the provision of welfare and social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer YJ|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2014|title=The Local Corporatist State and NGO Relations in China|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/15/|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|language=en|volume=23|issue=87|pages=516-517|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments have adapted corporatist measures by "utilizing subtle or tacit forms of approval" to influence NGOs' operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer YJ|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2014|title=The Local Corporatist State and NGO Relations in China|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/15/|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|language=en|volume=23|issue=87|pages=517|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Russian corporatism====
On October 9, 2007, an article signed by [[Viktor Cherkesov]], head of the Russian Drug Enforcement Administration, was published in ''[[Kommersant]]'', where he used the term "corporativist state" in a positive way to describe the evolution of Russia. He claimed that the administration officials detained on criminal charges earlier that month are the exception rather than the rule and that the only development scenario for Russia that is both realistic enough and relatively favorable is to continue evolution into a corporativist state ruled by security service officials.&lt;ref&gt;Cherkesov, Viktor. [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=812840 Нельзя допустить, чтобы воины превратились в торговцев]. ''[[Kommersant]]'' #184 (3760), October 9, 2007. [http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/viktor_cherkesov_on_the_spy_wa.htm English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025092259/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/viktor_cherkesov_on_the_spy_wa.htm |date=2007-10-25 }} and [http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/grigory_pasko_a_cry_from_a_jar.htm Comments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017134834/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/grigory_pasko_a_cry_from_a_jar.htm |date=2007-10-17 }} by [[Grigory Pasko]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, [[Andrei Illarionov]], former economic adviser to [[Vladimir Putin]], claimed that Russia had become a corporativist state: &lt;blockquote&gt;The process of this state evolving into a new corporativist [''sic''] model reached its completion in 2005. [...] The strengthening of the corporativist state model and setting up favorable conditions for quasi-state monopolies by the state itself hurt the economy. ... Cabinet members or key Presidential Staff executives chairing corporation boards or serving on those boards are the order of the day in Russia. In what Western country—except in the corporativist state that lasted for 20 years in Italy—is such a phenomenon possible? Which, actually, proves that the term 'corporativist' properly applies to Russia today.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1145192,00.html "Q&amp;A: Putin's Critical Adviser"]. By Yuri Zarakhovich. December 31, 2005. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to some researchers, all [[political power]]s and most important economic [[asset]]s in the country are controlled by former [[state security]] officials ("[[silovik]]s").&lt;ref name="Takeover"/&gt; The takeover of Russian state and economic assets has been allegedly accomplished by a clique of [[Political groups during Vladimir Putin's presidency|Putin's close associates and friends]]&lt;ref name="Glinski"&gt;[http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/pm_0147.pdf The Essence of Putinism: The Strengthening of the Privatized State] by Dmitri Glinski Vassiliev, [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; who gradually became a leading group of [[Russian oligarch]]s and who "seized control over the financial, media and administrative resources of the Russian state"&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/numbers/7/521.html What is ‘Putinism’?], by Andranik Migranyan, ''Russia in Global affairs'', 13 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Putin legislation and program|restricted democratic freedoms]] and [[Human rights in Russia|human rights]]&lt;ref name="Takeover"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600500483699 The Chekist Takeover of the Russian State], Anderson, Julie (2006), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 19:2, 237 - 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Illarionov described the present situation in Russia as a new socio-political order, "distinct from any seen in our country before". In this model, members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators (KSSS) took over the entire body of state power, follow an [[omerta]]-like behavior code and "are given instruments conferring power over others – membership "perks", such as the right to carry and use weapons". According to Illarionov, the "Corporation has seized key government agencies – the Tax Service, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[Duma|Parliament]], and the [[Media freedom in Russia|government-controlled mass media]] – which are now used to advance the interests of KSSS members. Through these agencies, every significant resource of the country – security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial – is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members".&lt;ref name="Illarionov"&gt;[http://ej.ru/comments/entry/6735/ Andrei Illarionov: Approaching Zimbabwe (Russian)] [http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/04/andrei_illarionov_approaching.htm Partial English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705011725/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/04/andrei_illarionov_approaching.htm |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyst [[Andrei Piontkovsky]] also considers the present situation as "the highest and culminating stage of bandit capitalism in Russia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4094.html#1 Putinism: highest stage of robber capitalism], by [[Andrei Piontkovsky]], The Russia Journal, February 7–13, 2000. The title is an allusion to work ''"[[Imperialism]] as the last and culminating stage of capitalism"'' by [[Vladimir Lenin]]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that "Russia is not corrupt. [[Political corruption|Corruption]] is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today’s Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=4852 Review of Andrei's Pionkovsky's ''Another Look Into Putin's Soul'' by the Honorable Rodric Braithwaite], [[Hoover Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic groups==
Saint Vincents's population is predominantly [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]/black (77,390 in 2001; 72.8% of the total population) or of mixed African-European descent (21,303; 20%).&lt;ref name="2001 census"/&gt; 1.4% of the population is East Indian (1,436 residents in 2001) and 1.4% white (608 Portuguese and 870 other white).

Saint Vincent &amp; the Grenadines also has a small [[Black Carib]] population. During the past decades the Black Caribs increased from 3,347 at the 1991 census (3.1% of the population) to 3,818 at the 2001 census (3.6% of the population). Black Caribs are indigenous from the island of Saint Vincent, formed in the 18th century by the mixture between Carib Amerindians and black slaves. A part of their community (now known as [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]]) was expelled from St. Vincent in 1797 and exported to the island of [[Roatán]], Honduras, from where they migrated to the Caribbean coast of the mainland of Central America and spread as far as [[Belize]] and [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garifunaresearch.com/page21.html Garifuna reach: Historia de los garífunas]. Posted by Itarala.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Garifuna have retained their Carib language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/cab|title=Garifuna|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Black Caribs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines speak Creole English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/VC/languages|title=Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 0.8% of the population includes [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and people from the Middle East.

'''E. Patrick Johnson''' is the Carlos Montezuma Professor of Performance Studies and Professor of African-American Studies at [[Northwestern University]]. He currently serves as the Chair of the African-American Studies Department at Northwestern University and is a Visiting Scholar at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. His scholarly and artistic contributions focus on [[Performance studies|Performance Studies]], [[African-American studies|African-American Studies]] and [[Women's studies|Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies]].

==Early life==
Born Elondust Patrick Johnson on March 1, 1967, the youngest of seven children in [[Hickory, North Carolina]], Johnson was raised by his mother, Sarah M. Johnson, who worked as a factory worker. His mother reared him, along with his six siblings, in a one-bedroom apartment in Ridgeview, a majority-Black section of Hickory. Though she had only acquired a 10th grade education herself, Johnson's mother emphasized doing well in school, nurtured Johnson's creative talents early on and entered him in community talent shows. His first grade teacher, Beverly "Bunny" White, was instrumental in nurturing his creative and academic talents as well, by providing access to spaces that were closed to blacks and by providing financial support. He was also mentored by black women in the Ridgeview Community, including Z. Ann Hoyle, who became the first black alderman on the City of Hickory's city council. Hoyle would eventually spearhead a resolution to honor Johnson with his own day in 1996. He attended [[Hickory High School (North Carolina)|Hickory High School]], where he was Senior Class President, and later the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. At UNC-Chapel Hill, Johnson was involved with a number of campus groups, including the Black Student Movement and the gospel choir. He entered college as a theater major, but after becoming a work-study student in the Speech Communications department, he switched his major. It was in that department that he was introduced to performance studies, oral history, and performance ethnography and influenced by his teachers and mentors D. Soyini Madison, Della Pollock, and [[Trudier Harris]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Johnson received both his [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] and [[Master's degree|master's degrees]] from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in Speech Communications before completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Speech Communications at Louisiana State University with certificates in [[English studies|English]] and [[Anthropology]].

==Career==
After earning his PhD, Johnson became an [[Assistant professor|Assistant Professor]] of English at [[Amherst College]]. In 2000, Johnson joined the faculty of the Department of Performance Studies Department at Northwestern University as an Assistant Professor before receiving [[Academic tenure|tenure]] and a joint appointment in African-American Studies in 2003. From 2003–2006 and 2014–2016, Johnson served as the Director of Graduate Studies for the Department of Performance Studies. Later, he would also serve as the Chair of Performance Studies from 2006–2011. In 2007, Johnson was promoted to Full Professor of African-American Studies and Performance Studies before becoming the Carlos Montezuma Professor of African-American Studies and Performance Studies in 2011. He currently serves as the Chair of the African-American Studies Department.

==Influence==
Johnson's introduction of "quare" as a theoretical concept became particularly influential in the fields of [[queer theory]], [[Women's studies|women, gender and sexuality]] and [[Africana studies|black studies]]. Originally published in ''Text &amp; Performance Quarterly'', "Quare' Studies Or (Almost) Everything I Know About Queer Studies I Learned From My Grandmother" went on to be reprinted numerous times. "Quare" signaled a significant departure from the lack of engagement with race and class by queer theorists and with gender and sexuality among black studies scholars.

Conceptually, "Quare" took seriously the lived experiences and knowledge of black queer people and such an understanding necessitated a shift toward enabling black queer people to articulate their own identities, knowledge and experiences. Further, the manner in which Johnson wrote the article blurs the line between art and scholarship as the article employs prose, poetry and theoretical ideas simultaneously. In 2000, Johnson convened the Black Queer Studies in the Millennium Conference which served as the beginning of black queer studies as a field.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Research==

Johnson's first book, ''Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity'', examines how blackness is appropriated and performed—toward widely divergent ends—both within and outside African American culture and won the Lilla A. Heston Award and the Errol Hill Award.

His second book, ''Sweet Tea: Black Gay Men of the South—An Oral History'' (2008) is an ethnographic oral history of the lives of black gay men in the US South, a traditionally uninterrogated region. This book was awarded the Stonewall Book Award Honor Book by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table of the [[American Library Association]].

Published in 2005 with Mae G. Henderson, ''Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology'' interrogates the experiences of black queer people whose subjectivities, beliefs, struggles, triumphs and desires had not previously been interrogated by either Queer Theory or Black Studies. The anthology includes writings from scholars including [[Cathy Cohen]], [[Kara Keeling]], [[Roderick Ferguson]], [[Rinaldo Walcott]] and [[Dwight A. McBride|Dwight McBride]].

Published in 2014 with Ramon H. Rivera-Servera, ''solo/black/woman: scripts, interviews and essays'' is a collection of writings that feature seven solo performances by emerging and established feminist performance artists from the past three decades. The book received an Honorable Mention for the Errol Hill Book Award.

In 2013, Johnson published ''Cultural Struggles: Performance, Ethnography, Praxis'', an edited collection of essays written by [[Dwight Conquergood]]. Conquergood selected Johnson to publish his work before his death in 2004. Conquergood was an ethnographer in the field of performance studies whose ethnographic methods focused on power, privilege and researcher reflexivity/responsibility.

Published in 2016, ''No Tea, No Shade: New Writings in Black Queer Studies'' features the next generation of black queer theorists who follow in the lineage of writings in ''Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology''. The text was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award and features writings by Amber Jamilla Musser, Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley, Jafari Sinclaire Allen, Lyndon Gill and [[Marlon M. Bailey]].

Published in 2016, ''Blacktino Queer Performance'' (with Ramon H. Rivera-Servera) is a collection of nine performance scripts by established and emerging black and Latina/o queer playwrights and performance artists. Each script is accompanied by an interview and critical essay by scholars across a range of interdisciplinary fields.

''Black. Queer. Southern. Women—An Oral History'' is a forthcoming text examining the experiences of black women who love other women and live in the US South. In this text, Johnson employed similar methods (ethnographic oral history) as he did in ''Sweet Tea''.

==Creative scholarship==

===''Sweet Tea—The Play'' ===
Inspired to present a more comprehensive version of ''Sweet Tea'' and the men that Johnson interviewed, in 2006 he created a solo [[Reader’s Theater|Reader's Theater]] performance, called ''Pouring Tea: Black Gay Men of the South Tell Their Tales'', based on selected stories of the men that he interviewed.

Alexander]] was a senior adviser to the [[Barack Obama]] [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] and a member of the president-elect's transition team.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;
After she was born, the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] She was just a toddler when her parents brought her in August 1963 to the [[March on Washington]], site of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s famous ''[[I Have A Dream]]'' speech. Alexander recalled that "Politics was in the drinking water at my house". She also took ballet as a child.&lt;ref name="Biography Today, pp.10" /&gt;

She was educated at [[Sidwell Friends School]], and graduated in 1980. From there she went to [[Yale University]] and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1984. She studied poetry at [[Boston University]] under [[Derek Walcott]] and got her Master's in 1987. Her mother said to her, "That poet you love, Derek Walcott, is teaching at Boston University. Why don't you apply?" Alexander originally entered studying fiction writing, but Walcott looked at her diary and saw the poetry potential. Alexander said, "He gave me a huge gift. He took a cluster of words and he lineated it. And I saw it."&lt;ref name="Biography Today, pp.10"&gt;"Biography Today", p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, she received her PhD in English from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. While she was finishing her degree, she taught at nearby [[Haverford College]] from 1990 to 1991.

===2009 U.S. presidential inauguration===
On January 20, 2009, at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|presidential inauguration of Barack Obama]], Alexander recited her poem "[[Praise Song for the Day]]", which she had composed for the occasion.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;&lt;ref name=yal/&gt; She became only the fourth poet to read at an American presidential inauguration, after [[Robert Frost]] in 1961, [[Maya Angelou]] in 1993 and [[Miller Williams]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael E. Ruane |title=Selection Provides Civil Rights Symmetry |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/17/AR2008121702027.html?wpisrc=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=newsletter |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of her selection was favorably received by her fellow poets [[Maya Angelou]], [[Rita Dove]],&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; [[Paul Muldoon]],&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; and [[Jay Parini]], who extolled her as "smart, deeply educated in the traditions of poetry, true to her roots, responsive to black culture."&lt;ref name=gn/&gt; The [[Poetry Foundation]] also hailed the choice: "Her selection affirms poetry's central place in the soul of our country."&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

Though the selection of the widely unknown poet, who was a personal friend of Obama, was lauded, the actual poem and delivery were met with a poor reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-bd-25-jan25,0,5305166.column | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Big stage amplifies poet's critics | first=Mary | last=Schmich | date=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Chicago Tribune'', the ''Los Angeles Times'' Book editor, and most critics found that "her poem was too much like prose," and that "her delivery [was] insufficiently dramatic." The ''Minneapolis Star-Tribune'' found the poem "dull, 'bureaucratic' and found it proved that "the poet's place is not on the platform but in the crowd, that she should speak not for the people but to them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/politics/37883244.html?page=2&amp;c=y ''Star Tribune''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander wrote of her experience of reading at the inauguration in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in January 2017. Alexander brought her father, who had attended the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], to sit next to her at the inauguration. At the rehearsal for the inauguration, Alexander read [[Gwendolyn Brooks]]'s poem "kitchenette building".&lt;ref name=NewYorkerJan17&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-poets-tale-from-obamas-first-inaugural|title=A Poet's Tale from Obama's first inaugural|date=17 January 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
According to research done by [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], of Harvard University, in 2010 for the PBS series ''[[Faces of America]]'', it was revealed that according to DNA analysis, she is a lineal cousin of another of the guests on the show, [[Stephen Colbert]]. Her paternal grandfather came to the United States in 1918 from [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. On the maternal side, her roots can be traced back 37 generations through notable ancestors, including her 23rd great-grandmother Joan, Princess of England, 24th great-grandparents King John I of England and Clemence, Mistress of the King, and 37th great-grandfather [[Charlemagne]], first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=faces&gt;{{cite episode|title =4|episodelink = |series = Faces of America|serieslink = Faces of America (PBS series)|network = [[PBS]]|airdate = 2010-03-03|season = 1|number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to Ficre Ghebreyesus until his death in April 2012.

'''Florianópolis''' ({{IPA-pt|floɾi.aˈnɔpolis}}) is the capital and second largest city of the state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], in the [[South Region, Brazil|South region]] of [[Brazil]]. The city encompasses [[Santa Catarina Island]] and surrounding small islands, as well as part of the mainland. It has a population of 477,798, according to the 2016 IBGE population estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IBGE :: Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística|url = http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2014/estimativa_dou.shtm|website = www.ibge.gov.br|accessdate = 17 July 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150719095553/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/estimativa2014/estimativa_dou.shtm|archivedate = 19 July 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second most populous city in the state (after [[Joinville]]), and the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|47th in Brazil]]. The metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,111,702, the [[Demography of Brazil|21st largest in the country]].

The economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on [[information technology]], [[tourism]] and services.&lt;ref name="bbcclick"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8284704.stm | title=Brazil's bid for tech-powered economy | work=BBC Click | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=King, Tayfun | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220015005/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8284704.stm | archivedate=20 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has 60 [[beach]]es and is a center of [[surfing]] activity. [[Lagoa da Conceição]] is the most famous area for tourism, recreation, nature and radical sports.

Most of the population lives on the mainland and on the island's central and northern parts. The southern half is less inhabited. Many small commercial fishermen populate the island. The fishing boats, the lacemakers, the folklore, the cuisine and the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial architecture]] contribute to the growing tourism and attracts resources that compensate for the lack of any large industry. Villages immersed in [[Culture of Brazil|tradition]] and [[History of Brazil|history]], such as Santo Antônio de Lisboa and Ribeirão da Ilha still resist the advances of modernity.&lt;ref name="state-magicisland"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sc.gov.br/conteudo/santacatarina/turismo/contrasts/magicisland.html | title=The magic island | publisher=Centro de Informática e Automação do Estado de Santa Catarina | accessdate=3 December 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031103/http://www.sc.gov.br/conteudo/santacatarina/turismo/contrasts/magicisland.html | archivedate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hercílio Luz International Airport]] serves the city. Florianópolis is home to the [[Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina]] (Federal University of Santa Catarina). There are also the [[Santa Catarina Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology]] (Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina), and two campuses of the [[Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina]] (State University of Santa Catarina), among other institutions of higher and professional education.

== Etymology ==
The name Florianópolis was meant to be a tribute to Marshal [[Floriano Peixoto]], the [[List of Presidents of Brazil|second President]] (1891–1894) of the [[First Brazilian Republic|Republic of the United States of Brazil]] and from [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''polis'', meaning "city". Until 1893, the city was called Nossa Senhora do Desterro (Our Lady of Banishment) or simply "Desterro".

==Geography==
===Vegetation===
Florianópolis has a native [[Atlantic Forest]]-type vegetation. This vegetation has an extremely diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. The main [[ecoregion]] is the coastal Atlantic forest, the narrow strip of about 50–100 kilometers (31–62 miles) along the coast which covers about 20 percent of the region. This forests extend as far as 500–600 kilometers (310–372 miles) inland and its range is as high as 2,000 meters above sea level. [[Altitude]] determines at least three vegetation types in the Atlantic Forest: the lowland forest of the coastal plain, montane [[forest]]s, and the high-altitude grassland or "campo rupestre".

The municipality contains part of the {{convert|17104|ha}} offshore [[Marinha do Arvoredo Biological Reserve]], a fully protected conservation unit established in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Portuguese |title=Unidade de Conservação: Reserva Biológica Marinha do Arvoredo|publisher=MMA: Ministério do Meio Ambiente |url=http://sistemas.mma.gov.br/cnuc/index.php?ido=relatorioparametrizado.exibeRelatorio&amp;relatorioPadrao=true&amp;idUc=214 |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also contains part of the {{convert|84130|ha}} [[Serra do Tabuleiro State Park]], a mountainous area covered in lush forests.
The park protects the sources of the [[Vargem do Braço River|Vargem do Braço]], [[Cubatão River (south Santa Catarina)|Cubatão]] and [[Una River (Santa Catarina)|Una]] rivers, which supply most of the drinking water for greater Florianópolis and the south coast region.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Parque Estadual da Serra do Tabuleiro – FATMA}}|language=Portuguese|title=Parque Estadual da Serra do Tabuleiro|publisher=FATMA: Fundação do meio Ambiente|url=http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-da-serra-do-tabuleiro|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510084252/http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-da-serra-do-tabuleiro|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The municipality contains the {{convert|1,532|ha}} [[Rio Vermelho State Park]] in the northeast of [[Santa Catarina Island]], created in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=pt|ref={{harvid|Parque Estadual do Rio Vermelho – FATMA}}|title=Parque Estadual do Rio Vermelho|publisher=FATMA: Fundação do Meio Ambiente|url=http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-do-rio-vermelho|accessdate=2017-01-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120233041/http://www.fatma.sc.gov.br/conteudo/parque-estadual-do-rio-vermelho|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precipitation===
There is significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] which is well distributed throughout the year. The annual normal precipitation for the period of 1961 through 1990 was {{convert|1517.8|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name=INMET /&gt; There is no dry season, and summer generally is the rainiest season. Increased [[rainfall]] occurs from January to March, with a median of {{convert|160|mm|in}} per month, and from April to December there is somewhat less precipitation, averaging {{convert|100|mm|in}} per month. The driest months are from June to August.

===Climate===
Florianópolis experiences a warm [[humid subtropical climate]], falling just short of a true [[tropical climate]]. The seasons of the year are distinct, with a well-defined summer and winter, and characteristic [[weather]] for [[autumn]] and spring. Due to the proximity of the sea, the relative [[humidity]] of the [[atmosphere]] is 80% on average.

The maximum [[temperature]]s of the hottest month varies from {{convert|25|°C|°F}} to {{convert|38.8|°C|°F}} and the minimum temperatures are from {{convert|6|°C|°F}} to {{convert|11|°C|°F}}. The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|0.7|°C|°F}} in September 1980 while the highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38.8|°C|°F}} in February 1973.&lt;ref name=INMET /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Florianopolis-Desterro.JPG|thumb|right|The [[city]] in 1847]]

[[File:Fortaleza Sao Jose-Florianopolis-Brasil.JPG|thumb|right|São José [[fortress]]]]
[[File:Edificação Colonial Florianópolis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colony|Colonial]] [[house]]]]
[[File:Florianopolis historic center.jpg|thumb|right|Historic Center of Florianópolis]]
Carijós Indians, a [[Tupi people]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} were the first inhabitants{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} of Florianópolis area. The traces of its presence are verified through archaeological sites and [[sambaquis]] dating up to 4000 years ago. The Indians called the place Meiembipe or "mountain along the channel".

Around 1514 the [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] landed and gave the area the name Ilha dos Patos, but in 1526 it was renamed Ilha de Santa Catarina ([[Saint Catherine Island]]). The area supplied the vessels that went to the River Plate (Río de la Plata) Basin.

The official settlement of the [[island]] began in 1673 with the arrival of [[bandeirante]] Francisco Dias Velho's agricultural company and it continued in 1678 with the construction of a [[chapel]] consecrated to Nossa Senhora do Desterro. At this time a villa began to take form, slowly becoming a [[Colony|colonial]] settlement.

To guarantee its domain the [[Portuguese Crown]] elevated Santa Catarina Island to the category of village in 1714 with the name of Nossa Senhora do Desterro and already in 1726 they promoted it again, now to the category of [[town]].

From this date on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port began to have a strategic function because it was situated halfway between [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Buenos Aires]], possibly two of the largest seaside cities of [[South America]] at that time. For this reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive seaside defensive ring of [[Southern Brazil]] started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul [[fortress]]es.

With the coming of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy]] the population began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of [[Azores]] and from [[Madeira Island]]. The development of the agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation.
In 1823, during the monarchy which ended in 1889, Desterro became the Capital of Santa Catarina Province opening a period of prosperity with many urban works and also intense [[politic]]al [[organization]].

Regional elites not happy with the government centralization staged the Revolta Federalista ([[Federalist Riograndense Revolution|Federalist Revolt]]) at the beginning of the [[Brazilian Republic]]. The movement that started in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] spread to Santa Catarina and turned Desterro into the Federalist Capital of the Republic. The then president of Brazil, Marechal [[Floriano Peixoto]], known as Iron Marshal, suppressed the rebellion and ordered the shooting of many people who were considered enemies of the state, in the Anhatomirim Island Fortress. Possibly to show loyalty to the marshal, 1893 saw the change of the state [[Capital (political)|capital]]'s name: from Desterro to Florianópolis, that is to say, city of Floriano.

==Demographics==
[[File:Costanera de Florianópolis.jpg|thumb|right|Beira Mar Avenue in Florianopolis]]

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] of 2007, there were 406,564 people residing in the city (in 2010 IBGE reports a population of 421,203). The population density was {{convert|928|PD/sqkm}}. The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 366,000 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (90.0%), 37,000 [[Brown people#Pardos in Brazil|Brown]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (9.0%), 4,000 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (1.0%), 400 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] or [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.1%).&lt;ref name="placeinthesouth"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aplaceinthesouth.com/page6/page6.html | title=Florianopolis | publisher=A Place in the South | date=11 May 2008 | accessdate=3 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301000045/http://aplaceinthesouth.com/page6/page6.html|archivedate=1 March 2009}}{{circular reference|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florianópolis has a [[population]] mostly composed of Brazilians of [[European Brazilian|European descent]]. The numbers of immigrants started to increase in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists from the [[Azores Islands]]. The population of Florianópolis was composed mainly of Portuguese/Azoreans, Germans, and Italians. Further south, some neighborhoods preserve their [[rural]] [[village]] identity. The cultural heritage left by their Azorean ancestors is noticeable in their manner of speaking, in handicrafts, and traditional festivities.

The small [[village]] of Santo António de Lisboa (Saint Anthony of Lisbon) is an example of colonial period architecture and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the [[Capital (political)|capital]], the inhabitants still speak the [[Azorean]] [[dialect]] which is difficult to understand at first. In Ribeirão da Ilha is the church of Our Lady of Lapa do Ribeirão, built in 1806. Lagoa da Conceição, with its many sand dunes, restaurants and seaside night life and where women make lace to sell in the street, has also managed to retain many traces of its colonial [[architecture]].&lt;ref name="VisiteFloripa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visitefloripa.com.br/cultura_acoriana.php | title=Cultura Açoriana | publisher=Visite Floripa | accessdate=3 December 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105000011/http://www.visitefloripa.com.br/cultura_acoriana.php | archivedate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side, the city has taken on a cosmopolitan air with the arrival of Brazilians from other states and [[alien (law)|foreigners]] who chose to live there. The island, which at the beginning of the colonization period, was an important whale hunting centre, is today a technological pole of the IT industry. A State Capital of interest to [[tourism]], Florianópolis is currently inhabited by about 400,000 people. The metro area has about 980,000 people.

==Economy==

[[File:Beach off Florianópolis, 3 January 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Beach in Florianópolis]]
[[File:Baía Sul de Florianópolis.jpg|thumb|right|South bay in the city]]
[[File:Joaquina centro.JPG|thumb|right|Joaquina Beach]]
According to 2002 Sefaz statistics, [[Agriculture|agricultural activities]] represented 0.05%, [[manufacturing]] represented 3.41% and the sector of the [[commerce]] and [[service (economics)|service]] 96.54%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/portal/pmf/cidade/perfildeflorianopolis/ Economy of Florianópolis – City Hall Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610094320/http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/portal/pmf/cidade/perfildeflorianopolis/ |date=10 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is one of the staples of Florianópolis' [[economy]]. Many inhabitants and [[tourist]]s consider Floripa to have a singular beauty endowed with strong lines of Azorean culture, observed in the buildings, workmanship, [[folklore]], [[Cuisine|culinary]] and religious traditions. Its environmental restrictions on building and commercial development have been more or less strictly enforced, helping it to keep its original character.

Between 1970 and 2004, Florianópolis's population tripled. But the local [[economy]] grew fivefold, and [[income]]s grew in step. Opportunity seekers, urban and rural, white collar and blue, poured in. While many Brazilian cities are struggling to graduate from smokestacks to services, Florianópolis is succeeding. Thanks in part to a federal rule that for decades barred heavy [[industry]] on the island, town elders focused on cleaner [[public works]] which led to the founding of several public and private universities that make this one of the most scholarly cities in Brazil.

To meet the demands of its [[academic]] crowd, the city invested heavily in everything from roads to schools, and now Florianópolis ranks high on every development measure, from [[literacy]] (97 percent) to [[electrification]] (near 100 percent). By the late 1990s, private companies were flocking to the [[island]], or emerging from a [[technology]] "[[wiktionary:Incubator|incubator]]" at the federal university. (Among the innovations it hatched: the [[DRE voting machine|computerized voting]] machines that have made [[Brazilian elections]] fraud-free and efficient). Local officials now say their aim is to be the [[Silicon Valley]] of Brazil, with beaches.&lt;ref name="siliconvalley"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.terra.com.br/istoedinheiro/146/ecommerce/com146_01.htm | title=Florianópolis - A ilha da tecnologia - Região ganha status de Vale do Silício brasileiro | work=Dinheiro na Web | accessdate=3 December 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030406030643/http://www.terra.com.br/istoedinheiro/146/ecommerce/com146_01.htm | archivedate=6 April 2003|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its white sand beaches, Florianópolis offers many historical attractions, including the sites of the original Azorean colonists, the Lagoa da Conceição [[lagoon]], and Santo Antônio de Lisboa. Tourism in Florianópolis has grown significantly over the past 10 years, with increasing numbers of visitors coming from other large cities in Brazil (particularly [[Porto Alegre]], [[Curitiba]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]) as well as other South American countries (particularly Argentina, with direct flights offered daily from [[Buenos Aires]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/portal/pmf/cidade/perfildeflorianopolis/#d Brazilians and Argentines in Floripa – City Hall Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204053920/http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/portal/pmf/cidade/perfildeflorianopolis/#d |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past several years, a greater number of international tourists have also begun to frequent the island (particularly from [[Europe]] and the United States).  As the number of visitors grows each year, Florianopolis faces the ongoing challenge of ensuring that its limited infrastructure and resources are updated to adequately accommodate them. Of particular concern are the sewers, which often drain directly into the ocean, polluting the very beaches that attract so many visitors.

During the past decade technology and software development firms also experienced strong growth, and today [[Information Technology]] services are one of the top revenue generators in Florianópolis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/portal/pmf/cidade/perfildeflorianopolis/#d Information Technology in Floripa – City Hall Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204053920/http://www.pmf.sc.gov.br/portal/pmf/cidade/perfildeflorianopolis/#d |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several technology centers are spread around Florianópolis, making the city an important pole in this economic sector.

The [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] for the city was R$6,259,393,000 (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf | title=GDP | publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] | accessdate=18 July 2007 | year=2005 | format=PDF | location=Florianópolis, Brazil | language=Portuguese | isbn=85-240-3919-1 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024524/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf | archivedate=2 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[per capita income]] for the city was R$15,776 (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf | title=per capita income | publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] | accessdate=18 July 2007 | year=2005 | format=PDF | location=Florianópolis, Brazil | language=Portuguese | isbn=85-240-3919-1 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024524/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf | archivedate=2 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florianópolis is one of the most visited places in Brazil as it is an island with 42 beaches, lagoons and waterfalls.

'''[[Lagoa da Conceição]]''' (Lagoon of Conceição) is the largest lagoon on the island of Florianopolis (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pureviagem.com.br/noticia/turismo-em-florianopolis-saiba-que-fazer-na-ilha-de-santa-catarina_a3859/1|title=Turismo em Florianópolis: saiba o que fazer na ilha de Santa Catarina|author=|date=|website=pureviagem.com.br|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827165354/http://www.pureviagem.com.br/noticia/turismo-em-florianopolis-saiba-que-fazer-na-ilha-de-santa-catarina_a3859/1|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most visited area of the island by foreign travelers and backpackers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The area has the highest concentration of restaurants, bars, organic markets and shops. Many expats and Brazilian people from other cities choose to live by the lagoon because of its stunning views, safety, nature and quality of life.

The lagoon is surrounded by mountains and has a canal linking to the ocean. The history of the region around the lagoon is a plus with all the folklore, netting tradition, old Portuguese architecture, graffiti, and an 18th-century church on the top of the hill. See panoramic view below.

The Holy Spirit Feast (''Festa do Divino'') is a festival that takes place 40 days after Easter. The celebration dates to the colonial era and includes a parade, music, and [[street food]].

'''Praia Mole''' (Mole Beach)
One of the most famous beaches is Praia Mole, close to the Lagoon of Conceição and noted for its rolling green hills and rock formations on either side. The beach is mostly known for surfing, eco-friendly lounges and LGBTQ scene during the summer. The beach is one of the locations for the ASP World Tour of the [[Association of Surfing Professionals]], which classifies 50 competitors, among professionals and amateurs.  The state of Santa Caterina is the only location in South America for this [[surfing]] event.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. [[Santa Catarina Art Museum]] is located in the city.

'''Joaquina Beach''' (''Praia da Joaquina'')
Became internationally famous in the 1970s, when [[surfer]]s from around the world discovered its waves. Joaquina Beach is accessible from the Lagoon of Conceição.  Many surf cups began to emerge, and great Catarinense surfing personalities. It is one of the beaches that offers the best tourist facilities, receiving a large number of tourists from around Brazil and the world on the warm days in spring and summer. The rock complex situated to the left of the beach, the night lighting and the public showers are some of the trademarks at Joaquina. There is a big paid parking lot, toilets, tourist coach parking lot, lifeguards, police station, handicraft shop, bars, restaurant and hotels. In addition to the beach, it is possible to enjoy the most famous dunes in the South of the country as well as to sand board. The boards used in this sport can be rented on the spot.

'''[[Barra da Lagoa]]'''
Barra da Lagoa is a quaint fisherman's village but the physical characteristics of the beach make it the perfect place to learn to surf. It is a cove on the Eastern part of the island and stretches into Moçambique beach for {{convert|15|km|mi}}. It is in a natural setting as there are no huge hotels on the beach and the Southern headquarters of [[Projeto TAMAR]] (Save the [[Turtle]]s) is located here. Penguins swim into the canal and near the beach of Barra da Lagoa during the colder winter months of June, July and August. The canal at Barra da Lagoa connects the [[Lagoa da Conceição]] with the open sea. It is not uncommon to see fishermen during the night tossing their nets in the lagoa to catch shrimp they sell to the fresh fish restaurants in this [[community]].

'''[[Praia dos Ingleses|Ingleses Beach]]''' (''Praia dos Ingleses'')
Even though it is a beach preferred by tourists, Ingleses still keeps to the traditions of the [[Azorian]] colonizers. In the [[summer]], it is one of the top beach destinations of Argentine tourists, second only to Canasveiras. In the [[winter]], mullet fishing, religious celebrations and regional festivities are beautiful demonstrations of the local culture. The dunes separating the Ingleses Beach (English Beach) from the Santinho Beach are [[natural]] attractions not to be missed. The practice of sand board is quite common there, a sport created in Florianópolis, which consists of sliding down the dunes on a board, engaging or not in radical manoeuvres. To practice it, one must have a lot of balance and rent a board. Those looking for a different outing can go on a trek of {{convert|4|km|mi}} over the dunes.

'''Armação Beach''' (''Praia da Armação'')
The Sant'Anna Church, built by the Armação fishing company, is part of the beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and attended the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go down to the [[beach]] to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited [[island]]s around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds one of the most important archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses from destruction.

'''[[Campeche (Florianópolis)|Campeche Beach]]''' (''Praia do Campeche'')
With {{convert|5|km|mi}} of white sands and a turbulent waters, Campeche is considered the Jeffreys Bay of the Santa Catarina Island for the quality of its waves. For those who are not interested in surfing, the beach offers other attractions. The paradisaical beauty of Ilha do Campeche, for instance, located across from the beach, a [[association football|football]] game on the Saint-Exupéry [[aviation]] field, or even fishing, are some of the leisure alternatives. At [[night]], Campeche is also an excellent attraction. The huge reflector that illuminates part of the large sand strip in front of the bars only contributes to the partying that extends far into the night. The [[Lighting|illumination]] favours both those who enjoy the merrymaking as well as the [[fishermen]], who use the time to drag their nets in from the [[sea]].

'''Santinho Beach''' (''[[:pt:Praia do Santinho|Praia do Santinho]]'')  is mainly sought by tourists who look for nature, the location's paradisaical beauty and tranquility. Surfers are the main visitors and consider Santinho to be the best beach in the North of the Santa Catarina Island. It is in the left hand corner, where bathers do not venture, that surfers practice their sport, sharing the space with fishermen. {{convert|40|km|mi}} away from the centre of Florianópolis, another great attraction of this beach are the primitive inscriptions made by hunters, fishermen and collectors inhabiting the Island five thousand years ago. The name Santinho comes from a human figure engraved on an isolated block of rock.

Outdoor sports, including [[Underwater diving|diving]], [[hang gliding]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[paragliding]], and [[mountain biking]], as well as surfing, are popular on the island.

The island is connected to the Continent by three bridges. The [[Hercílio Luz Bridge]] that was built in 1926, this bridge is 11 years older than [[Golden Gate Bridge]], but is now closed to traffic; it is a symbol of the island and often appears on postcard images. The Colombo Sales Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge are the ones open to traffic.

Santo Amaro da Imperatriz was the first thermal water facility in Brazil. Hotels with [[thermal bath]] facilities are located in the district of Caldas da Imperatriz and in the city of Águas Mornas. The Fonte Caldas da Imperatriz city baths are an additional source of thermal waters, which can reach the temperature of {{convert|39|°C|°F}}, where there are immersion baths and hydromassage. It is located on the Estrada Geral Highway, km 4, Caldas da Imperatriz district.

==Areas of the city==
[[File:Florianopolis market west towers.jpg|thumb|right|Public Market]]
The centre of Florianópolis, with its alleys, rows of typical [[house]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[museum]]s, contains many examples of colonial [[architecture]]. Among these are the former government palace, nowadays the [[Cruz e Souza]] Museum (which took its name from the famous poet from Santa Catarina who formed the symbolist movement) and the Public Market built in 1898 which sells food and local [[handicraft]]s under the shade of a one-hundred-year-old fig tree. Close to the centre is the house where [[Victor Meirelles]] was born, one of the authors who devised the first mass spoken in Brazil. The building is registered by the Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage and houses the Victor Meirelles Museum.

Roughly saying, the [[island]] can be divided in two sectors: in the north is the most visited side by [[tourist]]s and because of that, the busiest and with the best services infrastructure. In some quarters notice a strong influence in the population architecture and customs. The most ancient livers of Florianópolis still have in the way they speak, in the craftwork activities and in the popular parties, the heritage left by [[Immigration to Brazil|immigrants]] from [[Portugal|Portuguese islands]] from [[Azores]]. The south of the island preserved intensely [[Azorean]] [[customs]] that arrived there from the 18th century.&lt;ref name="cityhistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guiafloripa.com.br/ | title=A Cidade - História | work=Guia Floripa | accessdate=4 December 2014 | language=Portuguese | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208183622/http://www.guiafloripa.com.br/ | archivedate=8 December 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International airport===
Florianópolis is served by [[Hercílio Luz International Airport]] for both domestic and international flights.&lt;ref name="infraero-fln"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/aeroportos/santa-catarina/aeroporto-internacional-de-florianopolis.html | title=Aeroporto Internacional de Florianópolis/Hercílio Luz | publisher=Infraero | accessdate=3 December 2014 | language=Portuguese | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132800/http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/aeroportos/santa-catarina/aeroporto-internacional-de-florianopolis.html | archivedate=28 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the leading airports in Brazil for [[Air charter|charter flights]], especially during the summer months and from destinations such as [[Santiago de Chile]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], besides domestic routes. The traffic has grown significantly at the airport and therefore the city plans to upgrade and expand the airport so that 2.7 million passengers can be accommodated annually.
The architectural design of the expansion was chosen by a public competition held by [[Infraero]] in partnership with the Brazilian Architects Institute (IAB).
Among the over 150 original entries, the proposal of São Paulo architect Mário Bizelli was chosen. Normally the projects for expansion and modernization of the 66 airports administered by Infraero are done by public tender based on the needs, criteria and conditions presented by the company's engineering area.
On days when one of the two the local football (soccer) teams plays at home in a stadium near the airport, traffic comes to a complete standstill, often preventing vehicles from departing the airport itself. People with departing flights are well advised to check the local football schedule to ensure they arrive at the airport on time.

Florianópolis, since the beginning of the 20th century has a tradition in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. By the middle of that century the sport was growing in Brazil and the city had a big influence on it. But, with the decline of the sport in the country by the late 1980s, the investment slowed and by today is almost none. But is still served with three great schools, Riachuelo Remo, Martinelli Remo and Aldo Luz Remo, with all three being placed between [[Hercilio Luz bridge|Hercílio Luz Bridge]], Colombo Salles Bridge and Pedro Ivo Campos Bridge. Since the beginning of 2008 the sport is watching a rapid growing in the number of rowers, even with people flocking from other cities to experience Floripa's rowing.

Florianópolis is the hometown of tennis player [[Gustavo Kuerten]]. There are various opportunities to practice [[yoga]] in Florianopolis with studios that host international yoga retreats and provide teacher-training courses.

== History ==
The cultural landscape was firstly discovered by local miner in 1939-40.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape.

Djafarzad, who analyzed approximately 750 rocks with more than 3.500 petroglyphs in 1947 and onwards. Later on, F. Muradova and J. Rustamov made new discoveries of more than 1.500 images. Those archeological excavations were supported by the Institute of Archeological and Ethnography of the National Academy of Science of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1966, 1988 and 2001, all discoveries of rock carvings and images were taken under state protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Gérard Genette''' (7 June 1930 – 11 May 2018) was a [[France|French]] [[literary theory|literary theorist]], associated in particular with the [[structuralism|structuralist]] movement and such figures as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], from whom he adapted the concept of ''[[bricolage]]''.

==Life==
Genette was born in [[Paris]], where he studied at the [[Lycée Lakanal]] and the [[École Normale Supérieure]], [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="PKLM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2018/05/11/le-theoricien-de-la-litterature-gerard-genette-est-mort_5297715_3382.html|title=Le théoricien de la littérature Gérard Genette est mort|last=Kéchichian|first=Patrick|date=11 May 2018|work=Le Monde|language=French|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the [[French Communist Party]], Genette was a member of [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] during 1957–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabler |first=Andrea |title =Arbeitsanalyse und Selbstbestimmung Zur Bedeutung und Aktualität von Socialisme ou Barbarie | url =http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/diss/2008/gabler/gabler.pdf | year = 2006| accessdate = 2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his professorship in French literature at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1967.

In 1970 with [[Hélène Cixous]] and [[Tzvetan Todorov]] he founded the journal ''Poétique''&lt;ref name="PKLM"/&gt; and he edited a series of the same name for [[Éditions du Seuil]].

Among other positions, Genette was research director at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]]&lt;ref name ="harari"&gt;{{cite book | last=Harari|first=Josue | title=Textual Strategies | publisher=University Paperbacks| year=1980|isbn=0-416-73750-1 |pages=43–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a visiting professor at [[Yale University]].

==Work==
Genette is largely responsible for the reintroduction of a [[rhetoric]]al vocabulary into literary criticism, for example such terms as [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]] and [[metonymy]]. Additionally his work on narrative, best known in English through the selection ''[[Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method]]'', has been of importance.&lt;ref name="harari" /&gt; His major work is the multi-part ''Figures'' series, of which ''Narrative Discourse'' is a section. His trilogy on [[textual transcendence]], which has also been quite influential, is composed of ''Introduction à l'architexte'' (1979), ''[[Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree]]'' (1982), and ''Paratexts. Thresholds of Interpretation'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Macksey, Richard (1997) ''Foreword'' to Genette ''Paratexts'', p.xiii, note 3&lt;/ref&gt;

His international influence is not as great as that of some others identified with structuralism, such as Roland Barthes and Claude Lévi-Strauss; his work is more often included in selections or discussed in secondary works than studied in its own right. Terms and techniques originating in his vocabulary and systems have, however, become widespread, such as the term [[paratext]] for prefaces, introductions, illustrations or other material accompanying the text, or [[hypotext]] for the sources of the text.

==Important concepts in Genette's narratology==
This outline of Genette's [[narratology]] is derived from ''Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method''. This book forms part of his multi-volume work ''Figures I-III''.  The examples used in it are mainly drawn from Proust's epic ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.  One criticism  which had been used against previous forms of narratology was that they could deal only with simple stories, such as [[Vladimir Propp]]'s work in ''[[Morphology of the Folk Tale]]''. If narratology could cope with Proust, this could no longer be said.

Below are the five main concepts used by Genette in ''Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method''.  They are primarily used to look at the syntax of narratives, rather than to perform an interpretation of them.

===Order===
Say a story is narrated as follows: the clues of a murder are discovered by a detective (event A); the circumstances of the murder are finally revealed (event B); and lastly the murderer is caught (event C).

Add corresponding numbers to the lettered events that represent their order chronologically: 1, 2, and 3.

If these events were described chronologically, they would run B1, A2, C3.  
Arranged in the text, however, they run A2 (discovery), B1 (flashback), C3 (resolution).

This accounts for the 'obvious' effects the reader will recognise, such as flashback.  It also deals with the structure of narratives on a more systematic basis, accounting for flash-forward, simultaneity, as well as possible, if rarely used, effects.  These disarrangements on the level of order are termed 'anachrony'.

===Frequency===
The separation between an event and its narration allows several possibilities.

*An event can occur once and be narrated once (singular).
** 'Today I went to the shop.'
*An event can occur n times and be narrated once (iterative).
** 'I used to go to the shop.'
*An event can occur once and be narrated n times (repetitive).
** 'Today I went to the shop' + 'Today he went to the shop' etc.
*An event can occur n times and be narrated n times (multiple).
** 'I used to go to the shop' + 'He used to go to the shop' + 'I went to the shop yesterday' etc.

===Duration===
The separation between an event and its narration means that there is [[discourse time]] and [[narrative time]].  These are the two main elements of duration.

*"Five years passed", has a lengthy narrative time, five years, but a short discourse time (it only took a second to read).
*James Joyce's novel ''Ulysses'' has a relatively short narrative time, twenty-four hours.  Not many people, however, could read ''Ulysses'' in twenty-four hours.  Thus it is safe to say it has a lengthy discourse time.

===Voice===
Voice is concerned with who narrates, and from where.  This can be split four ways.

*Where the narration is from
** Intra-diegetic: inside the text. e.g. Wilkie Collins' ''The Woman in White''
** Extra-diegetic: outside the text. e.g. Thomas Hardy's ''Tess of the D'Urbervilles''
*Is the narrator a character in the story?
** Hetero-diegetic: the narrator is not a character in the story.  e.g. Homer's ''The Odyssey''
** Homo-diegetic: the narrator is a character in the story.  e.g. Emily Brontë's ''Wuthering Heights''

===Mood===
Genette said narrative mood is dependent on the 'distance' and 'perspective' of the narrator, and like music, narrative mode has predominant patterns. It is related to voice.

Distance of the narrator changes with narrated speech, transposed speech and reported speech.

Perspective of the narrator is called [[focalization]].  Narratives can be non-focalized, internally focalized or externally focalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Genette, |first=G  |year=1980 |chapter=4 |title=Mode |work=Narrative Discourse |pages=161–211|location=New York |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-9259-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hammer and sickle red on transparent.svg|thumb|150px|A red hammer and sickle, in the shape it appeared (in gold) on the [[Soviet Union]]'s flag from 1955 to 1991]] 
The '''hammer and sickle''' is a symbol of proletarian solidarity that was first adopted – as {{lang-ru|серп и мо́лот|translit=serp i mólot}}: "sickle and hammer" – during the [[Russian Revolution]]. At the time of its creation, the [[hammer]] stood for the [[Industrial workers|industrial working class]] and the [[sickle]] for the [[peasant]]ry—combined they stood for the worker-peasant alliance for [[socialism]].  The sickle symbol resembles a sickle used to harvest grain crops and the hammer is one that would be used to make a razor sharp edge on a sickle or scythe.

After [[World War I]] (from which [[Russian Empire|Russia]] withdrew in the year 1917) and the [[Russian Civil War]], the hammer and sickle became more widely used as a symbol for peaceful labor within the [[Soviet Union]] and for international [[Proletariat|proletarian]] unity. It was taken up by many [[History of communism|communist movements]] around the world, some with local variations. Today, even after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the hammer and sickle remains commonplace in [[Russia]] and other [[Post-Soviet states|former union republics]], but its display is prohibited in some other former Communist countries as well as in countries where [[Communism]] is [[Bans on Communist symbols|banned]] by law.


== History ==
[[File:Peso_Chileno_1933.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[chilean peso]] used the hammer and sickle symbol between 1895 and 1940]]

=== Worker symbolism ===
Farm and worker instruments and tools have long been used as symbols for [[Proletariat|proletarian]] struggle.

The combination of hammer and sickle symbolised the combination of farmers and construction workers. One example of use prior to its political instrumentalisation by the Soviet Union is found in [[Chilean peso|Chilean currency]] circulating since 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilean peso design, 1894|url=http://www.moneta-coins.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=598&amp;title=chile-1894-pattern|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative example is the combination of a hammer and a [[plough]], with the same meaning (unity of peasants and workers). In Ireland, the symbol of the plough remains in use. The [[Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] banner was originally used by the [[Irish Citizen Army]], a socialist republican workers' militia. [[James Connolly]], co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with [[Jack White (trade unionist)|Jack White]], said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. A sword is forged into the plough to symbolise the end of war with the establishment of a Socialist International. This was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].

[[File:Starry Plough flag (1914).svg|thumb|150px|The [[Starry Plough (flag)|Plough flag]] from 1914 and flown during the [[Easter Rising]]]]

=== Inception ===
In 1917, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] held a competition to create a Soviet emblem. The winning design was a hammer and sickle on top of a globe in rays of the sun, surrounded by a wreath of grain and under a five-pointed star, with the inscription "[[Workers of the world, unite!|proletariats of the world, unite!]]" in six languages ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]). It originally featured a sword, but Lenin strongly objected, disliking the violent connotations.&lt;ref name="HS Role and Symbolism"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution|url=https://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning designer was [[Yevgeny Ivanovich Kamzolkin]] (1885–1957).&lt;ref&gt;[http://1965tribunal.org/the-spectre-of-hammer-and-sickle/ International People's Tribunal 1965, "The Spectre of Hammer and Sickle"]. {{retrieved|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picture-russia.com/en/painter/582 International Gallery of Contemporary Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816163416/http://www.picture-russia.com/en/painter/582|date=16 August 2016}}. {{retrieved|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 1923, the 2nd session of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] (CIK) adopted this emblem.&lt;ref name="HS Role and Symbolism"/&gt;

=== Usage in the Soviet Union ===
* The [[Coat of Arms of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Coats of Arms of the Soviet Republics]] showed the hammer and sickle, which also appeared on the [[red star]] badge on the uniform cap of the [[Red Army]] uniform and in many other places.
* ''Serp i Molot'' ([[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]] of {{lang-ru|cерп и молот}}, "sickle and hammer") is the name of the [[Moscow Metallurgical Plant]].
* ''Serp i Molot'' is also the name of a stop on the [[electric railway]] line from Kurski [[railway station]] in [[Moscow]] to [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]], featured in [[Venedikt Yerofeyev]]'s novel, ''[[Moscow-Petushki]]''.

[[File:Coat of arms of the Soviet Union 1923–1936.svg|thumb|150px|The first [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]] (1923–1936)]]

== Meaning ==
At the time of creation, the hammer and sickle stood for worker-peasant alliance, with the hammer a traditional symbol of the industrial proletariat (who dominated the proletariat of Russia) and the sickle a traditional symbol for the peasantry, but the meaning has since broadened to a globally recognizable symbol for [[Marxism]], [[communist party|Marxist parties]], or [[socialist state]]s.&lt;ref name="HS Role and Symbolism"/&gt;

In the Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle came to take on a gendered meaning, with the sickle coming to be associated with women and the hammer men.&lt;ref name="HS Role and Symbolism"/&gt;

== Current usage ==
=== Post-Soviet states ===
[[File:Flag of Transnistria (state).svg|thumb|The flag of [[Transnistria]] is based on the flag formerly used by the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]]]
[[File:Flag of Oryol (city).svg|thumb|The flag of [[Oryol]] incorporates the flag formerly used by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]]]
Two federal subjects of the post-Soviet Russian Federation use the hammer and sickle in their symbols: the [[Vladimir Oblast]] has them on its flag and the [[Bryansk Oblast]] has them on its flag and coat of arms, which is also the central element of its flag. In addition, the Russian city of [[Oryol]] also uses the hammer and sickle on its flag.

The former Soviet (now Russian) national airline, [[Aeroflot]], continues to use the hammer and sickle in its symbol.

The hammer and sickle can be found as a logo on most [[ushanka]] hats, usually the Soviet-styled ones

The ''de facto'' government of [[Transnistria]] uses (with minor modifications) the flag and the emblem of the former [[Moldavian SSR]], which includes the hammer and sickle. The flag can also appear without the hammer and sickle in some circumstances, for example on Transnistrian-issued [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]].

=== Communist parties ===
Three out of the five currently ruling Communist parties use a hammer and sickle as the party symbol: the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. All of these use the yellow-on-red colour scheme. In Laos and Vietnam, the hammer and sickle party flags can often be seen flying side-by-side with their respective national flags.

Many communist parties around the world also use it, including the [[Communist Party of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kke.gr/|title=KKE - Αρχική|work=kke.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Communist Party of Chile]], the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], the [[Egyptian Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]], the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]], the [[Communist Party of Denmark]], the [[Communist Party of Norway]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]], the [[Lebanese Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and the [[Shining Path]]. The [[Communist Party (Sweden)|Communist Party of Sweden]], the [[Portuguese Communist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcp.pt/estatutos-do-pcp#cap_13|title=Estatutos do PCP, art. 72|work=pcp.pt/estatutos-do-pcp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Mexican Communist Party]] use the hammer and sickle imposed on the red star. The hammer and sickle accompanied by the yellow star is used by the [[Communist Refoundation Party]], the main communist party in Italy.

== Variations ==
Many symbols having similar structures and messages to the original have been designed. For example, the [[flag of Angola|Angolan flag]] shows a segment of a [[gear|cog]], crossed by a [[machete]] and crowned with a [[red star|socialist star]] while the [[flag of Mozambique]] features an [[AK-47]] crossed by a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. In the logo of the [[Communist Party USA]], a circle is formed by a half cog and a [[Semicircle|semicircular]] sickle-blade. A hammer is laid directly over the sickle's handle with the hammer's [[Hammer#Designs and variations|head]] at the logo's center. The logo of the [[Communist Party of Turkey (current)|Communist Party of Turkey]] consists of half a cog wheel crossed by a hammer, with a star on the top.

Tools represented in other designs include: the [[Ink brush|brush]], sickle and hammer of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]; the [[spade]], [[torch|flaming torch]] and [[quill]] [[Labour Party (UK)#The split under MacDonald|used prior to 1984]] by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (which was a socialist and not a communist party); the [[pickaxe]] and [[rifle]] used in [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|communist Albania]]; and the hammer and [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]] of the [[East Germany|East German]] emblem and flag. The [[Far Eastern Republic]] of Russia used an [[anchor]] crossed over a spade or pickaxe, symbolising the union of the fishermen and miners. The [[Fourth International]], founded by [[Leon Trotsky]], uses a hammer and sickle symbol on which the number 4 is superimposed. The hammer and sickle in the Fourth International symbol are the opposite of other hammer and sickle symbols in that the head of the hammer is on the right side and the sickle end tip on the left. The [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[League for the Fifth International]] merges a hammer with the number 5, using the number's lower arch to form the sickle.

The [[Communist Party of Britain]] (CGB) uses the hammer and [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|dove symbol]]. Designed in 1988 by Michal Boncza, it is intended to highlight the party's connection to the peace movement. It is usually used in conjunction with the hammer and sickle and it appears on all of the CPB's publications. Some members of the CPB prefer one symbol over the other, although the party's 1994 congress reaffirmed the hammer and dove's position as the official emblem of the party. Similarly, the [[Communist Party of Israel]] uses a dove over the hammer and sickle as its symbol. The flag of the [[Guadeloupe Communist Party]] uses a sickle, turned to look like a [[capital letters|majuscule G]], to represent [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/gp%7Dpcg.html|title=Parti Communiste Guadeloupéen|work=flagspot.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag of the [[Black Front]], a [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] group founded by early Nazi Party members and expelled around the time of the [[Night of the Long Knives]] purge, along with his supporters and the [[Sturmabteilung]] and originator of the ideology and the Black Front himself [[Otto Strasser]], featured a crossed hammer and sword, symbolizing the unity of the workers and military.

The [[flag of Burma]] (from 1974–2010) featured a bushel of [[rice]] superimposed on a [[cogwheel]].

The flag of [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, Party of the Revolution in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]), currently the ruling political party of [[Tanzania]], has a slightly different symbol with a hammer and a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] (''jembe'') instead of a sickle to represent the most common farm tool in Africa.

The [[National Bolshevik Party]] used the hammer and sickle in their flag, but colored black instead of gold and in a design similar to the [[Nazi flag]], a brighter red flag than the USSR, with a black hammer and sickle on a white disk in the center.

== Art ==
The hammer and sickle has long been a common theme in socialist realism, but it has also seen some depiction in non-Marxist popular culture. [[Andy Warhol]] who created many drawings and photographs of the hammer and sickle is the most famous example of this.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Legal status ==
{{see also|Red star#Legal status|l1=Red star § Legal status|Bans on Communist symbols}}
In several countries in the former [[Eastern Bloc]], there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a "[[totalitarian]] and criminal ideology" and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence.

A similar law was considered in [[Estonia]], but it eventually failed in a parliamentary committee.

The foreign ministers of [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and the [[Czech Republic]] called for a [[European Union]]-wide ban on communist symbols in 2010, urging the European Union "to criminalize the approval, denial or belittling of communist crimes" and stating that "the denial of such crimes should be treated the same way as the denial of the Holocaust and must be banned by law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/politics/european-commission-communist-crimes/|title=EU refuses to ban denial of communist crimes|work=RT English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] annulled the ban on the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships, including the hammer and sickle, the red star and the swastika, saying the ban was too broad and imprecise. The court also pointed to a judgement of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in which Hungary was found guilty of violation of [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 10]], the right to [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungary, hammer and sickle ban declared illegal|url=http://www.ansa.it/nuova_europa/en/news/sections/news/2013/02/24/visualizza_new.html_1844118137.html|publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the [[Constitutional Court of Moldova]] ruled that the [[Moldovan Communist Party]]’s symbols—the hammer and sickle—are legal and can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Constitutional Court rules that 'hammer and sickle' can be used|url=http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249056313.html|work=allmoldova.com|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=12 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112194049/http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249056313.html|archivedate=12 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], the public display of communist symbols like the hammer and sickle is banned by decree following the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966|1965–1966 killings of communists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artists summoned over communist symbol exhibition|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/10/20/artists-summoned-over-communist-symbol-exhibition.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026114133/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/10/20/artists-summoned-over-communist-symbol-exhibition.html|archivedate=26 October 2008|deadurl=yes|author=Dickie Christanto|publisher=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=20 October 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being banned, the symbols are also highly [[Social stigma|stigmatized]], similar to [[Nazi symbolism]] in the West.

In [[Poland]], dissemination of items which are "mediums of fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbolism" was criminalized in 1997. However, the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] found this sanction to be unconstitutional in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trybunal.gov.pl/rozprawy/komunikaty-prasowe/komunikaty-po/art/2628-nowelizacja-kodeksu-karnego/s/k-1110/|title=Nowelizacja kodeksu karnego.|language=pl|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this treatment of the symbolism, promotion of fascist, communist and other ideology deemed totalitarian remains illegal.

A ban on the Hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols is currently also being considered in [[Brazil]], the bill was introduced in 2016 but it has yet to be voted in Congress.

'''Isfahan''' (historically also rendered in English as '''Ispahan''', '''Sepahan''', '''Esfahan'''  or '''Hispahan''') ({{lang-fa|اصفهان|Esfahān}} {{IPA-fa|esfæˈhɒːn||Esfahan.ogg}}) is a city in [[Iran]]. It is located {{convert|406|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Tehran]], and is the capital of [[Isfahan Province]].

Isfahan has a population of approximately 1.6 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{URL | 1=worldpopulationreview.com/countries/iran-population/cities | 2="Population of Cities in Iran (2018)." The population of the greater metropolitan area is 5.1 million (2016 Census). }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third largest city in Iran after Tehran and Mashhad. 

Isfahan is an important city as it is located at the intersection of the two principal north–south and east–west routes that traverse Iran. It was once one of the largest cities in the world. It flourished from 1050 to 1722, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries under the [[Safavids|Safavid]] dynasty when it became the capital of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] for the second time in its history. Even today the city retains much of its past glory. It is famous for its Persian–Islamic architecture, having many beautiful boulevards, covered bridges, palaces, mosques, and minarets, and the city also has many historical buildings, monuments, paintings and artefacts. The fame of Isfahan led to the Persian pun and proverb "''Esfahān nesf-e- jahān ast''": Isfahan is half (of) the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isfahan Is Half The World |url=//www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/isfahan-is-half-the-world-isfahan-is-half-the-world.html|website=New York Times |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naghsh-e Jahan Square]] in Isfahan is one of the [[List of city squares by size|largest city squares]] in the world. [[UNESCO]] has designated it a [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Isfahan}}

===Etymology ===
:''See also: {{illm|Names of Isfahan|fa|پیشینه نام اصفهان}}''
"Isfahan" is derived from [[Middle Persian]] ''Spahān''. ''Spahān'' is attested in various Middle Persian seals and inscriptions, including that of Zoroastrian Magi [[Kartir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/isfahan-iv-pre-islamic-period |title=Isfahan, Pre-Islamic-Period |date=15 December 2006 |website=Encyclopædia Iranica |access-date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the Armenian name of the city (Սպահան). The present-day name is the Arabicized form of ''Ispahan'' (unlike Middle Persian, and similar to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[New Persian]] does not allow initial consonant clusters such as ''sp''&lt;ref&gt;Strazny, P. (2005). Encyclopedia of linguistics (p. 325). New York: Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;). The region appears with the abbreviation ''GD'' (Southern [[Media (region)|Media]]) on [[Sasanian]] numismatics. In Ptolemy's [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]] it appears as ''Aspadana'', translating to "place of gathering for the army". It is believed that ''Spahān'' derives from ''spādānām'' "the armies", Old Persian plural of ''spāda'' (from which derives ''spāh'' 'army' and [[spahi]] (soldier – lit. ''of the army'') in Middle Persian).

===Prehistory===
Human habitation of the Isfahan region can be traced back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] period. Recent discoveries [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have found [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s dating back to the Palaeolithic, [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron age]]s.

===Zoroastrian era===
What was to become the city of Isfahan in later historical periods probably emerged as a locality and settlement that gradually developed over the course of the [[Elamite civilisation]] (2700–1600 BCE).

Under [[Medes|Median]] rule, this commercial entrepôt began to show signs of a more sedentary urbanism, steadily growing into a noteworthy regional centre that benefited from the exceptionally fertile soil on the banks of the Zayandehrud River in a region called Aspandana or Ispandana.

Once [[Cyrus the Great]] (reg. 559–529 BCE) had unified Persian and Median lands into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (648–330 BCE), the religiously and ethnically diverse city of Isfahan became an early example of the king's fabled religious tolerance. It was Cyrus who, having just taken Babylon, made an edict in 538 BCE, declaring that the Jews in Babylon could return to Jerusalem (see Ezra ch. 1). Now it seems that some of these freed Jews settled in Isfahan instead of returning to their homeland. The 10th-century Persian historian [[Ibn al-Faqih]] wrote:{{blockquote|"When the Jews emigrated from Jerusalem, fleeing from Nebuchadnezzar, they carried with them a sample of the water and soil of Jerusalem. They did not settle down anywhere or in any city without examining the water and the soil of each place. They did all along until they reached the city of Isfahan. There they rested, examined the water and soil and found that both resembled Jerusalem. Thereupon they settled there, cultivated the soil, raised children and grandchildren, and today the name of this settlement is Yahudia."&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Precincts: The Religious Architecture of Non-Muslim Communities Across the Islamic World, Gharipour Mohammad, BRILL, Nov 14, 2014, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] in the period 250–226 BCE continued the tradition of tolerance after the fall of the Achaemenids, fostering the [[Hellenistic]] dimension within Iranian culture and the political organisation introduced by [[Alexander the Great]]'s invading armies. Under the Parthians, [[Arsacid]] governors administered the provinces of the nation from Isfahan, and the city's urban development accelerated to accommodate the needs of a capital city.

[[File:Esfahan scheme middle ages fr.png|thumbnail|Isfahan at the end of the 6th century (top), consisting of two separate areas of Sassanid Jay and Jewish Yahudia. At 11th century (bottom), these two areas are completely merged.]]
The next empire to rule Persia, the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]]s (226–652 CE), presided over massive changes in their realm, instituting sweeping agricultural reform and reviving Iranian culture and the Zoroastrian religion. Both the city and region were then called by the name Aspahan or Spahan. The city was governed by a group called the Espoohrans, who came from seven noble and important Iranian royal families. Extant foundations of some Sassanid-era bridges in Isfahan suggest that the Sasanian kings were fond of ambitious urban planning projects. While Isfahan's political importance declined during the period, many Sassanid princes would study statecraft in the city, and its military role developed rapidly. Its strategic location at the intersection of the ancient roads to [[Susa]] and [[Persepolis]] made it an ideal candidate to house a standing army, ready to march against [[Constantinople]] at any moment. The words 'Aspahan' and 'Spahan' are derived from the Pahlavi or Middle Persian meaning 'the place of the army'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=1752&amp;order_by=title&amp;showdescription=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023052853/http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=1752 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many theories have been mentioned about the origin of Isfahan, in fact little is known of it before the rule of the Sasanian dynasty (c. 224 – c. 651 CE). The historical facts suggest that in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, Queen [[Shushandukht]], the Jewish consort of [[Yazdegerd I]] (reigned 399–420) settled a colony of Jews in Yahudiyyeh (also spelled Yahudiya), a settlement 3&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the Zoroastrian city of Gabae (its Achaemid and Parthian name; Gabai was its Sasanic name, which was shortened to Gay (Arabic 'Jay') that was located on the northern bank of the [[Zayanderud]] River. The gradual population decrease of Gay (Jay) and the simultaneous population increase of Yahudiyyeh and its suburbs after the Islamic conquest of Iran resulted in the formation of the nucleus of what was to become the city of Isfahan. The words "Aspadana", "Ispadana", "Spahan" and "Sepahan", all from which the word Isfahan is derived,  referred to the region in which the city was located.

Isfahan and Gay were both circular in design, a characteristic of Parthian and Sasanian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salma |first1=K.

===Islamic era===

When the Arabs captured Isfahan in 642, they made it the capital of [[al-Jibal]] ("the Mountains") province, an area that covered much of ancient Media. Isfahan grew prosperous under the Persian [[Buyid]] (Buwayhid) dynasty, which rose to power and ruled much of Iran when the temporal authority of the Abbasid caliphs waned in the 10th century. The Turkish conqueror and founder of the [[Seljuq dynasty]], [[Tughril|Toghril Beg]], made Isfahan the capital of his domains in the mid-11th century; but it was under his grandson [[Malik-Shah I]] (r. 1073–92) that the city grew in size and splendour.&lt;ref name="Britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Malik-Shah|title=Britannica.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
After the fall of the Seljuqs (c. 1200), Isfahan temporarily declined and was eclipsed by other Iranian cities such as [[Tabriz]] and [[Qazvin]].

During his visit in 1327, [[Ibn Battuta]] noted that "The city of Isfahan is one of the largest and fairest of cities, but it is now in ruins for the greater part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It regained its importance during the [[Safavid]] period (1501–1736). The city's golden age began in 1598 when the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas I (reigned 1588–1629) made it his capital and rebuilt it into one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the 17th century world. In 1598 [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] moved his capital from [[Qazvin]] to the more central Isfahan; he name it ''Ispahān'' ([[New Persian]]) so that it wouldn't be threatened by the [[Ottomans]]. This new status ushered in a golden age for the [[Abbas I of Persia#Isfahan: a new capital|city]], with architecture and Persian culture flourishing. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of deportees and migrants from the [[Caucasus]], that Abbas and other Safavid rulers had permitted to emigrate en masse, settled in the city. So now the city had enclaves of [[Georgians|Georgian]], [[Circassians|Circassian]], and [[Dagestan|Daghistani]] descent.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/isfahan-vii-safavid-period|title=ISFAHAN vii. SAFAVID PERIOD – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbert Kaempfer, who dwelt in Safavid Persia in 1684–85, estimated their number at 20,000.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt;{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=67}} During the Safavid era, the city contained a very large [[Armenians|Armenian]] community as well.

It is still one of the oldest and largest [[List of Armenian ethnic enclaves|Armenian quarters]] in the world. Following an agreement between Shah Abbas I and his [[Georgians|Georgian]] subject [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti]] ("Tahmuras Khan"), whereby the latter submitted to Safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region’s wāli (governor) and for having his son serve as [[darugha|dāruḡa]] ("prefect") of Isfahan in perpetuity, the Georgian prince converted to Islam and served as governor.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; He was accompanied by a troop of soldiers,&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; some of whom were [[Georgian Orthodox]] Christians.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; The royal court in Isfahan had a great number of Georgian ḡolāms (military slaves), as well as Georgian women.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; Although they spoke both Persian and Turkic, their mother tongue was Georgian.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; During Abbas's reign, Isfahan became very famous in Europe, and many European travellers made an account of their visit to the city, such as [[Jean Chardin]]. This prosperity lasted until it was [[Siege of Isfahan|sacked]] by Afghan invaders in 1722 during a marked decline in Safavid influence.

Thereafter, Isfahan experienced  a decline in importance, culminating in a move of the capital to [[Mashhad]] and [[Shiraz]] during the [[Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] periods respectively, until it was finally moved to [[Tehran]] in 1775 by [[Agha Mohammad Khan]], the founder of the [[Qajar]] dynasty. (See https://www.britannica.com/place/Tehran)

In the early years of the 19th century, efforts were made to preserve some of Ifsahan's archeologically important buildings. The work was started by [[Mohammad Hossein Khan]]  during the reign of [[Fath Ali Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |editor= |authorlink= |title=Iran Almanac and Book of Facts |volume=8 |year=1969 |publisher=Echo Institute |location= |pages=71 |quote= | oclc=760026638 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxJIAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern age===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ISF CC.jpg|thumb|Inside Isfahan City Center]] --&gt;

In the 20th century, Isfahan was resettled by a very large number of people from southern Iran, firstly during the population migrations at the start of the century, and again in the 1980s following the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Today, Isfahan produces fine carpets, textiles, steel, handicrafts, and traditional foods including sweets. There are [[Nuclear reactor|nuclear]] experimental reactors as well as facilities for producing nuclear fuel (UCF) within the environs of the city. Isfahan has one of the largest steel-producing facilities in the region, as well as facilities for producing special alloys. [[Mobarakeh Steel Company]] is the biggest steel producer in the whole of the Middle East and Northern Africa, and it is the biggest [[Direct reduced iron|DRI]] producer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.msc.ir/MSC-at-a-Glance_4039.html|title=MSC at a Glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Esfahan Steel Company|Isfahan Steel Company]] was the first manufacturer of constructional steel products in Iran, and it remains the largest such company today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esfahansteel.com/en-profile|title=Esfahan Steel Company A Pioneer in The Steel Industry of Iran|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has an [[Isfahan International Airport|international airport]] and a [[rapid transit|metro]] line.

There are a major oil refinery and a large airforce base outside the city. [[Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company|HESA]], Iran's most advanced aircraft manufacturing plant, is located just outside the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hesaco.com/contactus.htm Hesaco.com] (from the [[Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company|HESA]] official company website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/hesa.htm|title=HESA Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isfahan is also attracting  international investment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/07/aug/1208.html|title=International conference held on investment opportunities in Iran tourism industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the [[Isfahan City Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfahancitycenter.com|title=صفحه اصلی بزرگترین مرکز خرید ایران|first=IT|last=DEPARTMENT-it@isfahancitycenter.com|publisher=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the largest shopping mall in Iran and the fifth largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfahancitycenter.com/about-iran-shopping-mall|title=About Isfahan City Center|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isfahan hosted the [[International Physics Olympiad]] in 2007.

==Geography and climate==
The city is located in the lush plain of the [[Zayanderud]] River at the foothills of the [[Zagros]] mountain range. The nearest mountain is [[Mount Soffeh]] (Kuh-e Soffeh), just south of the city. No geological obstacles exist within {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} north of Isfahan, allowing cool winds to blow from this direction. Situated at {{convert|1590|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on the eastern side of the Zagros Mountains, Isfahan has an [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk''). Despite its altitude, Isfahan remains hot during the summer, with maxima typically around 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F). However, with low humidity and moderate temperatures at night, the climate is quite pleasant. During the winter, days are mild while nights can be very cold. Snow has occurred at least once every winter except 1986/1987 and 1989/1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irimo.ir/english/monthly&amp;annual/r32.asp |title=Snowy days for Esfahan |publisher=Irimo.ir |accessdate=2012-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005328/http://irimo.ir/english/monthly%26annual/r32.asp |archive-date=26 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zayande River]] starts in the Zagros Mountains, flowing from the west through the heart of the city, then dissipates in the [[:fa:گاوخونی|Gavkhooni]] [[wetland]].

=== Air pollution ===
Air pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Isfahan. Due to an increase in the number of cars in the city, thermal power plants, petrochemical complexes and the oil refinery in the west of the city, air pollution levels have increased markedly in the second half of the 20th century. With the introduction of national environment levels for heavy industry, industrial pollution has been reduced in recent years. However, the air quality in the city is far below world norms. Indeed, Isfahan has the highest air pollution index of all the major cities in Iran. This is thought to be partly due to its climate and geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/82795476|title=چرا آلودگی هوای اصفهان از تهران بیشتر است؟|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth-lighting-summer-solstice EN.png|thumb|right|300px|[[daylight|Illumination]] of [[Earth]] by the [[Sun]] on the day of the June [[solstice]]]]
The '''June solstice''', also known as the '''northern solstice''', is the [[solstice]] on the Earth that occurs each June falling on the 20th to 22nd according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the June solstice is the [[summer solstice]], whilst in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] it is the [[winter solstice]].

==Solar year==
The June solstice solar year is the [[solar year]] based on the June solstice. It is thus the length of time between adjacent June solstices.

In 6000 BC, the December solstice solar year had a length of 50:35 in excess of 365 days and 5 hours. This shortened to 47:55 in 2000 AD. It will remain between 47:45 and 48:00 at least until 10000 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/leap/Solar-Year-Length-Variations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kekova''', also named ''Caravola'' &lt;ref name=bert134&gt;Bertarelli (1929), p.134&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Lycian language|Lycian]]: ''[[Dolichiste]]''), is a small [[Turkey|Turkish]] island near [[Demre]] (Demre is the [[Lycia]]n town of [[Myra]]) district of [[Antalya province]] which faces the villages of [[Kaleköy, Kaş|Kaleköy]] (ancient Simena) and [[Üçağız]] (ancient [[Teimioussa]]). Kekova has an area of {{convert|4.5|km²|0|abbr=on}} and is uninhabited.

==Island==
After the [[Italy|Italian]] occupation of [[Kastelorizo]], Kekova &amp;mdash; which at that time was temporarily inhabited during summer because of wood harvest &lt;ref name=bert134/&gt; &amp;mdash; was disputed between Italy and Turkey. The [[Convention between Italy and Turkey,1932|1932 Convention between Italy and Turkey]] assigned it to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/bilateral/italturc.htm Text of the convention, Art. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

On its northern side there are the partly sunken ruins of ''Dolchiste/Dolikisthe'', an ancient town which was destroyed by an [[earthquake]] during the 2nd century.
Rebuilt and still flourishing during the Byzantine Empire period, it was finally abandoned because of [[Arab]] incursions.
Tersane (meaning "dockyard", as its bay was the site of an ancient city Xera and dockyard, with the ruins of a Byzantine church) is at the northwest of the island.

The Kekova region was declared a specially protected area on 18 January 1990 by  Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forest.  All kinds of diving and swimming were prohibited and subject to special permits from governmental offices.  In later years the prohibition has been lifted except for the part where the sunken city is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/middle-east/sunken-ruins-of-ancient-city-in-turkey-may-soon-be-opened-up-to-explore/news-story/d7863d162369fc91f675cb33c8160bb2|title=Ancient underwater city may be opened for first time in 30 years|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kekova region is {{convert|260|km²|0|abbr=on}} and encompasses the island of Kekova, the villages of [[Kaleköy]] and Üçağız and the four ancient towns of Simena, [[Aperlae]], Dolchiste  and Teimioussa.

[[Kaleköy]] (locally just "Kale") (ancient Simena) is a Lycian site on the Turkish coast.  It is a small village with the partly sunken ruins of Aperlae&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thy.com/en-INT/skylife/archive/en/2004_6/konu08.htm City of Aperlae]&lt;/ref&gt; and a castle.  Access to the village is possible only by sea.

Üçağız (ancient name, Teimioussa) is a [[village]] one km from Kaleköy, north of a small bay by the same name, with the ruins of Teimioussa to the east.  The name ''"Üçağız"'' means "three mouths", referring to the three exits to open sea.

The '''lava bear''' (also known as '''sand lapper''', '''dwarf grizzly''', and '''North American sun bear''') is a variety of [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus'') found in the lava beds of south central [[Oregon]].  The animal was described as a very small bear with wooly light brown fur.  The few lava bears that were killed or captured were a little larger than a [[badger]]. It was once thought to be a separate species.  However, scientists who examined the specimens determined that the animals were stunted due to the harsh environment in which they lived.  Today, it is acknowledged that lava bears never existed as a unique species.

== Description ==

When lava bears were first encountered in the early [[20th century]] it was speculated that they might be a unique species, possibly a dwarf [[Grizzly bear|grizzly]].  The diminutive bears resembled [[American black bear|black bear]]s in many ways, but were much smaller with wooly fur that was light brown in color, similar to [[grizzly bear]]s.  Specimens taken by hunters were a little larger than a badger.  They were approximately {{convert|17|in|cm}} to {{convert|30|in|cm}} long and between {{convert|12|in|cm}} and {{convert|18|in|cm}} high.  The bears weighed between {{convert|23|lb|kg}} and {{convert|35|lb|kg}}.  Gray hair on their muzzles along with well-worn claws and teeth indicated that some of the specimens were adult bears.&lt;ref name="GMI"&gt;Ingram, Guy M., [https://archive.org/stream/oregonsportsman05port#page/275/mode/2up "The Little Bear Wonder of Oregon"], ''The Oregon Sportsman'' (Volume 5, Issue 4), Oregon State Sportsmen's League, Portland, Oregon, October 1917, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SGJ"&gt;Jewett, Stanley G., [https://archive.org/details/jstor-3533662 "The So-Called Dwarf Bear of Oregon"], ''The Murrelet'' (Volume 3), Pacific Northwest Bird and Mammal Society, Seattle, Washington, 1 October 1922, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RRH"&gt;Hatton, Raymond R., ''Pioneer Homesteaders of the Fort Rock Valley'', Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1982, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAK"&gt;Kriegh, LeeAnn, "Lava Bear", ''The Nature of Bend'', Tempo Press, Bend, Oregon, 2016, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ERG"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19340719&amp;id=qrJWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1443,2509111&amp;hl=en "Lave Bear Shown at McKenzie Bridge"], ''Eugene Reigister-Guard'', Eugene, Oregon, 19 July 1934, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first lava bear specimens taken in the wild was mounted and sent to [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|United States Bureau of Biological Survey]] in [[Washington, District of Columbia|Washington]], [[District of Columbia]].  Eventually, scientist determined that lava bears were American black bears (''Ursus americanus''), stunted by malnutrition caused by the austere environment where the animals lived and foraged.&lt;ref name="SGJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finley, William L., [http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1921-01-14/ed-1/seq-10/#index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;words=bear+BEAR+bears+LAVA+lava&amp;sequence=0&amp;proxtext=%22Lava+bear%22&amp;y=20&amp;x=14&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 "Proof Lacking for Lava Bear"], ''Morning Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 14 January 1921, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DHM"&gt;[http://www.deschuteshistory.org/about-us/faq "Frequently Asked Questions"], Des Chutes Historical Museum, Deschutes County Historical Society, Bend, Oregon, accessed 1 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

From 1917 through the early 1930s, a number of people reported seeing small bears in the lava beds and surrounding [[High desert (Oregon)|high desert]] county of northern [[Lake County, Oregon]].  The bears were initially called ''sand lappers'', but eventually became known as lava bears.  The first documented encounter was in 1917, when a sheepherder name O. T. McKendree killed a small bear near [[Fossil Lake (Oregon)|Fossil Lake]].  Originally, McKendree thought it was a black bear cub, but upon further inspection he found the animal was a very small adult bear.  He had the animal mounted by a [[taxidermist]].  The mounted lava bear was exhibited in [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] and later in [[Lakeview, Oregon|Lakeview]].&lt;ref name="GMI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SGJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADD"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/111193548/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Lava bears"], ''Albany Daily Democrat'', Albany, Oregon, 17 June 1923, p. 4.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A photograph of the mounted bear was published in ''Oregon Sportsman'' magazine in October 1917.&lt;ref name="GMI"/&gt;  Eventually, the mounted specimen was sent to Washington, D. C., where it was examined by [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] of the Bureau of Biological Survey.  Merriam, an expert on North American bears, determined that the specimen was an unusually small American black bear.&lt;ref name="SGJ"/&gt;

Publicity generated by the ''Oregon Sportsman'' photograph and various newspaper articles about the miniature bear made it a fascinating creature.  In 1920, [[Irvin S. Cobb]], a well-known writer for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', organized a hunting trip to Oregon with the stated purpose of finding a lava bear.&lt;ref name="LAK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFB"&gt;Brogan, Phil F., [http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/12696/VisitorInformationDeschutesNationalForest.pdf  "Deschutes Recreation Forest"], ''Visitor Information Service Book for the Deschutes National Forest'', Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, Bend, Oregon, 1969, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MO1"&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1920-09-14/ed-1/seq-1/#index=5&amp;rows=20&amp;words=bear+lava&amp;sequence=0&amp;proxtext=%22Lava+bear%22&amp;y=20&amp;x=14&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 "Cobb Discovers Sun Bear Yet in Oregon"], ''Morning Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 14 September 1920, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;   While Cobb did not locate a lava bear during his hunt, he left Oregon believing they existed.  He thought the little bears were a dwarf grizzly or a species of [[sun bear]], unique to North America.  After he left Oregon, several of the local trappers who accompanied Cobb began to actively search for lava bears.  In addition, the story Cobb wrote about his hunting trip for ''The Saturday Evening Post'' increased interest in the animal across the county.&lt;ref name="MO1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/96035029/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Lava Bear May Be Scientific Find, Believed"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 13 September 1920, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISC"&gt;Cobb, Irvin S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=4F4wAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP21&amp;lpg "A Quest in Youbetcherland"], ''The Saturday Evening Post'' (Volume 193, Issue 3), 1 January 1921, p. 6-7, 49–50, 52 &amp; 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Alfred Andrews, a trapper for the [[United States Forest Service]], reported killing a lava bear near [[Fort Rock]].  He sent the specimen to the Oregon biological survey office for examination.&lt;ref name="ADD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/96034882/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Bagged Lava Bear Belief of Hunter"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 9 June 1923, p. 8.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/94790782/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22%2B%22Alfred%2BAndrews%22  "The Lava Bear Trapper"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 4 March 1937, p. 4.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later, Andrews captured a live lava bear.  The animal looked like a small grizzly bear, but weighed only {{convert|28|lb|kg}}.  It was a male, {{convert|30|in|cm}} long and {{convert|18|in|cm}} high.  The [[Smithsonian]] offered Andrews $2,000 for the live lava bear, but he decided not to sell the animal.  Instead, he announced plans to tour the country with the bear.&lt;ref name="LAK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/94799009/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Lava Bear is Caught Alive"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 16 May 1924, p. 1.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19240704&amp;id=351XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s_MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6343,149141&amp;hl=en "Nabs Lava Bear Near Fort Rock"], ''Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, 4 July 1924, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  He displayed the bear in Portland, where 8,000 people paid to see the animal.&lt;ref name="RRH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/94799232/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Lava Bear Shown to Portland Folks"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 25 June 1924, p. 6.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also exhibited in [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]] and [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]] before being taken to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].  Eventually, Andrews' partner Harry Thrall stole or sold the bear and the animal disappeared.&lt;ref name="RRH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/96369545/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Caged Life Liked by Dwarf Grizzly"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 16 October 1924, p. 6.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1924, a second lava bear was captured alive near [[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]].  That bear weighed only {{convert|25|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/96370512/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Second Lava Bear is Taken in Lake"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 10 November 1924, p. 1.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another lava bear was trapped by L.

It weighed {{convert|30|lb|kg}} and resembled a miniature grizzly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/96331122 "Another Lava Bear Reported"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 20 January 1934, p. 1.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/152536816/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Rare Lave Bear is Exhibited by Lapine Trappers"], ''Eugene Register-Guard'', Eugene, Oregon, 20 January 1934, p. 1.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last animal identified as a lava bear was captured in 1934 by a forest road crew near Scar Mountain in the [[Willamette National Forest]].  It was {{convert|17|in|cm}} long and weighed {{convert|25|lb|kg}}.  It was exhibited for a time in [[McKenzie Bridge, Oregon]] before the animal was sold to a man named Alfred Bayne.&lt;ref name="ERG"/&gt;  As late as 1981, scientist were being asked to identify small bear tracks in the Fort Rock area to determine if they were made by lava bears.&lt;ref name="RRH"/&gt;

Today, it is accepted that lava bears are actually common American black bears.  It is also generally acknowledged that all of the animals that were killed or captured between 1917 and 1934 were either black bear cubs or small adults stunted from malnutrition.&lt;ref name="DHM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PFB"/&gt;

== Popular culture ==

In 1924, [[Bend Senior High School]] selected the lava bear as the school’s sports mascot.  The mascot was chosen shortly after a living bear was exhibited in Bend.  At the time, it was thought that lava bears might be a species unique to Central Oregon.&lt;ref name="RRH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/94799705/?terms=%22Lava%2BBear%22 "Bend Eleven in Christened"], ''Bend Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon,16 September 1924, p. 3.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' newspaper conducted a statewide survey, asking Oregon sports fans to identify their favorite high school team mascots.  Fans from across the state of Oregon, selected Bend’s ''Lava Bear'' as their top pick for large school mascot.&lt;ref&gt;Beyrle, Jen, [http://highschoolsports.oregonlive.com/news/article/-6407406660419497156/bend-lava-bears-voted-best-mascot-in-oregon-for-class-5a "Bend Lava Bears voted best mascot in Oregon for Class 5A"], ''OregonLive/The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian Revolution was a series of riots and clashes in December 1989. These were part of the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that occurred in several [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. The Romanian Revolution was the only one of these revolutions that forcibly overthrew a Communist government and executed the country's head of state.

{{US Income}}

The following is a list of the '''highest-income urban areas in the United States'''. The [[U.S. Census Bureau]] defines two types of [[United States urban area|urban area]]s. They are listed below, along with their Census definitions.

* '''Urbanized Area (UA)''', ''an area consisting of a central place(s) and adjacent territory with a general population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile of land area that together have a minimum residential population of at least 50,000 people. The Census Bureau uses published criteria to determine the qualification and boundaries of UAs.''
* '''Urban Cluster (UC)''', ''a densely settled territory that has at least 2,500 people but fewer than 50,000.''

The '''Marmifera''', full name {{lang-it|'''Ferrovia Marmifera Privata di Carrara'''|italic=no|lit=private marble railway of Carrara}}, was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[industrial railway]] used for the transport of [[Carrara marble]] from the [[Quarry|quarries]] of the municipal territory of [[Carrara]], [[Tuscany]]. The route extended from the hillside village of [[Colonnata]] to the port of [[Marina di Carrara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ferroviamarmifera.com/ Infos on the Marmifera di Carrara website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The railway, projected in 1866, was inaugurated in 1876 and was connected to the pre-existent [[Avenza-Carrara railway]] (1866),&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ferrovieabbandonate.it/linea_dismessa.php?table=dismessa&amp;type=search&amp;r=Toscana&amp;g=Ferrovie%20dello%20Stato&amp;s=Ordinario&amp;l=Avenza&amp;id=14&amp;start=0 Avenza-Carrara railway on ferrovieabbandonate.it (site about abandoned railways)]&lt;/ref&gt; linking the main station of [[Carrara-Avenza railway station|Carrara Avenza]] to [[Carrara San Martino railway station|Carrara San Martino]], in city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ferroviamarmifera.com/lastoria01.htm History of Marmifera di Carrara (part 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent expansion to the quarries below the [[Apuan Alps]] (Gioia, Ravaccione-Polvaccio and [[Colonnata]]) was proposed in 1885. Work began in 1887 and the new branch was inaugurated on 15 May 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ferroviamarmifera.com/lastoria02.htm History of Marmifera di Carrara (part 3)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.carraraonline.com/la_marmifera.php The "Marmifera" railway on "Carrara Online"]&lt;/ref&gt; The line was owned by the  SFMPC (Società Ferrovia Marmifera Privata di Carrara) and operated by the SFAI ([[Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.comune.carrara.ms.it/sezioni.aspx?id=1285 Article about the Marmifera and SFMPC on Carrara official municipal website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222031458/http://www.comune.carrara.ms.it/sezioni.aspx?id=1285 |date=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if its bridges were damaged by bombings and sabotages during the [[Second World War]], the line was practically in continuous operation from 1876 to 1964, when it was closed due to competition from road traffic. In 1969 it was closed also the passenger route Avenza-Carrara and the [[Track (rail transport)|rail tracks]] dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ferroviamarmifera.com/lastoria04.htm History of Marmifera di Carrara (part 5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, apart Avenza FS station, the only area in which the railway is operating is the [[port of Carrara]], connected to the [[Pisa–La Spezia–Genoa railway|Pisa-La Spezia-Genoa line]] with a pair of industrial lines. It is part of a route of [[industrial archaeology]] and, since 2003 its stations, quarries and bridges over the [[Vara (river)|Vara]], have been included in the Archaeological Park of the [[Apuan Alps]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.archeominerario.it/documenti/elenco_siti_beni_parco.PDF List of possible heritage sites in the Apuan Alps National Park (see page 3, section 7)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route ==
The railway line started in the hill village of [[Colonnata]] and, following a tortuous path, connects some hill hamlets of Carrara, as [[Miseglia]] and [[Torano, Carrara|Torano]], and several quarries, through some branches. Subsequently the railway runs through the city of Carrara and, from San Martino to Avenza station follows a path almost parallel to that of the passenger line. From Avenza FS station to the port, in [[Marina di Carrara]], the line follows a straight parallel to that of [[Carrara-Marina di Carrara Tramway|the former tramway]], with a small branch to the station of Covetta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferroviamarmifera.com/Immagini/lamarmifera013.JPG Map of Marmifera railway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Tram Carrara.JPG|Map of Carrara Tramway]]&lt;/ref&gt; The only stations passenger service was the one from Avenza to San Martino stations.&lt;ref&gt;"General Timetable of Italian Railways", July 1933.

'''Mestizo''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|ˈ|s|t|iː|z|oʊ|,_|m|ɪ|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mestizo?s=t|title=the definition of mestizo|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|mesˈtiθo|lang}}) is a term traditionally used in Spain, Latin America and the Philippines that originally referred to a person of combined [[Caucasian race|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the ''[[casta]]'' system that was in use during the [[Spanish Empire]]'s control of its American and Asian colonies. Nowadays though, particularly in [[Latin America]], ''mestizo'' has become more of a cultural term, with culturally mainstream Latin Americans regarded or termed as mestizos regardless of their actual ancestry and with the term '''Indian''' being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]], tribal affiliation, etc. Consequently, today, the vast majority of Spanish-speaking Latin Americans are regarded as Mestizos.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The term '''mestizaje''' – taking as its root ''mestizo'' or mixed – is the Spanish word for [[miscegenation]], the general process of mixing ancestries.

To avoid confusion with the original usage of the term {{lang|es|mestizo}}, mixed people started to be referred to collectively as {{lang|es|castas}}. In some Latin American countries, such as [[Mexico]], the concept of the mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous and the word '''mestizo''' acquired its current meaning, with it being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who do not speak [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]],&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dejó de clasificar a la población del país en tres categorías raciales, blanco, mestizo e indígena, y adoptó una nueva clasificación étnica que distinguía a los hablantes de lenguas indígenas del resto de la población, es decir de los hablantes de español.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=2013-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartolomé |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México |title=Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including people of complete European or indigenous descent as well as [[Asian Mexicans|Asians]] and [[Afro-Mexicans|Africans]].&lt;ref name="Knight 1990:73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910–1940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870–1940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=71–113 [p. 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-73856-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redalyc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Al respecto no debe olvidarse que en estos países buena parte de las personas consideradas biológicamente blancas son mestizas en el aspecto cultural, el que aquí nos interesa (p. 196) |publisher=Redalyc.org |date=2005-03-16 |accessdate=2013-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonial [[Venezuela]], {{lang|es|[[pardo]]}} was more commonly used instead of {{lang|es|mestizo}}. {{lang|es|Pardo}} means being mixed without specifying which mixture;&lt;ref name="Ethnic Groups in Venezuela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/17.htm|title=Venezuela – ETHNIC GROUPS|website=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was used to describe anyone born in the Americas whose ancestry was a mixture of European, Amerindian and black African.&lt;ref name="LAS CASTAS EN LA SOCIEDAD COLONIAL VENEZOLANA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldesafiodelahistoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=193:silvio-di-bernardo&amp;catid=94:publicate&amp;Itemid=129|title=El Desafío de la Historia|website=Eldesafiodelahistoria.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spanish system of racial hierarchy, the ''sistema de castas'', mestizos/{{lang|es|pardos}}, who formed the majority, had fewer rights than the minority elite European-born persons called {{lang|es|[[peninsulares]]}}, and the minority white colonial-born whites {{lang|es|[[Criollo people|criollo]]}}, but more rights than the now-minority {{lang|es|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indio]]}}, {{lang|es|[[negro]]}}, {{lang|es|[[Mulatto|mulato]]}} and {{lang|es|[[zambo]]}} populations.

The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[cognate]], ''[[mestiço]]'', historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the [[Portuguese colonies]]. In [[colonial Brazil]] most of the non-slave population was initially ''[[caboclo|mestiço de indio]]'', i.e. mixed white and native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class white landlord males and female slaves would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs). In [[Portuguese India]] also, the mixed population was known as ''[[Mestiços (Sri Lanka)|mestiços]]'' and the local Indian Christians as ''indiacatos''.

In the [[Philippines]], which was a colony of Spain, the term [[Filipino mestizo|''mestizo'']] came to refer to a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] with any foreign ancestry, especially [[White People|white]], and usually shortened as ''[[Tisoy]]''.

In Canada, the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] people is a distinct community composed of the descendants of Europeans (usually French, sometimes Scottish or English) involved in the fur trade and North American Indigenous peoples of what is now Western Canada.

In [[Saint Barthélemy]], the term mestizo refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name=SaintBarts1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tb.html |title=Saint Barthelemy: People and Society |date=13 September 2012|work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Spanish word {{lang|es|mestizo}} is from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mixticius'', meaning mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mestizo|title=mestizo|year=2008|work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|quote=a person of mixed blood; specifically: a person of mixed European and American Indian indigenous ancestry }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mestizo|title=Mestizo – Define Mestizo at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage has been documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an [[Egypt]]ian and a [[Semitic people|Semite]].&lt;ref name= "AlfonsoX-p261R"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfonso X|title=General Estoria. Primera parte|location=Spain|year=1275|page=261R|website=Corpus.rae.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term was first documented in English in 1582.&lt;ref name= "Herbst-p.144"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbst|first=Philip|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopædic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|publisher=Intercultural Press|location=Yarmouth|year=1997|isbn=978-1-877864-42-1|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-day use===
In the United States, Canada and other English-speaking countries and cultures, mestizo, as a loanword from Spanish, is used to mean a non-white of mixed European and American Indian descent exclusively, generally with connection to a Latin American culture or of Latin American descent, a concept much stricter than that found in Romance languages (especially Portuguese, possessing terms that are not cognate with mestizo for such admixture, and thus the concept of {{lang|pt|mestiço}} is not seen as particularly connected with Amerindian ancestry at all). It is related to the particular racial identity of historical non-white Amerindian-descended [[Hispanic and Latino American]] communities in an American context.

In English-speaking Canada, [[Métis (Canada)|Canadian Métis]] (with upper-case), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word métis, are referring to [[Métis (Canada)|Canadian Métis]] ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry, rather than the broader concept of mixed-race people in general ({{lang|fr|métis}} with lowercase), present in all other French-speaking countries, as would speakers of Spanish; the usual term to refer to mixed-raced people in general is thus "mulâtre", which is considered elsewhere pejorative. In the United States, [[Métis people (United States)|Métis Americans]] and [[Mestizos in the United States|Mestizo Americans]] are two distinct racial and [[racial identity|ethno-racial identities]], as reflected in the use of French and Spanish loanwords, respectively.

In the Philippines, the word ''mestizo'' usually refers to a Filipino with combined [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Indigenous]] and European ancestry, but occasionally it will be used for a Filipino with apparent Chinese ancestry, who will also be referred to as 'chinito'. The latter was officially listed as a "mestizo de sangley" in birth records of the 19th century, with 'sangley' as a reference to the [[Hokkienese]] word for business, 'seng-li'.

In the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages, because of important linguistic differences, so that {{lang|pt|mestiço}} (mixed-race, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenated, etc.) is separated altogether from {{lang|pt|pardo}} (any kind of brown people) and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (brown people originally of European–Amerindian admixture or assimilated Amerindians), in which {{lang|pt|mestiços}} can be also fully white, black or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown) and one does not need to be a {{lang|pt|mestiço}} to be a part of the latter two categories.

In Brazil specifically, at least in modern times all non-Indigenous people are part of a single ethnicity ({{lang|pt|os brasileiros}}; lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid), the {{lang|pt|mestiço}} ({{IPA-pt|meʃˈt(ʃ)isu}}, {{IPA-pt|miʃˈt(ʃ)isu|}}) group is by far the largest among the free people since the earliest decades of the colony. As explained above, the concept of {{lang|pt|mestiço}} should not in any way be confused with the mestizo as used in either the Spanish-speaking world or the English-speaking one, as it relates no special relation to being of Amerindian extraction, and also should not be confused with {{lang|pt|pardo}}, literally "brown people" (there are {{lang|pt|mestiços}} among all major groups of the country, Indigenous, Asian, white, {{lang|pt|pardo}} and black, and they are likely the majority in the three latter ones).

===Cognates===
{{lang|es|Mestizo}} ({{IPA-es|mesˈtiθo|lang}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-es|mesˈtiso|}}), {{lang|pt|mestiço}} ({{IPA-pt|mɨʃˈtisu|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|mesˈt(ʃ)isu|}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-pt|miʃˈt(ʃ)isu|}}), {{lang|fr|métis}} ({{IPA-fr|meˈtis|lang}}), {{lang|ca|mestís}} ({{IPA-ca|məsˈtis|lang}}), {{lang|de|Mischling}} ({{IPA-de|mɪʃˈlɪŋɡ|lang}}), {{lang|it|meticcio}} ({{IPA-it|meˈtittʃo|lang}}), {{lang|nl|mestiezen}} ({{IPA-nl|mɛsˈtizə(n)|lang}}), ''mestee'' ({{IPA-all|məsˈtiː|Middle English:}}), and mixed (English) are all [[cognates]] of the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''mixticius''.

==History==
{{Main|Casta}}

[[File:Casta painting all.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''Las castas''. 18th century, Museo Nacional del Virreinato, [[Tepotzotlán]], Mexico.]]
In the Spanish colonial period, the Spanish developed an extremely vast complex system of racial hierarchy, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's standing in society.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mörner, ''Race Mixture in the History of Latin America''. Boston: Little, Brown and Co. 1967, pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three main categories of race during the initial period of colonization of the Americas by the Spanish: White Spaniard (''español''), Amerindian (''indio''), and Black African (''negro''). During the Spanish colonial era, a myriad of terms (such {{lang|es|mestizo}}, {{lang|es|pardo}}, {{lang|es|mulato}} and {{lang|es|zambo}}) were created to differentiate these racial mixtures, called collectively ''castas''.&lt;ref name="Meyer 6th ed"/&gt; By the end of the colonial period in 1821, over one hundred sub-categories of possible variations of mixture existed, but official church and civil records were maintained with few categories. Church baptismal and marriage registers and civil records (censuses, arrest records) used the terms ''español'', ''castizo'', ''mestizo'', ''mulato'', and ''indio''.

===Casta===
Throughout the territories of [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas, systems of racial hierarchy, the ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'' developed where society was divided based on race, wealth, and where one was born. The main divisions were as follows:
# ''Español'' (fem. española), i.e. [[Spaniards|Spaniard]] – person of Spanish or other European ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into ''Peninsulares'' and ''Criollos''
#* ''[[Peninsulars|Peninsular]]'' – a European born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;
#* ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' (fem. criolla)&amp;nbsp;– a white person with Spanish or other European descent born in the Americas;
# ''[[Castizo]]'' (fem. castiza) – a person with primarily European and some Amerindian ancestry born into a mixed family; the offspring of a castizo and an español was considered español.
# ''Mestizo'' (fem. mestiza) – a person of extended mixed European and Amerindian ancestry;
# ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]]'' (fem. India) – a person of pure Amerindian ancestry;
# ''[[Pardo]]'' (fem. parda) – a person of mixed white European, Amerindian and black African ancestry;
# ''[[Mulatto]]'' (fem. mulata) – a person of mixed white European and black African ancestry;
# ''[[Zambo]]'' – a person of mixed native black African and Amerindian ancestry;
# ''[[Negro]]'' (fem. negra)&amp;nbsp;– a person of black [[Atlantic slave trade|African]] descent, primarily African slaves and their descendants.

Persons of mixed race were collectively referred to as ''[[castas]]''.&lt;ref name="Meyer 6th ed"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Michael C.|first2=William L.| last2 =Sherman|first3 =Susan M.|last3=Deeds|title=The Course of Mexican History|edition=6th|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511001-3|pages=195–196}},&lt;/ref&gt;
In theory, and as depicted in eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, ''español'' status could also be attained by people of mixed origin who consistently had intermarried with Europeans. Such cases might include the offspring of a ''[[castizo]]'' (3/4 Spanish and 1/4 Indian) parent and one Peninsular or criollo parent.&lt;ref&gt;Mörner, ''Race Mixture'', p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry. Many indigenous people left their traditional villages and sought to be counted as mestizos to avoid tribute payments to the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter N. Stearns  |author2=William L. Langer |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=Encyclopedia of World History:Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged|work=Houghton Mifflin Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA401&amp;lpg=RA1-PA401&amp;dq=mestizo+cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many indigenous people, and sometimes those with partial African descent, were classified as mestizo if they spoke Spanish and lived as mestizos.

In the early colonial period, the offspring of españoles and Indias were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the child, even though illegitimate; or the child was raised in the indigenous world of the mother if he did not.  As early as 1533, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] mandated the high court (Audiencia) to take the children of Spanish men and indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Mörner, ''Race Mixture'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; As this mixed group born out of wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother's indigenous communities, but increasingly not accepted there either, and being designated mestizos with the assumption that they were illegitimate.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

When the Mexican republic was established in 1824, legal racial categories ceased to exist. The production of [[casta]] paintings in [[New Spain]] ceased at the same juncture, after almost a century as a genre.

Because the term had taken on a myriad of meanings, the designation "mestizo" was removed from census counts in Mexico and is no longer in use.&lt;ref name="Herbst-p.144"/&gt;

===Mexico===
{{See also|Mestizos in Mexico}}
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A representation of a Mestizo, in a ''Pintura de Castas'' from [[New Spain]] during the late colonial period. The painting's caption states "Spanish and Indian produce Mestizo", 1780.]]

The large majority of Mexicans can be classified as "Mestizos", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a particular non-Indigenous heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating both indigenous and European elements. In Mexico, Mestizo has become a blanket term which not only refers to [[Mixed race|mixed]] Mexicans but includes all Mexican citizens who do not speak [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]]&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"/&gt; even [[Asian Mexicans]] and [[Afro-Mexicans]].&lt;ref name=redalyc/&gt;
By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the "Mestizo identity" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as {{lang|es|mestizaje}} ({{IPA-es|mes.tiˈsa.xe|}}). Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of '''mestizaje''' (the process of race homogenization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Peter |year=1997 |title=Race and Ethnicity in Latin America |location=Chicago |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=0-7453-0987-9 |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910–1940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870–1940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=71–113 [pp. 78–85] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-73856-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to "help" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the "Indian problem" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Gonzalo Guerrero.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|A statue of [[Gonzalo Guerrero]], who adopted the Maya way of life and fathered the first Mestizo children of [[Mexico]], but not of the [[Americas]], since the first mestizos were born in the Caribbean, by Spanish men and indigenous Caribbean women.]]
Sometimes, particularly outside of Mexico, the word "mestizo" is used with the meaning of Mexican persons with mixed Indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"/&gt; and a person with none or very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Knight 1990:73"/&gt; In the Yucatán peninsula the word mestizo has a different meaning to the one used in the rest of Mexico, being used to refer to the [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]]-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the [[Caste War of Yucatán|caste war]] of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos.&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartolomé |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México |title=Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chiapas, the term [[Ladino people|''Ladino'']] is used instead of mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Peter |year=1997 |title=Race and Ethnicity in Latin America |location=Chicago |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=0-7453-0987-9 |pages=44–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the extensiveness of the modern definition of  Mestizo, various publications offer different estimations of this group, some try to use a biological, racial perspective and calculate the Mestizo population in contemporary Mexico as being around a half and two thirds of the population,&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico- Ethnic groups|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others use the culture-based definition, and estimate the percentage of Mestizos as high as 90%&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"/&gt; of the Mexican population, several others mix-up both due lack of knowledge in regards to the modern definition and assert that mixed race Mexicans are as much as  93% of Mexico’s population.&lt;ref name=INMEGEN1&gt;{{cite web|last1=González Sobrino|first1=Blanca Zoila|last2=Silva Zolezzi|first2=Irma|last3=Sebastián Medina|first3=Leticia|title=Miradas sin rendicíon, imaginario y presencia del universo indígena|url=http://www.inmegen.gob.mx/tema/cms_page_media/397/Miradas_LETY%20SEBASTIÁN_.pdf|publisher=INMEGEN|accessdate=8 March 2015|pages=51–67|language=Spanish|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paradoxically to its wide definition, the word Mestizo has long been dropped of popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word even having pejorative connotations,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2" /&gt; which further complicates attempts to quantify Mestizos via self-identification.

While for most of its history the concept of Mestizo and Mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico’s intellectual circles, in recent times the concept has been target of criticism, with its detractors claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of  “(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo” the Mestizo ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El archivo del estudio de racismo en Mexico|url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1405-92742016000200092&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso|website=Scielo.org.mx|accessdate=15 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804041510/http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1405-92742016000200092&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en  Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|format=PDF|website=Enp4.unam.mx|accessdate=15 October 2017

====Genetic studies====
A 2012 study published by the [[Journal of Human Genetics]] found that the Y-chromosome (paternal) ancestry of the average Mexican Mestizo was predominately European (64.9%), followed by Native American (30.8%), and African (4.2%). The European ancestry was more prevalent in the north and west (66.7–95%) and Native American ancestry increased in the centre and south-east (37–50%), the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0–8.8%).&lt;ref name="Admixture and population structure in Mexican-Mestizos based on paternal lineages"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/jhg/journal/v57/n9/full/jhg201267a.html In the total population sample, paternal ancestry was predominately European (64.9%), followed by Native American (30.8%) and African (4.2%). However, the European ancestry was prevalent in the north and west (66.7–95%) and, conversely, Native American ancestry increased in the center and south-east (37–50%), whereas the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0–8.8%)], Journal of Human Genetics].

A study of 104 Mestizos from Sonora, Yucatán, Guerrero, Zacatecas, Veracruz, and Guanajuato by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine, reported that Mestizo Mexicans are 58.96% European, 31.05% Native American, and 10.03% African. [[Sonora]] shows the highest European contribution (70.63%) and [[Guerrero]] the lowest (51.98%) which also has the highest Native American contribution (37.17%). African contribution ranges from 2.8% in Sonora to 11.13% in [[Veracruz]]. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as "being racially mixed in some degree").&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web

The study found that the Mestizo population of these Mexican states were on average 55% of indigenous ancestry followed by 41.8% of European, 1.8% of African, and 1.2% of East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name="Pnas.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/11/0903045106.abstract |title=Analysis of genomic diversity in Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0903045106 |volume=106 |issue=21 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=8611–8616|pmc=2680428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study also noted that whereas Mestizo individuals from the southern state of Guerrero showed on average 66% of indigenous ancestry, those from the northern state of Sonora displayed about 61.6% European ancestry. The study found that there was an increase in indigenous ancestry as one traveled towards to the Southern states in Mexico, while the indigenous ancestry declined as one traveled to the Northern states in the country, such as Sonora.&lt;ref name="Pnas.org"/&gt;

====Costa Rica====

{{As of | 2012}} most Costa Ricans are primarily of Spanish or mestizo ancestry with minorities of German, Nicaraguan, Italian, Jamaican, Colombian, other Central American and Greek ancestry. 

European migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the USA West Coast ([[California]]) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the [[Panama Canal]] opened). Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, [[Palestinians]], Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.

Many of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to [[Christianity]] who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/dje/articles2/costarica.htm|title=The Jewish Community in Costa Rica|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Costa-Rica.html|title=Culture of Costa Rica - history, people, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social, marriage|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica has four small minority groups: [[Mulatto]]s, [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] and [[Asians]]. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s, English-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers.

By the late twentieth century, allusions in textbooks and political discourse to "whiteness," or to Spain as the "mother country" of all Costa Ricans, were diminishing, replaced with a recognition of the multiplicity of peoples that make up the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Costa-Rica.html#ixzz5VSnSmoYJ&lt;/ref&gt;

====El Salvador====

[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep. Centroamérica).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in '''San Salvador, El Salvador'''. At the center, [[José Matías Delgado]], a Salvadoran priest and doctor known as El Padre de la Patria Salvadoreña (The Father of the Salvadoran Fatherland), alongside his nephew [[Manuel José Arce]], future Salvadoran president of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].]]

[[File:CIUDAD VIEJA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ciudad Vieja, El Salvador]],(Old City), also known as Old San Salvador, was a lost colony established in 1525 in what is today's El Salvador. It was a first attempt by the [[Spaniards]] to establish a permanent settlement in El Salvador. The city was abandoned after Native repeatedly attacked and then resettled again in 1528, then completely abandoned and dismantled in 1545 and moved to modern day [[San Salvador]] City. The settlement resembles more of a fortified military base rather than a city. The historic census indicates that the city contained male Spaniards with many Mestizo children with Native American indigenous wives]]

In [[Central America]], systematic rape and intermarriage by European men with the Native American Indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]] and [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women of what is now [[El Salvador]] happened almost immediately after the arrival of the European [[Spaniards]] led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other indigenous groups in the country such as [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Poqomam people]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Ch'orti' people]], [[Alaguilac]], [[Xinca people]], [[Mixe]] and [[Mangue language]] people became culturally extinct duo to the Mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digestyc.gob.sv/servers/redatam/htdocs/CPV2007S/Docs/RESULTADOS_FINALES.pdf Ethnic Groups -2007 official Census]. Page 13, Digestyc.gob.sv&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, ruthless dictator [[Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez]] was responsible for La Matanza ("The Slaughter"),known as the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]] in which the Native American indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.

There is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Palestine]] (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.

[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]], who passed racial laws to keep blacks and other peoples out of El Salvador, though [[Afro-Salvadoran|Salvadorans with African ancestry]], called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.

Today, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Native American indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, also tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans, and Salvadoran of Arab descent, also identify themselves as culturally Salvadoran Mestizo by absorption.

====Guatemala====
{{See also|Demographics of Guatemala}}
The Ladino population in [[Guatemala]] is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minedoc.gob.gt/administracion/dependencias/centrales/ccre/ccre_interculturalidad.htm  |title=Reflexiones sobre el mestizaje y la identidad nacional en Centroamérica: de la colonia a las Républicas liberales |access-date=28 July 2008 |author=Ministerio de Educación (MINEDUC) |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2008 |month= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Spanish |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Argentina and Uruguay===
{{main|Argentine people}}
{{main|Uruguayan people}}
Initially colonial [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] had a predominately mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century, and the repeated intermarriage with white Europeans and Middle Easterners{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}; the mestizo population became a so-called {{lang|es|castizo}} population. With more Europeans arriving in the early 20th century, the face of Argentina and Uruguay has overwhelmingly become white and European (some Middle Eastern{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}) in culture and tradition.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Because of this, the term mestizo has fallen into disuse. Northern Argentina still has a predominately mestizo population, especially in the provinces of [[Jujuy]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Tucumán]], [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[La Rioja province (Argentina)|La Rioja]], [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], where there is also a significant population of Indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Britannica''. Book of the Year (various issues). Britannica World Data: Argentina.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{main|Chilean people}}
In Chile, from the time the Spanish soldiers with [[Pedro de Valdivia]] entered northern Chile, a process of 'mestizaje' began where white Spaniards began to mate with the local bellicose [[Mapuche]] population of Amerindians to produce an overwhelmingly mestizo population during the first generation in all of the cities they founded. In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Amerindian tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the [[Spanish Empire]] and did not submit to a European power.

A public health book from the [[University of Chile]] states that 30% of the population is of Caucasian origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%. A genetic study by the same university showed that the average Chilean's genes are 60% Caucasian and 40% Amerindian.

===Colombia===
{{Main|Mestizo Colombian}}
[[Colombia]] whose land was named after explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] is the product of the interacting and mixing of the European [[conquistador]]s and colonist with the different Amerindian peoples of Colombia. Later the African element was introduced into the coastal parts of Colombia as slaves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Over time Colombia has become a primarily Mestizo/White country due to limited immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the minorities being: the [[Mulatto]]es and [[Pardo]]s living primarily in the coastal areas; and pockets of Amerindians living around the rural areas and the Amazonian Basin regions of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

An extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of [[White Colombian|European]] ancestry (predominantly [[Spaniards|Spanish]], and a part of [[Italians|Italian]], [[French people|French]], and [[Germans|German]]) and of [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Middle Eastern]] ancestry. 10.6% is of [[Afro-Colombian|African]] ancestry. [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous Amerindians]] comprise 3.4% of the population. 0.01% of the population are [[Romani people|Roma]].&lt;ref name="The Society and Its Environment"&gt;Bushnell, David &amp; Rex A. Hudson (2010) "[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Colombia.pdf The Society and Its Environment]"; ''Colombia: a country study'': 87. Washington D.C.: Federal Research Division, Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", consisting of [[White Colombian|whites]] and [[Mestizo Colombian|mestizos]] (those of mixed white European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population.&lt;ref name="The Society and Its Environment"/&gt;

===Ecuador===
During the colonial era, the majority of Ecuadorians were Amerindians and the minorities were the White Spanish [[Conquistadors]], who came with [[Francisco Pizarro]] and Sebastian de [[Benalcazar]]. With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many white females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominately mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian Population due to European diseases and wars.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Afro-Ecuadorians]] ([[Zambos]] and [[Mulatto]]es), who are a minority in the country, can be found mostly in the [[Esmeraldas Province]], in the [[Valle del Chota]] of the [[Imbabura Province]], and as small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas as minorities.

Mestizos are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 71.9% of the current population. The next 28% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7% each, the Montubios, Afroecuadorian, Amerindian (Indigenous) and White.

===Paraguay===
{{main|Paraguayan people}}
During the reign of  [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], the first consul of [[Paraguay]] from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Indians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was [[Afro-Brazilian]]), but feared that racial superiority would create [[class division]] which would threaten his [[Autocracy|absolute rule]].

As a result of this, today 90% of Paraguay's population are mestizo, and the main language is the native [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. Although it did not had the exposition to [[miscegenation]] as de Francia wanted, after the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], European male worker émigrés mixed with the female mestizo population so as that pushed a middle class of Mestizo background largely accepted as a configuration of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Peru===
[[File:Mestizo. Mestiza. Mestiza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Mestizo-Mestiza, Peru, circa 1770.]]

According to Alberto Flores Galindo, "By the 1940 census, the last that utilized racial categories, mestizos were grouped with whites, and the two constituted more than 53 % of the population. Mestizos likely outnumbered Indians and were the largest population group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galindo|first=Alberto Flores|title=In Search of an Inca: Identity and Utopia in the Andes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|page=247|isbn=0-521-59861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
{{Main|Mestizos in Venezuela}}

Mestizos are the majority in Venezuela, accounting for 51.6% of the country's population. According to D'Ambrosio&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambrosio, B. ''L'emigrazione italiana nel Venezuela''. Edizioni "Universitá degli Studi di Genova". Genova, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; 57.1% of mestizos have mostly European characteristics, 28.5% have mostly African characteristics and 14.2% have mostly Amerindian characteristics.

====Notable mestizos migrating to Europe====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}

[[Martín Cortés (son of doña Marina)|Martín Cortés]], son of the [[conquistador|Spanish conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] and of the [[Nahuatl]]–[[Maya languages|Maya]] indigenous Mexican interpreter [[La Malinche|Malinche]], was one of the first documented mestizos to arrive in Spain. His first trip occurred in 1528, when he accompanied his father, Hernán Cortés, who sought to have him legitimized by the Pope.

There is also verified evidence of the grandchildren of [[Moctezuma II]], [[Aztec]] emperor, whose royal descent the Spanish crown acknowledged, willingly having set foot on European soil. Among these descendants are the Counts of Miravalle, and the '''[[Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo|Dukes of Moctezuma de Tultengo]]''', who became part of the [[Spanish peerage]] and left many descendants in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alvarezgalloso.wordpress.com/2007/12/30/la-descendencia-espanola-de-moctezuma-reclama-pago-de-mexico/|title=La descendencia española de Moctezuma reclama pago de Mexico|work=El Noticiero de Alvarez Galloso|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Counts of Miravalle, residing in [[Andalusia|Andalucía]], Spain, demanded in 2003 that the government of Mexico recommence payment of the so-called 'Moctezuma pensions' it had cancelled in 1934.

The mestizo historian [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], son of Spanish conquistador Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega and of the [[Inca civilization|Inca]] princess Isabel Chimpo Oclloun arrived in Spain from Peru. He lived in the town of [[Montilla]], Andalucía, where he died in 1616. The mestizo children of Francisco Pizarro were also military leaders because of their famous father. Starting in the early 19th and throughout the 1980s, France and Sweden saw the arrival of hundreds of [[Chile]]ans, many of whom fled Chile during the dictatorial government of [[Augusto Pinochet]].

[[File:Spanish mestizo costume.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Spanish Filipino mestizo couple c. 1846]] 
In the [[Philippines]], the word "mestizo"&lt;ref  name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; and usually shortened as ''Tisoy'' as a modern usage, today generally denotes [[Filipinos|Filipino]]s of mixed [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and any non-native, usually white, ethnicity.

Mestizos in the Philippines are traditionally a blend of Austronesian, Chinese, Spanish, Southern European or Latin American ancestry and are primarily descendants of ''viajeros'' (sailors who plied the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon|Manila-Acapulco Galleon route]]), ''soldados'' (soldiers) and ''negociantes'' (merchants who were primarily Spanish, Chinese, or themselves mestizos). Because of this, most mestizos in the Philippines are concentrated in the urban areas and large towns of the islands such as [[Manila]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]] and [[Vigan]]. In these provinces of the Philippines, many Spaniards and foreign merchants intermarried with the rich and landed Malayo{{nbhyph}}Polynesian [[Principalía|local nobilities]]. From these unions, a new cultural group was formed, the mestizo class.&lt;ref&gt;Also v.[[encomienda]]; [[hacienda]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their descendants emerged later to become an influential part of the colonial government, and of the [[Principalía]],&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/TAGALOG/Tagalog_Homepage99/impacts_of_spanish_rule_in_the_p.htm|title=The impact of Spanish rule in the Philippines|website=Seasite.niu.edu|accessdate=15 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001215334/http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/Tagalog_Homepage99/impacts_of_spanish_rule_in_the_p.htm|archivedate=1 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among whom were [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the first [[President of the Philippines|President]] of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935–1944); and [[Marcelo Azcárraga Palmero]] who even became ''interim'' [[Prime Minister]] of [[Spain]] on August 8, 1897 until October 4 of that same year. Azcárraga also went on to become Prime Minister of Spain again in two more separate terms of office. In 1904, he was granted Knighthood in the very exclusive Spanish chilvalric [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] — the only mestizo [[List of Knights of the Golden Fleece|recipient of this prestigious award]].

More recent migrations and interracial marriages beginning in the 20th century resulted in a greater variety of racial admixture with non-Iberian Europeans, White Americans and other Asians.

===Guam and Northern Mariana Islands===
In [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the term "mestizo" was borrowed from the Spanish language and was formerly used to identify people of mixed Pacific Islander and Spanish ancestry; however, as the United States gained control of these islands after the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the term "Multiracial" replaced "Mestizo".{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Mestizos/Multiracials currently form a small minority of the population. Because most Guamanians and Northern Mariana Islanders were also [[Alphabetical Catalog of Surnames|given Spanish surnames]] as part of the [[Spanish East Indies]], persons of [[white American]] and other non-Spanish European descent with Spanish surnames may be mistaken as having such descent.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}{{clarify|date=November 2010}}

====Brazilian mestiço====
{{main|Pardo}}
In Brazil, the word {{lang|pt|[[Mestiço (Brazil)|mestiço]]}} is used to describe individuals born from any mixture of different ethnicities or races, not specifying any relation to Amerindian or European descent whatsoever. The Mixed Race Day, or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mestiço), on June 27, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Paraíba and a holyday in two cities.

One of the most notorious group is the {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown people), also informally known as {{lang|pt|moreno}} (tan skinned people; given its euphemism-like nature, it may be interpreted as offensive). They include mostly those of non-light [and non-black] skin color. Nevertheless, not all {{lang|pt|pardos}} are {{lang|pt|mestiços}}. For example, an Amerindian (initially and most often {{lang|pt|índio}}, often more formally {{lang|pt|indígena}}, rarely {{lang|pt|ameríndio}}, an East Indian ({{lang|pt|indiano}})) or a Filipino may be initially described as {{lang|pt|pardo/parda}} (in opposition to {{lang|pt|branco}}, white, {{lang|pt|negro}}, black, and {{lang|pt|amarelo}}, yellow) if his or her race is unknown, and it is testified by the initial discovery reports of Portuguese navigators. In the same way, {{lang|pt|mestiço}}, a term used to describe anyone with any degree of [[miscegenation]] in one's blood line, may apply to all said groups (that in Portugal and its ex-colonies, always depended solely on phenotype, meaning a brown person may have a full sibling of all other basic phenotypes and thus race groups).

Descent is largely ignored, and having to choose between "white" and "{{lang|pt|mestiço}}" categories is a concept completely foreign to Brazilians as in the native culture it is possible to fully belong to both categories at the same time (as they describe different things). Even though all people of full European descent are white by race, not all white people are of any European descent (so that it may include few, some or most of North African, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian descent; again, phenotype is more important than descent), and neither full nor majoritary European ancestry admixed with that of people in regions where no one is white by phenotype is necessary for one to be white.

As Brazilians often believe most people to be {{lang|pt|mestiços}}, given how most groups have at least some minor degree of genetic exchange since what in the modern day people believe to be races were formed in the Upper Paleolithic, a term also used to explicitly explain that one has a recent major degree of miscegenation in one's blood line is {{lang|pt|miscigenado}}.

Important {{lang|pt|pardo}} groups in Brazil are the {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (largely contemporary usage) or {{lang|pt|mamelucos}} (largely archaic usage), the {{lang|pt|mulatos}}, and the {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The first group is composed of the culturally assimilated Amerindians as well as the '''brown-skinned''' descendants or children of both whites or {{lang|pt|moreno}} (swarthy) people of otherwise Caucasian phenotype and Amerindians. They are an important group in the Northern (Amazon Basin) region, but also relatively numerous on the Northeastern and Center-Western ones. Then, those, neither black- nor fair-skinned, whose origins come from the admixture between whites or {{lang|pt|morenos}} and blacks or {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The last group is composed of descendants of Amerindians or {{lang|pt|caboclos}} and blacks or other {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. Finally, those whose origins possess a notorious level of European ancestry and in which neither Amerindian nor African phenotypical traces are much more present than each other are sometimes known as {{lang|pt|juçaras}}.

[[File:Ronaldo-14-05-2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]]]
There are, however, important groups who are {{lang|pt|mestiços}} but not [necessarily] {{lang|pt|pardos}}. People of East Asian and non-Asian descent combined are known as {{lang|pt|ainokos}}, from the Japanese "love (ai) child (ko)" (also used for all children of illegitimate birth.  Mixed children are now largely referred to as "half" or [[hāfu]]), though often, for those without contact with the term, {{lang|pt|mestiço de}} [East Asian nationality/ethnicity] may also be used. {{lang|pt|[[Sarará]]s}} differ from {{lang|pt|mulatos}} at being fair-skinned (rather than brown-skinned), and having non-straight [[blond]] or [[red hair]].

Other people who are not brown (and thus not {{lang|pt|pardo}}), but also their phenotypes by anything other than skin, hair and eye color do not match white ones but rather those of people of color may be just referred to as {{lang|pt|mestiço}}, without specification to skin color with an identitarian connotation (there are the distinctions, though, of {{lang|pt|mestiço claro}}, for the fair-skinned ones, and {{lang|pt|mestiço moreno}}, for those of olive skin tones). In Brazilian censuses, those people may choose to identify mostly with {{lang|pt|branco}} (white) or {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown) or leave the question on race/color blank.

===Lusophone Africa===

====Angolan mestiço====
The {{lang|pt|mestiço}} are primarily of mixed European, [[Jus soli|native]] born [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Precolonial history of Angola|Angolan]] or other [[Sub-Saharan Africans#Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous African]] lineages. They tend to be Portuguese culturally and to have full Portuguese names.

Although they make up about two percent of the population, they are the socially elite and racially privileged group in the country. Historically, {{lang|pt|mestiços}} formed social and cultural allegiances with [[Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese colonists]] subsequently identifying with the Portuguese over and above their indigenous identities. Despite their loyalty, the ethnic group faced economic and political adversity at hands of the white population during times of economic hardship for whites. These actions lead to ostracizing Mestiços from their inherited economic benefits which sparked the group to take a new sociopolitical direction.

Across the 500 year Portuguese presence in the country, the Mestiço have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic and [[Culture of Angola#Mestiço|cultural]] hierarchy in present-day [[Angola]]. Their [[phenotype]] range is broad with a number of members possessing physical characteristics that are close to others within the indigenous black [[Demographics of Angola|non-mixed]] population. Since the Mestiços are generally better educated than the rest of the indigenous black population, they exercise influence in government disproportionate to their numbers.

====Bissau-Guinean mestiço====
1% of the population is of mixed Native African and Portuguese descent, Arab and Berber genetic influence ignored.

====Mozambican mestiço====
A minority population of Mozambicans of mixed Bantu and Portuguese heritage.

====Mestiços of São Tomé and Príncipe====
Mestiços of São Tomé and Príncipe are descendants of Portuguese colonists and African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as {{lang|pt|filhos da terra}} or "children of the land").

===Lusophone Asia===

====Sri Lankan mestiço====
In [[Sri Lanka]], the names [[Mestiços (Sri Lanka)|''mestiços'']] (Portuguese for "mixed race") or ''casados'' ("married ones") were applied to people of mixed Portuguese and Sri Lankan ([[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]]) descent, starting in the 16th century.

A [[French colonial empire|French Colonial empire]] in Canada, the Métis are regarded as an independent ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This community of descent consists of individuals descended from marriages of [[First Nation]] women, specifically [[Cree]], [[Ojibwa]]y, and [[Saulteaux]] with Europeans, usually [[French Canadian|French]], [[English Canadian|English]], and [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] [[Engagé|laborers]] or merchants employed in the [[Fur Trade|North American Fur Trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Their history dates to the mid 17th century, and they have been recognized as a distinct people since the early 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Traditionally, the Métis spoke a mixed language called [[Michif]] (with various regional dialects). Michif (a phonetic spelling of the Métis pronunciation of "Métif", a variant of Métis) is also used as the name of the Métis people. The name is most commonly applied to descendants of communities in what is now southern [[Manitoba]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} The name is also applied to the descendants of similar communities in what are now [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Labrador]], and the [[Northwest Territories]], although these groups' histories are different from that of the western Métis.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} In Northern Manitoba some communities spoke [[Bungee language|Bungee]], a combination of [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]], [[Orcadian]], [[Cree]], and [[Ojibwe]]. Bungee is now extinct.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Estimates of the number of Métis vary from 300,000 to 700,000 or more. {{citation needed|date=June 2007}} In September 2002, the Métis people adopted a national definition of Métis for citizenship within the "Métis Nation." Based on this definition, it is estimated that there are 350,000 to 400,000 {{citation needed|date=June 2007}} Métis Nation citizens in Canada, although many Métis classify anyone as Métis who can prove that an ancestor applied for money scrip or land scrip as part of nineteenth-century treaties with the Canadian government.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, Labrador, Quebec, and even some Acadian Métis communities are not accepted by the Métis National Council and are represented nationally by the "Congress of Aboriginal Peoples."{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Métis are recognized as Aboriginal, but not as a First Nation by the Canadian government and do not receive the same benefits granted to First Nation peoples.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, the 1982 amendments to the Canadian constitution recognize the Métis as an [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal people]], and have enabled individual Métis to sue successfully for recognition of their traditional rights such as rights to hunt and trap.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 2003, a court ruling in [[Ontario]] found that the Métis deserve the same rights as other aboriginal communities in Canada.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Mestizo of Saint Barthélemy===
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}

In [[Saint Barthélemy]], the term mestizo refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name=SaintBarts1/&gt;

The United States has a large mestizo population, as many [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]] of Mexican or Central American or South American descent are technically mestizo. However, the term "mestizo" is not used for official purposes, with [[Mexican Americans]] being classed in roughly equal proportions as "white" or "some other race" (see links), and the term "mestizo" is not in common popular use within the United States.

Many Mexican-Americans use the term Chicano, which has a strong connection with their Native heritage.

===Anglo-Métis===
A 19th-century community of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]] of Canada, the '''[[Anglo-Métis]]''', more commonly known as '''Countryborn''', were children of fur traders; they typically had [[Orcadian]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], or English fathers and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] mothers. Their first languages were generally those of their mothers: [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Saulteaux language|Saulteaux]], [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]], etc. and English. Some of their fathers spoke [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] or [[Scots language|Scots]], leading to the development of the dialect of English known as "[[Bungee language|Bungee]]".

'''''The Middle-Class Millionaire:  The Rise of the New Rich and How They are Changing America''''' (Doubleday) is a book that chronicles the evolution of America’s middle-class over the last twenty years, and at how a portion of the middle-class is pulling away from the rest by amassing significant wealth.  Meanwhile, their values continue to make this group an important bellwether of the middle-class mood in America.

== Overview ==
Written by [[Lewis Schiff]] (''The Armchair Millionaire'') and [[Russ Allen Prince]] (''Cultivating the Middle-class Millionaire: Why Financial Advisors Are Failing Their Wealthy Clients and What They Can Do About It'') the book introduces an entirely new way of understanding why certain trends are gaining momentum and where that momentum will lead to next.

The book shows us how this subset of America, labeled the Middle-Class Millionaire, manages to thrive with one foot in the world they came from (the middle-class) and one foot in the world they now inhabit (the wealthy).

''The Middle-Class Millionaire'' is based on extensive personal interviews with more than 3,500 American households in 2006. It provides a three-dimensional portrait of a previously unrecognized demographic group: the emerging affluent middle class.

== Key concepts ==
Millionaire’s Intelligence: There are four behaviors that middle-class millionaires exhibit that appear to be linked to their success. These qualities have origins in classic middle-class values but they have applied them in uncommon ways.

The Influence of Affluence: Because the middle-class millionaire is both willing and able to try new things (products, services, places and ways to live, etc.) they are an important indicator for how the world might be changing in the years to come. As Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize–winning economist, once suggested, when it comes to innovation, the rich work for the poor.

The Hierarchy of Values: It’s easy to understand where the new rich are going to have the greatest impact when you understand their hierarchy of values. They share them with the rest of the middle class.

The '''minimum bounding rectangle''' ('''MBR'''), also known as '''bounding box''' (BBOX) or '''envelope''', is an expression of the maximum extents of a 2-dimensional object (e.g. point, line, polygon) or set of objects within its (or their) 2-D (x, y) [[coordinate system]], in other words min(x), max(x), min(y), max(y). The MBR is a 2-dimensional case of the [[minimum bounding box]].

MBRs are frequently used as an indication of the general position of a [[geography|geographic]] feature or dataset, for either display, first-approximation spatial query, or spatial indexing purposes. 

The degree to which an "overlapping [[rectangle]]s" query based on MBRs will be satisfactory (in other words, produce a low number of "false positive" hits) will depend on the extent to which individual spatial objects occupy (fill) their associated MBR. If the MBR is full or nearly so (for example, a mapsheet aligned with axes of latitude and longitude will normally entirely fill its associated MBR in the same coordinate space), then the "overlapping rectangles" test will be entirely reliable for that and similar spatial objects. On the other hand, if the MBR describes a dataset consisting of a diagonal line, or a small number of disjunct points (patchy data), then most of the MBR will be empty and an "overlapping rectangles" test will produce a high number of false positives. One system that attempts to deal with this problem, particularly for patchy data, is [[c-squares]].

MBRs are also an essential prerequisite for the [[R-tree]] method of [[spatial index]]ing.

==As spatial metadata==
Owing to their simplicity of expression and ease of use for searching, MBRs (frequently as "bounding box" or "bounding coordinates") are also commonly included in relevant standards for [[geospatial metadata]], i.e. [[metadata]] that describes spatial (geographic) objects; examples include [http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-box/index.shtml DCMI Box] as an extension to the [[Dublin Core]] metadata scheme, "Bounding Coordinates" in the [http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/base-metadata/v2_0698.pdf (U.S.) FGDC metadata standard], and "Geographic Bounding Box" in the (2003–current) '''ISO 19115 Metadata Standard''' for geographic information ([[ISO/TC 211]]). It is also (as "boundingBox") an element in [[Geography Markup Language]] (GML), that is utilised by a range of Web Service specifications from the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC). In the '''ISO 19107 Spatial Schema''' (ISO/TC 211), MBR appears as the datatype GM_Envelope that is returned by the envelope() operation on the root class GM_Object.

Web-accessible articles that deal further with the concept of the MBR include "Unlocking the Mysteries of the Bounding Box"&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.oclc.org/coordinates/a2.htm Douglas R. Caldwell: Unlocking the Mysteries of the Bounding Box]&lt;/ref&gt; by Douglas R. Caldwell, and "Geographic Database Search Interfaces and the Equatorial Cylindrical Equidistant Projection"&lt;ref&gt;[http://chukchi.colorado.edu/PAPER/ Ross S. Swick and Kenneth W.

Swick and Kenneth W. Knowles. The section on "searching" on the [http://geospatialmethods.org/searching.html Geospatial Methods] site is also well worth investigating.

'''''Mortality''''' is a 2012, posthumously published book by Anglo-American writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], comprising seven essays which first appeared in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' concerning his struggle with oesophageal cancer, with which he was diagnosed during his 2010 book tour&lt;ref&gt;Bowcott, Owen (1 July 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/01/aurtho-christopher-hitchens-diagnosed-cancer "Author Christopher Hitchens diagnosed with cancer"] from ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and which killed him in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William (16 December 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?_r=0 "Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; An eighth chapter consisting of unfinished "fragmentary jottings," a foreword by [[Graydon Carter]], Hitchens' ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' editor and an afterword by Carol Blue, Hitchens' widow, are also included in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Christopher (30 August 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens.html?pagewanted=all "Review of ''Mortality'': Staying Power"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Hitchens held the post of contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' from November 1992 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]] contributor page at [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']]: http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/christopher-hitchens&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he contributed about 10 essays per year on subjects as diverse as politics and the limits of self-improvement, writing about "anything except sports".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2012). Mortality. Atlantic Books Ltd., p.103 {{ISBN|978-1-4555-0275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he felt obliged when he was asked to write about his illness for the magazine, and managed to dispatch seven essays from "Tumourville" before he was overcome by his illness on 15 December 2011, aged 62.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William (16 December 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?_r=0 "Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The essays take as their subject matter his fear of losing the ability to write, the torture of chemotherapy, an analysis of [[Nietzsche]]'s proclamation that "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger," the joy of conversation and the very meaning of life.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2012). Mortality. Atlantic Books Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-4555-0275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The critical response to ''Mortality'' was largely positive with friends and admirers of Hitchens praising both his character in confronting his death and the way that this was transferred onto the page. In a glowing review of ''Mortality'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] described Hitchens' seven essays as "diamond-hard and brilliant" and "word-perfect." He wrote that it was "sobering and grief-inducing to read this brave and harrowing account of his "year of living dyingly" in the grip of the alien that succeeded where none of his debate opponents had in bringing him down." Buckley was a friend of Hitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Christopher (30 August 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens.html?pagewanted=all "Review of ''Mortality'': Staying Power"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colm Tóibín]] fondly wrote in ''[[The Guardian]] ''of his experiences with Hitchens, opining that "he was the best company in the world" and offered praise for ''Mortality'', writing that "in this book he does everything to make sure that his voice remains civilised, searching and ready to vanquish all his enemies, most notably in this case the dullness of death and its silence."&lt;ref&gt;Tóibín, Colm (31 August 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"]'' ''in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Observer]] ''[[Alexander Linklater]] was also complimentary. Referring to [[John N. Gray|John Gray's]] description of Hitchens as "one of the greatest living writers of English prose",&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (6 October 2011) [http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/09/hitchens-trotsky-convictions "Review: ''Arguably'' by Christopher Hitchens"]'' ''in ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Linklater responded that "the only word of that which is certainly untrue is that Hitchens is now no longer living." He also noted: "The real struggle in ''Mortality'' is not with mortality. Hitchens cleaves to the logical conclusion of his materialism. He hints, rather, at a fear of losing himself, of becoming an imbecile, someone who might, in terror and pain, say something foolish or (God forbid) religious near the end, to give his enemies satisfaction. The true struggle of his last writings is to remain himself, deep in the country of the ill, for as long as he can."&lt;ref&gt;Linklater, Alexander (26 August 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/26/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"] in ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another positive review came from the magazine where Hitchens started his career, ''The New Statesman''. George Eaton wrote that Hitchens' final work had "a timeless, aphoristic quality".&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, George (7 September 2012) [http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/09/mortality-christopher-hitchens-–-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"] in ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northeastern Pomo''', also known as '''Salt Pomo''', is a [[Pomoan languages|Pomoan language]] of [[Northern California]]. There are no living fluent speakers. It was spoken along Stony Creek, a [[tributary]] of the [[Sacramento River]]. Northeastern was one of seven mutually unintelligible Pomoan languages spoken in Northern California. Unlike the other six Pomoan languages(going to north to south: Northern Pomo, Central Pomo, Eastern Pomo, Southeastern Pomo, Kashaya Pomo, Southern Pomo), Northeastern Pomo was not spoken in an area immediately contiguous with any other Pomoan-speaking area. Northeastern Pomo speakers were ringed by speakers of Yuki, Nomlaki, and Patwin; Yuki is unrelated to Pomoan or Nomlaki and Patwin, both of which are within the Wintu language family.

O. Davies]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Africans should follow India &amp;ndash; the only way is for Africans to co-operate and make sacrifices in the struggle for freedom."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ali Mazrui,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But the emergence of the Muslim League in India as a serious secessionist movement soon shattered the myth of unity in the Indian model. A new word entered the vocabulary of West African nationalism &amp;ndash; the word was 'pakistanism'."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ghana]]'s [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[Nigeria]]'s [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] became concerned about possible Pakistanization.&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azikiwe1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Zik: a selection from the speeches of Nnamdi Azikiwe |first=Nnamdi |last=Azikiwe |authorlink=Nnamdi Azikiwe |year=1961 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London |isbn= |page=173 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iec7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention People's Party]]'s 1954 Election Manifesto contain the following message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have seen the tragedy of religious communalism in India and elsewhere. Don't let us give it a chance to take root and flourish in Ghana. Down with Pakistanism!"&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p105"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Values and the Educated Class in Africa |first=Ali Al'Amin |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-03292-6 |page=105 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8F6eKRVysC&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pakistanism became a concern in [[Nigeria]]'s independence movement. The primary subdivisions of Nigeria consisted of the [[Hausa-Fulani]]-dominated [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]], the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-dominated [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]], and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-dominated [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]. In addition to  these ethnic differences, the Northern Region was primarily [[Muslim]], while the Western and Eastern regions were primarily [[Christian]]. In the 1950s, the Northern Region threatened to secede. [[Godfrey Mwakikagile]] noted that it was the Northern region that was the first region threatening to secede.&lt;ref name="mwakikagile1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria |first=Godfrey |last=Mwakikagile |authorlink=Godfrey Mwakikagile |year=2001 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=Huntington, NY |isbn=1-56072-967-8 |page=4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqTjUjdvTQwC&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1950 General Conference at Ibadan, Northern Region delegates demanded 50% of the seat in Nigeria's legislature, and they threatened to secede if this demand was not met.&lt;ref name="mwakikagile1"/&gt; In 1958, Nnamdi Azikiwe said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is essential that ill-will be not created in order to encourage a Pakistan in this country."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azikiwe1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original goal of the counter-coup against the government of [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]] on July 29, 1966, was to facilitate the Northern Region's secession from the rest of Nigeria.&lt;ref name="ikein1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oil, democracy, and the Promise of true Federalism in Nigeria |first1=Augustine A. |last1=Ikein |first2=Diepreye S.

In February 2011, Ali Mazrui used the term to describe the division of the [[Sudan]] into Sudan proper, which is primarily Muslim, and [[South Sudan]], which is primarily Christian and [[animism|animistic]].&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/sudan-secession-postcolonial-africa |title=Is this Pakistanism in Sudan? |first=Ali |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |date=2011-02-09 |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the characteristics of the [[Williams syndrome]] has been described as "pointed ears".&lt;ref name="JohnsonMunakata2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark H.

In one family a woman was born with two pointed ears, she later had a son with two less dramatically pointed ears, and she had a great uncle with one pointed ear.  Some cases of pointed ears may be due to trauma to ears during labor, and the ear crease may unfold with time.

[[File:Nikolai Zykov with hand puppets, Russia.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer with hand puppets.]]
A '''puppeteer''' is a person who manipulates an inanimate object that might be shaped like a human, animal or mythical creature, or another object to create the illusion that the [[puppet]] is "alive". The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet indirectly by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs. Some puppet styles require two or more puppeteers to work together to create a single puppet character.

The puppeteer's role is to manipulate the physical object in such a manner that the audience believes the object is imbued with life. In some instances, the persona of the puppeteer is also an important feature, as with [[ventriloquist's dummy]] performers, in which the puppeteer and the human figure-styled puppet appear onstage together, and in theatre shows like ''[[Avenue Q]]''.

The puppeteer might speak in the role of the puppet's character, synchronising the movements of the puppet's "mouth". However, there is much puppetry which does not use the moving mouth (which is a lip-sync innovation created originally for television where close-up "headshots" are popular). Often, in theatre, a moveable mouth is used only for gestural expression, or speech might be produced by a non-moving mouth. In traditional glove puppetry often one puppeteer will operate two puppets at a time out of a cast of several.
Much work is produced without any speech at all with all the emphasis on movement

The relationship between the puppeteer and the puppet-maker is similar to that between an [[actor]] and a [[playwright]], in cases where a puppet-maker designs a puppet for a puppeteer. Very often, though, the puppeteer assumes the joint roles of puppet-maker, [[Theatre director|director]], [[designer]], writer and [[performer]]. In this case a puppeteer is a more complete theatre practitioner than is the case with other theatre forms, in which one person writes a play, another person directs it, and then [[actor]]s perform the lines and gestures.

Puppetry is a complex medium sometimes consisting of live performance, sometimes contributing to stop frame puppet animation, and film where performances might be technically processed as motion capture, CGI or as virtual puppetry.

In 1956, [[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] published a paper called '''"Revitalization Movements"''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/people/mira.amiras/courses/c10/s2/AFC_Wallace_RevitalizationMvt.pdf   Wallace, Anthony F.C. 1956. "Revitalization Movements," ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 58: 264-281.]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how [[culture]]s change themselves.   A revitalization movement is a "deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;265), and Wallace describes at length the processes by which a revitalization movement takes place.

Wallace' model 1956 describes the process of a '''revitalization movement'''. It is derived from studies of a Native American religious movement, The Code of [[Handsome Lake]], which may have led to the formation of the [[Longhouse Religion]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{Plainlist|
*I. ''Period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to a group's social and natural environment.
*II. ''Period of increased individual stress''. While the group as a whole is able to survive through its accustomed  cultural behavior, changes in the social or natural environment frustrate efforts of many people to obtain normal satisfactions of their needs.
*III. ''Period of cultural distortion''. Changes in the group's social or natural environment drastically reduce the capacity of accustomed cultural behavior to satisfy most persons' physical and emotional needs.
*IV. ''Period of revitalization'': (1) reformulation of the cultural pattern; (2) its communication; (3) organization of a reformulated cultural pattern; (4) adaptation of the reformulated pattern to better meet the needs and preferences of the group; (5) cultural transformation; (6) routinization, when the adapted reformulated cultural pattern becomes the standard cultural behavior for the group.
*V. ''New period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to the group's changed social and/or natural environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace derived his theory from studies of so-called primitive peoples (preliterate and homogeneous), with particular attention to the [[Iroquois]] revitalization movement led by [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] religious leader and [[prophet]] [[Handsome Lake]] (1735-1815). Wallace believed that his revitalization model applies to movements as broad and complex as the rise of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Methodism]].

Revitalizaton is a part of social movements.

Scholars such as Vittorio Lanternari (1963) and Peter Worsley (1968) have developed and adapted Wallace's insights.

In informal usage, a '''Rosenwald School''' was any of the over five thousand [[school]]s, shops, and teachers' homes in the [[Education in the United States|United States]] which were built primarily for the education of [[African-American]] children in the South in the early 20th century. The project was the product of the partnership of [[Julius Rosenwald]], a Jewish American [[tailor|clothier]] who became part-owner and president of [[Sears Holdings Corporation|Sears, Roebuck and Company]] and the African American leader, educator, philanthropist and president of [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], [[Booker T. Washington]].&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutsch |first1=Stephanie |title=You Need a Schoolhouse: Booker T. Washington, Julius Rosenwald, and the Building of Schools for the Segregated South |date=2015 |publisher=Northwestern University Press |location=Evanston, Illinois |isbn=0-8101-3127-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need arose from the chronic underfunding of public education for African-American children in the South, as black people had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] at the turn of the century and excluded from the political system in that region. Children were required to attend racially segregated schools.

Rosenwald was the founder of [[Rosenwald Fund|The Rosenwald Fund]]. He contributed [[seed money]] for many of the schools and other [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] causes, requiring local communities to raise matching funds to increase their commitment to these projects.

To promote collaboration between white and black citizens, Rosenwald required communities to commit public funds and/or labor to the schools, as well as to contribute additional cash donations. White school boards had to agree to operate and maintain the schools, and millions of dollars were raised by African-American rural communities across the South to fund better education for their children. Despite this program, by the mid-1930s, white schools in the South were worth, per student, more than five times what black schools were worth per student (in majority-black Mississippi, this ratio was more than 13 to one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Neil R. |last=McMillen |title=Dark Journey: Black Mississippians in the Age of Jim Crow |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-252-06156-X |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the Rosenwald-Washington Collaboration==
In the segregated schools of the South, African American children were sent to woefully underfunded schools. The collaboration of Rosenwald and Washington led to the construction of almost 5,000 schools for black children in the eleven states of the former Confederacy as well as Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland.  As a result of their collaboration approximately one-third of African American children were educated in these schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooker|first1=Russell|last2=Kaplan|first2=Fran|title=The Rosenwald Schools: An Impressive Legacy of Black-Jewish Collaboration for Negro Education|url=http://abhmuseum.org/2012/07/the-rosenwald-schools-an-impressive-legacy-of-black-jewish-collaboration-for-negro-education/|publisher=America's Black Holocaust Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615141917/http://www.abhmuseum.org/2012/07/the-rosenwald-schools-an-impressive-legacy-of-black-jewish-collaboration-for-negro-education/|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenwald-Washington model required the buy-in of African American communities as well as the support of white governing bodies. Black communities raised more than $4.7 million to aid in construction [https://web.archive.org/web/20060515144853/http://ford.claiborneone.org/], plus often donating land and labor. Research has found that the Rosenwald program accounts for a sizable portion of the educational gains of rural Southern black persons in this period. This research also found significant effects on school attendance, literacy, years of schooling, cognitive test scores, and Northern migration, with gains highest in the most disadvantaged counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_26.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, "The Impact of Rosenwald Schools on Black Achievement"], September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Julius Rosenwald==
{{Main article|Julius Rosenwald}}
[[Image:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mr. Rosenwald.|Julius Rosenwald]]
Julius Rosenwald (1862–1932) was born to a [[German people|German]]-[[Jew]]ish immigrant family. He became a clothier by trade after learning the business from relatives in [[New York City]].  His first business went bankrupt; however, another he began in [[Chicago, Illinois]] became a leading supplier to [[Richard Warren Sears|Richard Sears]]' business. Sears, Roebuck and Company was a growing [[mail-order]] business which served many rural Americans. Anticipating demand by using the variations of sizes in American men and their clothing determined during the [[American Civil War]], Rosenwald helped plan the growth in what many years later [[marketing|marketer]]s would call "the softer side of Sears": clothing. In 1895, he became one of its investors, eventually serving as the president of Sears from 1908 to 1922. He was its chairman until his death in 1932.

After the 1906 reorganization of the Sears company as a public [[stock]] corporation by the financial services firm of [[Goldman Sachs]], one of the senior partners, [[Paul Sachs]], often stayed with the Rosenwald family at their home during his many trips to Chicago. Julius Rosenwald and Sachs would often discuss America's social situation, agreeing that the plight of [[African American]]s was the most serious problem in the United States. The millions in the South had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] at the turn of the century and suffered second-class status in a system of [[Jim Crow]] segregation. Black public schools and other facilities were chronically underfunded.

==Role of Booker T. Washington==
{{Main article|Booker T. Washington}}
[[File:Booker_T_Washington_retouched_flattened-crop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mr. Washington.|Booker T. Washington]]
Sachs introduced Rosenwald to [[Booker T. Washington]], (1856 - 1915) the famed educator who in 1881 started as the first principal of the [[normal school]] which he developed as [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama. Washington, who had gained the respect of many American leaders including U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], had also obtained financial support from wealthy philanthropists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[George Eastman]] and [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]]. He encouraged Rosenwald, as he had others, to address the poor state of African-American education in the U.S.

In 1912, Rosenwald was asked to serve on the Board of Directors of Tuskegee, a position he held until his death in 1932. Rosenwald [[Financial endowment|endowed]] Tuskegee so that Washington could spend less time traveling to seek funding and devote more time toward management of the school. As urged by Washington, Rosenwald provided funds for the construction of six small schools in rural [[Alabama]], which were constructed and opened in 1913 and 1914 and overseen by Tuskegee.

==Rosenwald Fund==
[[Image:Pine Grove Rosenwald School Interior.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inside a restored school.|Because many schools were located in areas lacking electricity, the fund designed architectural plans that made the most of natural light]]
Julius Rosenwald and his family established [[Rosenwald Fund|The Rosenwald Fund]] in 1917 for "the well-being of mankind." Unlike other endowed foundations, which were designed to fund themselves in perpetuity, The Rosenwald Fund was intended to use all of its funds for philanthropic purposes. It donated over 70 million dollars to [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], [[college]]s and [[university|universities]], [[museum]]s, Jewish [[charitable trust|charities]] and black institutions before funds were completely depleted in 1948.

The school building program was one of the largest programs administered by the Rosenwald Fund. Using state-of-the-art architectural plans designed by professors at Tuskegee Institute,&lt;ref name="tusarch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/southern-region/rosenwald-schools/history.html#Tuskegee |title=History of the Rosenwald School Program |publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fund spent more than four million dollars to build 4,977 schools, 217 teachers' homes, and 163 shop buildings in 883 counties in 15 states, from Maryland to Texas. The Rosenwald Fund was based on a system of matching grants, requiring white school boards to commit to maintenance and black communities to aid in construction.

==Preservation==
[[Image:Tankersley Rosenwald School 05.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Inside a Rosenwald School.|Interior of a Rosenwald School]]
In some communities, surviving structures have been preserved because of the deep meaning they had for African Americans as symbols of their leaders' and communities' dedication to education. Others were threatened by lack of funds in rural areas, urbanization and changes in demographics, changing style of education to consolidated and integrated schools, and other social changes.  

Former Rosenwald students have led some efforts to preserve Rosenwald Schools.  For example, in Georgia, three former Rosenwald Schools were preserved by the efforts of former students and Georgia's Historic Preservation Division, leading to their being listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by 2001.&lt;ref name=reflections&gt;{{cite journal|title=Saving Georgia's Rosenwald Schools |url=http://georgiashpo.org/sites/uploads/hpd/pdf/Reflections/Reflections_August_2001.pdf |journal=Reflections |publisher=Historic Preservation Division, Georgia Department of Natural Resources |date=August 2001| page=3–5 |volume=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] named Rosenwald Schools near the top of the country's most endangered places [http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=100899&amp;ran=189503] and created a campaign to raise awareness and money for preservation.  At least 60 former Rosenwald Schools are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;At least 60 in [[List of Rosenwald Schools]] are documented to be NRHP-listed.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the National Trust classified the Rosenwald Schools as National Treasures.

[[File:Barney_Colored_Elementary_School_historical_marker_dedication.jpg|thumb|right|Historical marker dedication for Barney Colored Elementary School in Brooks County, Georgia]]In Georgia, several Rosenwald School sites have been commemorated through the Georgia Historical Marker Program, currently administered by the [[Georgia Historical Society]]. In partnership with community organizations, markers have been erected for the Hiram Rosenwald School (2006, Paulding County), Macon County Training School (2016, Macon County), Barney Colored Elementary School (2013, Brooks County), and Noble Hill Rosenwald School (1995 by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Bartow County).

Some schools have been adapted for new uses. Walnut Cove Colored School in [[Stokes County, North Carolina]] won a National Preservation Honor Award for its rehabilitation for use as a [[senior citizen]]s' community center. The [[Hope Rosenwald School]] in [[Pomaria, South Carolina|Pomaria]], [[South Carolina]] will also be used as a community center. The Highland Park School in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] had been in continuous use by the school system. It was recently renovated for use as a Headstart Center.  The Canetuck Rosenwald School in Currie, North Carolina has been renovated by the local Black community and is used as a busy community center. The [[Beauregard Parish Training School]] in [[DeRidder, Louisiana]] was renovated with a federal grant in 2007 and open in 2009 as ''BeauCare Head Start''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kplctv.com/story/11383536/historic-deridder-school-starts-new-chapter KPLCTV: Historic DeRidder school starts new chapter]- Retrieved 2016-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seibal St.11.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stela 11 at Seibal.]]
'''Seibal''' ({{IPA-es|seiˈβal}}), known as '''El Ceibal''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is a [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] archaeological site of the [[Maya civilization]] located in the northern [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]], about 100 km SW of [[Tikal]]. It was the largest city in the [[Pasión River]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006 p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was occupied from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic Period]] through to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]], with a significant hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520. Kelly 1996, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal phase of occupation dates to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] (400 BC &amp;ndash; AD 200), followed by a decline in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] (AD 200&amp;ndash;600).&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; Seibal experienced a significant recovery in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] immediately prior to its complete abandonment,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; reaching its second peak from about 830 to 890, with a population estimated at 8&amp;ndash;10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 689. Kelly 1996, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The dates on the [[Maya stelae|stelae]] at Seibal are unusually late, with monuments still being dedicated after the [[Classic Maya collapse]] had engulfed most of the Petén region.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Seibal's late monuments show artistic influence from central [[Mexico]] and from the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]].

The early history of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby [[Petexbatun]] kingdom with its capital at [[Dos Pilas]], resulting in the destruction of its earlier [[Monumental sculpture|sculpted monuments]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Seibal was reduced to being a [[vassal state]] until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of [[Wat'ul Chatel]] from [[Ucanal]] to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, well after the [[Classic Maya collapse]] had engulfed most of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Seibal'' is a corruption of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''ceibal'', meaning "place where many [[ceiba]] trees grow". ''El Ceibal'' was the name of a lumber camp near the ruins at the time of their discovery. The change in spelling originated with a publication by [[Teoberto Maler]] in 1908, which used a [[German language|Germanic]] form with initial "s".&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 9. Kelly 1996, p. 154. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 175. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Seibal is located on bluffs about {{convert|100|m|ft}} above the [[Pasión River]], a major tributary of the [[Usumacinta River]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520. Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; About {{convert|100|km|mi}} downstream, the Pasión River joins with the [[Salinas River (Guatemala)|Salinas River]] to form the Usumacinta, which flows northwards to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The site lies in the Petén [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of northern [[Guatemala]], {{convert|16|km|mi}} east of the modern town of [[Sayaxché]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Seibal lay {{convert|27|km|mi}} east of the Late Classic city of [[Dos Pilas]] and {{convert|100|km|mi}} south of [[Tikal]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 58. Smith 1968, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Petén Itzá]] lies {{convert|60|km|mi}} to the north of the ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seibal lies among [[tropical rainforest]] on a [[limestone]] plain that is intermittently hilly and flat.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys have revealed an average of 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 690.&lt;/ref&gt; population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion that appears to have occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 689. Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 2002, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 900&amp;ndash;1200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Stratification===
The social stratification of Seibal was that of priest-kings, as well as nobility and elites living in the main ceremonial center, with the common people living in the peripheries of the city.  During the 1964-68 excavations, 34 of the 45 found burials were from the peripheral zone, showing the distribution of population by class.&lt;ref&gt;Willey and Smith 1975-1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site was occupied by the Middle Preclassic, then declined from the Late Preclassic through to the Early Classic, with a renewed expansion in the Late to Terminal Classic before being completely abandoned.

===Preclassic===
Seibal was first settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its peak population in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, at the end of the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 288-9. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willey and Smith 1975-1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya ceramics|Ceramics]] from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A cruciform [[Olmec]]-style cache consisting of a [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletter]] and [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] [[Celt (tool)|celts]] is similar to those found in the [[Olmec heartland]] on the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]], and the artifacts were probably manufactured at [[La Venta]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 54. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Real/Xe complex, came the Escoba period, dating to approximately 600CE-300CE. The ceramics between these two periods are similar, but Escoba ceramics are more extensive and stratigraphically separated. There is also evidence during this time of the population increase that would peak at the end of the Cantutse period.&lt;ref&gt;Willey and Smith 1975-1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest settlement in the Middle Preclassic was mostly confined to Group&amp;nbsp;A. After 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic, settlement expanded to include Group&amp;nbsp;D.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, there is evidence of ceremonial structures being build both in Group A and D.

By the end of the Late Preclassic (or Protoclassic), Seibal experienced an unexplained decline in population.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Classic===
During the Early Classic, the decline that began in the Late Preclassic continued unabated until the site was all but abandoned around AD 300 for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 84. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Classic===
Seibal underwent a revival in the Late Classic with an expansion of occupation linked to the great city of [[Tikal]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; About AD 650 new inhabitants moved into the city in order to found a new kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups&amp;nbsp;A and D saw new construction, with a particular emphasis on Group&amp;nbsp;D, which became an important part of the ceremonial centre.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Any monuments raised by the Late Classic rulers responsible for this renewed occupation were defaced when the city suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the defeat of Seibal, foreign influences can be seen from Central Mexico in the art and stelae of the site dating to the Bayal phase (mid-700 CE-post-classic).&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, F.J. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mention of Seibal in [[Maya script|hieroglyphic inscriptions]] is on Stela&amp;nbsp;15 at Dos Pilas, dated to 13 October 721, and refers to Seibal becoming involved in the long-running war between the great cities of Tikal and [[Calakmul]] and their respective allies and vassals. Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the [[Petexbatún]] region, established by Tikal to exert its control over the Pasión River, a strategy that backfired when Calakmul seized control of the fledgling kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defeat====
[[File:Dos Pilas Stela 16 detail.jpg|thumb|right|Part of relief at the base of Dos Pilas Stela 16 showing both the Seibal emblem glyph and the face of Yich'aak B'alam]]
In AD 735 [[Ucha'an K'in B'alam]], the third king of [[Dos Pilas]], attacked Seibal, capturing [[Yich'aak B'alam]]. The captive king was not executed but rather became a vassal of his more powerful neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520. Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 58, 61. Coe 1999, p. 130. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Ucha'an K'in B'alam raised monuments to his victory over Seibal at Dos Pilas, [[Aguateca]] and Seibal itself.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Yich'aak B'alam is shown under the feet of Ucha'an K'in B'alam on [[Aguateca]] Stela&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; At Seibal a hieroglyphic stairway was built recording the city's new status as a vassal of Dos Pilas. At the same time as he erected these monuments to his victory, Ucha'an K'in B'alam ordered the destruction of the hieroglyphic records on the earlier monuments of Seibal, with inscriptions at Dos Pilas and Aguateca specifically recording the destruction of Seibal's previously recorded history using phrases that translate as "they destroyed the writing" and "they chopped the writing off the statues that were made".&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yich'aak B'alam continued as a vassal under the next king of Dos Pilas, [[K'awiil Chan K'inich]], who presided over rituals at Seibal in 745 and 747.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seibal regained its independence in the late 8th century with the destruction of the Dos Pilas kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; Ajaw B'ot acceded to the throne in AD 771, restoring Seibal as an independent capital.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; After AD 800 Seibal fell into a thirty-year hiatus during which no new monuments were erected.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminal Classic===
[[Image:El Ceibal 1.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of Stela 11 at Seibal, showing king [[Wat'ul Chatel]].&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 66; Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With its independence came a new  apogee, and for a brief time Seibal became a prominent regional capital located on the important Pasión River [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade route]]. The [[Maya architecture|architecture]] and ceramics from this period demonstrate connections with the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and the Gulf Coast of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen stelae carved between AD 849 and 889 show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of [[Ehecatl]], the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth, carvings of foreign-style foot slippers, and squared cartouches. Some of these stelae have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at [[Cacaxtla]], a site in the central [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Tlaxcala]]. This hybrid style seem to indicate that the new lords of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 522. Coe 1999, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes at Seibal at this time are associated with the [[Putún Maya|Chontal]]-controlled trade flowing along the Pasión River. The Chontal Maya themselves were warrior-merchants originating from the Gulf Coast of Mexico who displayed a mixture of Maya and non-Maya characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 528-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal indicate that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of [[Caracol]] and [[Ucanal]] in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading [[Classic Maya collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 522-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of [[Tikal]], and Chan Pet, king of [[Calakmul]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 313, 361, 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement to the south of the Central Plaza of Group&amp;nbsp;A. Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3 consists of a low radial [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wat'ul Chatel's last monument was erected in 889. This stela is also the last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 524. Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.

The late stelae at Seibal show a marked reduction in quality over a span of about forty years, with the loss of Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae. This may reflect the loss of expertise in the Terminal Classic, with craftsmen less able to work monuments and large structures as time progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The ruins of Seibal were probably discovered around 1890 by loggers working for the Hamett Mahogany Company. Federico Arthes, an owner of logging company Arthes and Sons, first reported the existence of the ruins of Saxtanquiqui, the Maya name of the site, in 1892 in a public article for the Guatemala City paper. He resided and did business in the Peten. The [[Politics of Guatemala|Guatemalan government]] nominated Senor Arthes Comisionado Especial to collect material to be displayed in the Guatemalan exhibit for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]]. He was having very little luck getting satisfactory material at Tikal due to lack of available water for the plaster casting at which point he traveled to Saxtanquiqui with Gorgonio Lopez Toledo, a former assistant to Alfred Maudley. He took molds from some of the stelae and the resulting casts were displayed in the Exposition, bringing the recent discovery of the ruins to the attention of archaeologists for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; After the exposition closed, the casts were given to the Peabody Museum. Photographs of the stelae are still catalogued under the name "Sactankiki", the western spelling used by Maler after his expedition but a name he later wrote about with derision.

Two years later, in July 1895, Seibal was explored by [[Teoberto Maler]] on behalf of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] of [[Harvard University]]. He made a site plan and discovered a new stela to add to those already discovered. He returned to the site for further investigations in August 1905 but discovered no new monuments. The Peabody Museum published Maler's work in 1908, including good quality photos of the stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seibal was next investigated by [[Sylvanus Morley]] in 1914 on behalf of the [[Carnegie Institution]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr [[Barnum Brown]] visited the ruins in 1948, and members of the [[Altar de Sacrificios]] Expedition of the Peabody Museum made visits in 1961, 1962 and 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the Peabody Museum returned to the site with a thorough investigation that continued until 1968, led by [[Gordon Willey|Gordon R. Willey]] as director and [[A. Ledyard Smith]] as field director.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520. Kelly 1996, p. 159. Smith 1968, pp. 82, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations were carried out from May to June in 2006 by the Proyecto Arqueológico Ceibal-Petexbatun (Seibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project).&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano et al 2007, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
Seibal is a medium-sized site.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The site core is divided into three principal hilltop groups (Groups A, C and D) connected by causeways and covers a little over 1&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520. Smith 1968, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The causeways were faced with masonry and had parapets in places.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Causeway&amp;nbsp;I is the western causeway, Causeway&amp;nbsp;II is the south causeway and Causeway&amp;nbsp;III is the eastern causeway.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Group&amp;nbsp;D is a fortress refuge concealed above the river frontage.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Group&amp;nbsp;B is a small complex located about {{convert|3|km|mi}} from the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Group&amp;nbsp;A is smaller than Group&amp;nbsp;D but has most of the sculptured monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Various small housemound groups lie beyond the site core. They are spaced between {{convert|50|and|100|m|yd}} apart, extending for several kilometers to the north, south and west.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two structures have been restored at Seibal, the A-3&amp;nbsp;temple platform and the C-79&amp;nbsp;circular platform, topped with the Jaguar Altar. Both were restored during the investigations carried out by the Peabody Museum in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seibal possesses a satellite site located to the north, known as El Anonal. This site has large structures built from clay that date to the Middle Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 449, 469.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
'''Group A''' is in the site core. It features three plazas, the North, South and Central Plazas and lies at the west end of Causeway&amp;nbsp;I. Group&amp;nbsp;A has more than fifty mounds arranged around the three plazas.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 520. Smith 1968, p. 85. Ponciano et al 2007, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Monuments dating to the period when Seibal was a vassal of Dos Pilas (AD 735&amp;ndash;761) are situated in the Central Plaza of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt; In this group, there is also a ball court that is dated to the Terminal Classic and stylistically resembles that at Uxmal.&lt;ref&gt;Willey and Smith 1975-1990&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group C''' lies on Causeway&amp;nbsp;II, which passes through it to end at the circular Structure&amp;nbsp;C-79. Group&amp;nbsp;C has over forty mounds.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group D''' is a compact group at the east end of Causeway&amp;nbsp;III, it is perched in an easily defensible position at the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Pasión river.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; It has more than seventy structures crowded around five plazas. Group&amp;nbsp;D only had one stela, which was a plain monument erected in front of a {{convert|20|m|ft|adj=on}} high stepped pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Patio''' of Group&amp;nbsp;A is part of an acropolis complex located behind Structure&amp;nbsp;A-14. The complex is situated upon a massive platform raised almost {{convert|7|m|ft}} above the natural surface level. The patio was accessed by a stairway on the south side. It includes Structures&amp;nbsp;A-15 and A-16.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano et al 2007, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruines El Ceibal.JPG|thumb|right|Structure A-3]]
'''Structure A-3''' is a temple platform located in the centre of the south plaza. It has a stairway ascending each of its four sides. Five stelae are associated with this structure, one located at the base of each stairway and a fifth inside the building surmounting the platform.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 520. Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Three large jade cobbles were interred under the central stela.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure and its associated stelae were dedicated in AD 849 by king Wat'ul Chatel (also known as Aj B'olon Haab'tal).&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.523. Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3 has the remains of a [[Corbel arch|corbeled]] vault, the only surviving example at Seibal.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement of the radial pyramid with its associated stelae was highly innovative. The radial temple form was ancient in the Maya region, dating back to the Late Preclassic, but Wat'ul Chatel placed upon it a square shrine with four doors, one opening onto each of the stairways. The temple building contained three vaulted chambers oriented north-south, with doors joining each chamber along an east-west axis. The [[cornice]] of the temple supported a brightly coloured [[stucco]] [[frieze]]. The frieze collapsed with the temple in ancient times. Archaeologists were able to recover portions of the fallen frieze and attempt a reconstruction of how it originally appeared. Each of the four doors was originally topped by a larger-than-life sculpture of king Wat'ul Chatel. Twelve smaller figures were spaced around the cornice, one at each corner with an additional figure positioned half-way between each corner and the central figure of the king. It is not known who these smaller figures represented. The spaces between the figures were occupied by panels with cross-hatch designs and sculpted vegetation and animals. Old gods sat in the centre of each of the sixteen panels, including [[Itzamna]] and [[Pawatun]]. Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3 was built over an earlier platform structure.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 179-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure A-10''', a {{convert|28|m|ft|adj=on}} tall temple-pyramid, is the tallest structure at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure A-13''' is a radial pyramid. Excavations uncovered a mass burial (Burial 4) with parts of eleven people, including two women and a child. This was not a traditional Classic Maya burial and has been dated to AD 930, very late in the occupation of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, pp. 63, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure A-14''' is covered by the forest that has overgrown the northern part of the Central Plaza. It is a range structure running north-south and once had a hieroglyphic stairway detailing Seibal's defeat by Dos Pilas, although the inscriptions have now been removed to the old project camp.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 178. Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 451-452.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was found to contain an elite female burial, labelled as Burial&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure A-15''' is located on the north side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a long, low structure running east-west and closing the patio on the north side. It measures {{convert|24|by|8|m|ft}} by {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} tall. The building contained a long room with a wide entrance opening southwards onto the patio, raised from the patio by a step. The room contained a stone bench built from reused blocks. The structure was superimposed upon two earlier substructures, the earliest of which had a different orientation to the final building. All three periods of construction appear to date to the Terminal Classic, with the last phase perhaps dating to about the time of the fall of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 449-451, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure A-16''' is located on the northeast side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a rectangular structure measuring {{convert|16|by|10|m|ft}}, running north-south and facing to the west. The remains of the structure stand {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} high. The western side of the building had been damaged by looters prior to archaeological investigation. The looters' trench measured {{convert|5|by|0.8|m|ft}} by {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} deep and cut through the structure's floor, bench and rear wall but did not uncover any burials or offerings. Fallen limestone blocks and slabs reveal that the structure once had a corbel-vaulted chamber. Fragments of [[stucco]] were also recovered, they once made up a colourful frieze above the front of the building that included modelled human figures. The stucco still had traces of orange, green and yellow paint. The building was a palace-type structure with perhaps six rooms, three on the west side and three on the east, and it was originally roofed in stone. The interior had an L-shaped bench. The structure was built of finely cut limestone blocks and the walls were coated with stucco painted orange and turquoise. It is believed that the building was part of a Terminal Classic royal palace with architectural features similar to those of the temple Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 449-454, 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ceibal.jpg|thumb|left|The unusual circular structure C-79.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Structure A-19''' and '''Structure C-9''' are [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]]s. They have a resemblance to ballcourts at [[Chichen Itza]].&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, pp. 71-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ballcourts are aligned east-west, an unusual feature in the Maya area, although the [[topography]] of the site severely restricted the layout of the city to a principally east-west orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough 1991, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballcourt&amp;nbsp;A-19 lies on the west side on the north plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 520. Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure C-79''' is a circular three-tiered platform built during the Terminal Classic on top of a pre-existing structure dating to the Late Preclassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 158. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Circular structures such as this  have their origin in central Mexico, where they are typically temples of [[Ehecatl]], the god of wind.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.520. Miller &amp; Taube p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the structure at Seibal was surmounted by a rectangular building platform, whereas the temple buildings of Ehecatl were also circular.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;C-79 has two stairways, the larger ascends the west side, the smaller is on the east side.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A circular jaguar altar rests on three pedestals before the structure, two of these are crouching figures that originally supported the altar, the third central column is modern and was put in place as an additional support during restoration of the ruins. The altar has the crude representation of a jaguar's head carved onto its edge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 91. Kelly 1996, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure&amp;nbsp;C-79 and the associated altar are dated to about AD 870.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monuments of Seibal include a number of [[Stele|stelae]], carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. The monuments at Seibal are fashioned from a hard [[limestone]], accounting for their generally excellent preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; During excavations in the 1960s, 57 [[stele|stelae]] were identified. Of these 22 were sculpted and 35 were plain.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hieroglyphic Stairway 1''' was located on the front of Structure&amp;nbsp;A-14.&lt;ref&gt;Ponciano et al 2007, p.451.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairway was installed by king Ucha'an K'in B'alam of Dos Pilas to record Seibal's status as a vassal after its defeat by that city. The stones are no longer ''in situ'', having been removed to the area of the camp of the old archaeological project.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 1''', on the north side of the South Plaza near Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3, names someone called "Knife-Wing", who is also known at distant Chichen Itza. It is dated to AD 869.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005, pp69-70. Kelly 1996, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 2''' is believed to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts the frontal view of a masked figure and is the only monument at Seibal to show a frontal portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp. 156-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It was broken into six or seven pieces and has been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1968, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 3''' bears a [[Mesoamerican calendars|non-Maya calendrical date]], one of the glyphs is ''[[cipactli]]'', a crocodile head used to represent the first day of the 260-day calendar in central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2001, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This stela once stood next to Stela&amp;nbsp;2 but was removed to a museum in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 4''' is badly damaged, having been broken into pieces by a falling tree. It was lost for sixty years before being rediscovered. It currently remains buried under a thin covering of soil.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 5''' lies to the north of the South Plaza and is badly damaged. The broken middle section of the stela is all that is left, it bears the representation of a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayer]] and dates to about AD 780.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 6''' is slightly to the north of Stela&amp;nbsp;5, bearing hieroglyphic text. This stela was damaged in antiquity when the upper part was broken off and erected by an altar nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 7''' stands to the north of stelae&amp;nbsp;5 and 6. It is in a reasonable state of preservation and bears the image of a ruler dressed as a ballplayer. This monument was probably dedicated in AD 780, although it records the accession of a king of Seibal in AD 771.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 8''' is a well-preserved monument on the south side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 156. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; In one hand the king holds the head of the god [[K'awiil]]. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of [[Jacawitz]], the name of one of the patron gods of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj]] in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the [[K'iche' people]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 190-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 9''' was erected on the west side of Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3. It is badly damaged and one section is missing.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp. 154, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The stela depicts Wat'ul Chatel with the attributes of the [[Maya maize god|Maize God]] and describes him invoking the [[Vision Serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 10''' is on the north side of Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts Wat'ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, although his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|emblem glyphs]] of [[Tikal]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Motul de San José]], describing how he received visitors from those cities.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 523. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and [[Kan Ek']] of Motul.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Wat'ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K'awiil, deities that were also the patrons of [[Palenque]]. This appears to be an attempt by this foreign king to identify himself more closely with the city he came to rule.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 11''' is on the east side of Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3 and describes the refounding of Seibal on 14 March 830 and the installation of its new lord, Wat'ul Chatel, as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 523. Kelly 1996, p. 156. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; A panel beneath the portrait of the ruler depicts a bound captive.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.156. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The hieroglyphic inscription describes how Wat'ul Chatel arrived with his [[palanquin]]s and his patron deities.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 13''' stands a little to the west of the South Plaza. It dates to AD 870.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 14''' dates to about AD 870 and stands at the junction of two causeways and is in a good state of preservation. It has stylistic similarities with sculptures at distant Chichen Itza in the extreme north of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 18''' is one of the last stelae to be erected at Seibal, it lies {{convert|20|m|ft}} west of the group of monuments consisting of Stelae&amp;nbsp;5, 6 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 19''' demonstrates the foreign influences prevalent at Seibal during the Late Classic. It depicts a lord wearing a mask representing the central Mexican wind god [[Ehecatl]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.522.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 20''' stands to the west of the South Plaza. It was one of the last monuments to be erected at Seibal, dating to AD 889.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 21''' is located inside the chamber at the top of Structure&amp;nbsp;A-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber collapsed on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela&amp;nbsp;8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 156. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp. 193-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides its own particular contents, the album is known for being the first soundtrack ever written for a book.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
The album was recorded in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1982 and released by Applause Records.&lt;ref name="tomlord"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lord | first =Tom | title =The Jazz Discography | publisher =Cadence Jazz Books | date =October 1982 | id = Entry: H82-48 - &lt;u&gt;Space Jazz&lt;/u&gt; | isbn =1-881993-02-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1983 press release put out by the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] subsidiary company [[Author Services Inc.]] marketed the [[concept album]] as "the only original sound track ever produced for a book before it becomes a movie".&lt;ref name="pressrelease01261983"&gt;{{cite news | last =[[Author Services Inc.]] (Press release) | title =PR Newswire, January 26, 1983 | work =PR Newswire | publisher =PR Newswire Association, Inc. | date =1983-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album includes performances by prominent musicians [[Chick Corea]] (keyboards), [[Stanley Clarke]] (bass), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (keyboards) and [[Gayle Moran]] (keyboards/vocals).&lt;ref name="tomlord" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berkwits" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Rusch  | first = Bob   | title = Battlefield Earth  | journal = [[Cadence Magazine]]  | volume = 11  | page = 23  | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins was known for his work in rock and roll, the others mainly as jazz musicians; all were, at the time, associated with Scientology. The album features extensive use of the [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer.&lt;ref name="berkwits" /&gt;  A demonstration of the "computer space jazz" soundtrack was one of the festival displays at the 1982 [[US Festival]] rock concert in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Wilson | first =Jeff | title =You couldn't have put this on in the Sixties... | work =[[United Press International]] | date =1982-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Ron Hubbard's son [[Ronald DeWolf]] filed a probate case in November 1982, after his father had not made any public appearances since 1980, requesting to be appointed trustee of Hubbard's estate on the grounds that his father was missing or dead.&lt;ref name="lamont"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lamont | first =Stewart | title =[[Religion Inc.]] | publisher =Harrap | date =June 1986 | pages =153–155 | isbn =0-245-54334-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, attorneys representing Hubbard produced a letter in Hubbard's handwriting and with his fingerprints, in which he wrote that he had not had a leadership role in the [[Church of Scientology]] for "nearly 17 years", and mentioned his new novel ''Battlefield Earth'', his recently released album ''Space Jazz'', and 10-volume novel ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]]''.&lt;ref name="mathews"&gt;{{cite news | last =Mathews | first =Jay  | title =Sect's Missing Founder Leaves Legal Morass | work =[[The Washington Post]] | page =A2 | publisher =[[The Washington Post Company]] | date =1983-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I am actively writing, having published ''Battlefield Earth'', and my ''Space Jazz'' album; a projected ten-volume work, ''Mission Earth'', is in the pre-publication stage at the moment", said Hubbard's statement.&lt;ref name="lamont" /&gt; In conjunction with the release of Hubbard's letter, Church of Scientology President [[Heber Jentzsch]] told the press that Hubbard had produced ''Space Jazz'' around December 1982, and wrote the majority of songs and [[lyrics]] for the computer-based music on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Arnold | first =Jay | title =Church Repeats Contention That Hubbard Still Alive | work =[[Associated Press]] | date =1983-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[LP album|LP]] was retitled to ''Battlefield Earth''.&lt;ref name="berkwits"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Berkwits   | first = Jeff   | title = Singing the Body Electric: Science Fiction Writers and Their Music   | newspaper = Locus Online  | publisher = www.locusmag.com  | date = September 13, 2003  | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/Berkwits09_Songwriters.html  |accessdate = 2009-09-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1987 statement from Norman F. Starkey, the executor of Hubbard's estate, the copyright to Hubbard's works passed to the Church of Scientology after his death.&lt;ref name="hubbardleft"&gt;{{cite news  | last =[[Associated Press]] | title =L. Ron Hubbard Left $26 Million Estate | work =[[Los Angeles Daily News|Daily News of Los Angeles]] | page =17 | date =1987-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to copyright of ''Space Jazz'', other copyrighted music titles by Hubbard included "Tarzan", "The Black Cape" and "Snake Head".&lt;ref name="hubbardleft" /&gt;

==Reception==
A 1983 review of the work for ''[[Stereo Review]]'' commented that the wording used in the jacket copy of the album was "hyperbolic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Stereo Review staff  | title = Space Jazz  | journal = [[Stereo Review]]  | volume = 48  | page = 76  | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 review for ''Locus Online'', Jeff Berkwits noted: "The eclectic 1982 album is reportedly the first soundtrack ever written for a book, and highlights performances from jazz greats Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke".&lt;ref name="berkwits" /&gt; A copy of ''Space Jazz'' was given out to the first prize recipient in the 2006 Worst Record competition by the [[New Jersey]] newspaper the ''Hunterdon Democrat''.&lt;ref name="garchik" /&gt;

'''Structuralism''' is a movement in architecture and urban planning evolved around the middle of the 20th century. It was a reaction to [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM-Functionalism]] ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|Rationalism]]) &lt;ref name="CIAM VI"&gt;Aldo van Eyck, "Statement Against Rationalism", written for CIAM VI in 1947. In: ''Aldo van Eyck - Writings'', Amsterdam 2008. Statement against CIAM-formulations like: ''"Urban planning can never be determined by aesthetic considerations but exclusively by functional conclusions."'' This formulation came from architects of the Rationalist movement, written for the CIAM-declaration in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; which had led to a lifeless expression of urban planning that ignored the identity of the inhabitants and urban forms.

[[Structuralism]] in a general sense is a mode of thought of the 20th century, which came about in different places, at different times and in different fields. It can also be found in linguistics, anthropology, philosophy and art. At the beginning of the general article [[Structuralism]] the following explanations are noted:

''"Structuralism is a theoretical [[paradigm]] emphasizing that '''elements of culture''' must be understood in terms of their relationship to a larger, '''overarching system''' or '''structure'''."''

Alternately, as summarized by philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], ''"Structuralism is the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture."''

== Structuralism as parallel movement to Postmodernism ==


In Europe, structuralism is seen as a parallel movement to American postmodern architecture. The first interpretations of both movements came up in the 1960s. Through publications and presentations by authors such as [[Charles Jencks]], [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]], postmodern architecture was successful throughout the world for decades. While postmodernism is concerned with an architectural style, many aspects of architecture and urbanism are treated in the structuralist movement.

[[File:Yamanashi Culture Chamber.jpg|thumb|right|Yamanashi Culture Chamber in [[Kofu]], Prototype of an interpretable, adaptable and expandable architecture, 1967 ([[Kenzo Tange]])]]
In contrast to the postmodern movement, structuralism has developed more slowly, less noticeably during several periods in the last decades. The theoretical contributions of structuralism were developed in [[Europe]], [[Japan]], [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]]. In 2011, the first comprehensive compilation of structuralist activity appeared in a publication called ''Structuralism Reloaded''.&lt;ref name="Valena"&gt;Tomas Valena (ed.) with Tom Avermaete and Georg Vrachliotis, ''Structuralism Reloaded - Rule-Based Design in Architecture and Urbanism'', Stuttgart-London 2011. 47 articles by Roland Barthes, Herman Hertzberger, Winy Maas et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In this extensive book, articles by 47 international authors were published about philosophical, historical, artistic and other relevant aspects. The selecting process for all these different views, including what is more or less important, needs time to give a definitive overall picture of structuralism. The following parts of this article are based on the current state of the publication ''Structuralism Reloaded''.

A few months after publishing this book, the RIBA Institute in [[London]] discussed the new candidates for the RIBA Gold Medal in 2012. An actual question was: ''"Should the [[Robert Venturi|Venturis]] be given this year's RIBA Gold Medal?"'' Surprisingly enough, the RIBA-committee did not award the Venturis with their postmodernist view, and instead, gave [[Herman Hertzberger]] the prize for his structuralist architecture and theoretical contributions. The times had changed and a shift in emphasis had occurred. The comment of the former RIBA president Jack Pringle was: ''"The Royal Gold Medal, Britain's most prestigious award, should go to an architect that has taken us forward, not backwards."'' Today, postmodern architecture can be compared, to some degree with the architectural movement, [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|Traditionalismus]], in Europe.

== Various movements and directions ==

[[File:Grid 1811.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Manhattan]]: [[Gridiron plan]] 1807 and 2007, overarching system, structure and coincidence, rule-based and interpretable structure]]
[[File:NASA Manhattan.jpg|thumb|left|160px]]
The anthropologist, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], remarked: ''"I do not believe that we can still speak of one structuralism. There were a lot of movements that claimed to be structuralist."''&lt;ref name="Valena"/&gt; This diversity can also be found in architecture. However, architectural structuralism has an autonomy that does not comply with all the principles of structuralism in human sciences. In architecture, the different directions have created different images. In this article two directions are discussed. Sometimes these occur in combination.

On the one hand, there is the '''''Aesthetics of Number''''' &lt;ref name="Aesthetics of number"&gt;Aldo van Eyck, "Het Verhaal van een Andere Gedachte" (The Story of Another Idea), with the principle "Aesthetics of Number", in ''Forum'' 7/1959, Amsterdam-Hilversum. The editorial team for the magazine ''Forum'' 7/1959-3/1963 and July/1967 existed of Aldo van Eyck, Herman Hertzberger, Jacob Bakema et al.&lt;/ref&gt; which was formulated by [[Aldo van Eyck]] in 1959. This concept can be compared to cellular tissue. The most influential prototype of this direction is the orphanage in Amsterdam by Aldo van Eyck, completed in 1960. The "Aesthetics of Number" can also be described as "Spatial Configurations in Architecture"&lt;ref name="Eyck 1962"&gt;Aldo van Eyck, "Steps towards a configurative discipline", in: ''Forum'' 3/1962, Amsterdam-Hilversum.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Mat-Building" ([[Alison Smithson]]).

On the other hand, there is the '''''Architecture of Lively Variety (Structure and Coincidence)'''''&lt;ref name="Habraken"&gt;N. John Habraken, ''Supports - An Alternative to Mass Housing'', London 1972. User Participation. (Dutch edition ''De Dragers en de Mensen'', Amsterdam 1961. German edition ''Die Träger und die Menschen'', The Hague 2000; in combination with ''Two-Components-Approach - Structure and Coincidence'').&lt;/ref&gt; which was formulated for user [[Participatory design|participation]] in housing by [[N. John Habraken|John Habraken]] in 1961. Also, in the 1960s, many well-known utopian projects &lt;ref name="Banham"/&gt; were based on the principle of "Structure and Coincidence". The most influential prototype of this direction is the Yamanashi Culture Chamber in [[Kofu]] by [[Kenzo Tange]], completed in 1967. Similar notions of "Architecture of Lively Variety" are: "Architecture of Diversity", "Pluralistic Architecture", "Two-Components-Approach" or "Open Structures".

== Origins ==

Structuralism in architecture and urban planning had its origins in the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM)]] after World War II. Between 1928 and 1959, the CIAM was an important platform for the discussion of architecture and urbanism. Various groups with often conflicting views were active in this organization; for example, members with a scientific approach to architecture without aesthetic premises ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|Rationalists]]), members who regarded architecture as an art form ([[Le Corbusier]]), members who were proponents of high- or low-rise building ([[Ernst May]]), members supporting a course of reform after World War II ([[Team 10]]), members of the old guard and so on.
Individual members of the small splinter group Team 10 laid the foundations for Structuralism. The influence of this team was later interpreted by second generation protagonist [[Herman Hertzberger]] when he said: ''"I am a product of Team 10."''&lt;ref name="Risselada"/&gt; As a group of avant-garde architects, Team 10 was active from 1953 to 1981, and two different movements emerged from it: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members ([[Alison and Peter Smithson]]) and the Structuralism of the Dutch members ([[Aldo van Eyck]] and [[Jacob Bakema]]).&lt;ref name="Risselada"&gt;Max Risselada and Dirk van den Heuvel (eds.), ''Team 10 - In Search of a Utopia of the Present'', Rotterdam 2005. Essays by 23 authors. Interviews with Georges Candilis, Giancarlo De Carlo, Balkrishna Doshi, Ralph Erskine, Herman Hertzberger, Alison and Peter Smithson, Aldo van Eyck.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Team 10, other ideas developed that furthered the Structuralist movement - influenced by the concepts of [[Louis Kahn]] in the United States, [[Kenzo Tange]] in Japan and [[N. John Habraken|John Habraken]] in the Netherlands (with his theory of user participation in housing). [[Herman Hertzberger]] and [[Lucien Kroll]] made important architectural contributions in the field of [[Participatory design|participation]].

In 1960, the Japanese architect [[Kenzo Tange]] designed his well-known Tokyo Bay Plan. Reflecting later on the initial phase of that project, he said: ''"It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call Structuralism."''&lt;ref name="Kenzo Tange"&gt;Kenzo Tange, "Function, Structure and Symbol, 1966", in: Udo Kultermann, ''Kenzo Tange'', Zurich 1970. Kenzo Tange in 1966: ''"In addition to 'functioning' we also need to give spaces structure. The process of 'structuring' is the basic theme of urban design."'' - Kenzo Tange in a lecture in 1981: ''"It was, I believe, around 1959 or in the beginning of the Sixties, that I started to think about what I was later to call structuralism,"'' (published in ''Plan'' 2/1982, Amsterdam).&lt;/ref&gt; Tange also wrote the article "Function, Structure and Symbol, 1966", in which he describes the transition from a functional to a structural approach in thinking. Tange considers the period from 1920 to 1960 under the heading of [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|"Functionalism"]] and the time from 1960 onwards under the heading of "Structuralism".&lt;ref name="Kenzo Tange"/&gt;

[[Le Corbusier]] created several early projects and built prototypes in a Structuralist mode, some of them dating back to the 1920s. Although he was criticized by the members of Team 10 in the 1950s for certain aspects of his work (urban concept without a "sense of place" and the dark interior streets of the Unité), they nevertheless acknowledged him as a great model and creative personality in architecture and art.

== Manifesto ==

One of the most influential manifestos for the Structuralist movement was compiled by [[Aldo van Eyck]] in the architectural magazine ''Forum'' 7/1959.&lt;ref name="Aesthetics of number"/&gt; It was drawn up as the programme for the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|International Congress of Architects in Otterlo in 1959]]. The central aspect of this issue of ''Forum'' was a frontal attack on the Dutch representatives of [[New Objectivity (architecture)|CIAM-Rationalism]] who were responsible for the reconstruction work after World War II, (for tactical reasons, planners like van Tijen, van Eesteren, Merkelbach and others were not mentioned). The magazine contains many examples of and statements in favour of a more human form of urban planning. This congress in 1959 marks the official start of Structuralism,&lt;ref name="Valena"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnulf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heuvel 1992"&gt;Wim van Heuvel, ''Structuralism in Dutch Architecture'', Rotterdam 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; although earlier projects and buildings did exist. Only since 1969 has the term "Structuralism" been used in publications in relation to architecture.&lt;ref name="Valena"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beerends"&gt;Arnaud Beerends, "Een Structuur voor het Raadhuis van Amsterdam" (A Structure for the Town Hall in Amsterdam), in ''TABK'' 1/1969, Heerlen. The architectural terms "Structuralism" and "Structuralists" are published the first time in this magazine, for the Dutch architecture scene. According to Francis Strauven (video Vimeo 2014, Studium Generale, 04:40 and 1:22:40) the term "Structuralism" was used by Herman Hertzberger in a discussion with Arnaud Beerends after the presentation of the Valkenswaard project in 1966, and ''"Dutch Structuralism as an architectural movement was recognized and launched internationally by the Swiss architect Arnulf Lüchinger, since 1974."'' It is remarkable that the term "Structuralism" was never used in the magazine ''Forum'' (van Eyck, Bakema, Hertzberger et al.). The last issue of this editorial team was ''Forum'' July/1967. Herein one of the articles by Herman Hertzberger was named "A Study of Configuration". In an architectural magazine, the first article with the title "Structuralism" was published in ''Bauen+Wohnen'' 5/1974 by Arnulf Lüchinger, about the architecture of Herman Hertzberger. – Correction in video 2014, first use of the term structuralism in architecture. Herman Hertzberger: ''"It was Arnaud Beerends who used the term structuralism for the first time in the magazine TABK 1/1969... I have expanded the term structuralism."'' Interview with Herman Hertzberger by Francis Strauven (in: A+, Architecture in Belgium, 261_Hertzberger, Brussels 4.10.2016). Development from "Configurative discipline" to "Overarching system or structure".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otterlo Congress – participants ==

[[File:PlaCerda1859b.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Barcelona]], integration of two different structures: historic town and gridiron plan, 1859]]

Some presentations and discussions that took place during the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|Otterlo Congress in 1959]] are seen as the beginning of Structuralism in architecture and urbanism. These presentations had an international influence. In the book ''CIAM '59 in Otterlo''&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Oscar Newman (ed.), ''CIAM '59 in Otterlo'', Stuttgart-London-New York 1961. 30 articles by Louis Kahn, Kenzo Tange, Georges Candilis, Jacob Bakema, Aldo van Eyck, Alison and Peter Smithson et al., (English+German supplement). Since the 1970s the Otterlo congress is considered the official start of the structuralist movement.&lt;/ref&gt; the names of the 43 participating architects are listed.&lt;ref name="Risselada"/&gt; While the term structuralism in architecture was published for the first time in 1969.&lt;ref name="Beerends"/&gt;

Since structuralism has different directions, there is more than one definition. The theoretical contribution by [[Herman Hertzberger]] belongs to the most interesting versions. A recent and often cited statement by Hertzberger is: ''"In Structuralism, one differentiates between a structure with a long life cycle and infills with shorter life cycles."'' &lt;ref name="Hertzberger 1991"&gt;Herman Hertzberger, ''Lessons for Students in Architecture'', Rotterdam 1991-No.1, 2000-No.2, 2008-No.3. Definition by Herman Hertzberger: ''"Structuralism deals with the difference of a structure with a long life-cycle and infills with shorter life-cycles."''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed description by Hertzberger is published in 1973. It is a structuralist definition in a general sense, but also the basis concept for user [[Participatory design|participation]]: ''"The fact that we put 'form' in a central position with respect to such notions as 'space' or 'architecture', means in itself no more than a shifting of accent. What we are talking about is in fact another notion of form than that, which premises a formal and unchanging relationship between object and viewer, and maintains this. It is not an outward form wrapped around the object that matters to us, but form in the sense of inbuilt capacity and potential vehicle of significance. Form can be filled-in with significance, but can also be deprived of it again, depending on the use that's made of it, through the values we attach to, or add to it, or which we even deprive it of, - all this dependent on the way in which the users and the form react to, and play on each other. The case we want to put is, that it is this capacity to absorb, carry and convey significance that defines what form can bring about in the users - and conversely - what the users can bring about in the form. What matters is the interaction of form and users, what they convey to each other and bring about in each other, and how they mutually take possession of each other. What we have to aim for, is, to form the material (of the things we make) in such a way that - as well as answering to the function in the narrower sense - it will be suitable for more purposes. And thus, it will be able to play as many roles as possible in the service of the various, individual users, - so that everyone will then be able to react to it for himself, interpreting it in his own way, annexing it to his familiar environment, to which it will then make a contribution."'' &lt;ref name="Arnulf"&gt;Arnulf Lüchinger, ''Structuralism in Architecture and Urban Planning'', Stuttgart 1980. Structuralism as an international movement. Including original texts by Herman Hertzberger, Louis Kahn, Le Corbusier, Kenzo Tange, Aldo van Eyck and other members of Team 10.&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;56

Compared to other directions of structuralism in architecture, the following clarifications are noted: ''"In the new architectural movement there is often a tendency to call everything Structuralist that resembles a woven texture and has a grid. This would be a superficial way of looking at things. By nature Structuralism is concerned with the configuration of conditioned and polyvalent units of form (spatial, communicational, constructional or other units) at all urban scales. Only when the users have taken possession of the structures through contact, interpretation or filling-in the details, do the structures achieve their full status. Any architecture that has a tendency to formalism is thus excluded. Flexible form, which has been much discussed, is also rejected as a neutral enclosing system, since it does not offer the appropriate solution for any spatial programme. In the architecture of Herman Hertzberger Structuralist form can be found from the smallest detail up to the most complicated structure, whether it is in terms of spatial, facade or environmental design."'' &lt;ref name="Arnulf"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;56

The next quotation is a definition of structuralism in different fields. It also discusses the autonomy of the primary  structure: ''"Many Structuralists would describe a structure roughly in the following terms: it is a complete set of relationships, in which the elements can change, but in such a way that these remain dependent on the whole and retain their meaning. The whole is independent of its relationship to the elements. The relationships between the elements are more important than the elements themselves. The elements are interchangeable, but not the relationships."'' &lt;ref name="Arnulf"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;16

== Theoretical origins, principles and aspects ==

*Built structures corresponding in form to social structures, according to [[Team 10]] (Working group for the investigation of '''''interrelationships between social and built structures''''').&lt;ref name="Risselada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnulf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;
*The '''''archetypical behaviour of man''''' as the origin of architecture (cf. Anthropology, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]). Different Rationalist architects had contacts with groups of the Russian Avant-Garde after World War I. They believed in the idea that man and society could be manipulated.
*'''''Coherence''''', '''''growth''''' and '''''change''''' on all levels of the urban structure. The concept of a '''''Sense of place'''''. Tokens of identification (identifying devices). '''''Urban Structuring''''' and '''''Articulation''''' (of the built volume).
*Polyvalent form and '''''individual interpretations''''' (compare the concept of [[langue and parole|langue et parole]] by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]). User '''''[[Participatory design|Participation]]''''' in housing. Integration of "high" and "low" culture in architecture (fine architecture and everyday forms of building). Pluralistic architecture.

The principle '''''Structure and Coincidence''''' remains relevant until now, both for housing schemes and urban planning. For housing schemes the following images were influential: the perspective drawing of the project "Fort l'Empereur" in Algiers by [[Le Corbusier]] (1934) and the isometric drawing of the housing scheme "Diagoon" in Delft by [[Herman Hertzberger]] (1971). At city level, important projects were: the Tokyo Bay Plan of [[Kenzo Tange]] (1960) and the fascinating images of the model of the Free University of Berlin by [[Shadrach Woods|Candilis Josic &amp; Woods]] (1963). Also, worth mentioning are the utopias of [[Metabolism (architecture)|Metabolism]], [[Archigram]] and [[Yona Friedman]]. In general, instruments for urban structuring are: traffic lines (e.g. gridiron plans), symmetries, squares, remarkable buildings, rivers, seashore, green areas, hills etc. These methods were also used in previous cities.

The principle '''''Aesthetics of Number''''' proved to be less useful for structuring an entire city. However, exemplary articulated configurations did arise, both in architecture and housing schemes. The first influential images for this direction [[Aldo van Eyck]] provided with aerial photos of his orphanage in Amsterdam (1960). Later he built another inspiring configuration for the Space Centre Estec in Noordwijk (1989). These two compositions can be counted among the most beautiful "icons" of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Aesthetics of number"/&gt;

==Different types of structures==

===Aesthetics of number===

The term "aesthetics of number" is introduced by [[Aldo van Eyck]] in the architectural magazine ''Forum'' 7/1959.&lt;ref name="Aesthetics of number"/&gt; In his article van Eyck showed two works of art: a structuralist painting by the contemporary artist [[Richard Paul Lohse]] and a [[African folk art|Kuba textile]] (Bakuba tissue) by an African artist of the "primitive" culture. The combination of these two cultures has a symbolic meaning in the structuralist movement.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Structure and coincidence – two-components approach – participation===

In the 1960s the structuralists criticised the narrowness of the functional principle "Form Follows Function". In historic cities they found solutions for a new form principle: an interpretable, adaptable and expandable architecture, see below "Historic cities - reciprocity of form". In the magazine ''Forum'' they developed ideas about "polyvalent form and individual interpretations", "reciprocity of form", "structure and infill" and "[[Participatory design|participation]]".&lt;ref name="Aesthetics of number"/&gt; In our time the notions "open structures" and "creation of architectural ensembles" are also used in discussions.

==Urban structuring – the art of town planning – overarching structures==

===Historic cities===

Examples of urban planning and urban structuring. About the relation between historic and contemporary architecture Le Corbusier wrote: ''"I was labelled a revolutionary, whereas my greatest teacher was the Past. My so-called revolutionary ideas are straight out of the history of architecture itself."'' Quotation in &lt;ref name="Hertzberger 1991"/&gt; No.2.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Historic cities – reciprocity of form===

In ''Forum'' 2/1962 [[Jacob Bakema]] made a study on the principle "reciprocity of form" and "[[Participation (decision making)|participation]]", especially on the [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].&lt;ref name="Aesthetics of number"/&gt; In ''Forum'' 3/1962 [[Herman Hertzberger]] did research on the Roman amphitheatres in [[Arles]] and [[Lucca]]. Later, in 1966 the idea of the amphitheatre in Arles was taken over by [[Aldo Rossi]] in his book ''[[The Architecture of the City]]''. In 1976 [[Reyner Banham]] presented the [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] as one of the historic prototypes in his book ''Megastructure''.&lt;ref name="Banham"&gt;Reyner Banham, ''Megastructure - Urban Futures of the Recent Past'', London 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New cities===

New cities in the twentieth century. The term "Urban Structuring" is introduced by Alison and Peter Smithson, the term "Articulations" (of the built volume) by Herman Hertzberger. Both terms are used as a title of an architectural book.

== Interrelationships between social and built structures (Team 10) ==

'''''De Drie Hoven''''' residential building for elderly people in [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam-Slotervaart]] by [[Herman Hertzberger]], 1974. In the original state, the primary [[Megastructures (architecture)|megastructure]] was light grey (prefabricated concrete) and the facade elements dark grey and matt (wood construction). Today, the original proportions and colors of the facade elements are changed by the intervention of an unknown architect. Herewith the fine architectural quality of the original building complex has disappeared.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10291">'''Television studies''' is an [[academic discipline]] that deals with critical approaches to [[television]]. Usually, it is distinguished from [[mass communication]] research, which tends to approach the topic from an [[social sciences]] perspective. Defining the field is problematic; some institutions and syllabuses do not distinguish it from [[media studies]] or classify it as a subfield of [[popular culture studies]].

One form of television studies is roughly equivalent to the longer-standing discipline of [[film studies]] in that it is often concerned with [[textual analysis]] yet other approaches center more on the social functions of television.&lt;ref&gt;Brunsdon, Charlotte (2004). Television Studies. In Horace Newcomb (Ed.), The Ency-clopedia of Television[second edition]. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2299–304.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, analyses of [[quality television]], such as ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' and ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', have attracted the interests of researchers for their [[art film|cinematic]] qualities. However, television studies can also incorporate the study of television viewing and how [[audience]]s make meaning from texts, which is commonly known as [[audience theory]] or [[reception theory]].

==History==
[[Charlotte Brunsdon]] argues that television studies is an "aspirationally disciplinary name given to the academic study of television." Since it is a relatively new discipline, Brunsdon notes that "...many of the key television scholars are employed in departments of [[sociology]], [[politics]], communication arts, speech, theatre, media and film studies." She argues that television studies developed during the 1970s and 1980s "...from three major bodies of commentary on television: [[journalism]], literary/dramatic criticism and the social sciences." Critical methods for television have been "...extrapolated from traditional literary and dramatic criticism."&lt;ref name="Television Studies"&gt;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/televisionst/televisionst.htm Television Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Newcomb]] argues that television studies scholars often need to justify their academic focus: "[T]he mere suggestion that television needs analysis itself requires supportive argument."&lt;ref&gt;Horace Newcomb, “The Development of Television Studies,” in A Companion to Television, ed. Janet Wasko (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result, television studies is marked by a great deal of "disciplinary [[hybridity]]." Perhaps because television scholars are approaching the subject from so many different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives, there are many debates about how television should be understood and conceptualized from a political and methodological point of view. Another impact of the disciplinary hybridity is the diversity in the types of studies carried out. Early television studies included histories of television, biographies of [[television producer]]s, archival research by historians, and sociological studies of the role the television set played in 1950s homes.

In television studies, television and other [[mass media]] forms are "...conceptualised within frameworks" such as "...ownership; national and international [[regulation]] of media production and distribution; professional ideologies; public opinion; [and] media audiences."  As the field of television studies was being developed, it was influenced by the medium's longstanding issue of invoking "distrust, fear and contempt", as a purported cause of social ills. As well, television scholars had to prove that television was different from other "mass media", often by pointing to how television differed from radio and cinema.

In the 1970s and 1980s, television studies developed three strands of commentary: 
* A journalistic approach, which reviews recent [[television program]]s
* A literary and dramatic criticism approach, which examines the television screenwriter in the same way that literary and dramatic criticism examines novels and plays
*A social science approach, which examines production and distribution, and the function of television in society.

The social science stream examined the social function and effects of television and analyzed the role that television plays in the social order and the public sphere. Some television scholars applied [[Marxist]] frameworks or the "critical sociology of the [[Frankfurt School]]". Since the 1970s, feminist television scholars have focused "... on programmes for women and those which have key female protagonists", such as Julie D'Acci's study of the police drama ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'' and the "...now substantial literature on [[soap opera]]." Television studies in the 1990s includes "work on the definition and interpretation of the television text and the new media ethnographies of viewing" and histories of "production studies" - how television shows are developed, financed, and produced.&lt;ref name="Television Studies"/&gt;

While some predicted the end of television (or at least of the broadcast TV), some scholars actually defend that television "has never been so healthy and triumphant as nowadays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buonanno |first1=Milly |title=Thematic Issue on The End of Television (Not Yet): Editor’s Introduction |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=3 |page=95 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i3.661 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">A '''termbase''', or '''term base''' (a contraction of [[terminology]] and [[database]]), is a database consisting of concept-oriented terminological entries (or ‘concepts’) and related information, usually in multilingual format. Entries may include any of the following additional information:
* a definition; 
* source or context of the term; 
* subject area, domain, or industry; 
* grammatical information (verb, noun, etc.); 
* notes; 
* [[usage label]] (figurative, American English, formal, etc.); 
* author (‘created by’), 
* creation/modification date (‘created/modified at’);
* verification status (‘verified’ or ‘approved’ terms), and
* an ID. 

A termbase allows for the systematic management of approved or verified terms and is a powerful tool for promoting consistency in terminology.

'''''This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India'''''&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, http://global.oup.com/academic/product/this-fissured-land-second-edition-9780198077442?cc=in&amp;lang=en&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Scholarship http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198077442.001.0001/acprof-9780198077442&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by [[Madhav Gadgil]] and [[Ramachandra Guha]] on the ecological history of India. It examines 'prudent' (sustainable) and 'profligate' (unsustainable) use of [[natural resources]], and their effects. It describes the ecological history of India, from the first humans, through the ages of hunter-gatherers, farmers, empires and the [[British Raj]].

==Outline==

The book is split into three parts, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/This_Fissured_Land.html?id=Jmr9n7aoRR4C&lt;/ref&gt;

Part 1 introduces the concept of "Modes of resource use". According to Sonja Brodt of the University of Hawaii, the authors based this classification on the "Marxist '[[mode of production]]' framework, which they intend to complement ...[as it lacks]... reflection on ecological parameters, and ...[so]... is not adequately materialistic ... [This book is therefore] written from a strongly materialistic perspective. Everything from economy to ideology is seen to derive from resource use modes."&lt;ref name=sonjabrodt-jpe-p3&gt;[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_1/brodtvol1.htm ''Case Studies in History and Society Vol-I (1994)'', Sonja Brodt, Journal of Political Ecology], paragraph 3&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there are four modes of resource use - [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering]] / [[shifting cultivation]], [[nomadic pastoralism]], [[Agriculture|settled cultivation]] and [[industrial society]] (whether [[socialist]] or [[capitalist]]), even though more than one mode of resource use may exist in one society at a time.&lt;ref name=sonjabrodt-jpe-p2&gt;[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_1/brodtvol1.htm ''Case Studies in History and Society Vol-I (1994)'', Sonja Brodt, Journal of Political Ecology], paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; The modes are distinguished by technology, economy, social organisation. ideology and ecological impact. There is conflict between modes, and also within a mode.

This section also explains the difference between prudent or sustainable use of resources and unsustainable or profligate resource exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;p 3, ln 12, ''This Fissured Land''&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable use involves restrictions on the use of (1) ecologically important species, (2) ecologically sensitive areas, (3) certain life stages (e.g. juveniles) etc. Such strategies may be based on either trial and error - as in early humans and modern tribal societies - or observation and study - as in most modern societies. In either case, sustainable use has little negative impact on the environment, and societies can survive for long periods of time without significant changes. Unsustainable use, whether scientific or unscientific, leads to rapid exhaustion of resources and damage to both the society and its environment.

Part 2 discusses ecological events in the history of India. It argues that the replacement of early hunter-gatherer societies with extensive agricultural ones lead to an environmental crisis during the fourth century CE. Gradually, a village-level conservation system developed. The growing environmental awareness is visible in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] teachings and literature.&lt;ref name=sonjabrodt-jpe-p3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wordlimitreached.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/this-fissured-land-review/&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these teachings - [[non-violence]], [[vegetarianism]] and a practice of [[Intercropping|mixed agriculture]] with domestication of animals - particularly cattle - are still seen in India.

Part 3 examines ecologically important events during, and just after, British rule.&lt;ref name=sonjabrodt-jpe-p5&gt;[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_1/brodtvol1.htm ''Case Studies in History and Society Vol-I (1994)'', Sonja Brodt, Journal of Political Ecology], paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p 4, ln 31, ''This Fissured Land''&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial forestry practices, such as those favoured by [[Baden-Powell]], led to the destruction of village - level conservation systems. At the same time, little was done on [[Dietrich Brandis]]'s recommendations to introduce a centralised conservation strategy (as [[Germany]] had). The book argues that this is a major reason for India's ecological problems. Finally, a study of industrial and state [[forestry]] is made, concluding that they are far inferior to village or [[social forestry]] when it comes to conservation.

Sonja Brodt feels that "...[the authors avoid]... the usual, overused stories of conflict ... They also avoid some of the black-and-white cliches so common in writings about colonial resource exploitation in the third world. For example, although British forestry policies are pinpointed as one major cause of forest depletion and conflicts, the authors ...[provide written evidence]... that some of the administrators openly opposed the prevailing policies. They also decline to exonerate all Indian rulers ... The result is an analysis that for the most part is refreshingly frank and balanced in its assessments."&lt;ref name=sonjabrodt-jpe-p5 /&gt;

The concluding chapter says that it is too early to say whether a new, more sustainable, mode of resource use will develop as a result of the present environmental crisis. This is because "given the complexity of ecological communities, precise prescriptions for the prudent use of living resources are difficult".&lt;ref&gt;p 23, ''This Fissured Land''&lt;/ref&gt; Sonja Brodt agrees that "it is ultimately contingent upon the reader to delve deeply into the historical analysis for any lessons it might hold".&lt;ref name=sonjabrodt-jpe-p6&gt;[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_1/brodtvol1.htm ''Case Studies in History and Society Vol-I (1994)'', Sonja Brodt, Journal of Political Ecology], paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The original 1992 release was followed by an Oxford India Paperback version in 1993. A revised edition was published in 2013, as part of the 'Oxford India Perennials' series.

==Reception==
[[E. P. Thompson]] noted that the book stuck to the pessimistic tone of most environmental texts, and asked why this should be so for a book that looks at a land of such natural and cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;ഭൂതവും വർത്തമാനവും (Past and Present), Ramachandra Guha, Mathrubhoomi 2018 January 28 pg 50-53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trivia''''' ([[1716 in poetry|1716]]) is a [[poem]] by [[John Gay]]. The full title of the poem is '''''Trivia, or The Art of Walking the Streets of London''''', and it takes its name from the "Goddess of crossroads", [[Trivia (goddess)|Trivia]].

The poem is loosely based on the [[Satires of Juvenal|''Satires'' of Juvenal]], and is a poem in [[heroic couplet]]s, and though based on Juvenal, attains a [[Horace|Horatian]] [[satire|satirical]] manner.

The length of the entire poem is approximately 1000 lines, and it is in three books.

==Content==
The poem describes the perils of walking in [[London]] in the 1710s. It is a [[topographical poem]], taking the form of a walk through a day and night. It pretends to utmost seriousness in advising the reader on:

*how to dress properly
*what sorts of boots to wear
*how to survive falling masonry
*[[chamber pot]]s being emptied out of windows
*overflowing gutters
*[[pickpocket]]s
*wig thieves
*mud splashes

He also describes the characters of the city, including its ballad singers, chairmen, footmen, and toughs.

[[UNESCO]] established its '''Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage''' with the aim of ensuring better protection of important [[intangible cultural heritage]]s worldwide and the awareness of their significance.&lt;ref name=convention&gt;Compare: {{cite web| title= Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 2003
|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17716&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate= 2009-09-05
| quote = In order to ensure better visibility of the intangible cultural heritage and awareness of its significance, and to encourage dialogue which respects cultural diversity, the Committee, upon the proposal of the States Parties concerned, shall establish, keep up to date and publish a Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This list is published by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, the members of which are elected by State Parties meeting in a General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Functions of the General Assembly of the States Parties to the 2003 Convention |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/functions-00710 |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Through a compendium of the different oral and intangible treasures of humankind worldwide, the programme aims to draw attention to the importance of safeguarding intangible heritage, which UNESCO has identified as an essential component and as a repository of [[cultural diversity]] and of creative expression.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO ISSUES FIRST EVER PROCLAMATION OF MASTERPIECES OF THE ORAL AND INTANGIBLE HERITAGE|url= http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/2001/01-71e.shtml |publisher=UNESCO Press |date=2001-05-18 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2005_proclamation&gt;{{cite web| title=The Samba of Roda and the Ramlila proclaimed Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30973&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher=UNESCO Press |date=2005-11-25 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list was established in 2008 when the 2003 [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]] took effect.

{{As of | 2010}} the programme compiles two lists. The longer, '''''Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,''''' comprises cultural "practices and expressions [that] help demonstrate the diversity of this heritage and raise awareness about its importance." The shorter, '''''List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding,''''' is composed of those cultural elements that concerned communities and countries consider require urgent measures to keep them alive.&lt;ref name="pg=00011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011 |title=Intangible Heritage Lists |date= |work= |publisher=[[UNESCO]] Press |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00174 |title=Criteria and timetable of inscription on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding |date= |work= |publisher=[[UNESCO]] Press |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 four elements were inscribed on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, which helps States Parties mobilize international cooperation and assistance to ensure the transmission of this heritage with the participation of the concerned communities. The Urgent Safeguarding List now numbers 35 elements.
The Committee{{which|date=June 2015}} also inscribed 25 elements on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, which serves to raise awareness of intangible heritage and provide recognition to communities’ traditions and know-how that reflect their cultural diversity. The List does not attribute or recognize any standard of excellence or exclusivity. The list totaled 429 elements {{As of | 2017 | lc = on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists Browse the Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage and the Register of good safeguarding practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements inscribed in the lists are deemed as significant bastions of humanity's intangible heritage, the highest honour for intangible heritage in the world stage.

==Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity==
The '''Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity''' contains intangible cultural heritage elements that "help demonstrate the diversity of [cultural] heritage and raise awareness about its importance".&lt;ref name="unes_Purp"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Purpose of the Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage and of the Register of Best Safeguarding Practices - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO | author =  | work = unesco.org | date =  | accessdate = 2015-12-15 | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/purpose-of-the-lists-00807 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage were established in 2008, when the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]] took effect.&lt;ref name=convention2&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716023040/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN |archivedate=July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, a project known as the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] has already been active in recognizing the value of intangibles such as tradition, custom and cultural spaces and the local actors who sustain these forms of cultural expressions through a Proclamation.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt; Identification of the Masterpieces also entails the commitment of states to promote and safeguard these treasures, while UNESCO finances plans for their conservation.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt; Started in 2001 and held biennially until 2005, a total of three Proclamations occurred, encompassing 90 forms of intangible heritage around the world.&lt;ref name=2005_proclamation /&gt;

The 90 previously proclaimed Masterpieces have been incorporated into the ''Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity'' as its first entries, to be known as ''elements''.&lt;ref name=convention /&gt;&lt;ref name=rep_list&gt;{{cite web | title = Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00173|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent elements will be added following the assessment of nominations submitted by national governments acceding to the UNESCO Convention, termed as member states, who are each allowed to submit a single candidature file, in addition to multi-national candidatures. A panel of experts in intangible heritage and an appointed body, known as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, then examine each of the nominations before officially inscribing the candidates as elements on the List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00009 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2120">The '''Western Conference on Linguistics''', usually known as ''WECOL'', is an annual conference held in rotating locations in the western part of the United States and Canada since 1988. Papers for presentation are chosen by a selection committee with the assistance of reports by referees. There is no restriction by topic though there is a weak slant toward linguistic theory.

Papers presented at the conference are published by the Department of Linguistics at [[California State University, Fresno]]. The proceedings have been available on-line since 2004.
