The '''2003 Afro-Asian Games''', officially known as the '''First Afro-Asian Games''' or '''I Afro-Asian Games''' and unofficially known as the '''Inaugural Afro-Asian Games''', was a major [[international]] [[multi-sport]] [[sporting event|event]] held in [[Hyderabad, India]],&lt;ref name=host&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/aag.htm|publisher=gbrathletics|title=Host city of 1st Afro-Asian Games|accessdate=2009-04-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090321205102/http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/aag.htm| archivedate= 21 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; from October 24 (excluding [[Football at the 2003 Afro-Asian Games|football]] and [[Field hockey|hockey]], which began on October 22 and October 23 respectively) to November 1, 2003.&lt;ref name=rsch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Countdown-begins-for-Afro-Asian-Games/articleshow/155923.cms|publisher=The Times Of India|date=2003-09-01|title=Reason for choosing Hyderabad over other cities|accessdate=2010-03-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afro-Asian Games was the largest sporting event ever to be held in Hyderabad, and one of the largest in India, second only to the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] by athletes' volume. The scale of these Games exceeds even the two [[Asian Games]] held in [[Delhi]] in [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] (both by athletes' volume and by number of participating nations) and [[1982 Asian Games|1982]] (by number of participating nations). More than 2000 athletes from 96 countries competed in the Games. A total of 131 [[sporting events]] in eight disciplines were conducted. Also, 120 countries sent 1,565 official representatives to these Games.

The First [[Afro-Asian Games]] were held after nearly two decades of delays, shifts and cancellations. The prolonged amount of time for these Games considerably reduced interest in them. After the preliminary decision of hosting the Games, the venue was shuttled between [[New Delhi]] and [[Kuwait City]]. At the last moment, New Delhi was out favoured by [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], which had hosted the [[National Games of India]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=NGI&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.goodnewsindia.com/index.php/Supplement/article/317/

|date=2002-12-21
|title=2002 National Games to be held in Hyderabad, India
|accessdate=2009-06-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Games, however, had lesser scope than the [[Asian Games]] or [[Commonwealth Games]], since 96 nations participated in only eight disciplines. The Games witnessed only one new world record. Thirty-seven countries - an unprecedented 39% of the participating nations - won at least one medal in these Games.&lt;ref name=medtal/&gt;

==History==
The idea to hold an inter-continental sporting event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with [[New Delhi]] as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to [[Kuwait]] and the Games were proposed to be held in 1985.&lt;ref name=idek&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2016-01-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games. In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games.&lt;ref name=idek/&gt; The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.

In 1999, a proposal for the renewal of the Games was accepted. Subsequently, [[Pune]] and then [[New Delhi]] were proposed as venues.&lt;ref name=idek/&gt; However, they were postponed till November 2001.&lt;ref name=orda&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow preparations led to indefinite postponement again.&lt;ref name=idek/&gt; After the occurrence of [[9/11]], Delhi pulled out.&lt;ref name=idek/&gt; This led to the circulation of rumours that the games were "jinxed".&lt;ref name=jinxed&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-05-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the IOA announced that the [[Olympic Council of Asia]] (OCA) and the [[Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa]] (ANOCA) had sanctioned 2003 as the new date for the Games.&lt;ref name=newd&gt;{{cite web

|title=New dates for AAG
|accessdate=2009-05-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the venue was changed to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] after Delhi pulled out. Most critics point to the successful hosting of the 32nd [[National Games of India]], which were held at Hyderabad, as the main reason for Hyderabad being chosen.&lt;ref name=rsch/&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Gachibowli hyderabad.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Gachibowli]], the [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabadean]] suburb which hosted the Games]]
The Indian Government spent {{Indian Rupee}} 1.03&amp;nbsp;billion (US$22.92&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref name=orda/&gt; for the Afro-Asian Games, making these Games one of the most expensive sporting events held in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. All preparations were completed within 60 days before the events began.&lt;ref name=orda/&gt;

===General Preparation===
The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) decided to set up a central head of the development for the Games. Thus, the Afro-Asian Games Secretariat was set up at the ''Greenlands Guest House''&lt;ref name=orda/&gt; to organize, monitor and manage all the activities related to the Games. 17 functional organizing sub-committees were formed to oversee the development of the venues and other infrastructure.&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/25/stories/2003092500911900.htm
|publisher=The Hindu
|date=2003-09-25
|title=Sub-organizing committees for the AAG??!!
|accessdate=2009-05-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various functions were divided within these committees. The special officer-in-charge of the Games was Sabyasachi Ghosh,&lt;ref name=sbgh&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/ap-out-of-bounds-for-business-visitors-during-afroasian-games/95766/
|publisher=The Financial Express
|date=2003-10-10
|title=OIC of 2003 AAG
|accessdate=2010-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Secretary-General of the Games was Ali Moradi.&lt;ref name=secgen&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=The Indian Express
|date=2003-10-12
|author=Kumar Shyam
|title=AAG is ideal to test all waters
|accessdate=2010-03-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large development Planning Association meant a great amount of inter-connectivity and communication requirements. A 24-hour call centre with interpreters was set up, using a Closed User Group (CUG) circuit.

A large "web" of networking facilities was built to connect all the hotels, media centres, stadia and Transportation Committees.&lt;ref name=orda/&gt; This would help in easing pressure on any one committee. Since the African continent is not very well-connected, an Accreditation Committee was dispatched to [[Abuja]] - in [[Nigeria]] - the host city of the [[2003 All-Africa Games]].&lt;ref name=orda/&gt; The Accreditation committee brought all sports-persons and officials from Africa to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].

===Technology===
The software company [[CMC Limited]] had developed a Games and Event Management System (GEMS),&lt;ref name=gems&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2003/10/26/stories/2003102601140200.htm
|publisher=The Hindu - Business Line
|date=2003-10-26
|title=GEMS to be developed by CMC
|accessdate=2009-11-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues. It worked closely with [[Doordarshan]], the official television broadcasters of the Games, to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information.&lt;ref name=gems/&gt; Additionally, cutting-edge technology like the implementation of geo-referenced maps and [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) was implemented,&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/andhra-to-sport-its-tech-prowess-at-afroasian-games/89025/
|publisher=The Financial Express
|date=2003-09-08
|title=Implementation of GIS and geo maps for the AAG
|accessdate=2009-11-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to ensure a smooth and rapid flow of work.

===Transport===
In the month of September, less than a month away from the Afro-Asian Games, the Transport Ministry of Hyderabad released a large number of luxury vehicles, to be used in the Games. It was the second time in the span of one year that the Transport Ministry had done so - the first time being for the 32nd [[National Games of India]].&lt;ref name=trsp&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to spruce up the city in time for the Games, the organizers arranged several buses, vans and cars to ferry the athletes and the guests.&lt;ref name=trsp/&gt;

===Accommodation=== &lt;!--Accommodation for the 2003 Afro-Asian Games redirects here --&gt;

{{Main article|Accommodation for the 2003 Afro-Asian Games}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Taj krishna hyd.jpg|thumb|left|Taj Krishna, one of the hotels used for accommodation]] --&gt;

Accommodation of the athletes and foreign officials posed a serious problem to the organisers. Contrary to what the [[Olympics]] and related [[multi-sport events]] provide, no actual Games Village was available for the athletes to stay.&lt;ref name=abs&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://beta.mid-day.com/news/2003/oct/67163.htm

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP)  had initially wanted to have a separate Games Village for the Games, but could not arrange for it. Even though Hyderabad had hosted the 32nd [[National Games of India]] in 2002, for which a Games Village had been built, the organizers could not utilise it due to severe financial problems. It was estimated that about {{INR}} 800 million (US$16&amp;nbsp;million) would be required to upgrade the existing Games Village.&lt;ref name=gav&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200990400.htm
|publisher=The Hindu
|date=2003-10-02
|title=Upgradation of existing Games Village impossible
|accessdate=2009-12-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) instead opted to obtain bulk bookings from all the major hotels in the city so as to provide accommodation for the athletes, foreign dignitaries and the media.&lt;ref name=gav/&gt;

===Security===
About 1400 police personnel were drawn from various districts of Andhra Pradesh to provide the first layer of security. In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city.&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2003/oct/18aag.htm
|publisher=Rediff.com
|date=2003-10-18
|title=Strict security arrangements made for the Games
|accessdate=2009-10-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour access control system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.&lt;ref name=sec/&gt;

To facilitate foreign athletes and officials, four immigration counters were set up at the airport. A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official. To improve security speed, six interpreters of [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic]] were present at the airport. In addition, 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the clock in the airport.&lt;ref name=sec/&gt;

==Pressure on Organizing Committee==
There was a lot of pressure upon the Secretariat for the smooth performance of these Games, as the IOA would keenly observe the Afro-Asian Games, in preparation for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] at [[Delhi]], India. Also, officials from [[Beijing]], China - the venue of [[2008 Summer Olympics]] - and [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] - the host of [[2006 Asian Games]] - would attend the Afro-Asian Games, and keenly observe the way the Games functioned.&lt;ref name=orda/&gt;

However, hosting of the Games was not the only major issue for the Committee. The Afro-Asian Games would see the participation of various nations which are not in good terms with some other nations. The then Prime Minister of India, [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]], had hinted that ''"some nations might withdraw from the Games, rather than get embroiled in international conflicts"''.&lt;ref name=wtdw&gt;{{cite web

The logo of the Afro-Asian Games was the [[Charminar]]&lt;ref name=idek/&gt; - Hyderabad's most famous landmark - surrounded by a string of pearls. Hyderabad is also famous for its pearls. The official logo of the Games was unveiled, along with the official website, by Chief Minister [[Chandrababu Naidu]] on September 3, 2003.&lt;ref name=unv&gt;{{cite web

===Qualification===
Qualification for the Games depended upon the performance of the countries in other major multi-sport events. Since these Games featured delegations from two continents, the qualification criteria for nations from the different continents was different. The qualification of the African nations was based on their performance in the [[2003 All-Africa Games]] held in [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=qual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/06/26/stories/2003062601412200.htm |publisher=The Hindu |date=2003-06-26 |author=K.P Mohan |title=AAG - galloping costs, a race against time |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220163555/http://hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/06/26/stories/2003062601412200.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification for the Asian nations was based on their performance in the [[2002 Asian Games]] held in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=qual/&gt;

===Radio===

India's premier radio broadcaster, the [[All India Radio]] (A.I.R), was the official radio partner of the Games. The AIR hired 150&lt;ref name=want/&gt; programmers and engineers for the coverage of the Games.

===Opening ceremony===

The Opening ceremony of the Games were held in the [[Gachibowli Athletic Stadium|G. M. C. Balayogi Stadium]] - the main stadium of the events - at 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm [[Indian Standard Time|IST]].&lt;ref name=timeop&gt;{{cite web

Around 12,000 schoolchildren and college students came up with a show depicting the vast and vibrant culture of the two continents.&lt;ref name=crowd/&gt;

Chief Guest [[L K Advani]] declared the Games open. Shooter [[Anjali Bhagwat]] took the [[Athlete's Oath]].&lt;ref name=crowd/&gt; This was followed by a laser show, fireworks and a space cannon show. The highlight of the Opening ceremony was the ''Umojas''&lt;ref name=crowd/&gt; - a group of professional tribal dancers from Africa. There were other international showcases - the spiritual chanting by the [[China|Chinese]] monks, and the peace prayers by thousands of schoolchildren. Singer [[Shankar Mahadevan]] sang the theme song. Bollywood divas [[Shilpa Shetty]], [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] and [[Urmila Matondkar]] did dance performances.

Unlike the [[Olympic Games]], there was no individual march past for the countries. The countries came in batches of two - Asian countries in one batch and African countries in another.&lt;ref name=jinxed/&gt;

===Closing ceremony===

The closing ceremony of the Games was marked by lights, colour and technology.

The closing ceremony was hosted by [[Yukta Mookhey]]. President [[APJ Abdul Kalam]] officially closed the Games, in front of a near capacity crowd.&lt;ref name=close&gt;{{cite web

A "daredevil" act was done by a few service personnel, who came riding on motorcycles.&lt;ref name=close/&gt; A fly-past of the [[Indian Army]] airplanes, trailing smoke in the colours of the [[Indian flag]] took place as the dignitaries took their seats.

The expected "high-point" of the closing ceremony was the show of [[camaraderie]] between the sportspersons of the two continents. However, few athletes trooped into the Stadium for that purpose.&lt;ref name=close/&gt; The "camaraderie ceremony" was followed by speeches of various important people, among them being IOA President [[Suresh Kalmadi]], IOA and OCA Secretary-General [[Raja Randhir Singh]], ANOCA President [[Alfa Ibrahim Diallo]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] Chief Minister [[Chandrababu Naidu]] and Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports [[Vikram Verma]]. The speeches were shortly followed by a memento presentation.&lt;ref name=close/&gt;

As night fell, hundreds of Army recruits brought lighted torches, and did the "mashal dance". Laser lights and several technological innovations followed. Sheroo, the mascot, was bid farewell by noted Indian singer [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]] and many costumed children. The ''Umojas'' performed yet again at the closing ceremony. The [[China|Chinese]] State circus was considered "breath-taking". [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] singer [[Diana Haddad]], [[Egypt]]ian singer [[Hisham Abbas]] and Indian singer [[Remo Fernandes]] performed at the closing ceremony as well.&lt;ref name=close/&gt;

The host country was portrayed by a number of traditional folk dances, after which the Games officially ended.

==Legacy==
The success of the Games was a point in favor of India being able to host a major international sporting event. Subsequently, this success was used in the bidding of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]], which was ultimately awarded to [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name=brds/&gt;&lt;ref name=legc&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the hospitality sector received a major boost due to the games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city.&lt;ref name=trhp&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous places such as the [[Charminar]] and the [[Chowmahalla Palace]] saw record number of visitors.

Also, famous local markets witnessed exceptional growth in sales and business, as demand peaked during the Games. Business of the world-renowned [[pearl]]s of Hyderabad increased by about 50%, generating revenue of {{INR}} 50 million in one week. The rise in buyers was mainly driven by African visitors, who prefer pearls as jewellery.&lt;ref name=bsli&gt;{{cite web

__NOTOC__
Year '''475 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Poplicola and Rutilus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 279 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 475 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Arthur Orton''' (20 March 1834 &amp;ndash; 1 April 1898), the son of a London butcher, went to sea as a boy, spent a year in Chile, and worked as a butcher and [[Stockman (Australia)|stockman]] for [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] in Australia in the middle-to-late 1850s. He has generally been identified by legal historians and commentators as the [[Tichborne case|"Tichborne Claimant"]], who in two celebrated court cases both fascinated and shocked Victorian society in the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1866 Thomas Castro, a butcher from [[Wagga Wagga]] in Australia, claimed to be Roger Tichborne, the  heir to the Tichborne estates and baronetcy who had been declared lost at sea in 1854. During the protracted court proceedings that followed Castro's claim, evidence was produced that Castro might in fact be Arthur Orton, attempting to secure the Tichborne fortunes by imposture. The verdict of the jury in ''Regina versus Castro'' (1873–74) was that Castro was not Roger Tichborne, and that he was Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to fourteen  years imprisonment for perjury. After his release he lived in great poverty, still insisting that he was Tichborne. In 1895 he confessed to being Orton, but retracted almost immediately. He died in 1898; the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the names "Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne" to be placed on the coffin.

Commentators  have generally concurred with the court's verdict that the Claimant was Orton, but some 20th-century analysts have raised uncertainties about this accepted view, and have suggested that although the Orton identity remains the most likely, a lingering doubt remains.

==Biography==
Orton was born at [[Wapping]], London, the son of George Orton, a butcher and purveyor of ships' stores.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;
Michael Roe, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050429b.htm Orton, Arthur (1834–1898)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Vol.. 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, p. 374. Retrieved 2009-11-02
&lt;/ref&gt; 
He left school early and was employed in his father's shop. In 1849,&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; he was apprenticed to a Captain Brooks of the ship ''Ocean''. The ship sailed to South America and in June 1849 Orton deserted and went to the small [[Chile]]an country town of [[Melipilla]]. He stayed in Chile for a year and seven months and befriended the Castro family.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Orton then went back to London as an ordinary seaman.

In November 1852 he sailed for [[Tasmania]] aboard the ''Middleton''&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; and arrived at [[Hobart]] in May 1853. There, Orton worked for several butchers. There is some evidence he was a heavy drinker; and for minor trade malpractices, he appeared before magistrates.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; [[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Hobart Mercury]] of 1 Aug 1855 reports on the case of 'Fane v. Orton' in the Mayor's Court in which the City Surveyor brought a charge of 'offering for sale...unwholesome meat, unfit for human food' against 'Arthur Orton, butcher, Macquarie-street' to which Orton pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3336162 |title=LOCAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[The Hobarton Mercury]] |location=Tas. |date=1 August 1855 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1855, Orton appeared on a charge of obtaining money under false pretences brought by Frederick Dight, after Orton had been a witness against Dight in an earlier Supreme Court trial, but the case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3336739 |title=Local Intelligence. |newspaper=[[The Hobarton Mercury]] |location=Tas. |date=12 October 1855 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Port Albert PhillipC.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Modern day view of Port Albert, Gippsland, Victoria|Contemporary view of [[Port Albert]], [[Gippsland]]. Arthur Orton landed there as a passenger on the schooner 'Eclipse' after leaving Tasmania for mainland Australia in 1855.]]
From 1855 to the mid-1860s there is little detail about his life, but he appears to have pursued gold prospecting, mail-running and pastoral station hand-work, with a suggestion of bushranging and even murder.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Orton left Hobart as a passenger on schooner 'Eclipse' on 16 November 1855 bound for [[Port Albert]] on the coast of [[Gippsland]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Shipping Intelligence"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8785362 |title=Shipping Intelligence. |newspaper=[[Colonial Times]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=17 November 1855 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for some time on [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] 'runs' in the district.&lt;ref name="Shipping Intelligence"/&gt; While employed at one he was said to have written 'on a fly-leaf of one of the station novels' and this was later offered as evidence that Orton did not have the education that would have been expected of Tichborne:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This day i have received a letter from Donald MacDonald. With the Seal Broken. i Arthur Orton here make a vow on this Book. Although not a Bible. It bear a cross, That i am a man of Bone Blood and flesh. That i will find out the Man if Possible. That broke the said Seal. And that i will punish him according to the laws of, My Countrie.&lt;br&gt;Sined Arthur Orton&lt;br&gt; Dargo &lt;br&gt;11 March 1858"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61209375 |title=THE TICHBORNE CASE. |newspaper=[[Gippsland Times]] |location=Vic. |date=11 April 1868 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=3 Edition: Morning. |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 1856, he appears in a subscription list, donating £2, for 'the Patriotic Fund from the Upper District of Gippsland' as a stockman and 'one of the men' of 'Mewburn Park'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112486655 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[Gippsland Guardian]] |location=Vic. |date=30 May 1856 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1859, a letter to the editor of the 'Gippsland Guardian' mentions Orton, 'who was in charge of the Dargo station', and recounts Orton's testimony in relation to 'the mysterious disappearance of William Henry Clare alias Ballaarat Harry, and Thomas Took'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112488891 |title=CORRESPONDENCE. |newspaper=[[Gippsland Guardian]] |location=Vic. |date=15 April 1859 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orton's letters to England while he was in Hobart showed he was fond of dogs and children and affectionate towards his girlfriend in Wapping.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; However a personal notice in a Hobart newspaper from May 1856 – 'If this should meet the eye of Arthur Orton, formerly of 69, Wapping, London, by applying on board the "Irene", he will hear of his friends.' – after he had departed for Victoria raises the question of when the correspondence may have ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8783886 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[Colonial Times]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=10 May 1856 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tichborne Claimant==
{{Main|Tichborne case}}
In August 1865  advertisements appeared in Australian newspapers asking for information about the fate of Roger Charles Tichborne (born 1829), who had been on a vessel '' Bella'' which disappeared at sea off South America in 1854. This advertisement had been inserted by Lady Tichborne, the missing man's mother,  who believed her son was still alive. Roger Tichborne had, however, been presumed dead by the courts and his younger brother had thus succeeded to the [[Tichborne Baronets|Tichborne baronetcy]] and the family's  estates.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Arthur|Last=Orton|shortlink=0-dict-biogN-O.html#orton1|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, through his solicitor William Gibbes, a butcher in Wagga Wagga known as "Thomas Castro" came forward, claiming to be the missing Sir Roger. He appeared to have some knowledge of the missing man's background and family history, although many of his assertions were inaccurate or false. However, at Gibbes's prompting he wrote to Lady Tichborne and was invited to come to England to be recognised.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam 2007, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; It is the contention of most historians that the Claimant was Arthur Orton, whose travels had at some time crossed the path of Roger Tichborne whose identity the former had then adopted.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam 2007, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition, doubt and legal process==
{{Main|Tichborne case}}
[[Image:Tichborne claimant Arthur Orton.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Orton as portrayed in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''  by '[[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|'Ape']] June 1871]]
The [[Scotland Yard]] detective [[Jack Whicher]] discovered that immediately  on his arrival in England in December 1866  the Claimant visited Wapping and made enquiries about the Orton family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications4/low-08.htm Greenwood, James 'Low-Life Deeps: An Account of the Strange Fish to be Found There' – Chatto and Windus, Piccadilly (1881) – The Dictionary of Victorian London]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NENZC18730821.2.18&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-- 'The Tichborne Trial'] ''Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle'', Rōrahi XXXII, Putanga 96, 21 Hereturikōkā 1873, Page 3 [[National Library of New Zealand]] Archive&lt;/ref&gt; When this visit was made public during the legal processes, it was presented as strong evidence that the Claimant was indeed Arthur Orton.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam 2007, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Lady Tichborne recognised him as her son with complete certainty;&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam 2007, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; he was likewise accepted as Roger by numerous family servants and professional advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis of the affair, Rohan McWilliam considers the extent of recognition remarkable, given the physical bulk and unrefined manners of the Claimant, as compared with the Roger Tichborne of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the rest of the Tichborne family considered the Claimant an imposter.&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt; Nevertheless, he obtained much financial support for the prosecution of his claim, which went ahead despite the death of Lady Tichborne in 1868. After a lengthy civil hearing the jury dismissed the Claimant's case to be Sir Roger; he was then arrested and tried for perjury under the name of Thomas Castro. In the trial that followed the jury declared that he was not Roger Tichborne and identified him on the evidence as Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, of which he served 10 before his release on licence in 1884.&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt;

==Appraisal==
After his release the Claimant continued to press his claim, but gradually lost his following. By the mid-1890s he was impoverished;
in 1895, for a fee of several hundred pounds, he published a confession in ''[[The People]]'' that he was Orton. However, almost immediately he  repudiated this confession, and styled himself once again as Sir Roger Tichborne.&lt;ref name= ODNB&gt;{{cite web|last= McWilliam|first= Rohan|title= Tichborne claimant|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20855/53701?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online edition)|date= May 2010|accessdate= 17 March 2012}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He died on 1 April 1898 in impoverished circumstances, and was given a pauper's burial. In "an act of extraordinary generosity", the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name "Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne" to be placed on the coffin before its interment.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliam 2007, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern consensus is that the Claimant was Orton, who had  used family information obtained from gullible or self-serving supporters. However, in his 1957 account of the case, Douglas Woodruff insists that at least some degree of doubt as to the Claimant's true identity must remain.&lt;ref name= ODNB/&gt; Woodruff argues  the sheer improbability of anyone  conceiving such an imposture from scratch and  at such a distance: "[I]t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds of sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son".&lt;ref name=W452&gt;Woodruff, pp. 452–53&lt;/ref&gt; Orton's cause continued to be upheld during the 20th century by his eldest daughter, one of four children borne him by his wife, who lived until 1926.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==In popular culture==
He was fictionalized by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in ''Tom Castro, The Implausible Impostor'', written between 1933 and 1934 and published in [[A Universal History of Iniquity]] in 1935

He symbolizes the "birth" of the next year and the "passing" of the prior year; in other words, a "rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novareinna.com/festive/bny.html|title=Baby New Year|website=www.novareinna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baby New Year's purpose varies by myth, but he generally performs some sort of ceremonial duty over the course of his year such as [[Wiktionary:chronicle#Noun|chronicling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sendables.jibjab.com/originals/2008_year_in_review|title=JibJab|website=sendables.jibjab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the year's events or presiding over the year as a [[figurehead|symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiqueshoppefl.com/newimages/newyearsbaby2.jpg |title=Saturday Evening Post cover |website=www.antiqueshoppefl.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The myth most associated with him is that he is a baby at the beginning of his year, but Baby New Year quickly ages until he is elderly (like [[Father Time]], with whom he is often associated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themoderatevoice.com/25364/una-vez-mas-the-old-man-and-the-baby-of-new-years-iconology-a-lost-story/|title=Una Vez Más: The Old Man and The Baby of New Year's Iconology: A Lost Story – The Moderate Voice|website=themoderatevoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the end of his year. Very rarely is the Baby New Year depicted as any age other than a baby or as a very old man. Some stories, especially those with depictions of years past, will have him [[personification|bear a strong likeness]] to key events in his time.&lt;ref name="Rudolph's Shiny New Year"&gt;[[Rudolph's Shiny New Year]]; https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073640/&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, he hands over his duties to the next Baby New Year, while he either dies or remains in this state and retires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themoderatevoice.com/wordpress-engine/wp-content/dr-e/old-man-baby-new-year.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208194253/http://themoderatevoice.com/wordpress-engine/wp-content/dr-e/old-man-baby-new-year.jpg |archivedate=2011-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The [[stereotype|stereotypical]] representation of Baby New Year is as a baby boy wearing nothing more than a [[diaper]], a [[top hat]] and a [[sash]] across his torso that shows the year he is representing (e.g. 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.tv/father-time-2010-baby-year-2011-battle/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104182324/http://www.nma.tv/father-time-2010-baby-year-2011-battle/ |archivedate=2011-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudolph's Shiny New Year"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marthastewart.com/good-thing/baby-new-year|title=Baby New Year|date=2 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes depicted holding or associated with an [[hourglass]], a [[Party horn|noisemaker]], or other item either pertaining to time or New Year's Day festivities. Often, he is not a complete [[newborn]] but instead more closely resembles a [[toddler]], because he is frequently shown standing on his own, crawling or barely walking, or having a small amount of (usually blond) hair.

==Baby New Year title==
In addition to being a mythical figure, the title of "Baby New Year" is sometimes given to living people. The first baby born in any village or city in a certain year may be honored by being labeled as the official Baby New Year for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/article.php?art_id=6852|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930032840/http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/article.php?art_id=6852|archivedate=2011-09-30|title=Jackson Hole News&amp;Guide; - Baby New Year born at home with midwife, family|date=30 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wlfi.com/dpp/news/local/lafayette-welcomes-new-years-baby |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105113535/http://www.wlfi.com/dpp/news/local/lafayette-welcomes-new-years-baby |archive-date=2011-01-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/section/news|title=The latest Boston, local and national news|first=|last=john-waller|date=11 January 2016|website=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Baby New Year can be male or female, even though the mythical Baby New Year is nearly always male. Attempts to name an official Baby New Year for an entire country have sometimes been made, but generally there are multiple contenders and no single Baby New Year can be confirmed. There has however been a great deal of several who have come close. Numerous hospitals no longer make a Baby New Year public due to concerns that the infant will become a target for criminals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvoa.com/news/first-baby-of-2015-it-s-a-secret-in-many-places/ First baby of 2015?

==Popular culture==
* Baby New Year is featured in the TV special ''[[Rudolph's Shiny New Year]]''. The featured Baby New Year is named Happy who goes missing before New Year's Eve and Rudolph had to travel to the Archipelago of Last Years (a bunch of islands where the old years go to retire) to find him before a [[vulture]] named Aeon the Terrible gets to him in order to keep the year from ending and stop time, thus preventing his predestined death. Happy ran away due to being laughed at because of his big ears which he wears under his top hat. Rudolph shows Happy his nose and tells him his own story of being shunned because of his nonconformity before asking Happy to let him see his ears. After Happy's ears played a part in defeating Aeon the Terrible, Happy is returned to Father Time as the year "Nineteen-Wonderful" begins.&lt;ref name="Rudolph's Shiny New Year"/&gt;
* A parody of Baby New Year, given the name "Big Fat Baby," appears in the animated series ''[[Histeria!]]''

A '''''Beat Party!''''' is a gathering of people, commonly youths, who are invited by a host for the purpose of social interaction and entertainment. A Beat Party! is unlike a traditional party because the music and fashion relies heavily on the 1960s.

The term Beat Party! was originally coined by [[You Am I]] lead singer and guitarist [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]] who named the bonus disc of the band's third album [[Hourly Daily]],  "Beat Party!".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youami.net/rarities.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Beat Parties are commonly associated with [[Beat Music]] and [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]].

== Origins ==

=== You Am I ===
The term Beat Party! was originally the title of the bonus disc from Australian band You Am I's album [[Hourly Daily]]. The disc contained covers by 1960s [[Beat Music]] bands [[The Creation (band)|The Creation]] and [[The Easybeats]] and his, combined with Tim Rogers's drunken declaration that he would make a "beat" record is where the phrase comes from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youami.com.au/music/9/hourly-daily-international |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930150925/http://www.youami.com.au/music/9/hourly-daily-international |archivedate=2009-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In the late 2009 a succession of unusual parties and gatherings were held in eastern [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. 1960s [[Beat Music]] was played and attendees wore 1960s styled, vintage suits or Fred Perry Polo Shirts with the buttons done up. These Beat Parties attempted to emulate the attitudes and behaviours of the English during [[Swinging London]] period.

== Comparisons ==
Due to the similar reference points, 1960s [[beat music]] and emphasis on fashion from the same era, Beat Parties have drawn comparisons to the [[Mod Revival]] which took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s throughout the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modrevival.net/&lt;/ref&gt; However unlike the [[Mod Revival]] which had [[The Jam]] and lead singer and Mod [[Paul Weller]] as its focal point, the Beat Party! culture is instead primarily influenced by its participants who all hold a dewy eyed love for the 1960s.

'''Beatosu''' and '''Goblu''' are two non-existent [[Ohio]] towns in [[Fulton County, Ohio|Fulton]] and [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas]] counties, respectively. They were inserted into the 1978–1979 edition of the official state of [[Michigan]] map. The names refer to the slogan of [[University of Michigan]] fans ("Go Blue!") and a reference to their archrivals from [[Ohio State University]] ("Beat OSU").

== History ==
Peter Fletcher, a Michigan alumnus and chairman of the [[Michigan State Highway Commission|State Highway Commission]] with a "sly sense of humor",&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news |date = October 1, 2012 |title = Peter B. Fletcher, Longtime Ypsilanti Republican Activist and Philanthropist, Dies at 80 |url =http://www.annarbor.com/news/ypsilanti/longtime-ypsilanti-republican-activist-philanthropist-peter-b-fletcher/ |first= Sven |last= Gustafson |work= [[AnnArbor.com]] |access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the inclusion the fake towns of "Goblu" (near the real town of [[Jerusalem Township, Lucas County, Ohio|Bono, Ohio]], off [[Ohio State Route 2|State Route&amp;nbsp;2]]) and "Beatosu" (near [[Archbold, Ohio]], just south of [[Interstate 80 in Ohio|Interstate 80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Ohio|Interstate 90]]/[[Ohio Turnpike]] at exit&amp;nbsp;25).&lt;ref name= barnett&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnett |first=Le Roy |url=http://www.michiganhistorymag.com/extra/transportation/maps.pdf |title=Paper Trails: The Michigan Highway Map |journal=[[Michigan History magazine|Michigan History]] |date=November–December 1999 |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=18–23 |format=PDF |accessdate= November 25, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051615/http://www.michiganhistorymag.com/extra/transportation/maps.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that on the printed map, the fictitious town names appear in all lowercase letters ("goblu" and "beatosu"), while every other town name is capitalized.  As well, while all real locations are clearly marked, there is no specific dot, boundary line or other marker to identify the precise location of the two fictitious towns.  

In a 2008 interview, Fletcher explained that a fellow Michigan alumnus had been teasing him about the [[Mackinac Bridge]] colors: green and white, the colors of [[Michigan State University]]. Fletcher noted that the bridge colors were in compliance with federal highway regulations, so he had no choice in that matter; he did, however, have more control over the state highway map. Fletcher said that he thus ordered a cartographer to insert the two fictitious towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Garrett |url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-54463_19313_20652_19271_19357-202571--,00.html |title=Beatosu and Goblu, Ohio |work= Archives Image of the Month |publisher=Archives of Michigan, Michigan Historical Center, [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] |date= October 31, 2008 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2012 obituary of Fletcher, [[AnnArbor.com]] noted that the maps containing the fictional cities had a limited print run and have become collectors items.&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt; The map's publication has also been noted as a good luck charm for the University of Michigan Wolverines that year; the team beat their arch rivals 14–3 in the 1978 edition of [[Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry|The Game]],&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt; which is the
greatest North American sports rivalry, according to [[ESPN.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = The 10 Greatest Rivalries |department= The End of the Century |author = [[ESPN.com]] |work= ESPN.com |date= January 3, 2000 |url= http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html |access-date= December 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The fictional ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' comic book character [[Road Pig]] is recorded as having been born in Goblu, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.yojoe.com/filecard/04/roadpig3.shtml |title = Dreadnok Road Pig (v3) G.I. Joe Action Figure |work = YoJoe Archive |access-date = February 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''[[Paper Towns (film)|Paper Towns]]'' refers to the context of paper towns. In their description, it refers to fake towns on a map created by cartographers to deter copyright infringement. A map extent of Beatosu is shown as an example.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

''Sottotenente'' '''Carlo Negri''' ([[Genoa]], 26 September 1919 – [[Koritza]], 24 September 1943)&lt;ref name="ono"/&gt;
was a [[World War II]] [[Italy|Italian]] [[Aviator|pilot]]. He was the first casualty of the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]], [[executed by firing squad]] by the Germans shortly after his capture.

== Biography ==
An [[engineering]] student before the war,&lt;ref name=anp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anpi.it/donne-e-uomini/carlo-negri|title=Page on Carlo Negri - www.anpi.it|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negri enlisted in the [[Regia Aeronautica]] in the course of the hostilities. After graduating from the [[Italian Air Force Academy]] in [[Caserta]] he was assigned to ''[[4 Stormo]]'' (''Prancing Stallion'')&lt;ref&gt;The "prancing stallion" was the personal emblem of Italy's World War I top ace, [[Francesco Baracca]]. After his death, his mother donated the emblem to [[Enzo Ferrari]] who used it as a brand for his sports cars.&lt;/ref&gt; as a ''[[Sottotenente]]'' ([[second Lieutenant]]) pilot.&lt;br&gt;
He had not been in the unit for long when the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]] was made public on 8 September 1943, ending hostilities between [[Italy]] and the Allies but ''de facto'' opening the war with [[Nazi Germany|their former allies]]. &lt;br&gt;
Negri, together with most ''4 Stormo'' personnel, flew to [[Apulia]] where the Royal Family had found a safe haven after fleeing from [[Rome]]. However, this "move" was not made for merely political reasons: the ''Stormo'' had very strong ties with [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]] (and therefore with the [[House of Savoy]]) although Amedeo had left the command of the unit by the late 1930s to take up the place of Governor General of [[Italian East Africa]] and had died the year before as a [[POW]] of the British in Kenya. At any rate, Amedeo's legacy with ''4 Stormo'' is so strong that the unit bears his name to the present day.&lt;br&gt;
Shortly after, [[Regia Aeronautica]] (officially renamed [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]]) was operational on the Allied side, flying ground attack and supply missions to relieve pressure on [[Regio Esercito]] units stuck in the [[Balkans]] and embedded in the local [[Resistance movement]]s. In one such occasion, on 21 September 1943, Negri volunteered to drop a cylinder containing a message for an Italian unit encircled in [[Koritza]], [[Albania]].&lt;br&gt;
Hit by [[Flak]], Negri was forced to land and was immediately captured by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Brought to a show trial, he was sentenced to death and shot on 23 September. He could not enjoy the protection of the [[Geneva Convention]] because there had not been any formal declaration of war between the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (which would take place only on 13 October 1943).

''[[Sottotenente]]'' Carlo Negri received the posthumous [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] for this action.

A little more than 60 years after his death (31 October 2003) [[61 Stormo]] was named after him. This [[Italian Air Force]] Wing is based at [[Lecce Galatina Air Base|Galatina]], the same airbase from which Negri had taken off for his fateful flight. The dedication ceremony was attended by his nephew and namesake, manager [[Carlo Alessandro Puri Negri|Carlo Puri Negri]], a holder of top offices in the [[Pirelli]] rubber and [[real estate]] company. As a matter of fact, the young officer was related to the well-known Italian industrial family by the side of his mother Margherita.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2003/ottobre/31/Ciampi_Resistenza_studiata_scuola__co_0_031031060.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year the Pirelli family organizes a [[regatta]], the ''Carlo Negri cup'' in his memory.

'''Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend''', popularly known as “The Dinah”, is a five-day weekend getaway and music festival catering to the lesbian community that takes place annually in [[Palm Springs, California]], United States. It is considered the largest lesbian event in the United States and the world. Held each spring, the event offers a series of pool parties, night entertainment, live concerts by Top Ten Billboard recording artists, comedy shows, sport-games and social networking opportunities.

Primarily catering to the lesbian demographics, The Dinah celebrates the tapestry of women around the world, attracting some 10,000-plus participants from countries such as Australia, Russia, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, China, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Over the years, it has gradually rallied the corporate support of market leaders such as [[Miller Beer]], [[MTV]]/[[Logo (TV channel)|LOGO Networks]], [[here!]] TV, [[Sirius Radio]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], O.B. Tampons, [[Shake Weight]] and [[Bacardi]] among others.

==History==
===First events===
[[File:Pool Party 2011.jpg|thumb|Pool Party 2011]]

The Dinah Shore Weekend was named after the late [[Dinah Shore]] – a singer, TV personality and renowned golfer, born Frances Rose Shore, in 1916, who lived in the [[Coachella Valley]] and is credited for having founded in Palm Springs the [[Kraft Nabisco Championship|Colgate-Dinah Shore Winner's Circle]]. The Dinah now coincides with the [[Kraft Nabisco Championship]] women’s golf tournament. The first unofficial Dinah Shore Weekend took place in 1986 when women began to flock to Palm Springs in conjunction with the tournament. After-dinner parties following the golfing turned benefits for the Human Rights Campaign and the AIDS Service Foundation.

===Official debut===

The first Dinah Shore Weekend was produced in 1991 by Mariah Hanson under her ''Club Skirts Presents The Dinah Marquee'' at the [[Palm Springs Art Museum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Recent years===
In 2006 [[Guinevere Turner]] featured the event in the TV documentary ''A Lez in Wonderland'' (original title: ''Broute-minou à Palm Springs'').&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0896793|title=A Lez in Wonderland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Confidence Trick - JM Staniforth.png|thumb|Political cartoon by [[Joseph Morewood Staniforth|JM Staniforth]]: [[Herbert Kitchener]] attempts to raise £100,000 for a college in Sudan by calling on the name of [[Charles George Gordon]]]]

A '''confidence trick''' (synonyms include '''con''', '''confidence game''', '''confidence scheme''', '''ripoff''', '''scam''' and '''stratagem''') is an attempt to [[defraud]] a person or group after first gaining their [[confidence]], used in the classical sense of [[trust (emotion)|trust]]. Confidence tricks exploit characteristics of the human psyche, such as [[credulity]], [[naïveté]], [[compassion]], [[vanity]], [[Moral responsibility|irresponsibility]], and [[greed]]. Researchers Lindsey Huang and Barak Orbach defined the scheme as “a distinctive species of fraudulent conduct, . . . intending to further voluntary exchanges that are not mutually beneficial,” as they “benefit con operators (‘con men’) at the expense of their victims (the ‘marks’).” &lt;ref&gt;Lindsey Huang &amp; Barak Orbach, [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3228077 "Con Men and Their Enablers: The Anatomy of Confidence Games," ''Social Research: An International Quarterly'' (2018)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The perpetrator of a confidence trick (or "con trick") is often referred to as a confidence (or "con") man, con-artist, or a "[[wikt:grifter|grifter]]". Samuel Thompson (1821–1856) was the original "confidence man". Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked his victims to express confidence in him by giving him money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way. A few people trusted Thompson with their money and watches.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Braucher &amp; Barak Orbach, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2314071 "Scamming: The Misunderstood Confidence Man," 27 ''Yale Journal of Law &amp; Humanities'' 249 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson was arrested in July 1849. Reporting about this arrest, Dr. James Houston, a reporter of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', publicized Thompson by naming him the "Confidence Man".&lt;ref name="Braucher &amp; Orbach"&gt;Braucher &amp; Orbach.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Thompson was an unsuccessful scammer, he gained reputation as a genius operator mostly because Houston's satirical writing wasn't understood as such.&lt;ref name="Braucher &amp; Orbach" /&gt; The National Police Gazette coined the term "confidence game" a few weeks after Houston first used the name "confidence man".&lt;ref name="Braucher &amp; Orbach" /&gt;

{{Anchor|mark}}
A confidence trick is also known as a con game, a con, a scam, a grift, a hustle, a bunko (or bunco), a swindle, a flimflam, a gaffle or a bamboozle. The intended victims are known as  marks, suckers, stooges, mugus, rubes or gulls (from the word ''gullible''). When accomplices are employed, they are known as [[shill]]s.

===Short and long cons===
{{Anchor|short con|Short con|small con|Small con}}A short con or small con is a fast swindle which takes just minutes. It typically aims to rob the victim of everything in his or her wallet.&lt;ref&gt;David Maurer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jxbbV5x66usC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+con&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eLSLUavDGa3-4AOkw4GYCg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=big%20con&amp;f=false ''The Big Con''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624064220/https://books.google.com/books?id=jxbbV5x66usC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+con&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eLSLUavDGa3-4AOkw4GYCg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA |date=2016-06-24 }}, Chapter Eight: "Short-Con Games"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of the con==
In ''Confessions of a Confidence Man'', Edward H. Smith lists the "six definite steps or stages of growth" of a confidence game.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Edward H. Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cyq8QAAACAAJ&amp;dq=confessions+of+a+confidence+man+smith&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0r6LUemKIa3r0QHMn4GQBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Confessions of a Confidence Man: A Handbook for Suckers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424161907/https://books.google.com/books?id=Cyq8QAAACAAJ&amp;dq=confessions+of+a+confidence+man+smith&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0r6LUemKIa3r0QHMn4GQBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |date=2016-04-24 }}, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that some steps may be omitted.

;Foundation Work
:Preparations are made in advance of the game, including the hiring of any assistants required.
;Approach
:The victim is contacted.
;Build-up
:The victim is given an opportunity to profit from a scheme. The victim's greed is encouraged, such that their rational judgment of the situation might be impaired.
;Pay-off or Convincer
:The victim receives a small payout as a demonstration of the scheme's effectiveness. This may be a real amount of money, or faked in some way. In a [[gambling]] con, the victim is allowed to win several small bets. In a [[stock market]] con, the victim is given fake [[dividend]]s.
;The Hurrah
:A sudden crisis or change of events forces the victim to act immediately. This is the point at which the con succeeds or fails.
;The In-and-In
:A conspirator (in on the con, but assumes the role of an interested bystander) puts an amount of money into the same scheme as the victim, to add an appearance of legitimacy to the scheme. This can reassure the victim, and give the con man greater control when the deal has been completed.

In addition, some games require a "[[corroboration]]" step, particularly those involving a "rare item". This usually includes the use of an accomplice who plays the part of an uninvolved (initially skeptical) third party, who later confirms the claims made by the con man.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

==Vulnerability to confidence tricks==
Confidence tricks exploit typical human characteristics such as [[Greed (emotion)|greed]], [[dishonesty]], [[vanity]], [[opportunism]], [[lust]], [[compassion]], [[credulity]], [[moral responsibility|irresponsibility]], [[panic|desperation]], and [[naïvety]]. As such, there is no consistent profile of a confidence trick victim; the common factor is simply that the victim relies on the good faith of the con artist. Victims of investment scams tend to show an incautious level of greed and gullibility, and many con artists target the elderly, but even alert and educated people may be taken in by other forms of a confidence trick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Victims/victims.htm Crimes-of-persuasion.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415230029/http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Victims/victims.htm |date=2007-04-15 }} ''Fraud Victim Advice / Assistance for Consumer Scams and Investment Frauds&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Huang and Orbach argue:
:“Cons succeed for inducing judgment errors—chiefly, errors arising from imperfect information and cognitive biases. In popular culture and among professional con men, the human vulnerabilities that cons exploit are depicted as ‘dishonesty,’ ‘greed,’ and ‘gullibility’ of the marks. Dishonesty, often represented by the expression ‘you can’t cheat an honest man,’ refers to the willingness of marks to participate in unlawful acts, such as rigged gambling and embezzlement. Greed, the desire to ‘get something for nothing,’ is a shorthand expression of marks’ beliefs that too-good-to-be-true gains are realistic. Gullibility reflects beliefs that marks are ‘suckers’ and ‘fools’ for entering into costly voluntary exchanges. Judicial opinions occasionally echo these sentiments."&lt;ref name="Huang &amp; Orbach"&gt;Huang &amp; Orbach.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accomplices, also known as [[shill]]s, help manipulate the mark into accepting the [[perpetrator]]'s plan. In a traditional confidence trick, the mark is led to believe that he will be able to win money or some other prize by doing some task. The accomplices may pretend to be strangers who have benefited from performing the task in the past.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3155">'''Ernst Bettler''' is a fictional [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[graphic designer]]. He was invented by Christopher Wilson in a 2000 [[hoax]] article published in the second issue of ''[[Dot Dot Dot (magazine)|Dot Dot Dot]]'', a magazine of visual culture.

According to the article, Bettler was asked in the 1950s to design advertisement [[poster]]s for ''Pfäfferli+Huber'' (P+H), a Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer. The article states that Bettler knew of the company's involvement in [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] experiments and decided to accept the commission with the intention of damaging P+H. The four posters he created, Wilson's article recounts, were exemplary works of [[International Typographic Style]] design, advertising P+H drugs such as "Contrazipan". However, according to the article, the posters featured abstract compositions that could be read as [[capital letters]] – spelling out "N - A - Z - I" when displayed in sequence. Wilson's article states that the public outcry that followed the public display of the posters ruined P+H in a matter of weeks.

Even though it was highly detailed and featured many photographs and illustrations, the article was a complete fabrication. Ernst Bettler, Pfäfferli+Huber and its drugs do not exist, and neither do the Swiss towns "Sumisdorf" and "Burgwald" that feature in the article – their names are presumably based on the real Swiss towns of [[Sumiswald]] and [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]]. Nonetheless, the story was well received in graphic design circles. Among others, the September/October 2001 "Graphic Anarchy" issue of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine hailed Bettler's work as "one of the greatest design interventions on record", and the 2002 graphic design textbook ''[[Problem Solved]]'' by [[Michael Johnson (writer)|Michael Johnson]] covers Bettler as one of the "founding fathers of the '[[culture-jamming]]' form of protest".

Wilson's article was first revealed to be false in a 2002 entry in the [[blog]] [[Lines and Splines]] by [[Andy Crewdson]]. The Bettler hoax and its reception was subsequently covered by [[Rick Poynor]] in an article in the February 2003 issue of ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]'' magazine, as well as by other blogs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">'''The Evans Road Wildfire''' was a smoldering [[peat fire]] in [[Eastern North Carolina]] that started on June 1, 2008 by lightning strike during North Carolina's drought - the worst on record.

It burned {{convert|41534|acre|km2}} inside the [[Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge]] and burned for three months. The wildlife refuge is located in the [[Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula]], where many forest fires are prone to start because of several ecological factors. The area is densely populated by trees, which makes it easy for fires to spread quickly; a layer of shrubs and dead plant material on the ground serve as fuel for fires. Under this layer, the [[pocosin]] soil is high in organic material, which acts as a charcoal-like substance that helps fires start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NC Extremes: NC Pocosins a Hotspot for Large Wildfires|url = http://climate.ncsu.edu/climateblog?id=138|website = State Climate Office of North Carolina|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

450 firefighters battled it. 71 high capacity pumps moved billions of gallons of water.

During [[World War II]] some 70,000 '''Finnish children''' ({{lang-fi|sotalapset}}, the 'war children' {{lang-sv|krigsbarn}}) were evacuated from [[Finland]], chiefly to [[Sweden]], but also to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;Korppi- Tommola, Aura. [http://library.csusm.edu/about/people/mchu/LBST307e.pdf "War and children in Finland during the Second World War."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007024214/http://library.csusm.edu/about/people/mchu/LBST307e.pdf |date=2011-10-07 }} p. 445-455. Paedagogica Historica  Vol. 44, No. 4, August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Most were evacuated during the [[Continuation War]] (1941-1944) to ease the situation for their parents who set out to rebuild their homes in the re-conquered [[Finnish Karelia|Karelia]] returning from the 1940 [[evacuation of Finnish Karelia]]. The first surge of evacuees arrived, however, during the [[Winter War]] when the Finns had reasons to fear a humanitarian catastrophe following the expected [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation.

[[File:Sotalapsen nimilappu ja tuntolevy.JPG|thumb|Identification document and tag of a Finnish war child.]]

== Effects ==
In retrospect, the evacuation has been considered psychologically flawed, as the separations turned out to inflict a far greater damage on the evacuees than the damage suffered by those children who had remained with their parents in Finland. In comparison to Finland's approximately 23,000 military casualties in the Winter War, the 66,000 in the Continuation war, and the total of 2,000 [[civilian casualties]] &amp;ndash; and the roughly equally many seriously wounded &amp;ndash; the war children were, of course, not physically injured, let alone killed. However, their number is of about the same size as that of the war invalids, and many of them feel their sufferings to be ignored.

==  Fate ==
After the war, Finland experienced times of economic hardship, and also substantial insecurity with regard to the Soviet Union's plans for Finland, which resulted in the delay of the return of the children for several years. Ultimately, about 20% of the war children stayed with their foster families after the war, who often adopted them. Many more returned to Sweden as adults, when the prolonged post-war hardship in Finland pushed large contingents of unemployed Finns to Sweden's booming economy in the 1950s&amp;ndash;60s.

== 2005 film – ''Mother of Mine'' ==
''[[Mother of Mine (film)|Mother of Mine]]'' (Finnish: ''Äideistä parhain'', Swedish: ''Den bästa av mödrar'') is a 2005 Finnish-Swedish film directed by [[Klaus Härö]] about a Finnish war child who is sent by his mother to live in Sweden during World War II. The film is based on a novel by Heikki Hietamies. It received good reviews from the Finnish press, and was selected as [[List of submissions to the 78th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Finland's submission for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]].

[[File:Gibbon's Tennis Court.jpg|thumb|Remains of Gibbon's Tennis Court, after a fire in 1809]]

'''Gibbon's Tennis Court''' was a building off [[Vere Street, Clare Market|Vere Street]] and [[Clare Market]], near [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in [[London]], [[England]].  Originally built as a [[real tennis]] court, it was used as a [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] from 1660 to 1663, shortly after the [[English Restoration]]. As a theatre, it has been variously called the "'''Theatre Royal, Vere Street'''", the "'''Vere Street Theatre'''", or (as in [[Samuel Pepys]]' diary) simply "The Theatre". It was the first permanent home for [[Thomas Killigrew]]'s [[King's Company]] and was the stage for some of the earliest appearances by professional [[actress]]es.

The theatre was destroyed by fire in 1809. The [[London School of Economics]], which covers most of Clare Market nowadays, retains some squash and real tennis courts in its older buildings.

== Tennis-court theatres ==

[[Tudor Style architecture|Tudor-style]] real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions &amp;mdash; about 75 by 30&amp;nbsp;feet &amp;mdash; are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, John (1996). ''The English Stage: A History of Drama and Performance''. Cambridge University Press. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The tennis courts were not used exclusively for tennis. In 1653, seven years before it saw lawful use as a theatre, an underground production of Killigrew's ''Claricilla'' was planned for Gibbon's court. The production was broken up before it debuted, reportedly betrayed to the army by one of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, Janet. (2004). "Theatre and Commonwealth". Milling and Thomson ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre''. Cambridge University Press. p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas killigrew 1650.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Thomas Killigrew]]'s acting troupe performed in a remodeled Gibbon's Tennis Court from 1660 to 1663.]]
After the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted [[Letters Patent]] to two companies to perform "legitimate drama" in London: the [[Duke's Company]] under the patronage of the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], led by [[William Davenant]], and the [[King's Company]], led by [[Thomas Killigrew]]. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] and [[English Civil War|civil war]] (including the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] and the [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]]), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres.  

Killigrew's remodelled Gibbon's Tennis Court opened first, on 8 November 1660, just two months after being given permission by the Crown.&lt;ref name="langhans2"&gt;Langhans, Edward (2000). "The theatre". Fisk, Deborah ''The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre''. Cambridge University Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The design was similar to the earlier [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]]-era "private" theatres, such as the [[Blackfriars Theatre|theatre in Blackfriars]]: a stage devoid of scenery facing a bench-filled pit on the auditorium floor and surrounded by one or two levels of U-shaped galleries.&lt;ref name="langhans2"/&gt;

== Competition ==

Not long after the opening, on 20 November, avid theatre-goer [[Samuel Pepys]] attended his first performance at Vere Street:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
…Mr. Shepley and I to the new Play-house near Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields (which was formerly Gibbon’s tennis-court), where the play of ''Beggar’s Bush'' was newly begun; and so we went in and saw it, it was well acted: and here I saw the first time one Moone,&lt;ref&gt;Actor [[Michael Mohun]].&lt;/ref&gt; who is said to be the best actor in the world, lately come over with the King, and indeed it is the finest play-house, I believe, that ever was in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1660/11/20/index.php The Diary of Samuel Pepys], Tuesday 20 November 1660.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pepys' high praise for the theatre is often taken to reflect his excitement regarding London's burgeoning theatrical scene rather than as commentary than on the quality of the tennis-court theatre itself. John Styan says it "seems a questionable statement about so makeshift a theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Styan, John. (1986). ''Restoration Comedy in Performance''. Cambridge University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Killigrew's competition, Davenant, would take another seven months to open his new theatre in nearby [[Lisle's Tennis Court]]; working more from the model of [[masque|court masque]] venues such as [[Inigo Jones]]’ [[Cockpit-in-Court]], he equipped it with a stage complete with a [[proscenium arch]] and moveable scenery, painted onto a series of sliding panels.  Opening in late June, 1661, Davenant's theatre would steal much of Vere Street's thunder.

Before then, though, Killigrew would generate some more excitement of his own, by being the first to stage plays with actresses, instead of actors, playing female roles. The first occasion, based on its newly-written prologue, is thought to have been a performance of ''[[Othello]]'' on 8 December 1660; authorities differ as to the name of the actress who played [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham, Robert and Matthews, William (1995). ''The Diary of Samuel Pepys.'' Volume 2. London: Harper Collins. Footnote, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Pepys records a 3 January 1661 restaging of ''Beggar’s Bush'' as "the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/01/03/index.php The Diary of Samuel Pepys], Thursday 3 January 1661.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Davenant’s theatre in Lisle’s Tennis Court opened, Vere Street’s popularity waned. Pepys, 4 July 1661: "I went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw ''[[Claricilla|Claracilla]]'' (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun&amp;mdash;and so will continue for a while I believe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/04/index.php The Diary of Samuel Pepys], Thursday 4 July 1661.&lt;/ref&gt; To remain competitive, Killigrew decided to construct a purpose-built theatre more to modern tastes. On 7 May 1663, just two-and-a-half years after the theatre in Lisle's Tennis Court opened, the King's Company moved to the new [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]] in Bridges Street. 

According to an 1811 Robert Wilkinson image, Gibbon's Tennis Court was destroyed by fire on 17 September 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Described at [http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/3/30/10/452? Martayan Lan Rare Books]. Retrieved 21 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the [[Stoll Theatre]] and the [[Peacock Theatre]] would be built at the same site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadlerswells.com/home/peacock_history.asp The Peacock Theatre - A brief history].

{{subprime mortgage crisis sidebar}}

The '''Great Recession in the United States''' was a severe [[financial crisis]] combined with a deep recession. While the recession officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, it took several years for the economy to recover to pre-crisis levels of [[Unemployment in the United States|employment]] and [[GDP|output]]. This slow recovery was due in part to households and financial institutions paying off debts accumulated in the years preceding the crisis&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/double-dip-or-just-one-big-economic-dive/2011/08/05/gIQANKAIxI_story.html Washington Post-Ezra Klein-Double Dip, or just one big economic dive-August 5, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; along with restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121120a.htm Federal Reserve-Ben Bernanke-The Economic Recovery and Economic Policy-November 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It followed the bursting of the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]], the [[United States housing market correction|housing market correction]] and [[subprime mortgage crisis]].  

The U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcic.gov/files/news_pdfs/2011-0127-fcic-releases-report.pdf Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission-Press Release-January 27, 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130170725/http://www.fcic.gov/files/news_pdfs/2011-0127-fcic-releases-report.pdf |date=January 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], roughly 8.7 million jobs (about 7%) were shed from February 2008 to February 2010, and real GDP contracted by 4.2% between Q4 2007 and Q2 2009, making the Great Recession the worst economic downturn since the [[Great Depression]]. The GDP bottom, or trough, was reached in the second quarter of 2009 (marking the technical end of the recession, defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining GDP).&lt;ref name="NBERSEP2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/sept2010.html|title=Business Cycle Dating Committee, National Bureau of Economic Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP did not regain its pre-crisis (Q4 2007) peak level until Q3 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1 FRED-Real GDP-Retrieved March 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment rose from 4.7% in November 2007 to peak at 10% in October 2009, before returning steadily to 4.7% in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE|title=Civilian Unemployment Rate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of jobs did not return to November 2007 levels until May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS FRED-All Employees Total Non-Farm-Retrieved March 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Households and non-profit organizations added approximately $8 trillion in debt during the 2000-2008 period (roughly doubling it and fueling the housing bubble), then reduced their debt level from the peak in Q3 2008 until Q3 2012, the only period this debt declined since at least the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CMDEBT#0 FRED-Households and Non-Profit Organizations Debt-retrieved March 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States national debt|debt held by the public]] rose from 35% GDP in 2007 to 77% GDP by 2016, as the government spent more while the private sector (e.g., households and businesses, particularly the banking sector) reduced the debt burdens accumulated during the pre-recession decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52370 CBO-Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017-2027 January 24, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/ FactCheck.org-Brooks Jackson-Obama's Final Numbers-September 29, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush Administration and continued during his Administration as completed and mostly profitable as of December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/business/us-signals-end-of-bailouts-of-automakers-and-wall-street.html?_r=0 New York Times-U.S. Declares Bank and Auto Bailouts Over, and Profitable-December 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
After the Great Depression of the 1930s, the American economy experienced robust growth, with periodic lesser recessions, for the rest of the 20th century. The federal government enforced the Securities Exchange Act (1934)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 | accessdate= 12 September 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Chandler Act (1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutebankruptcy.org/History3.htm |title=The Chandler Act |accessdate=12 September 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111172141/http://www.absolutebankruptcy.org/History3.htm |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which tightly regulated the financial markets. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulated the trading of the secondary securities market and The Chandler Act regulated the transactions in the banking sector.

There were a few investment banks, small by current standards, that expanded during the late 1970s, such as JP Morgan. The Reagan Administration in the early 1980s began a thirty-year period of financial deregulation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfczone.com/Summary-Inside-Job-Condensed.html |title=Summary - Inside Job - Condensed Version | accessdate= 8 September 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial sector sharply expanded, in part because investment banks were going public, bringing them vast sums of stockholder capital. From 1978 to 2008, the average salary for workers outside of investment banking in the U.S. increased from $40k to $50k&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; – a 25 percent salary increase - while the average salary in investment banking increased from $40k to $100k – a 150 percent salary increase. Deregulation also precipitated financial fraud - often tied to real estate investments - sometimes on a grand scale, such as the [[savings and loan crisis]]. By the end of the 1980s, many workers in the financial sector were being jailed for fraud, but many Americans were losing their life savings. Large investment banks began merging and developing Financial conglomerates; this led to the formation of the giant investment banks like Goldman Sachs.

According to numbers published by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] in May 2008, the GDP growth of the previous two quarters was positive. As one common definition of a recession is negative economic growth for at least two consecutive fiscal quarters, some analysts suggested this indicates that the U.S. economy was not in a recession at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Causes ==
{{Main|Subprime mortgage crisis}}
Federal Reserve Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] testified in September 2010 regarding the causes of the crisis. He wrote that there were shocks or triggers (i.e., particular events that touched off the crisis) and vulnerabilities (i.e., structural weaknesses in the financial system, regulation and supervision) that amplified the shocks. Examples of triggers included: losses on subprime mortgage securities that began in 2007 and a [[bank run|run]] on the [[shadow banking system]] that began in mid-2007, which adversely affected the functioning of money markets. Examples of vulnerabilities in the ''private'' sector included: financial institution dependence on unstable sources of short-term funding such as [[repurchase agreements]] or Repos; deficiencies in corporate risk management; excessive use of leverage (borrowing to invest); and inappropriate usage of derivatives as a tool for taking excessive risks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the ''public'' sector included: statutory gaps and conflicts between regulators; ineffective use of regulatory authority; and ineffective crisis management capabilities. Bernanke also discussed "[[Too big to fail]]" institutions, monetary policy, and trade deficits.&lt;ref name="BernankeFCIC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm |title=Bernanke-Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcic.gov/files/news_pdfs/2011-0127-fcic-releases-report.pdf Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission-Press Release-January 27, 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130170725/http://www.fcic.gov/files/news_pdfs/2011-0127-fcic-releases-report.pdf |date=January 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the important catalysts of the subprime crisis were the influx of money from the private sector, the banks entering into the mortgage bond market, government policies aimed at expanding homeownership, speculation by many home buyers, and the predatory lending practices of the mortgage lenders, specifically the adjustable-rate mortgage, [[Subprime lending|2–28 loan]], that mortgage lenders sold directly or indirectly via mortgage brokers.&lt;ref name="The downturn in facts and figures"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7073131.stm |title=The downturn in facts and figures; |publisher=BBC |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wall Street and in the financial industry, [[moral hazard]] lay at the core of many of the causes.&lt;ref name="brown1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid={9F4C2252-8BA7-459C-B34E-407DB32921C1}&amp;siteid=rss |last=Brown |first=Bill |title=Uncle Sam as sugar daddy; MarketWatch Commentary: The moral hazard problem must not be ignored |publisher=MarketWatch |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[shadow banking|non-depository banking system]] was not subject to the same risk-taking regulations as the depository banks. The top 5 investment banks at the core of the crisis (Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) had accumulated approximately $4 trillion in debt by 2007 with a high leverage ratio (25:1 or higher) meaning a 4% decline in the value of their assets would render them insolvent. Many housing securities in their portfolios became worthless during the crisis. They were also vulnerable to disruptions in their short-term financing (often overnight in Repo markets). They had been encouraged to add to their debt by the SEC in a 2004 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html NYT-Stephen Labaton-Agency's '04 rule let banks pile up new debt-October 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Giving [[Fannie Mae]] &amp; [[Freddie Mac]] GSE status allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to borrow money in the bond market at lower rates (yields) than other financial institutions. With their funding advantage, they purchased and invested in huge numbers of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, and they did so with lower capital requirements than other regulated financial institutions and banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to experience large losses on their retained portfolios, especially on their [[Alt-A]] and [[subprime]] investments. In 2008, the sheer size of their retained portfolios and mortgage guarantees led the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] to conclude that they would soon be insolvent.

===Rise in unemployment===
{{See|Unemployment in the United States}}
The Great Recession cost millions of jobs initially and high unemployment lingered for years after the official end of the recession in June 2009. One of the frightening aspects of the crisis was how fast jobs were lost in the midst of the crisis. From November 2008 to April 2009, an average of 744,000 jobs were lost per month; for scale, about 200,000 jobs were created per month from 2011-2016. At the time, no one knew how deep the recession would go, which is one reason Congress passed and President Obama signed the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) in January 2009. Known as "The Stimulus", ARRA was a roughly $800 billion mix of tax cuts (about one-third) and spending programs (about two-thirds) with the primary impact spread over three years.&lt;ref name="FRED_Payems"&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS FRED-Total Non-Farm Payrolls-Retrieved March 24, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Many economists argued the stimulus was too small, while conservatives such as the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] argued that deficit reduction was the priority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/in-defense-of-obama-20141008 Rolling Stone-Paul Krugman-In Defense of Obama-October 8, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of jobs ("total non-farm payrolls" which includes both private sector and government jobs) reached a peak of 138.4 million in January 2008, then fell to a trough (bottom) of 129.7 million in February 2010, a decline of nearly 8.8 million jobs or 6.8%. The number of jobs did not regain the January 2008 level until May 2014. For comparison, the severe 1981-82 recession had a jobs decline of 3.2%.&lt;ref name="FRED_Payems"/&gt; Full-time employment did not regain its pre-crisis level until August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12500000 FRED-Employed Usually Work Full Time-Retrieved March 27, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate ("U-3") rose from the pre-recession level of 4.7% in November 2008 to a peak of 10.0% in October 2009, before steadily falling back to the pre-recession level by May 2016. One factor to consider is that the job count was artificially high and the unemployment rate was artificially low prior to the recession due to an unsustainable [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]], which had increased construction and other employment substantially. In 2003, prior to the significant expansion of subprime lending of 2004-2006, the unemployment rate was close to 6%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE FRED-Unemployment Rate-Retrieved March 24, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; The wider measure of unemployment ("U-6") which includes those employed part-time for economic reasons or marginally attached to the labor force rose from 8.4% pre-crisis to a peak of 17.1% in October 2009. It did not regain the pre-crisis level until May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE FRED-U6 Unemployment Rate-Retrieved March 27, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquidity crisis===
{{main article|Financial crisis of 2007–2010}}
The major investment banks at the core of the crisis obtained significant funding in overnight [[Repurchase agreement|Repo]] markets, which were disrupted during the crisis. In effect, there was a [[bank run|run]] on the essentially unregulated [[shadow banking]] (non-depository) banking system, which had grown larger than the regulated depository system. Unable to obtain financing, they were forced to merge (in the case of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch), declare bankruptcy (Lehman Brothers) or obtain federal depository bank charters and private loans (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). Insurer [[American International Group|AIG]], which had guaranteed many of the liabilities of these and other banks around the globe through derivatives called [[credit default swaps]], also was bailed-out and taken over by the government at an initial cost exceeding $100 billion. The bailout of AIG was essentially a conduit for the U.S. government to bailout banks around the world, as the money was used by AIG to make good on its obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1557279 Gary Gorton-Questions and Answers about the Financial Crisis Prepared for the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission-Posted February 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

A timeline of some of the significant events in the crisis from 2007-2008 includes:
*From late 2007 through September 2008, before the official October 3 bailout, there was a series of smaller bank rescues that occurred which totalled almost $800 billion.
*In the summer of 2007, Countrywide Financial drew down a $11 billion line of credit and then secured an additional $12 billion bailout in September. This may be considered the start of the crisis.
*In mid-December 2007, Washington Mutual bank cut more than 3,000 jobs and closed its sub-prime mortgage business.
*In mid-March 2008, Bear Stearns was bailed out by a gift of $29 billion non-recourse treasury bill debt assets.
*In early July 2008, depositors at the Los Angeles offices of [[IndyMac]] Bank frantically lined up in the street to withdraw their money. On July 11, IndyMac, a spinoff of Countrywide, was seized by federal regulators—and called for a $32 billion bailout—as the mortgage lender succumbed to the pressures of tighter credit, tumbling home prices and rising foreclosures. That day the financial markets plunged as investors tried to gauge whether the government would [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|attempt to save]] mortgage lenders [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]. The two were placed into [[conservatorship]] on September 7, 2008.
*During the weekend of September 13–14, 2008, [[Lehman Brothers]] declared [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|bankruptcy]] after failing to find a buyer; [[Bank of America]] agreed to purchase investment bank Merrill Lynch; the insurance giant [[AIG]] sought a bridge loan from the Federal Reserve; and a consortium of 10 banks created an emergency fund of at least $70&amp;nbsp;billion to deal with the effects of Lehman's closure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html|title=After Frantic Day, Wall St. Banks Falter |work=The New York Times |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the consortium put forth by financial titan J.P.

*On September 16, 2008, news emerged that the [[Federal Reserve]] might give AIG an $85&amp;nbsp;billion rescue package; on September 17, 2008, this was confirmed. The terms of the package were that the Federal Reserve would receive an 80% public stake in the firm.

As of mid-November 2008, it was estimated that the new loans, purchases, and liabilities of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and FDIC, brought on by the financial crisis, totalled over $5 trillion: $1 trillion in loans by the Fed to broker-dealers through the emergency [[discount window]], $1.8 trillion in loans by the Fed through the [[Term Auction Facility]], $700 billion to be raised by the Treasury for the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]], $200 billion insurance for the [[Government sponsored enterprise|GSEs]] by the Treasury, and $1.5 trillion insurance for unsecured bank debt by FDIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/12/paulson-bernanke-fed-biz-wall-cx_lm_1112bailout.html|title=Washington's $5 Trillion Tab |first=Elizabeth |last=Moyer |date=November 12, 2008|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Great Recession was different in kind from the all the recessions since the Great Depression, as it also involved a banking crisis and the de-leveraging (debt reduction) of highly indebted households. Research indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2012-10-15/sorry-u-s-recoveries-really-aren-t-different |title=Sorry, U.S. Recoveries Really Aren't Different |date=15 October 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=5 October 2017 |via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Carmen Reinhart]] stated in August 2011: "Debt de-leveraging [reduction] takes about seven years ... And in the decade following severe financial crises, you tend to grow by 1 to 1.5 percentage points less than in the decade before, because the decade before was fueled by a boom in private borrowing, and not all of that growth was real. The unemployment figures in advanced economies after falls are also very dark. Unemployment remains anchored about five percentage points above what it was in the decade before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/double-dip-or-just-one-big-economic-dive/2011/08/05/gIQANKAIxI_story.html?|title=Double Dip, or just one big economic dive?|date=30 April 2012 |publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] explained during November 2012 several of the economic headwinds that slowed the recovery:
*The housing sector did not rebound, as was the case in prior recession recoveries, as the sector was severely damaged during the crisis. Millions of foreclosures had created a large surplus of properties and consumers were paying down their debts rather than purchasing homes.
*Credit for borrowing and spending by individuals (or investing by corporations) was not readily available as banks paid down their debts.
*Restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts (i.e., austerity) was not sufficient to offset private sector weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Bernanke_Recovery"&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121120a.htm Federal Reserve-Ben Bernanke-The Economic Recovery and Economic Policy-November 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, U.S. federal spending rose from 19.1% GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2007 to 24.4% GDP in FY2009 (the last year budgeted by President Bush) before falling towards to 20.4% GDP in 2014, closer to the historical average. In dollar terms, federal spending was actually higher in 2009 than in 2014, despite a historical trend of a roughly 5% annual increase. This reduced real GDP growth by approximately 0.5% per quarter on average between Q3 2010 and Q2 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#2 CBO Historical Tables-Retrieved March 24, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Both households and government practicing austerity at the same time was a recipe for a slow recovery.&lt;ref name="Bernanke_Recovery"/&gt;

Several key economic variables (e.g., Job level, real GDP per capita, stock market, and household net worth) hit their low point (trough) in 2009 or 2010, after which they began to turn upward, recovering to pre-recession (2007) levels between late 2012 and May 2014 (close to Reinhart's prediction), which marked the recovery of all jobs lost during the recession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS FRED-All Employees Total Non-Farm-Retrieved January 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA FRED-Real GDP per Capita-Retrieved January 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TNWBSHNO FRED-Household and Non-Profit Net Worth-Retrieved January 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSGDA188S FRED-Federal Surplus or Deficit as Percent GDP-Retrieved January 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Real median household income fell to a trough of $53,331 in 2012, but recovered to an all-time high of $59,039 by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N Federal Reserve Economic Data-Real Median Household Income-Retrieved January 22, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gains during the recovery were very unevenly distributed. Economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] wrote in June 2016 that the top 1% of families captured 52% of the total real income (GDP) growth per family from 2009-2015. The gains were more evenly distributed after the tax increases in 2013 on higher-income earners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2015.pdf Emmanuel Saez-Striking it richer: The evolution of top incomes in the U.S.-June 30,2016]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Federal Reserve, median family net worth had peaked at about $140,000 in 2007, fell to a low point of $84,000 in 2013, and only partially recovered to $97,000 by 2016. Middle-class families had much of their wealth in housing, driving much of the decline when the housing bubble burst.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm Federal Reserve-Survey of Consumer Finances 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare costs in the United States slowed in the period after the Great Recession (2008–2012). A decrease in inflation and in the number of hospital stays per population drove a reduction in the rate of growth in aggregate hospital costs at this time. Growth slowed most for surgical stays and least for maternal and neonatal stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moore B, Levit K and Elixhauser A |title=Costs for Hospital Stays in the United States, 2012 |work=HCUP Statistical Brief #181 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD |date=October 2014 |url=https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb181-Hospital-Costs-United-States-2012.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of $626B was invested, loaned, or granted due to various bailout measures, while $390B had been returned to the Treasury.

{{Criminal law}}
'''Implied consent''' is [[consent]] which is not expressly granted by a person, but rather implicitly granted by a person's actions and the facts and circumstances of a particular situation (or in some cases, by a person's silence or inaction).  The term is most commonly encountered in the context of [[United States]] [[Drunk driving (United States)|drunk driving laws]]. There are no U.S. States that allow implied consent as an excuse for rape in a court of law.

==Driving while intoxicated==
{{see also|Drunk driving (United States)}}
All [[U.S. state]]s have [[Driver's license|driver licensing]] laws which state that a licensed driver has given their implied consent to a certified breathalyzer or by a blood sample by their choice, or similar manner of determining [[blood alcohol concentration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soronen|first1=Lisa|title=Blood Alcohol Testing: No Consent, No Warrant, No Crime?|url=http://www.ncsl.org/blog/2016/01/12/blood-alcohol-testing-no-consent-no-warrant-no-crime.aspx|website=NCSL|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implied consent laws may result in punishment for those who refuse to cooperate with blood alcohol testing after an arrest for suspected impaired driving, including civil consequences such as a driver's license suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Blood Alcohol Testing in Drunk and Impaired Driving Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk_driving/Drunk_Blood_Alcohol.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=30 October 2017|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Birchfield v. North Dakota]]'' held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a [[Searches incident to a lawful arrest|search]] under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant, however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marimow|first1=Ann E.|title=Supreme Court requires warrants for some, but not all drunken-driving tests|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/supreme-court-requires-warrants-for-some-but-not-all-drunk-driving-tests/2016/06/23/fa1033dc-395f-11e6-a254-2b336e293a3c_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=1 September 2017|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically addressing implied consent laws, the court in the Birchfield opinion stated that while their "prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied-consent laws" that "there must be a limit to the consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads" and "that motorists could be deemed to have consented to only those conditions that are 'reasonable' in that they have a 'nexus' to the privilege of driving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birchfield v. North Dakota, Opinion of the Court|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1468_8n59.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2017|pages=36–37 (41–42 of pdf)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''People v. Arredondo'', the [[California courts of appeal|California Courts of appeals]] debated whether authorities could seize an unwarranted blood sample from an unconscious person suspected of driving under the influence without offending the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches or seizures. The court ruled that the defendant "consented to such a search in advance solely by operation of the statute in California, which declares that anyone who drives a vehicle in this state is "deemed to have given his or her consent" to blood alcohol testing under specified conditions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''People v. Arredondo'', 245 Cal. App. 4th 186, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 563 (Ct. App. 2016).

&lt;/ref&gt; Though Arredondo was unconscious at the time his blood was drawn, the court found that the "warrantless search was justified on the consent since California's "implied consent" law states "one who drives a motor vehicle in this state is "deemed" to consent to blood alcohol testing". Moreover, the court ruled that the extraction was justified by "exigent circumstances, statutorily implied consent, the officer's belief that the extraction was lawful in light of long-standing practice under prior case law and good faith reliance on the implied consent statute".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1966, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[Schmerber v. California]] held that a warrantless blood sample is justified under the Fourth Amendment's pressing circumstances because alcohol in one's blood would be diminished by the body's natural metabolic system if officers were to wait for a warrant. The Fifth Amendment only applies to interrogation and testimony and does not prohibit blood tests. The case resulted in a conviction because it was decided that blood test results do not constitute testimony, proof of a confession or any other communicative acts.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmerber v. California'', 384 U.S. 757, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-evidential testing===
In the United States, implied consent laws generally do not apply to [[Breathalyzer#Law enforcement|Preliminary Breath Test (PBT)]] testing (small handheld devices, as opposed to evidential breath test devices). For a handheld field breath tester to be used as evidential breath testing, the device must be properly certified and calibrated, evidential procedures must be followed, and it may be necessary to administer an "implied consent" warning to the suspect prior to testing.{{citation needed | date=June 2018}}

In most US jurisdictions, participation in a PBT test is voluntary; however for some violations, such as refusals by [[Commercial driver's license|commercial drivers]] or by drivers under 21 years of age, some US jurisdictions may impose implied consent consequences for a PBT refusal.{{citation needed | date=June 2018}} For example, the state of [[Michigan]] has a roadside PBT law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=mcl-257-625a Michigan Vehicle Code § 257.625a]&lt;/ref&gt; that requires motorist a preliminary breath test;&lt;ref name="misp"&gt;[https://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,4643,7-123-72297_30536_25802-15874--,00.html Michigan State Police **Breath Test Program and Training Information**]&lt;/ref&gt; however, for non-commercial drivers Michigan's penalties are limited to a "civil infraction" penalty, with no violation "points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8665-24488--,00.html|title=SOS - Substance Abuse and Driving|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in [[Drunk driving in the United States#Standardized Field Sobriety Tests|"field sobriety tests" (FSTs or SFSTs)]] is voluntary in the US.&lt;ref name="nolo_ref-long"&gt;[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press ("As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dui.findlaw.com/dui-arrests/can-i-refuse-to-take-field-sobriety-tests.html Findlaw ''Can I Refuse to Take Field Sobriety Tests?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contexts==

===Court procedure===
Typically, a [[party (law)|party]] has the right to [[Objection (law)|object]] in court to a line of questioning or at the introduction of a particular piece of [[Evidence (law)|evidence]].  If the party fails to object in a timely fashion, he is deemed to have [[Waiver|waived]] his right to object and cannot raise the objection on [[appeal]].  This is a form of implied consent.&lt;ref name=ThomsonGale&gt;{{cite web|title=Implied Consent|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/7507/Implied-Consent.html|website=jrank|publisher=Net Industries|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]], "Any person providing the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[California Department of Motor Vehicles]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with a mailing address shall … consent to
receive [[service of process]] …".&lt;ref&gt;[[California Vehicle Code]] § 1808.21(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual assault ===
{{Main|Sexual consent}}
In Canada, implied consent has not been a defence for [[sexual assault]] since the 1999 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case of ''[[R v Ewanchuk]]'', where the court unanimously ruled that consent has to be explicit, instead of merely "implied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2015/11/13/no-still-means-no-editorial.html|title=No still means "no": Editorial|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2015|website=thestar.com|publisher=[[The Toronto Star]]|access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, rape has traditionally been defined as the victim's nonconsent to sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Wicktom"&gt;Wicktom, Cynthia Ann. "Focusing on the Offender's Forceful Conduct: A Proposal for the Redefiniton of Rape Laws." George Washington Law Review 56.2 (1988): 399-430.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the law of rape is founded on a paradigm of violent stranger rape which fails to clearly proscribe less violent rapes." &lt;ref name= "Remick"&gt;Remick, Lani Anne. "Read her lips: An argument for a verbal consent standard in rape." University of Pennsylvania Law Review 141.3 (1993): 1103-1151.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambiguity requires the courts to determine whether the victim consented or not. During this process it is possible that, "courts examine objective evidence of the woman's state of mind, such as her behavior during the alleged rape and her character in general." &lt;ref name= "Wicktom" /&gt; This would allow the defense a chance to convince the court that consent was in some way implied by the victim. Many actions can be perceived by the court as implied consent: having a previous relationship with the alleged rapist (e.g. befriending, dating, cohabitating, or marrying),&lt;ref name= "Balos"&gt;Balos, Beverly, and Mary Louise Fellows. "Guilty of the Crime of Trust: Nonstranger Rape." Minn. L. Rev. 75 (1990): 599.&lt;/ref&gt; consenting to sexual contact on previous occasions, flirting,&lt;ref name= "Wicktom" /&gt; wearing "provocative" clothing,&lt;ref&gt;Tchen, Christina M. "Rape Reform and a Statutory Consent Defense." J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 74 (1983): 1518.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. These actions are not explicitly defined by the law as indicators of consent;&lt;ref name= "Balos" /&gt; however, the court may come to the conclusion that these actions in some way implied consent, as has often been the result in non-stranger rape cases.&lt;ref name= "Balos" /&gt; Implied consent may also be used as a defense in the case of violent stranger rape.&lt;ref name= "Remick" /&gt;

Common law rape is generally defined as "the act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten years by force without the consent and against the will of the victim"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Hazel v. State'', 157 A. 2d 922&lt;/ref&gt;  While force is a key element of rape, the evidence must conclude that either the victim resisted and their resistance was overcome by force, or that they were prevented from resisting because their safety was threatened. However, since resistance is relevant to crimes of sexual assault, the presence or absence of it depends on the facts and circumstances in each case.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While consent may involve submission, submission itself does not necessarily imply consent. In other words, "submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; since it has been proven that non-resistance or compliance with an attacker's request is a way to protect oneself from additional and often more severe abuse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Da Luz|first=Carla|last2=Weckerly|first2=Pamela|date=January 1993|title=The Texas 'Condom Rape' case: Caution Construed as Consent|url=|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|volume=3|pages=95–104|via=Nexis Uni}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Genuine and continuing fear of such harm", or abuse, "on the part of the persecuting witness" is a significant factor in determining whether the attacker committed a "felonious and forcible act against the will and consent of the prosecuting witness".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a tactic for survival, rape counselors advise women to "do whatever is necessary to protect themselves from physical injury and to save their lives" in a threatening situation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Spousal rape===
{{main|Spousal rape}}
In many [[common law]] jurisdictions, a couple who married were deemed to have given "implied consent" to have sex with each other, a doctrine which barred prosecution of a spouse for [[rape]].  This doctrine is now considered obsolete in Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''R v R'' [1992] 1 AC 599&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, however, some state legislature offer leniency to perpetrators of spousal rape.&lt;ref name="rainn"&gt;[https://www.rainn.org/pdf-files-and-other-documents/Public-Policy/Issues/vaw_spousal_rape.pdf "How is Spousal Rape Treated?"], compiled by the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI)&lt;/ref&gt;  These legislations typically require the use of physical violence from the perpetrator in order to be considered a felony.  Reasons given relate to evidence and the potential for malicious prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2584&amp;context=californialawreview Rape and Rape Laws: Sexism in Society and Law], Cal. L. Rev., v. 61, issue 3 (May-1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1984 Virginia Supreme Court Case Weishaupt v. Commonwealth. it states that "[A] wife can unilaterally revoke her implied consent to marital sex where ... *292 she has made manifest her intent to terminate the marital relationship by living separate and apart from her husband; refraining from voluntary sexual intercourse with her husband; and, in light of all the circumstances, conducting herself in a manner that establishes a de facto end to the marriage."&lt;ref name="Kizer v. Com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/virginia/supreme-court/1984/831968-1.html|title=Kizer v. Com.|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the spouse to commit what would be considered rape outside of marriage, inside the confines of the marriage as long as the de facto end of the marriage has not occurred. Again in the Virginia Supreme Court in 1984 Kizer v. Commonwealth upheld the ruling.&lt;ref name="Kizer v. Com"/&gt;

Idaho State legislature states, "No person shall be convicted of rape for any act or acts with that person's spouse…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 18-6107 – Idaho State Legislature|url=http://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title18/T18CH61/SECT18-6107/|website=legislature.idaho.gov|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless the perpetrator used physical violence. Similar to Idaho, South Carolina State legislature only considers spousal sexual battery as a felony if "accomplished through use of aggravated force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Laws - Title 16 - Chapter 3 - Offenses Against The Person|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c003.php|website=www.scstatehouse.gov|accessdate=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oklahoma State Law, being one of the more extreme examples, excludes spousal rape from their definition of rape by claiming, "Rape is an act of sexual intercourse involving vaginal or anal penetration accomplished with a male or female who is not the spouse of the perpetrator…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Defined|url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=69602|website=www.oscn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonwealth v. Chretien in Massachusetts in 1981 stated that, "There was no unfairness in subjecting a defendant to criminal prosecution for rape of his wife under G. L. c. 265, Section 22, as amended by St. 1974, c. 474, Section 1, which this court construes to eliminate the common law spousal exclusion, where the rape occurred after the wife had obtained a judgment of divorce nisi and was therefore unlawful even under the common law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/383/383mass123.html|title=CHRETIEN, COMMONWEALTH vs., 383 Mass. 123|website=masscases.com|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that the husband could be convicted of rape only because the wife had already ordered divorce papers.

Some states however do not offer leniency to perpetrators of [[Marital rape|spousal rape]].

In State v. Smith 1981 in New Jersey one of the concurring opinions states, "The statute has never contained any exception or exemption. I would construe it to mean exactly what it says and would hold that a husband who had carnal knowledge of his wife forcibly and against her will was guilty of rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1981/85-n-j-193-0.html|title=State v. Smith|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case affirmed that rape can still take place while a marriage is still ongoing.

Similarly in People vs. Liberta 1984 in New York, the opinion states about the Marriage Exception, "This statement is an apt characterization of the marital exemption; it lacks a rational basis, and therefore violates the equal protection clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/33260|title=People v.

In the United States, if a person is at risk of death or injury but unconscious or otherwise unable to respond, other people including members of the public and [[paramedic]]s may assume implied consent to touch the person to provide [[first aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brouhard|first1=Rod|title=Before You Save a Life: Understanding Medical Consent|url=https://www.verywell.com/before-you-save-a-life-understanding-medical-consent-1298835|website=verywell|publisher=Dotdash|accessdate=30 October 2017|date=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states have [[Good Samaritan law]]s that protect persons giving aid from legal liability, but the type of persons (laypeople versus healthcare professionals) and the amount of protection varies.

=== Reproductive Healthcare ===
Studies have indicated that implied consent is questionable due to the value patients place on being informed on even the simplest procedures being done to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Easton|first=Raul|date=|title=Defining the Scope of Implied Consent in the Emergency Department|url=|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics|volume=7|pages=35–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are varying events where implied consent can be seen in reproductive healthcare. An example of implied consent being utilized is when complication arise during routine childbirth and actions need to be taken in order to help the mother and fetus. If complications arise during a natural delivery, an emergency cesarean delivery may be performed, even if the mother had previously rejected the option. However this can only occur if the life of the mother or fetus is in danger.&lt;ref name="Dickens 181–184"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=Bernard M.|last2=Cook|first2=Rebecca J.|date=2015-02-01|title=Types of consent in reproductive health care|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.11.001|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=128|issue=2|pages=181–184|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.11.001|issn=1879-3479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implied consent is narrow in that "intervention must be necessary, not merely convenient".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=Bernard M.|last2=Cook|first2=Rebecca J.|date=2015-02-01|title=Types of consent in reproductive health care|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.11.001|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=128|issue=2|pages=181–184|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.11.001|issn=1879-3479|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implied consent in law indicates that "medical necessity requires a genuine perception of emergency, and a reasonable response".&lt;ref name="Dickens 181–184"/&gt; Some doctors have tried to claim implied consent in the sterilization of women belonging to ethnic minority groups in Europe. This then led to the formation of laws concerning human rights by international treaties and national legislatures that state consent must be given freely by the person in regards to their sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zampas|first=Christina|last2=Lamačková|first2=Adriana|date=2011-08-01|title=Forced and coerced sterilization of women in Europe|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2011.05.002|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=114|issue=2|pages=163–166|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2011.05.002|issn=1879-3479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organ donation===
Some countries have legislation allowing for implied consent for organ donation, asking people to opt out of organ donation instead of opt in, but allow family refusals.&lt;ref&gt;Keeping kidneys, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, Volume 90, Number 10, October 2012, 713-792 [http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/10/12-021012/en/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacqueline "Jacqui" Saburido''' ({{IPA-es|xakeˈline saβuˈɾiðo}}; born 20 December 1978) is a [[Venezuelan]] burn survivor who campaigns against [[drunk driving]].

==Early life==
The only child of Rosalia and Amadeo Saburido, she lived in [[Caracas, Venezuela]] for all of her childhood.  Living with her father after her parents [[divorce]]d, she studied engineering in the hope of taking over the family air conditioning business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dartcenter.org/content/chasing-hope?section=6|title=Chasing Hope|date=2003-03-02|work=Dart Center|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Accident===
On September 19, 1999, Saburido attended a birthday party near [[Austin, Texas]]. She and her friends Laura Guerrero, Johan Daal and Johanna Gil decided to drive home after a few hours, and accepted a ride home from classmate Natalia Chpytchak-Bennett. At the same time, Reginald Stephey, an 18-year-old [[high school]] student, was driving home alone after drinking beers with his friends at a party. On the outskirts of Austin, Stephey's 1996 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] [[Head-on collision|collided head-on]] with Chpytchak-Bennett's 1990 [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]] Regency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dartcenter.org/content/chasing-hope?section=4|title=Chasing Hope|last=Hafet|first=David|date=2003-03-02|website=|publisher=Dart Center|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrero and Chpytchak-Bennett were killed instantly, while Gil and Daal suffered minor injuries. Chpytchak-Bennett's Oldsmobile caught fire, and Saburido's feet were trapped under the seat, preventing her from escaping. Fortunately [[paramedic]]s John McIntosh and Bryan Fitzpatrick happened to be driving past and were flagged down by Stephey. The fire had spread, and the flames were leaping several feet up into the air by the time they arrived. McIntosh put out the fire with his extinguisher, and the two men set about removing everyone from the vehicle. Saburido was still trapped, and Macintosh and Fitzpatrick did not have the necessary equipment to free her. The fire then restarted, forcing McIntosh and Fitzpatrick to retreat. Saburido was inside the car for 45 seconds until a fire truck arrived to extinguish the fire.  Saburido was then cut from the car and airlifted to the burn unit in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dartcenter.org/content/chasing-hope?section=5|title=Chasing Hope|date=2003-03-02|work=Dart Center|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saburido suffered second and third degree burns to over 60% of her body, but survived despite her doctor's expectations. Her fingers had to be amputated, but there was enough bone left on her thumb to construct an [[opposable thumb]]. She lost her hair, ears, nose, lips, left eyelid, and much of her vision. Saburido subsequently underwent more than 120 reconstructive operations, including [[cornea]] transplants to restore her left eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dartcenter.org/content/chasing-hope?section=7|title=Chasing Hope|date=2003-03-02|work=Dart Center|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In June 2001, Reggie Stephey was convicted on two counts of [[vehicular homicide|intoxicated manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to two concurrent seven-year prison sentences inside [[Huntsville Unit]] and fined $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/headlines/?SecID=2&amp;ArID=9916 |title=Stephey gets 7 years and fined $20,000. - YNN - Your News Now |publisher=News8austin.com |date=2001-06-27 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/headlines/?SecID=2&amp;ArID=9627 |title=Stephey found guilty - YNN - Your News Now |publisher=News8austin.com |date=2001-06-22 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saburido and Stephey met for the first time after his trial and conviction in 2001. Saburido has stated that Stephey "destroyed my life completely," but forgave him. Regarding the meeting, Stephey later stated that "What sticks out in my mind is, 'Reggie, I don't hate you.' It's really touching someone can look you in the eyes and have that much compassion after all that I have caused."

Saburido allowed graphic post-accident photographs of herself to be used in the media (posters, TV-commercials, and internet chain mail) to illustrate a possible outcome of drunk driving.&lt;ref name=afacetoremember&gt;[http://www.news8austin.com/content/top_stories/?ArID=56676  A face to remember] by Nicole Traynor, News 8 Austin, December 31, 2002.{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is most well known for a commercial in which she holds a pre-accident photo of herself in front of the camera, which she lowers to reveal her disfigured face and says, "This is me, after being hit by a drunk driver." When asked why she appeared in the campaign, Saburido stated "I feel very good to do it because I know people can understand a little more what happened to me -- why my life changed completely. So I think for me, for everybody, it's a good opportunity."&lt;ref name=NPR1&gt;[https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/oct/texas_dwi/index.html A Sobering Message to Drunk Drivers], National Public Radio (NPR), October 18, 2002. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415184633/http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/oct/texas_dwi/index.html |date=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure the material involving Saburido that was used in an ad campaign by the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] could also be used in schools, the videos and photos taken of her involved the use of soft lighting to improve her appearance and consultation with child psychologists to ensure the material, although graphic, would not frighten children.&lt;ref name=NPR1/&gt;

Regarding her life after the accident, Saburido stated that she has never given up: "If a person stumbles, he must pick himself up and keep going. I believe this is very important; if not, life would not have much sense."&lt;ref name=afacetoremember/&gt;

Saburido appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on November 17, 2003. She was also interviewed on the [[Australia]]n ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' on March 14, 2004 and was featured in a [[Discovery Health Channel|Discovery Health]] documentary on [[face transplant]]s. She continues to educate people on drunk driving. [[Oprah Winfrey]] has called Saburido the one person she had met who defined "inner beauty" and that she is "a woman who defines survival."

Stephey served his full sentence, having an appeal denied in 2005. He was released from the [[Huntsville Unit]] in Texas on June 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/top_stories/default.asp?ArID=212397 |title=Reginald Stephey released from prison - YNN - Your News Now |publisher=News8austin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saburido stated: "I don't hate him, I don't feel bad because he's out, he can reconstruct his life again."&lt;ref name=victimforgives&gt;[http://www.txcn.com/sharedcontent/dws/txcn/austin/stories/062408kvuestephey-mm.374d710b.html Victim forgives newly-released drunk driver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628125034/http://www.txcn.com/sharedcontent/dws/txcn/austin/stories/062408kvuestephey-mm.374d710b.html |date=2008-06-28 }} by Shelton Green, Texas Cable News (TXCN), June 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Saburido is currently living in her hometown of Caracas, Venezuela.&lt;ref name=afacetoremember/&gt;

On May 20, 2011, Saburido again appeared on the fourth to last episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', a show dedicated to Oprah's Favorite Guests, including [[Mattie Stepanek]] and her "all-time favorite" [[Tererai Trent]].  During the segment Saburido revealed that as of the taping of that show, she had undergone over 120 surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqui's Struggle|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Jacquis-Struggle-Video_1|website=Oprah.com|accessdate=29 September 2015|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face transplant===
Saburido was among 21 disfigured people who had approached surgeons at a [[London]] hospital to carry out [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s first [[face transplant]] operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medindia.net/news/healthwatch/facialtransplant_controversies.asp The Looming Controversy Surrounding Facial Transplant], Medindia.net, December 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also looking into other possibilities for a face transplant in other nations and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/05/26/face.transplant/ Face transplants inch toward reality], CNN.com May 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1505905/First-British-face-transplant-'within-a-year'.html First British face transplant 'within a year'] by Roger Highfield and Celia Hall, The Telegraph, December 20, 2005k.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calligraphy Demonstration During Japanese New Year’s Celebration.jpg|thumb|A Florida woman writing "New Year" ({{lang|ja|お正月}})]]
'''''Kakizome''''' ({{lang|ja|書き初め}}, literally "first writing") is a Japanese term for the first [[Shodo|calligraphy]] written at the beginning of a year, traditionally on January&amp;nbsp;2. Other terms include ''kissho'' ({{lang|ja|吉書}}), ''shihitsu'' ({{lang|ja|試筆}}) and ''hatsusuzuri'' ({{lang|ja|初硯}}).

Traditionally, ''kakizome'' was performed using ink rubbed with the first water drawn from the well on New Year's Day. Seated facing a favourable direction, people would write Chinese poetry containing auspicious words and phrases such as long life, spring, or perennial youth. These poems were then often burned.  

In modern times, people often write out auspicious [[kanji]] rather than poems. School pupils up to senior high school are assigned ''kakizome'' as their winter holiday homework.
Each year on January&amp;nbsp;5, several thousand calligraphers gather at the [[Nippon Budokan]] in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]-ku for a ''kakizome'' event that is widely covered by media.

The kakizome paper is usually burned on January&amp;nbsp;14 in the Sagicho festival. If the burning paper flies high, it is said that the person will be able to write a more fair hand.

The '''Latvian National Opera''' (LNO, Latvijas Nacionālā opera), [[Riga]], is the national opera of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bousfield ''Baltic States'' Rough Guides 2004 "The [[Latvian National Symphony Orchestra]] and the Latvian National Opera are the biggest shows in town, but be sure to look out for performances by [[Kremerata Baltica]], a chamber ensemble put together by the Riga-born violinist [[Gidon Kremer]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The opera company includes the '''Latvian National Ballet''' (LNB), LNO Chorus, and LNO Orchestra.

==History==
Riga already had a German-speaking theatre, which also offered opera and ballet, from 1782, and this was housed in the [[Riga City Theatre]] from 1863. 

The first attempt to create a Latvian national opera was 1893, when Jēkabs Ozols' ''Spoku stunda'' ("The Ghostly Hour") was performed.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin O'Connor ''Culture and customs of the Baltic states'' 2006 p181 "The first attempt to create a Latvian national opera was J. Ozols's (1863–1902) ''The Ghostly Hour'', performed in 1893, but cultural historians agree that the first real Latvian opera was ''Baņuta'' by the organist and composer [[Alfrēds Kalniņš]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian opera (Latviešu Opera) was founded in 1912 by Pāvuls Jurjāns, though almost immediately, during the [[First World War]], the opera troupe was evacuated to Russia. In 1918, the opera restarted (Latvju Opera) led by [[Jāzeps Vītols]], the founder of the [[Latvian Academy of Music]]. The debut performance, on January 23, 1919, was of Wagner’s ''[[Der fliegende Holländer]]''. From 1944, following the occupation of Latvia by Soviet Union, and incorporation into the Soviet Union, the Latvian National Opera became the '''Latvian S.S.R. State Opera and Ballet Theater.''' In 1990, the theater was renamed the Latvian National Opera, but almost immediately the building was closed till 1995 for renovation and the company moved to temporary premises. For the reopening in 1995, the first opera was [[Jānis Mediņš]]’ ''Uguns un nakts'' (Fire and Night).

==Building==
[[File:National Opera House Riga.jpg|thumb|National Opera House building in the early 20th century.]]
The National Opera House was constructed in 1863 by the St. Petersburg architect [[Ludwig Bohnstedt]] (interiors made by the firm of [[August Volz]]), for the then German-speaking City Theatre, and has been refurbished several times; 1882–1887 (following a fire in 1882), 1957–1958, 1991–1995 (following independence).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barlas, Winnie Wong Latvia- 2010 p98 "Since independence in 1991, the National Opera building has received a major facelift, restoring the original facilities to their former grandeur and adding new ones."&lt;/ref&gt; A modern annex was  added in 2001 with a 300-seat New Hall.

'''Legacy''' is an [[Australia]]n [[non-profit organisation|organisation]], established in 1923 by [[ex-service]]men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/community_events.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120074545/http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/community_events.html |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }} retrieved Feb 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has the aim of caring for the dependents of deceased Australian [[Armed forces|service men and women]]. The dependants of [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], [[Malayan emergency]] and [[Vietnam War]] deceased are cared for. In addition the peacekeeping operations in [[East Timor]], the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] have provided ongoing work for Legacy. Finally, any death which is deemed service-related is attended to by Legacy.

Volunteer members are called "Legatees" because they accept the 'legacy of care' for their comrades' families; this title has continued to the present day. Some 5,500 legatees assist more than 90,000 [[widows]] and 1,900 children (referred to by Legacy as "Junior Legatees") and disabled dependents across Australia providing assistance, accommodation, medical and social support. Legacy's assistance depends on the individual situation of the person supported. With the help of Legatees, who stay in touch with all families, Legacy ensures families receive their Legacy entitlements and access to government benefits.

As well as financial help, Legacy provides companionship and assistance with the education of children. Assistance in dealing with the [[Australian Army|Army]], [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]] or [[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Force]], or the government is provided. In particular, specialist assistance is provided in submitting applications for Compensation for Dependants of Deceased Members and Former Members, including for War [[Widow's pension]]s and Income Support pensions. If initial claims are unsuccessful, when appropriate, Legacy will arrange for advocates before review tribunals. These services are provided at no cost to claimants.

A road tunnel under construction in [[Brisbane]] is named [[Legacy Way]] in honour of the men and women serving in the [[Australian Defence Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Part of road tunnel toll going to Legacy| work = | publisher =[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] News | date =Nov 10, 2010  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/10/3062517.htm| accessdate = 13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising==

Funds are raised by a variety of methods, the most notable being the sale of special badges and other goods during "Legacy Week".  This is usually during the first week of September when mainly school children volunteer their time to accomplish these sales, especially in Australia's central business districts. Legacy also solicits donations from the public to assist with its mission.

In the past money has also been raised from special events, sponsorships, dinners, bequests and other events.

==Australian postage stamps==

In 1973, the Australian Post Office issued a 7 cent [[commemorative stamp]] to commemorate 50 years of Legacy in Australia.

Also in 1948 the then current 2½d Red [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Mitchell]] [[commemorative stamp]] was [[Private overprint|privately overprinted]] with the words "Supporting Legacy for 25 years" and a value ranging from 1/- to £1 was also added which was the fundraising amount in addition to the legal cost of stamp of which the denomination was 2½d. Ten values were issued and were intended to raise funds for Legacy. It is believed these stamps were authorised by the secretary of Fremantle Legacy Club in Western Australia.

A '''lemming''' is a small [[rodent]] usually found in or near the [[Arctic]] in [[tundra]] [[biome]]s. They make up the [[Family (biology)|subfamily]] [[Arvicolinae]] (also known as Microtinae) together with [[vole]]s and [[muskrat]]s, which forms part of the superfamily [[Muroidea]], which also includes [[rat]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[hamster]]s, and [[gerbil]]s.

== Description and habitat ==
Lemmings measure around 13 – 18 centimeters (5 – 7 inches) in length and weigh around 23 – 34 grams (0.05 – 0.07 pounds). Lemmings are quite rounded in shape with brown and black long, soft fur. Lemmings have a very short tail, a stubby, hairy snout, short legs and small ears. They have a flattened claw on their first digit of their front feet which helps them to dig in the snow. They are [[herbivorous]], feeding mostly on moss and grass.They also forage through the snow surface to find berries, leaves, shoots, roots, bulbs and lichen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315766511_Not_only_mosses_lemming_winter_diets_as_described_by_DNA_metabarcoding|title=Not only mosses: lemming winter diets as described by DNA metabarcoding|first1=Eeva|last1=Soininen|first2=Lucie|last2=Zinger|first3=Ludovic|last3=Gielly|first4=Nigel|last4=Yoccoz|first5=John-André|last5=Henden|first6=Rolf|last6=Ims|date=4 April 2017|publisher=|journal=Polar Biology|pages=1–7|via=ResearchGate|doi=10.1007/s00300-017-2114-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

Like other rodents, their [[incisor]]s grow continuously, allowing them to exist on much tougher forage.

Lemmings do not [[Hibernation|hibernate]] through the harsh northern winter. They remain active, finding food by burrowing through the snow. These rodents live in large tunnel systems beneath the snow in winter which protects them from predators. Their underground burrows have rest areas, bathrooms and nesting rooms. Lemmings make nests out of grasses, feathers and musk ox wool. In the spring, they move to higher ground where they live on mountain heaths or in forests, continuously breeding before returning in Autumn to the Alpine zone.

== Behavior ==
Like many other rodents, lemmings have periodic population booms and then disperse in all directions, seeking the food and shelter their natural habitats cannot provide. The [[Norway lemming]] and [[Siberian Brown Lemming|brown lemming]] are two of the few vertebrates which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Turchin|title=Complex Population Dynamics: A Theoretical/Empirical Synthesis|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=391|isbn=978-0-691-09021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Turchin &amp; Ellner, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; rather than following linear growth to a [[carrying capacity]] or regular oscillations. It is not known why lemming populations fluctuate with such great variance roughly every four years, before numbers drop to near extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=91 Hinterland Who's Who – Lemmings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107145338/http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=91 |date=2011-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lemming behavior and appearance are markedly different from those of other rodents, which are inconspicuously colored and try to conceal themselves from their predators. Lemmings, by contrast, are conspicuously colored and behave aggressively towards predators and even human observers. The lemming defense system is thought to be based on [[aposematism]] (warning display).&lt;ref&gt;Malte Anderson, “Lemmus lemmus: A possible case of aposematic coloration and behavior” Journal of Mammalogy, 57, no 3, Aug, 1976:461 – 469&lt;/ref&gt; Fluctuations in the lemming population affect the behaviour of predators, and may fuel [[Irruptive_growth|irruptions]] of birds of prey such as [[snowy owl]]s to areas further south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/24/snowy-owl-lemming-population-us-canada |first=Darryl |last=Fears |title=Lemmings fuel biggest snowy-owl migration in 50 years |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the population of lemmings was believed to change with the [[population cycle]], but now some evidence suggests their predators' populations, particularly those of the [[stoat]], may be more closely involved in changing the lemming population.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Misconceptions ==

Misconceptions about lemmings go back many centuries. In the 1530s, geographer Zeigler of Strasbourg proposed the theory that the creatures fell out of the sky during stormy weather&lt;ref&gt;This notion is also featured in the [[folklore]] of the [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] and [[Yupik peoples]] at [[Norton Sound]].&lt;/ref&gt; and then died suddenly when the grass grew in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1081903.htm|title=Lemmings Suicide Myth|website=ABC Science|publisher=Karl S. Kruszelnicki Pty Ltd|date=27 April 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714004911/http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1081903.htm|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description was contradicted by natural historian [[Ole Worm]], who accepted that lemmings could fall out of the sky, but claimed that they had been brought over by the wind rather than created by [[spontaneous generation]]. Worm first published dissections of a lemming, which showed that they are anatomically similar to most other rodents such as voles and hamsters, and the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] proved that they had a natural origin.

Lemmings have become the subject of a widely popular misconception that they are driven to commit [[mass suicide]] when they migrate by jumping off cliffs.  It is not a deliberate mass [[animal suicide|suicide]] where the animal voluntarily chooses to die, but rather an unfortunate result of their migratory behavior. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. They can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many drown if the chosen body of water happens to be the Atlantic Ocean, or is in any case so wide as to exceed their physical capabilities. This, the unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings, and perhaps a small amount of semantic confusion (suicide not being limited to voluntary deliberation, but also the result of foolishness), gave rise to the myth.

This urban myth was popularized after this behavior was staged in the Walt Disney documentary ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' in 1958. However, the animals in the film are not wild animals jumping off the cliff voluntarily, rather they were bought by the producers and pushed over the edge of the cliff. The misconception itself is much older, dating back to at least the late 19th century, where in the 1887 issue of Popular Science Monthly, lemmings are presumed to be swimming the Atlantic Ocean in search of 'the submerged continent of Lemuria'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=W.|journal=The Monthly chronicle of North-country lore and legend|date=November 1891|title=The Monthly chronicle of North-country lore and legend: v.1–5; Mar. 1887–Dec. 1891|volume=5|page=523|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8rUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alaska.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6|title=Lemming Suicide Myth, Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior|first1=Riley|last1=Woodford|work=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|publisher=|year=2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925063003/https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6|archivedate=2011-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nicholls | first=Henry | date=21 November 2014 | title=BBC – Earth – The truth about Norwegian lemmings | url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141122-the-truth-about-lemmings | website=BBC.com | publisher=BBC | access-date=18 October 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703211429/http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141122-the-truth-about-lemmings/ | archivedate=3 July 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture and media==
The misconception of lemming "mass suicide" is long-standing and has been popularized by a number of factors. It was well enough known to be mentioned in "[[The Marching Morons]]", a 1951 short story by [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]].  In 1955, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Studio]] illustrator [[Carl Barks]] drew an [[Uncle Scrooge]] adventure comic with the title "The Lemming with the Locket". This comic, which was inspired by a 1953 ''[[The American Mercury|American Mercury]]'' article, showed massive numbers of lemmings jumping over Norwegian cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, Muriel. "Return of the Pied Piper". ''[[The American Mercury]]'', [http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1953dec-00033 Dec. 1953, pp. 33–34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103023127/http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1953dec-00033 |date=2014-01-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Geoffrey. 1996. "One Billion of Something", in: ''Uncle Scrooge Adventures by Carl Barks'', #9.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more influential was the 1958 Disney film ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'', which won an [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], in which staged footage was shown with lemmings jumping into certain death after faked scenes of mass migration.&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lemmings.asp|title='White Wilderness' Faked Lemming Suicides|author=|date=12 December 2015|work=Snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] documentary, ''Cruel Camera'', found the lemmings used for ''White Wilderness'' were flown from [[Hudson Bay]] to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada, where they did not jump off the cliff, but were in fact forced off the cliff by the camera crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/video.html Cruel Camera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117035233/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/video.html |date=2009-01-17 }} Time slice: 14:01–15:27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MentalFloss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50957/do-lemmings-really-run-cliffs-their-death|title=Do Lemmings Really Run Off Cliffs to Their Death?|work=Mental Floss|last1=Moss|first1=Tyler|date=10 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407150701/http://mentalfloss.com/article/50957/do-lemmings-really-run-cliffs-their-death|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the limited number of lemmings at their disposal, which in any case were the wrong sub-species, the migration scenes were simulated using tight camera angles and a large, snow-covered turntable.&lt;ref name="alaska.gov"/&gt; Lemmings also appear in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1953 short story ''[[The Possessed (short story)|The Possessed]]'', where their suicidal urges are attributed to the lingering consciousness of an alien group mind which had inhabited the species in the prehistoric past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke|last=Clarke|first=Arthur|date=2001|publisher=Tor Books|pages=423–427|accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of lemmings' mass-suicidal tendencies is transferred to human behavior in [[Richard Matheson]]'s horrific 1953 short-short story, ''Lemmings''.

This same myth was also used in the [[Apple Computer]] 1985 Super Bowl commercial "[[Lemmings (advertisement)|Lemmings]]" and the popular 1991 [[video game]] ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'', in which the player must stop the lemmings from mindlessly marching over cliffs or into traps. 

Because of their association with this odd behavior, lemming "suicide" is a frequently used [[metaphor]] in reference to people who go along unquestioningly with popular opinion, with potentially dangerous or fatal consequences. This metaphor is seen many times in popular culture, such as in the video game ''Lemmings'', in episodes of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', and in [[Adult Swim]]'s show ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. In the eighth episode of season 1 of Showtime's ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'', the Pope's second son Juan refers to the college of cardinals as lemmings when they flee the Vatican in anticipation of an impending French invasion. The [[Blink 182]] song "Lemmings" also uses this metaphor, as does the unrelated song of the same name by English progressive rock band [[Van der Graaf Generator]] (from their 1971 album ''[[Pawn Hearts]]''), and the 1973 stage show ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]'' starring [[John Belushi]] and mocking post-[[Woodstock]] [[groupthink]]. In the song "[[Synchronicity II]]" (from their 1983 album ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]''), [[The Police]] compare people in rush hour traffic to lemmings ("packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes / contestants in a suicidal race").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Lhabab Düchen''' is one of the four [[Buddhist festival]]s commemorating four events in the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], according to [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan traditions]]. Lhabab Düchen occurs on the 22nd day of the ninth lunar month according to [[Tibetan calendar]] and widely celebrated in [[Tibet]] and [[Bhutan]]. The festival is also celebrated in other Buddhist Asian countries including [[Sri Lanka]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] where it is celebrated a few weeks before the Tibetan and Bhutanese version.

Lhabab Duchen is a [[Buddhist]] festival celebrated to observe the Buddha's descent from the [[Trāyastriṃśa|Trāyastriṃśa heaven]] down to earth.

According to legend, the Buddha ascended the Trāyastriṃśa heaven temporarily at the age of 41, in order to give teachings to benefit the gods in that desire realm, and to repay the kindness of his mother by liberating her from [[Samsara]].

He was exhorted by his disciple and representative [[Maudgalyayana]] to return, and after a long debate and under a Full Moon agreed to return. He returned to earth a week later by a special triple ladder prepared by [[Viswakarma]], the god of machines. This event is considered to be one of the eight great deeds of the Buddha.

On Lhabab Duchen, the effects of positive or negative actions are multiplied ten million times. It is part of Tibetan Buddhist tradition to engage in virtuous activities and prayer on this day.

==Notes==
During this day, positive or negative actions are multiplied 10 million times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37531">In economics, '''market failure''' is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, often leading to a net [[social welfare]] loss. Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view.&lt;ref&gt;John O. Ledyard (2008). "market failure,"  ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed.

"Markets, Market Failures, and Development," ''American Economic Review'', 79(2), pp. [http://www.dial.prd.fr/articles/chap6/Stiglitz,%201989.pdf 197–203.]&lt;/ref&gt; thus  existence of a market failure is often the reason that self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions intervene in a particular [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth J.

However, government policy interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, [[bailout]]s, wage and price controls, and [[regulation]]s, may also lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called [[government failure]].&lt;ref name="weimervining"&gt;{{cite book

Given the tension between, on the one hand, the undeniable costs to society caused by market failure, and on the other hand, the potential that attempts to mitigate these costs could lead to costs from "government failure", there is sometimes a choice between imperfect outcomes, i.e. imperfect market outcomes with or without government interventions. But either way, if a market failure exists the outcome is not [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]]. Most mainstream economists believe that there are  circumstances (like building codes or endangered species) in which it is possible for government or other organizations to improve the inefficient market outcome.  Several [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] schools of thought disagree with this as a matter of principle.&lt;ref name=" n. gregory mankiw"&gt;{{cite book

An ''ecological'' market failure exists when human activity in a market economy is exhausting critical non-renewable resources, disrupting fragile ecosystems services, or overloading biospheric waste absorption capacities. In none of these cases does the criterion of Pareto efficiency obtain.&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;

==Categories==
Different economists have different views about what events are the sources of market failure. Mainstream economic analysis widely accepts that a market failure (relative to [[Pareto efficiency]]) can occur for three main reasons: if the market is "[[monopolised]]" or a small group of businesses hold significant [[market power]], if production of the good or service results in an [[externality]], or if the good or service is a "[[public good]]".&lt;ref name="krugman1"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Krugman  | first = Paul  | authorlink = Paul Krugman  |author2=Robin Wells |author3=Anthony Myatt   | title = Microeconomics: Canadian Edition | publisher = Worth Publishers  | year = 2006  | pages = 160–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The nature of the market===
{{main article|Market structure|market power|}}
[[Agent (economics)|Agent]]s in a market can gain [[market power]], allowing them to block other mutually beneficial [[gains from trade]] from occurring.  This can lead to inefficiency due to [[imperfect competition]], which can take many different forms, such as [[Monopoly|monopolies]],&lt;ref name="demartino01"&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Economy, Global Justice |last= DeMartino |first= George |authorlink= |year= 2000 |publisher= Routledge |location= |isbn= 0-415-22401-2 |page= 70 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bh66WFcdT9sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA70,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[monopsonies]], or [[monopolistic competition]], if the agent does not implement perfect price discrimination. 

It is then a further question about what circumstances allow a monopoly to arise. In some cases, monopolies can maintain themselves where there are "[[barriers to entry]]" that prevent other companies from effectively entering and competing in an industry or market. Or there could exist significant [[first-mover advantage]]s in the market that make it difficult for other firms to compete. Moreover, monopoly can be a result of geographical conditions created by huge distances or isolated locations. This leads to a situation where there are only few communities scattered across a vast territory with only one supplier. Australia is an example that meets this description.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46462759|title=The political economy of local government|last=Brian.|first=Dollery,|date=2001|publisher=Edward Elgar Pub|others=Wallis, Joe (Joe L.)|isbn=1840644516|location=Northampton, MA|oclc=46462759}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[natural monopoly]] is a firm whose per-unit cost decreases as it increases output; in this situation it is most efficient (from a cost perspective) to have only a single producer of a good. Natural monopolies display so-called increasing returns to scale. It means that at all possible outputs [[marginal cost]] needs to be below average cost if average cost is declining. One of the reasons is the existence of fixed costs, which must be paid without considering the amount of output, what results in a state where costs are evenly divided over more units leading to the reduction of cost per unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Natural_monopolies.html|title=Natural monopolies exist when one firm dominates an industry|website=www.economicsonline.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The nature of the goods===

====Non-excludability====
Some markets can fail due to the nature of the goods being exchanged. For instance, goods can display the attributes of [[public goods]]&lt;ref name="demartino01" /&gt; or [[common good]]s, wherein sellers are unable to [[Excludability|exclude]] non-buyers from using a product, as in the development of inventions that may spread freely once revealed.  This can cause underinvestment because developers cannot capture enough of the benefits from success to make the development effort worthwhile. This can also lead to resource depletion in the case of [[common-pool resource]]s, where, because use of the resource is [[Competition|rival]] but [[Excludability|non-excludable]], there is no incentive for users to conserve the resource. An example of this is a lake with a natural supply of fish: if people catch the fish faster than they can reproduce, then the fish population will dwindle until there are no fish left for future generations.

====Externalities====
A good or service could also have significant [[Externality|externalities]],&lt;ref name ="Laffont"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demartino01" /&gt; where gains or losses associated with the product, production or consumption of a product, differ from the private [[cost]]. These externalities can be innate to the methods of production or other conditions important to the market.&lt;ref name="krugman"/&gt; 

[[Traffic congestion]] is an example of market failure that incorporates both non-excludability and externality. Public roads are common resources that are available for the entire population's use (non-excludable), and act as a [[Complementary good|complement]] to cars (the more roads there are, the more useful cars become). Because there is very low cost but high benefit to individual drivers in using the roads, the roads become congested, decreasing their usefulness to society. Furthermore, driving can impose [[hidden costs]] on society through pollution (externality). Solutions for this include [[public transport]]ation, [[congestion pricing]], tolls, and other ways of making the driver include the social cost in the decision to drive.&lt;ref name="krugman"/&gt;

Perhaps the best example of the inefficiency associated with common/public goods and externalities is the environmental harm caused by [[pollution]] and [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name="krugman" /&gt;

===The nature of the exchange===
Some markets can fail due to the nature of their exchange. Markets may have significant [[transaction cost]]s, [[Principal-agent problem|agency problems]], or [[Information asymmetry|informational asymmetry]].&lt;ref name="krugman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demartino01" /&gt; Such [[incomplete markets]] may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies. From [[contract theory]], decisions in transactions where one party has more or better [[information]] than the other is an asymmetry. This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry. Examples of this problem are [[adverse selection]] and [[moral hazard]]. Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of [[principal–agent problem]]s. [[George Akerlof]], [[Michael Spence]], and [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] developed the idea and shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huffman|first=Max|title=Neo-Behavioralism?|journal=|date=December 2010|page=9|ssrn=1730365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bounded rationality====
{{main article|Bounded rationality}}
In ''Models of Man'', [[Herbert A. Simon]] points out that most people are only partly rational, and are emotional/[[irrational]] in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states "boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) [[information]]" ([[Oliver E. Williamson|Williamson]], p.&amp;nbsp;553, citing Simon). Simon describes a number of dimensions along which "classical" models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while sticking within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:

* limiting what sorts of [[utility]] functions there might be.
* recognizing the costs of gathering and processing information.
* the possibility of having a "[[vector (geometry)|vector]]" or "multi-valued" utility function.

Simon suggests that economic agents employ the use of [[heuristics]] to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation, and their inability to process and compute the expected utility of every alternative action. Deliberation costs might be high and there are often other, concurrent economic activities also requiring decisions.

====Coase theorem====
The [[Coase theorem]], developed by [[Ronald Coase]] and labeled as such by George Stigler, states that private transactions are efficient as long as property rights exist, only a small number of parties are involved, and transactions costs are low. Additionally, this efficiency will take place regardless of who owns the property rights. This theory comes from a section of Coase's Nobel prize-winning work ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]''. While the assumptions of low transactions costs and a small number of parties involved may not always be applicable in real-world markets, Coase's work changed the long-held belief that the owner of [[property rights]] was a major determining factor in whether or not a market would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parkin (2008). "Microeconomics," 9th Ed. p. 379. University of Western Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coase theorem points out when one would expect the market to function properly even when there are externalities.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A market is an institution in which individuals or firms exchange not just commodities, but the ''rights'' to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. [...] Markets are institutions which organize the ''exchange of control'' of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities.&lt;ref name="rees"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result, agents' control over the uses of their [[Commodity|commodities]] can be imperfect, because the system of rights which defines that control is incomplete.  Typically, this falls into two generalized rights – ''excludability'' and ''transferability''.  Excludability deals with the ability of agents to control who uses their commodity, and for how long – and the related costs associated with doing so.  Transferability reflects the right of agents to transfer the rights of use from one agent to another, for instance by selling or [[leasing]] a commodity, and the costs associated with doing so.  If a given system of rights does not fully guarantee these at minimal (or no) cost, then the resulting distribution can be inefficient.&lt;ref name="rees"/&gt; Considerations such as these form an important part of the work of [[institutional economics]].&lt;ref name="bowles"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bowles  | first = Samuel | title = Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution | publisher = Russel Sage Foundation
  | year = 2004  | location = United States| id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, views still differ on whether something displaying these attributes is meaningful without the information provided by the market price system.&lt;ref&gt;Machan, R. Tibor, [http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817929428_xi.pdf ''Some Skeptical Reflections on Research and Development''], Hoover Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business cycles ===
Macroeconomic business cycles are a part of the market. They are characterized by constant downswings and upswings which influence economic activity. Therefore, this situation requires some kind of government intervention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Interpretations and policy examples==
The above causes represent the [[mainstream economics|mainstream]] view of what market failures mean and of their importance in the economy.  This analysis follows the lead of the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] school, and relies on the notion of [[Pareto efficiency]]&lt;ref name="mises"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = MacKenzie  | first = D.W.  | title = The Market Failure Myth

  | date = 2002-08-26  | url = https://mises.org/library/market-failure-myth
  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which can be in the "[[public interest]]", as well as in interests of stakeholders with [[Equity (economics)|equity]].&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt; This form of analysis has also been adopted by the [[Keynesian]] or [[new Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] schools in modern [[macroeconomics]], applying it to [[Walras]]ian models of [[general equilibrium]] in order to deal with failures to attain [[full employment]], or the non-adjustment of prices and wages.

Policies to prevent market failure are already commonly implemented in the economy. For example, to prevent information asymmetry, members of the New York Stock Exchange agree to abide by its rules in order to promote a fair and orderly market in the trading of listed securities.  The members of the [[NYSE]] presumably believe that each member is individually better off if every member adheres to its rules – even if they have to forego money-making opportunities that would violate those rules.

A simple example of policies to address market power is government antitrust policies. As an additional example of externalities, municipal governments enforce building codes and license tradesmen to mitigate the incentive to  use cheaper (but more dangerous) construction practices, ensuring that the total cost of new construction includes the (otherwise external)  cost of preventing future tragedies.  The voters who elect municipal officials presumably feel that they are individually better off if everyone complies with the local codes, even if those codes may increase the cost of construction in their communities.

[[CITES]] is an international treaty to protect the world's common interest in preserving endangered species – a classic "public good" – against the private interests of poachers, developers and other market participants who might otherwise reap monetary benefits without bearing the known and unknown costs that extinction could create.  Even without knowing the true cost of extinction, the signatory countries believe that the societal costs far outweigh the possible private gains that they have agreed to forego.

Some remedies for market failure can resemble other market failures.  For example, the issue of systematic underinvestment in research is addressed by the [[patent]] system that creates artificial monopolies for successful inventions.

==Objections==
{{See also|Government failure|||}}

===Public choice===
Economists such as [[Milton Friedman]] from the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago school]] and others from the [[Public choice theory|Public Choice]] school, argue{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} that market failure does not necessarily imply that the government should attempt to solve market failures, because the costs of [[government failure]] might be worse than those of the market failure it attempts to fix. This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups ([[rent-seeking|rent seekers]]) both in the [[private sector]] and in the government [[bureaucracy]].  Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by [[coercion|coercive]] government intervention.  Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.

===Austrian===
Some advocates of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], including many economists of the [[Austrian School]], argue that there is no such phenomenon as "market failure". [[Israel Kirzner]] states that, "Efficiency for a social system means the efficiency with which it permits its individual members to achieve their individual goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Israel Kirzner]]|title=Market Theory and the Price System|year=1963|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company|location=Princeton. N.J.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inefficiency only arises when means are chosen by individuals that are inconsistent with their desired goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roy E. Cordato|title=The Austrian Theory of Efficiency and the Role of Government|year=1980|journal=[[The Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/4_4/4_4_6.pdf|volume=4|issue=4|pages=393–403 [396]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of efficiency differs from that of [[Pareto efficiency]], and forms the basis of the theoretical argument against the existence of market failures. However, providing that the conditions of the [[first welfare theorem]] are met, these two definitions agree, and give identical results. Austrians argue that the market tends to eliminate its inefficiencies through the process of [[entrepreneurship]] driven by the [[profit motive]]; something the government has great difficulty detecting, or correcting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roy E. Cordato|title=The Austrian Theory of Efficiency and the Role of Government|year=1980|journal=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/4_4/4_4_6.pdf|volume=4|issue=4|pages=393–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxian===
Objections also exist on more fundamental bases, such as that of [[Justice|equity]], or [[Marxian economics|Marxian analysis]].  Colloquial uses of the term "market failure" reflect the notion of a market "failing" to provide some desired attribute different from efficiency – for instance, high levels of inequality can be considered a "market failure", yet are not [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inefficient]], and so would not be considered a market failure by mainstream
economics.&lt;ref name="krugman"/&gt; In addition, many [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economists would argue that the system of individual property rights is a fundamental problem in itself, and that resources should be allocated in another way entirely. This is different from concepts of "market failure" which focuses on specific situations – typically seen as "abnormal" – where markets have inefficient outcomes. Marxists, in contrast, would say that markets have inefficient and democratically unwanted outcomes – viewing market failure as an inherent feature of any capitalist economy – and typically omit it from discussion, preferring to ration finite goods not exclusively through a price mechanism, but based upon need as determined by society expressed through the community.

=== Ecological ===
{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
{{See also|Ecological economics #Not 'externalities', but cost shifting| Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising neoclassical economics (weak versus strong sustainability)|Tragedy of the commons|Uneconomic growth}}

In [[ecological economics]], the concept of [[Externality|externalities]] is considered a misnomer, since market agents are viewed as making their incomes and profits by [[Ecological economics #Not 'externalities', but cost shifting| systematically 'shifting' the social and ecological costs]] of their activities onto other agents, including future generations. Hence, externalities is a ''modus operandi'' of the market, not a failure: The market cannot exist without constantly 'failing'.

The fair and even allocation of non-renewable resources over time is a market failure issue of concern to ecological economics. This issue is also known as 'intergenerational fairness'. It is argued that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|market mechanism]] fails when it comes to allocating the Earth's finite mineral stock fairly and evenly among present and future generations, as future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;{{rp|375}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142f}} In effect, today's market prices do not, and cannot, reflect the preferences of the yet unborn.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|156-160}} This is an instance of a market failure passed unrecognized by most mainstream economists, as the concept of [[Pareto efficiency]] is entirely static (timeless).&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|181f}} Imposing government restrictions on the general level of activity in the economy may be the only way of bringing about a more fair and even intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock. Hence, [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], the two leading theorists in the field, have both called for the imposition of such restrictions: Georgescu-Roegen has proposed a minimal bioeconomic program, and Daly has proposed a [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|comprehensive steady-state economy]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;{{rp|374–79}} &lt;ref name=hd02/&gt; However, Georgescu-Roegen, Daly, and other economists in the field agree that on a finite Earth, [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |geologic limits will inevitably strain most fairness in the longer run]], regardless of any present government restrictions: ''Any'' rate of extraction and use of the finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources will diminish the remaining stock left over for future generations to use.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;{{rp|366–69}} &lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369–71}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165–67}} &lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|270}} &lt;ref name=av01/&gt;{{rp|37}}

Another ecological market failure is presented by the overutilisation of an otherwise renewable resource at a point in time, or within a short period of time. Such overutilisation usually occurs when the resource in question has poorly defined (or non-existing) [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] attached to it while too many market agents engage in activity simultaneously for the resource to be able to sustain it all. Examples range from over-fishing of fisheries and over-grazing of pastures to over-crowding of recreational areas in congested cities. This type of ecological market failure is generally known as the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. In this type of market failure, the principle of Pareto efficiency is violated the utmost, as ''all'' agents in the market are left worse off, while nobody are benefitting. It has been argued that the best way to remedy a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure is to establish enforceable property rights politically – only, this may be easier said than done.&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|172f}}

The issue of [[Attribution of recent climate change|anthropogenic global warming]] presents an overwhelming example of a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure: The Earth's [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] may be regarded as a 'global common' exhibiting poorly defined (non-existing) property rights, and the waste absorption capacity of the atmosphere with regard to carbon dioxide is presently being heavily overloaded by a too large volume of emissions from the [[world economy]].&lt;ref name=cm01/&gt;{{rp|347f}} Historically, the [[fossil fuel]] dependence of the [[Industrial Revolution]] has unintentionally thrown mankind out of ecological equilibrium with the rest of the Earth's biosphere (including the atmosphere), and the market has failed to correct the situation ever since. Quite the opposite: The unrestricted market has been exacerbating this global state of ecological ''dis''-equilibrium, and is expected to continue doing so well into the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|95–101}} This particular market failure may be remedied to some extent at the political level by the establishment of an international (or regional) [[Emissions trading|cap and trade property rights system]], where carbon dioxide emission permits are bought and sold among market agents.&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|433–35}}

The term '[[uneconomic growth]]' describes a pervasive ecological market failure: The ecological costs of further economic growth in a so-called 'full-world economy' like the present world economy may exceed the immediate social benefits derived from this growth.&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|16–21}}

=== Chang's criticism ===
Chang states that "it is (implicitly) assumed the state knows everything and can do everything.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, this implies several assumptions about government in relation to market failures. There are three main statements. First of all, government representatives are able to evaluate the scope of market failures and to what extent it differs from efficient outcome. Secondly, having acquired the aforementioned knowledge they have capacity to re-establish market efficiency. Lastly, there has arisen an idea according to which decisions of policy-makers are not influenced by self-interest, but they are driven by altruism.

=== Lipsey and Lancaster criticism ===
They came up with the theory of  the so-called the “second best.” They refuse Chang's theory and state that is it not possible to restore [[Pareto-optimality|Pareto optimality]] even if policy makers possess the sufficient knowledge, intervene efficiently and altruism serves as stimulus for their decisions. On the other hand, the “second best” theory holds that when market failure occurs in one branch of the economy, it should be feasible to increase social welfare in another branch of the economy by violating [[Pareto efficiency]] instead of restoring Pareto efficiency by government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipsey|first=Richard|date=2007|title=Reflections on the General Theory of Second Best at its Golden Jubilee|url=|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|volume=14|pages=349-364|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zerbe and McCurdy ===
Zerbe and McCurdy connected criticism of market failure paradigm to transaction costs. Market failure paradigm is defined as follows:

"A fundamental problem with the concept of market failure, as economists occasionally recognize, is that it describes a situation that exists everywhere.”

Transaction costs are part of each market exchange, although the price of transaction costs is not usually determined. They occur everywhere and are unpriced. Consequently, market failures and externalities can arise in the economy every time transaction costs arise. There is no place for government intervention. Instead, government should focus on the elimination of both transaction costs and costs of provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCurdy|first=Howard E.|last2=Zerbe Jr.|first2=Richard O.|date=1999|title=The Failure of Market Failure|url=|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=18|pages=558-578|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Missing Women Commission of Inquiry''' was a commission in [[British Columbia]] ordered by the [[Lieutenant Governor in Council]] on September 27, 2010, to evaluate the response of law enforcement to reports of missing and murdered women.

==History== 
On December 9, 2007, [[Robert Pickton]], a pig farmer from [[Port Coquitlam]], was convicted of second-degree murder in the deaths of six women. He was also charged in the deaths of an additional twenty women, many of them from [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]]. These charges were, however, stayed by the Crown in 2010. In December 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years. It was the longest sentence then available under Canadian law for murder.

Following Pickton's arrest, there was increased attention was given to a prior attempted murder charge of a sex worker in March 1997. Pickton was alleged to have stabbed her several times during an altercation at the farm. The victim informed police that Pickton had handcuffed her, but that she escaped after suffering several lacerations, disarming him, and stabbing him with his weapon. The charge was dismissed in January 1998. The mandate of the commission included evaluating why the 1997 charges against Pickton were stayed.

The Missing Women Commission of Inquiry had four mandates:

* Evaluate the response of the police to reports of missing women from [[Downtown Eastside]] of [[Vancouver]],
* Evaluate the reasons for staying charges against [[Robert Pickton]] in January 1998,
* Recommend changes regarding how missing women and suspected homicides are handled
* Recommend changes to how cases are handled when they involve more than one investigating organization

In 2012, the Commission issued a final report which included a number of recommendations. The commission closed its office on August 1 of the following year.

==Criticism==
Human rights organizations the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association|B.C. Civil Liberties Association]], [[Pivot Legal Society]] and [http://www.westcoastleaf.org/ West Coast LEAF] have condemned the inquiry for its failure to include the voices of marginalized women. 15 groups representing the interests of marginalized people were initially granted standing at the inquiry but pulled out of the process in protest after being denied funding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vancouversun.com/life/Missing+Women+Inquiry+condemned+failure+human+rights+groups/7571576/story.html Missing Women Inquiry condemned as a failure by B.C. human rights groups] Retrieved 19 Nov 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Modesto International Architecture Festival''' was established to promote and celebrate the architecture profession.

== History ==
In 2008 American Institute of Architects Sierra Valley Chapter (AIASV) founded the “AIA Sierra Valley Film Festival” in collaboration with the Modesto Art Museum, the State Theatre, and the Modesto Film Society.  Bob Barzan, Executive Director of the Modesto Art Museum, had the original idea to put on a one-night architecture film festival in Modesto.  He approached the Modesto Film Society, State Theatre and AIA Sierra Valley to see if they were interested in partnering with the museum on the event.  The four non-profit organizations got together and planned the first event.  The festival was such a success that they decided to make it an ongoing event featuring 4 architectural film nights throughout the year. Since 2008 the Festival has grown each year to incorporate new events, taking it beyond film and incorporating lectures, exhibits, tours and special events.  

In 2010 the festival received its new name "The Modesto International Architecture Festival."The festival introduces the public to the world of architecture past, present, and future.

== Facts ==

The host city, [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], has a population of approximately 211,156 as of April 2009, Modesto ranks as the [[List of cities in California (by population)|17th largest city in the state of California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacities.org/index.jsp?displaytype=&amp;section=allabout&amp;zone=locc League of California Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; Modesto is located in Northern California, 92&amp;nbsp;miles east of [[San Francisco]], 68&amp;nbsp;miles south of the state capital of [[Sacramento]], 90 miles north of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], and 66&amp;nbsp;miles west of [[Yosemite National Park]]. 

For decades through the 20th century, Modesto was on the cutting edge of architecture in California and the United States. Modesto's landscape, commercial, residential, and government architecture was held up as a model for others and major architects designed buildings and landscapes in the city. Among them are John Funk, [[William Wurster]], [[Julia Morgan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Gardner Dailey, Milton Pflueger, [[Thomas Church (landscape architect)|Thomas Church]], [[Lawrence Halprin]], Russell Guerne Lappe, and [[John McLaren (park superintendent)|John McLaren]].

The festival is open to submissions by independent film makers from around the world.

The festival is hosted by two nonprofit organizations, the American Institute of Architects and the Modesto Art Museum.

The '''Neujahrsmarathon Zürich''' (New Year's Marathon Zurich) is a marathon race held on January 1 each year, since 2005. The start takes place at midnight, exactly at the beginning of the [[New Year]]. Start and finish are located in [[Schlieren, Zurich|Schlieren]] near [[Zurich]] in Switzerland. The track consists of four laps along the river [[Limmat]]. Besides the marathon, there are also a [[half marathon]] (two laps), a quarter marathon (one lap) as well as a marathon relay. The start of the marathon and the finish area of all races are located inside a sports hall. The participants run through the sports hall after each lap. The race is subject to a time limit of 5 hours, being extended in case of bad conditions (snow, ice).

Since 2014 there is also a kids marathon on a 750 meters track, which starts at 10 p.m. on 31 December. This race is free of charge for all participants.

{{TOCLimit|2}}

==International Membership==
All courses of the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich are officially measured according to the rules of [[IAAF]] (International Association of Athletics Federations). As one of only seven Swiss road races it is part of the AIMS ([[Association of International Marathons and Distance Races]]), which implies that the times run are accepted officially by IAAF. The other Swiss AIMS events are the Zürich Marathon, the Zermatt-Marathon, the Swiss Alpine Marathon, the Jungfrau-Marathon, the Swiss City Marathon and the Lausanne Marathon. Thanks to its starting time at the very first second of the year, the Neujahrsmarathon Zurich is the first AIMS running event of the year, and hence the performances of the winners automatically qualify as first official world record times of the year. This possibility to run an official record time of the year for the home country attracts runners from about 50 different countries from all continents.

==Organizer==
The Neujahrsmarathon Zürich is organized by the ''Verein Neujahrsmarathon Zürich'', a non-profit association founded in 2004. In the association's standing rules the intended purpose is described as: ''The association  aims to foster and promote the sport of running. In particular, the association organizes each New Year's Eve the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich. The association does not pursue commercial purposes and does not seek profit.''

The latter is reflected directly in the entry fee of the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich. Despite its status as recognized by IAAF, the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich is one of the least expensive marathons in Switzerland.

'''Peter Popoff''' (born July 2, 1946) is a German-born [[televangelism|televangelist]]. He was exposed in 1986 for using an earpiece to receive radio messages from his wife, who gave him the names, addresses and ailments of audience members during Popoff-led religious services.  Popoff falsely claimed God revealed this information to him so that Popoff could cure them by faith healing.&lt;ref name="GQ article, Feb. 27, 2017"/&gt;

He went bankrupt the next year, but made a comeback in the late 1990s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Popoff bought TV time to promote "Miracle Spring Water" on late-night infomercials, and referred to himself as a prophet.&lt;ref name="Government of Western Australia"/&gt; ''[[Business Insider]]'' remarked: "No matter how many times his claims are debunked, he seems to bounce back with another version of the same old scam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maag |first=Christopher |date=September 22, 2011 |title=Scam Everlasting: After 25 Years, Debunked Faith Healer Still Preaching Debt Relief Scam |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/scam-everlasting-after-25-years-debunked-faith-healer-still-preaching-debt-relief-scam-2011-9?IR=T |work=Business Insider |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Popoff was born in occupied [[Berlin]] ([[West Berlin]]) on July 2, 1946, to George and Gerda Popoff. As a child, Popoff emigrated with his family to the United States, where he attended [[Chaffey College]] before transferring to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], from which he graduated in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterpopoff.org/ministry-history]. peterpopoff.org. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310070021/http://peterpopoff.org/ministry-history |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSM&gt;{{cite web |author=Wilcox, Bruce G.; Yang, Henry T.

Popoff's father preached at revival meetings throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 30, 1960 |title=Hear Dr. George Popoff |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/155678976/ |work=Wilmington Morning News |location=Wilmington, DE |subscription=yes |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |ref={{sfnRef|"Hear Dr. George Popoff"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1960, Popoff also began making appearances as a preacher.{{sfn|"Hear Dr. George Popoff"|page=4}}  Billed as "The Miracle Boy Evangelist" in print advertisements, the ads also claimed he was born in a West Berlin bomb shelter, and had been rescued from a Siberian prison camp.{{sfn|"Hear Dr. George Popoff"|page=4}}  The powers he claimed included the abilities to heal the sick and foretell the future.{{sfn|"Hear Dr. George Popoff"|page=4}}

Popoff married his wife Elizabeth in 1970 and the couple settled in [[Upland, California]]. He then began his television ministry that, by the early 1980s, was being broadcast nationally.&lt;ref name=FaithHealers/&gt; His miraculous "curing" of chronic and incurable medical conditions became a central attraction of his sermons. Popoff would tell attendees suffering from a variety of illnesses to "break free of the [[devil]]" by throwing their prescription pills onto the stage. Many would obey, tossing away bottles of [[digitalis (medicine)|digitalis]], [[nitroglycerin (drug)|nitroglycerine]], and other important maintenance medications.&lt;ref name=UniversityOfColorado/&gt; Popoff would also "command" supplicants in wheelchairs to "rise and break free". They would stand and walk without assistance, to the joyous cheers of the faithful. Critics later documented that the recipients of these dramatic "cures" were fully ambulatory people who had been seated in wheelchairs by Popoff's assistants prior to broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Seckel"&gt;{{cite book |last= Seckel |first= Al |title= Science and the Paranormal |year= 1987 |chapter= God's Frequency is 39.17 MHz: The Investigation of Peter Popoff |chapterurl= http://www.skeptictank.org/popoff2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Popoff began soliciting donations for a program to provide Bibles to citizens of the [[Soviet Union]] by attaching them to [[helium]]-filled balloons and floating them into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-20/entertainment/ca-10627_1_tv-charity/2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first1=David |last1=Johnston |first2=Jennifer |last2=Leonard |title=Tv Charities: Let The Giver Beware |date=1985-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When skeptics asked him to prove that the money he had collected had in fact been spent on Bibles and balloons, Popoff staged a burglary at his own headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ajala-Immanuel |first=Sarah |date=2011 |title=Fleece My Sheep?: The Unprecedented Tragedy of the Church in Bed with a Sinful World |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=sVWxi-y4E3MC&amp;pg=PA92 |location=Central Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England |publisher=AuthorHouse UK LTD |page=92 |isbn=978-1-4567-7669-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On subsequent broadcasts he tearfully begged for additional donations to help repair the damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080321/http://healthwatcher.net/Quackerywatch/Popoff/ "Peter Popoff - Scamming us again"].

==Investigation by James Randi==
At the height of his popularity in the 1980s, Popoff would accurately announce home addresses and specific illnesses of audience members during his "healing sermons", a feat that he implied was due to divine [[revelation]] and "God-given ability".&lt;ref name="WDAF"&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}{{cite news |last= Friedman |first= Jason |title= Reverend Rip-Off |publisher= [[WDAF-TV|WDAF]] Fox 4 News |date= 2006-05-08 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] charged that Popoff was using electronic transmissions to receive his information; Popoff denied it, insisting that the messages were divinely revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB29B46A4187CFC.html |last= |first= |title= TV EVANGELIST DENIES USE OF RADIO IN HEALING SERVICE |publisher= [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date= July 15, 1986 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious skepticism|Skeptic]] groups distributed pamphlets explaining how Popoff's feats could be accomplished without any sort of divine intervention. Popoff branded his critics "tools of the [[devil]]".&lt;ref name=FaithHealers/&gt;

Popoff's methods were definitively exposed in 1986 by the magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] and his associate Steve Shaw, an illusionist known professionally as [[Banachek]], with technical assistance from the crime scene analyst and electronics expert Alexander Jason.&lt;ref name=JREF/&gt; With computerized [[scanner (radio)|radio scanners]], Jason was able to demonstrate that Popoff's wife, Elizabeth, was using a wireless radio transmitter to broadcast information that she and her aides had culled from prayer request cards filled out by audience members. Popoff received the transmissions via an earpiece he was wearing and repeated the information to astonished audience members. Jason produced video segments interspersing the intercepted radio transmissions with Popoff's "miraculous" pronouncements.&lt;ref name="GQ article, Feb. 27, 2017"&gt;[https://www.gq.com/story/peter-popoff-born-again-scoundrel Peter Popoff, the Born-Again Scoundrel], ''GQ'', Mark Oppenheimer, February 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FaithHealers&gt;{{cite book |last= Randi |first= James |year= 1989 |title= The Faith Healers |publisher= Prometheus Books |isbn= 978-0-87975-535-5 |pages=2, 147|title-link= The Faith Healers }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JREF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/166-swift-february-22-2008.html#i7 |title=NEW FOR TAM6!|publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |date=February 22, 2008 |first=James |last=Randi |authorlink=James Randi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broadway.com&gt;Daniel, Danica (April 24, 2012).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=dtkeLWVMlcsC&amp;pg=PA193 ''The Meme Machine'']. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi also planted accomplices in Popoff's audiences, including a man dressed as a woman, at a meeting in Detroit in 1984, whom Popoff "cured" of [[uterine cancer]].&lt;ref name=UniversityOfColorado&gt;Seckel, Al (1987). [http://casa.colorado.edu/~dduncan/pseudoscience/PeterPopoff.htm "GOD'S FREQUENCY IS 39.17 MHz: THE INVESTIGATION OF PETER POPOFF"]. [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. Originally published in ''Science and the Paranormal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Randi and Shaw recorded Elizabeth describing a woman to Popoff as "that big nigger in the back", and warning him, "Keep your hands off those tits ... I'm watching you." At another session, Elizabeth and her aides were heard laughing uncontrollably at the physical appearance of a man suffering from advanced [[testicular cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UX9S1b9KTrg|James Randi on Peter Popoff and Skepticism}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1986, Randi presented one of Jason's videos on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Randi (1989), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Popoff initially denied Randi's accusations and accused [[NBC]] of "...[hiring] an actress to impersonate Mrs. Popoff on a doctored videotape". Eventually Popoff admitted the existence of the radio device, but claimed that Elizabeth only "occasionally" gave him "the name of a person who needs special prayers". He added that "almost everybody" knew about the wireless communication system.&lt;ref&gt;Randi (1989), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; His ministry's viewer ratings and donations declined significantly after the Carson airing, and in September 1987 he declared [[bankruptcy]], listing more than 790 unpaid creditors. Popoff's attorney, William Simon, "attributed the collapse of his ministry to financial mismanagement more than to disclosures about Popoff."&lt;ref name="Bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58706407.html?dids=58706407:58706407&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+26%2C+1987&amp;author=JOHN+DART&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Evangelist+Popoff+Off+Air%2C+Files+Bankruptcy+Petitions&amp;pqatl=google |last= Dart |first= John |title= Evangelist Popoff Off Air, Files Bankruptcy Petitions |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= September 26, 1987 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason's video footage was also aired on the ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' episode "[[Secrets of the Psychics]]" in 1991. The episode was released on video as part of a lesson in critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Secrets of the Psychics. Program Overview |publisher=PBS |author= NOVA Teachers |date= 19 October 1993 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/programs/2012_psychics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former associate of Popoff from 1965 to 1990 said, "When you're praying for the sick, it's through the Holy Spirit, and there's some times that it works freely, and then there are other times when the Spirit's just not there."  He went on to say that on the days it didn't show, you still had to pay for the auditorium so you needed to help the Holy Spirit along.&lt;ref name="GQ article, Feb. 27, 2017"/&gt;

==Resurgence==
In 1998, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Popoff was making a comeback, seeking to jump-start his ministry by repackaging himself for an African-American audience, buying time on the [[BET|Black Entertainment Television network]]. Popoff, along with [[Don Stewart (preacher)|Don Stewart]] and [[Robert Tilton]], received "criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community".&lt;ref name=WhitePreachers&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-669259.html?refid=gg_x_02 |title=White Preachers Born Again on Black Network; TV Evangelists Seek to Resurrect Ministries |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 3, 1998|accessdate= September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2007 ''[[Inside Edition]]'' segment reported that Popoff's new [[infomercial]]s depict him "healing the sick" in a manner identical to his methods prior to James Randi's exposé. Victims were interviewed, including a married couple who charged that Popoff had taken "thousands of dollars" from them. Popoff refused to comment. "[[Confidence trick|Flim flam]] is his profession," Randi explained to reporter Matt Meaghan. "That's what he does best. He's very good at it, and naturally he's going to go back to it."&lt;ref name="InsideEdition2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insideedition.com/ourstories/reports/story.aspx?storyid=639 |title=A Profitable Prophet |work=[[Inside Edition]] |date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910132240/http://www.insideedition.com/ourstories/reports/story.aspx?storyid=639 |archivedate=September 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' focused on Popoff's comeback and explored the lives of a few people who felt cheated.&lt;ref name="2020-2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3164858&amp;page=1 |title=Selling Salvation?|work=[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]] |date=11 May 2007 |first=Jim |last=Avila |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other media outlets have run similar stories.&lt;ref name="KIDK"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kidk.com/news/local/11041621.html |title=Miracle Water: Ripoff or For Real Part II |publisher=[[KIDK]] |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915062044/http://www.kidk.com/news/local/11041621.html |archivedate=September 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.komotv.com/news/10404072.html |title=Prophet or profit? |publisher=[[KOMO-TV]] |date=October 9, 2007 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012024926/http://www.komotv.com/news/10404072.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.katu.com/news/10422457.html |title=Prophet or profit?

In 2008, the UK broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] issued strong warnings to broadcasters for transmitting Popoff's material, which the regulator felt promoted his products "in such a way as to target potential susceptible and vulnerable viewers". These programs included offers of free "Miracle [[Manna]]" that allegedly provided health and financial miracles. In 2009, Popoff began running advertisements in UK periodicals offering a free cross containing "blessed water" and "holy sand". The water, he claimed, was drawn from a spring near [[Chernobyl]] (site of the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 nuclear reactor disaster]]). Animals and humans drinking from the spring were purportedly spared radiation sickness. Responders to the ad received a small wooden cross bearing the inscription "Jerusalem" and a solicitation for donations, followed by numerous additional solicitation letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb117/ "Broadcast Bulletin Issue number 117"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701124916/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb117/ |date=July 1, 2010 }}.

Popoff was designated by the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] (JREF) as one of its recipients of the 2011 [[Pigasus Award]] for fraudulent practices, along with [[Mehmet Oz]] (from ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'') and [[CVS Pharmacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Randi, James (2011).

In September 2015, [[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]] of the [[Good Thinking Society]] documented Popoff's latest promises of "fabulous extreme fortune" and "miracles" in exchange for donations to his organization. At a recent London gathering, GTS filmed Popoff "healing" a woman supposedly "wracked with pain", though Marshall and a colleague had previously seen her—in no obvious distress—handing out pens and questionnaires to audience members. Soon after the "healing", they watched her quietly leave the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/two-very-different-charlatans-both-6501321 |title=Two very different charlatans both selling the divine right to get rich quick |author=Andrew Penman |work=Daily Mirror |date=24 September 2015 |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, Popoff began to offer "Miracle Spring Water" on late-night infomercials in the US, [[Canada]], the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="PopoffTV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Popoff Worldwide TV Schedule |work=Peter Popoff Ministries |url=http://peterpopoff.org/tv.php |accessdate=2008-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405004116/http://www.peterpopoff.org/tv.php |archivedate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents are promised miraculous protection from disease and disability, along with [[prosperity theology|financial prosperity]] (which may include "divine money transfers directly into your account"), if they sleep with the water for one night before drinking it, then pray over the empty packet and send it back to Popoff—with a donation. Multiple solicitation letters follow, requesting more donations in exchange for miracles.&lt;ref&gt;Controversial Televangelist Peter Popoff Hawks 'Miracle Water'.

Popoff also started referring to himself as a prophet.&lt;ref name="Government of Western Australia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Scam_Types-Psychics_clairvoyants_and_other_lucky_charms-Peter_Popoff.htm|title=Peter Popoff|publisher=Government of Western Australia, Dept. of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, Consumer Protection|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popoff's operation had functioned as a religious nonprofit until 2006, when it merged with a small church in Farmers Branch, Texas called Word for the World, which operated out of a storefront.  By being classified as a church, the operation no longer had to report annual income or salary to the IRS.  When a reporter from ''GQ'' attempted to visit this church on a Sunday morning in late 2016, he found a deserted parking lot in an industrial park with no church sign visible on the outside.&lt;ref name="GQ article, Feb. 27, 2017"/&gt;

Because of Popoff's history of fraud and financial irregularities, his "People United For Christ" organization earned a "Did Not Disclose" rating with the [[Better Business Bureau]], indicating its refusal to provide information that would enable BBB to determine whether the group adheres to its Standards for Charity Accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.give.org/charity-reviews/national/people-united-for-christ-in-upland-ca-8209#sthash.bzkakjGu.dpuf People United for Christ], [[Give.org]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Popoff's longtime assistants Reeford and Pamela Sherrell also began a televised [[Texas]]-based ministry, with Reeford using the name Pastor Lee Sherrell. Like Popoff, they use the offer of a religious trinket (a free prayer cloth) to compile an address list. Once a follower requests the prayer cloth and inputs his or her address, letters asking for money are dispatched.&lt;ref name=UniversityOfColorado/&gt;

Researcher and bioethics expert Fred M. Frohock cited Popoff as "one of many egregious instances of fake healing."&lt;ref&gt;Frohock, Fred M. (2000).

Popoff was collecting almost $4 million per year in the late 1980s, according to Randi.&lt;ref name=NOVA&gt;{{cite news |title=Secrets of the Psychics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNl52deOZro|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]|date=October 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, his ministry received over $9.6 million, and in 2005, over $23 million.

==In popular culture==
The 1992 [[Steve Martin]] [[dramedy]] ''[[Leap of Faith (film)|Leap of Faith]]'' was inspired by Popoff's fraudulent ministry, and demonstrated a number of the techniques Popoff and other televangelist scammers use to create the illusion of divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1599924.ece|title=Debt-busting ‘con' comes to Britain|last1=Ungoad-Thomas|first1=Jon|last2=Stoneman|first2=Justin|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=August 30, 2015|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A 2012 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical adaptation of the same title was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Musical]].&lt;ref name=Broadway.com/&gt;

Popoff was also the inspiration for a character in the 2012 [[thriller film]] ''[[Red Lights (2012 film)|Red Lights]]'', a [[psychic]] who uses information fed to him via a hidden earpiece to persuade the audience at his shows that he is receiving personal details psychically. The script includes Elizabeth Popoff's infamous line, "Hello Petey, can you hear me? If you can't, you're in trouble", almost verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/15/psychics-psychologists-red-lights?newsfeed=true|work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Chris|last=French|title=How true to life are the psychics and psychologists in Red Lights?|date=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''San Fernando Pioneer Memorial Cemetery''', earlier known as '''Morningside Cemetery''', is a cemetery in the [[Sylmar, Los Angeles, California|Sylmar district of Los Angeles]].

Located on a 3.8-acre (15,000 m²) site at the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Bledsoe Street, the Pioneer Cemetery was thought to be originally a 40-acre or 10-acre (400,000 m²) site. The cemetery was established in 1874 when Senator Charles Maclay created the Township of San Fernando. The last burial was most likely in 1939.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; It was known at the time as the '''San Fernando Cemetery''' and also as the '''Morningside Cemetery''' and is the oldest non-denominational cemetery in the San Fernando Valley.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book|author=Judson Grenier (Editor-in-chief)|title=A Guide to Historic Places in Los Angeles County, p. 96|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co.|year=1978|isbn=0-8403-7501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area's oldest cemetery being the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], which began operating in approximately 1800.

Until recently, it was erroneously thought that over 700 residents were buried there between approximately 1892 and 1939. Due to heavy vandalism, there are only 13 tombstones remaining. After the cemetery was determined to be legally abandoned in 1959, it was acquired by the Native Daughters of the Golden West, San Fernando Mission Chapter #280, renamed and maintained as a pioneer memorial park.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; Edith Reber, a longtime resident of Sylmar and an active member of the Chamber, for many years ran a volunteer effort to maintain the grounds with the help of local volunteer groups. In 2002, the Native Daughters gave the cemetery to the San Fernando Valley Historical Society. The Society has made many improvements to the property, including installing a memorial brick entrance and opening the cemetery to the public one day a month on the third Saturday. The Society also commissioned a ground penetrating radar survey in 2010 that located only 214 gravesites, which scientifically contradicted the long-standing belief that more graves were present. While ground penetrating radar may not be infallible, the likelihood that over 700 people were buried there is slim. Through volunteer researchers, nearly 200 death certificates citing Morningside Cemetery have been located. The Society continues to do research in an effort to correct the historical inaccuracies which unfortunately continue to be repeated by media, amateur historians, gravers, and others interested in the old cemetery. It is located on what is currently the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Bledsoe Street.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

It was listed as a [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] in 1993. As "San Fernando Cemetery", it is a [[California Historical Landmark]].

The '''South Pacific Touring Series''' was an [[Australia]]n [[Touring car racing]] series held annually from 1970 to 1975 during the month of February in conjunction with the [[Tasman Series]] for open-wheelers. Races counting towards the series were staged at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] in [[Queensland]], [[Warwick Farm Raceway|Warwick Farm]] and [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] in [[Sydney]], [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown Park]] in [[Melbourne]] and, from 1972, at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in [[South Australia]].

==History==
The 1970 series was run under the name '''Tasman Touring Series''',&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Stewart Wilson, Holden – the official racing history, page 77&lt;/ref&gt; with the South Pacific Touring Series name adopted for 1971.&lt;ref name=Moffat&gt;[http://www.allanmoffat.com.au/again/cars_xwfalcon.htm  “XW Falcon”, www.allanmoffat.com.au] Retrieved on 11 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 1972 the series was open to [[Group E Series Production Touring Cars]] &lt;ref&gt;Official Programme, Warwick Farm, 14 February 1971&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=AIR_1972&gt;”Programme of Events and Awards, Official Programme, Adelaide International Raceway, Sunday 27 February 1972, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1973 onwards, like the [[Bathurst 1000]] endurance race, it was switched to the new Australian [[Group C (Australia)|Group C Touring Car]] regulations.&lt;ref name=AIR_1973&gt;”Programme of Events and Awards, Official Programme, Adelaide International Raceway, Sunday 25 February 1973, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the series on the Australian racing calendar meant that it was the first title to be contested by the [[Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]], [[Ford Australia|Ford]] and [[Holden]] teams each year. 

A Manufacturers Trophy was awarded in addition to a drivers title in 1970 &lt;ref name=Castrol&gt;”Ford Falcon wins again on Castrol”, The Age, 23 February 1970, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;General Supplementary Regulations, Surfers Paradise International Motor Racing Circuit Pty Ltd, Sunday, 7th February 1971&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 the Entrant of the car driven by the driver gaining the most points in the series was awarded equal recognition with the winning driver.&lt;ref name=AIR_1972/&gt; &lt;ref name=AIR_1973/&gt; &lt;ref name=AIR_1974&gt; Programme of Events and Awards, Official Programme, Adelaide international Raceway, Sunday 24 February 1974, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=AIR_1975&gt; Programme of Events and Awards, Official Programme, Adelaide international Raceway, Sunday 16 February 1975, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford works team]] lead driver [[Allan Moffat]] was the winning driver in 1970 with the [[Ford Motor Company of Australia]] awarded the Manufacturers Trophy. [[John Goss (racing driver)|John Goss]] took the title driving for McLeod Ford in 1972. [[Harry Firth]]'s [[Holden Dealer Team]] and its drivers won the title four times, with [[Colin Bond]] winning in 1971 and 1975 and [[Peter Brock]] victorious in 1973 and 1974. 

Like the Tasman Series, the South Pacific series was in decline by the mid-1970s due to the greater importance put on the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] and it was discontinued after 1975.

[[Image:ACC-BackRow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The view of the ice from the last row of [[Toronto]]'s [[Air Canada Centre]] with stadium seating.]]
[[Image:stadium-demo.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of stadium seating (left) to standard seating. The rearmost viewer can see a lower subject with stadium seating.]]

'''Stadium seating''' or '''theater seating''' is a characteristic seating arrangement that is most commonly associated with [[Performing arts|performing-arts]] venues, and derives its name from [[stadium]]s, which typically use this arrangement.

==Description==
In stadium seating, most or all seats are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them so that the occupants of further-back seats have less of their views blocked by those further forward. This is especially necessary in stadiums where the subject matter is typically best observed from above, rather than in-line or from below. In addition to [[sports venue]]s and performing arts venues, many other venues that require clear audience views of a single area use stadium seating, including religious institutions, lecture halls, and [[movie theater]]s.

==Alternatives==
An alternative to stadium seating is to place the focal area at a higher level than the audience, so that the audience may look above those people in front of them to see, (like the green circle in the illustration, right), avoiding blocked sight-lines . One example of this is floor seating of a [[music venue]] which has a raised stage; seats are commonly all at an equal height on the actual floor of a venue, such as the floor seats at a concert held in a sports [[arena]].

Because the increased angle of stadium seating, seats are typically (but not universally) installed on a stepped floor surface which also functions as a staircase in the aisles. This is as opposed to the common usage of a flat, often slightly sloped, floor used in many standard seating venues (such as many [[Theater (structure)|stage theaters]]). There has been some criticism of stadium seating{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} because, due to the stepped layout, it is usually not possible for disabled people in wheelchairs to move about. Venues with stadium seating generally place handicapped seating among the row which is at the level of the [[concourse]] which feeds the seating area, leaving more space than rows above or below it, and leaving chair-less space(s) for wheelchairs.

==Trains==
The [[train (roller coaster)|trains]] on some [[roller coaster]]s are also configured in tiers; this seating configuration is also sometimes called stadium seating. Three prominent examples of roller coasters whose trains use this type of seating are [[Millennium Force]] at [[Cedar Point]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} which opened in 2000, [[SheiKra]] at [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} which opened in 2005, and [[Griffon (roller coaster)|Griffon]] at [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]], which opened in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Theaters==
Converting sloped-floor theaters to stadium seating often requires raising the ceiling and adding risers, so owners of movie theaters often judge conversion as not cost effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Connelly |work=[[Houston Press]] |title=A Loew(s) Blow |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2001-03-15/news/a-loew-s-blow/ |date=March 15, 2001 |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teatro El Círculo''' is a [[theatre|theater]] in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]].

== Overview ==

It is located near the historical center of the city, at the intersection of Laprida and Mendoza Streets. Planned as a [[Music theatre|lyric theater]], it was developed as ''Teatro La Ópera'' by Emilio O. Schiffner, who purchased the society of the same name in 1889. Schiffner contracted German engineer George Goldammer, an [[acoustician]] who modified the original design, and the construction firm of Bianchi, Vila y Compañía. Following delays caused by the [[Panic of 1890]], as well as the earlier society's debts, the theatre was started in 1903. Italian artists, directed by Luggi Levoni, decorated both the interiors and exteriors; among their notable creations was the stage curtain designed by Giuseppe Carmignani with images from [[Greek mythology]] similar to those found in the [[Teatro Regio di Parma]]. Teatro La Ópera was inaugurated on June 4, 1904, with the performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Otello]]''.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatro-elcirculo.com.ar/contenido.php?idcontenido=1|title=Teatro El Círculo: Historia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater received many artists from around the world, including opera singers, ballets, and orchestras. [[Enrico Caruso]] performed there in 1915, and compared its acoustic quality to that of the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=historia/&gt;

After this phase of splendor, the theater began to decay, and by 1940 its demolition was being actively considered by the city. The abandoned [[catacomb]]s underneath the theatre were converted into the Museum of Sacred Art in 1940 to house the prolific work of sculptor [[Eduardo Barnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatro-elcirculo.com.ar/item.php?iditem=69|title=Museo de Arte Sacro Eduardo Barnes|publisher=Teatro El Círculo}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural association known ''El Círculo de la Biblioteca'' (The Library Circle), who previously gathered at the [[Biblioteca Argentina Dr. Juan Álvarez|Biblioteca Argentina]] and needed another place for their meetings, acquired the building in 1943, preserved it, and changed its name to the present one.&lt;ref name=historia/&gt;

The theater has a capacity of 1,450 people, in five levels. It currently functions mostly as a cultural center. It was fully restored for its 100th anniversary in 2004, and served as a stage for the [[Third International Congress of the Spanish Language]]. The sidewalks and the two streets around the corner of the theater were turned into a sort of plaza with an early 20th-century look, using old lampposts and replacing the usual asphalted surface with [[cobblestone]]s.&lt;ref name=historia/&gt;

'''The Game Awards''' is an annual [[award]]s ceremony honoring achievements in the [[video game]] industry. The ceremonies also feature premieres of new games and upcoming content and an in-depth look at previously announced ones. The shows are produced and hosted by Canadian games journalist [[Geoff Keighley]], who had worked on its predecessor, the [[Spike Video Game Awards]], for over ten years.&lt;ref name="tga 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takahashi|first1=Dean|title=Geoff Keighley unveils The Game Awards 2014 to replace the VGAs|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/11/10/geoff-keighley-unveils-the-game-awards-2014-to-replace-the-vgas/|website=Venture Beat|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1994, [[Geoff Keighley]] had been a part of the first televised awards show for video games, ''Cybermania '94: The Ultimate Gamer Awards''. Keighley, as a teenager, had been brought on to help write material for the celebrity hosts such as [[William Shatner]] and [[Leslie Neilson]]. The show was not considered successful, aimed more for comedy than celebration, but from it, Keighley had been prompted to develop something akin to the [[Academy Awards]] for video games later in his career.&lt;ref name="latimes keighley"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-hc-game-awards-20171205-story.html | title = Geoff Keighley's lifelong obsession to create a video game Oscars | first = Todd | last = Martens | date = December 6, 2017 | accessdate = December 6, 2017 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keighley had subsequently worked on the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] (abbreviated VGA), which ran from 2003 to 2013. The show, was broadcast on [[Spike (TV network)|Spike TV]] near the end of each calendar year, was designed to honor video games released during that year. Keighley served as the producer and often host for these shows. In 2013, Spike opted to rename the awards from VGA to VGX as to reflect that they wanted to focus more on next-generation games that were being ushered in by the onset of the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth generation of consoles]], as well as bringing comedian [[Joel McHale]] to co-host alongside Keighley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/15/5107808/spike-video-game-awards-vgx-2013-date | title = Spike Video Game Awards renamed VGX, set for Dec. 7 | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = November 15, 2013 | accessdate = December 6, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 show was considered to be disappointing and aimed as a more commercial work rather than a celebration of video game achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/gamers-care-more-about-the-vgx-than-the-show-did-that-1479162197 | title =  Gamers Care More About the VGX Than the Show Did. That's the Problem. | first = Owen | last=  Good | date = December 8, 2013 | accessdate = December 6, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keighley was disappointed with the change in tone that this show has presented.&lt;ref name="latimes keighley"/&gt; He opted to drop out from further involvement in the VGX, allowing Spike to retain ownership of the property; in November 2014, Spike TV announced that they had opted to drop the awards show in its entirety.&lt;ref name="variety origins"/&gt; Instead, Keighley worked with several entities within the industry, including console hardware manufacturers [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Nintendo]], and several large publishers, to financially back and craft a new awards show, the Game Awards, with Spike's blessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/hey-all-a-little-more-about-this-from-my-pal-keighley-1656985933 | title = There's A Big New Game Award Show Happening This December | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date = November 10, 2014 | accessdate = December 6, 2014 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keighley was able to secure space for hosting the live event. Without a broadcaster, Keighley and the entities agreed to [[Streaming media|stream]] the live show on the consoles' networks and on [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Steam (software)|Steam]] service, as to be able to reach a much larger audience than Spike TV previously had.&lt;ref name="variety origins"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/videogame-industry-rallies-around-first-game-awards-exclusive-1201352339/ | title = Videogame Industry Rallies Around First ‘Game Awards’  | first = Marc | last = Graser | date = 10 November 2014 | accessdate = 2 December 2016 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Keighley has been able to secure multiple streaming services around the globe for the show, which has been a move appreciated by several of the Game Awards' partners since the show's inception.&lt;ref name="vb"/&gt;

Keighley considered it important that the Game Awards presentation is aimed to favorably present the interest of gamers and of the industry, and to be welcoming to celebrities and others that have shown interest in video games.&lt;ref name="vb"/&gt; While the Game Awards are principally an awards show, Keighley knew the importance of having additional content, having seen other experiments of video game awards shows that were only dedicated to awards fail due to lack of audience.&lt;ref name="kotaku promos"/&gt; Keighley believed that the Game Awards should fall somewhere between the entertainment venues that are used for the [[Academy Awards]], and the standard award presentation used for the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]], and wanted a balance of material.&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/06/at-4-the-game-awards-strives-for-balance-of-revelations-gamer-culture-and-celebrities/ | title = The Game Awards balances revelations, gamer culture, and celebrities | first = Dean | last = Takahashi | date = December 6, 2017 | accessdate = December 6, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Spike VGX and into the Game Awards, Keighley has engaged with developers and publishers to bring teaser trailers, sneak peaks, and reveals of upcoming games alongside the awards.  He considers the crowning moment of this approach was being able to secure the first gameplay reveal of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' for the 2014 Game Awards.&lt;ref name="kotaku promos"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/how-video-games-biggest-award-show-comes-together-1820880314 | title = How Video Games' Biggest Award Show Comes Together | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date = November 30, 2017 | accessdate = November 30, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keighly encourages developers and publishers to provide any content that might be deemed existing or that can pique interest, even if these games are at an early stage of development, and then makes the selection of which games and trailers to feature.&lt;ref name="kotaku promos"/&gt;

In conjunction with the Awards presentation, several digital storefronts, such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] and the [[PlayStation Store]] offer the nominated games on sale leading up to and a few days after the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2017/12/07/xbox-one-stealth-sale-has-great-prices-on-fifa-18-call-of-duty-ww2-shadow-of-war-much-more/ | title = Xbox One stealth sale has great prices on FIFA 18, Call of Duty: WW2, Shadow of War, much more | first = Sherif | last = Saed | date = December 7, 2017 | accessdate = December 7, 2017 | work = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statuette awarded to the selected games was designed by collaboration between Keighley and [[Weta Workshop]]. It is meant to represent "the evolution of the video game medium by way of an angel that ascends through digital building blocks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thegameawards.com/about/ | title = About the Game Awards | accessdate = December 3, 2017 | publisher = The Game Awards }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVqvAd7Ykw4 | title = The Game Awards 2016 - Behind the Scenes at WETA! | publisher = The Game Awards | date = November 20, 2016 | accessdate = December 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The Game Awards has an advisory committee which includes representatives from hardware manufacturers Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and [[AMD]], and software publishers [[Electronic Arts]], [[Activision]], [[Rockstar Games]], [[Ubisoft]], Valve, and [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]]. This committee selects around thirty influential video game news organizations that will be able to nominate and subsequently vote on the video games in several categories. The advisory committee otherwise does not participate in the nomination or voting process. During the nomination round, each of the news outlets provides a list of games in several categories; games for the [[esports]]-related categories are chosen by a specific subset of these outlets. The committee compiles the nominations and selects the most-nominated titles for voting by these same outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thegameawards.com/rules-and-voting/ |title = The Game Awards – Rules and Voting | accessdate = 1 December 2016 | work = The Game Awards }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2017, there were 28 industry experts and representatives that selected the winners, while the awards from 2017 onwards have used over 50 such experts.&lt;ref name="variety 2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/2017-game-awards-live-streaming-twitch-youtube-twitter-facebook-1202610838/ | title = 2017 Game Awards Expands Distribution, Adds Fan Voting via Google Search, Twitter, Facebook | first = Todd | last=  Spangler | date = November 10, 2017 | accessdate = November 10, 2017 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Hell Song'''" is a song by Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Sum 41]]. The song was released in February 2003 as the second single of the band's album ''[[Does This Look Infected?]]''. "The Hell Song" was released to radio on February 18, 2003.&lt;ref name=FMQB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16771|title=FMQB Airplay Archive: Modern Rock|publisher=Friday Morning Quarterback Album Report, Incorporated|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was featured in the films ''[[American Wedding]]'' and ''[[Punk's Not Dead (2007 film)|Punk's Not Dead]]'' and in the video game ''[[Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home]]''. "The Hell Song" was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] on May 29, 2015.{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=single|title=The Hell Song|artist=Sum 41}}

==Background==
Deryck Whibley, the lead vocalist of Sum 41, wrote "The Hell Song" after learning that one of his friends had contracted HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458709/20021114/sum_41.jhtml|title=Sum 41 Sober Up On Does This Look Infected?|publisher=[[MTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "That song just came out in, like, half an hour when I just found out," Whibley said. "I wasn't even meaning to write about it, but for some reason that just came out right away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=the+hell+song+sum+41+spreads+billboard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW6q3Up9jMAhXJ7RQKHb3GATEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20hell%20song%20sum%2041%20spreads%20billboard&amp;f=false |title=Sum 41 Spreads 'Infected' |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |last=Whitmire |first=Margo |year=2002 |volume=114 |number=48 |ISSN=0006-2510 |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]] |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The music video was of a concert with dolls and action figures, with Sum 41's faces on those "performing" in front of a [[Lite-Brite]] screen. They were joined with other action figures such as those of [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Eminem]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] with his family, [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Korn]], [[Metallica]], [[Eddie the Head]], [[Gene Simmons]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Angus Young]], [[Jesus Christ]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Ludacris]]. The dolls' obscene finger gestures and nudity are comically censored, which parodies real life. The video was directed by [[Marc Klasfeld]].

This article lists a chronology of events in the '''[[South Thailand insurgency]]''' from the 1960s. Most take place in the Muslim-majority, contested provinces of [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]], [[Pattani Province|Pattani]], and [[Yala Province|Yala]] in the far south of Thailand bordering Muslim [[Malaysia]].

For earlier events see [[History of Thailand]].

==Timeline==

===1960–1998===
Although the conflict was carried out with less intensity, armed resistance in the 1960s and 1970s involved up to 1,500 insurgents.&lt;ref name=KiwL/&gt;

'''1960''': The [[Barisan Revolusi Nasional]] (BRN) was founded by Haji Abdul Karim in response to the introduction of a secular curriculum in Pattani's religious boarding schools.&lt;ref name="RAND-2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalk|first1=Peter|title=The Malay-Muslim Insurgency in Southern Thailand; Understanding the Conflict's Evolving Dynamic|date=2008|publisher=RAND Corporation|location=Santa Monica|url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/occasional_papers/2008/RAND_OP198.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2017|format=Occasional Paper|chapter=RAND Counterinsurgency Study-Paper 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1968''': [[Patani United Liberation Organisation]] (PULO) was founded by Tengku Bira Kotanila (alias Kabir Abdul Rahman). PULO became the most powerful insurgent group during the 1960 – 2000 period of the war.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt;

''' 29 November 1975''': Thai marines allegedly murdered five Muslim youths in the [[Bacho District]] of Narathiwat Province. The government allegedly failed to conduct a proper investigation into the matter.&lt;ref name=AmER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/10752/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/9e93edd5-3b11-4b7b-bc9d-59aa638320f2/en/098_southern_thailand.pdf |title=Insurgency, Not Jihad |work=Asia Report 98 |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208032106/http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/10752/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/9e93edd5-3b11-4b7b-bc9d-59aa638320f2/en/098_southern_thailand.pdf |archivedate=8 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''11 December 1975''': PULO organised mass protests in response to the event, which were joined by 70,000 Malay Muslims. A bomb was thrown into the crowd killing 12 and injuring at least 30 protesters. The attack was blamed on Buddhist extremists.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

The government charged and imprisoned the perpetrators and launched an official inquiry and compensated the families of the victims. Despite the fact that the majority of the protesters demands were granted, the event led to an escalation of the insurgency.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

'''June 1977''': Sabilillah (Path of God) bombed [[Don Mueang International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]]. In the aftermath of the bombing Sabilillah vanished into obscurity.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

'''September 1977''': Black December 1902 members threw a bomb into a Thai royal ceremony. Five persons were killed and 47 wounded. The royal family managed to escape unharmed.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

'''1977''': Security forces killed [[Barisan Nasional Pembebasan Patani|BNPP]] leader Tunku Yala Nasae.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

* Renewed agitation began in the 1990s, led by Malay intellectuals influenced by revolutionary and [[Islamism|Islamist]] ideas from the [[Middle East]]. The BRN split into three rival factions, of which the most militant were the BRN Coordinate and the BRN Congress. The BRN Congress is regarded as the most active group, but there are several others, and competition between these militant groups has helped fuel the insurgency. It is believed that there is now a co-ordinating body called the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation]] (Dewan Pembebasan Pattani or PULO), although little is known about the composition or leadership of the various groups.

'''1993''': The [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|New PULO]], a dissident faction of the original PULO, was established by Arrong Moo-reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt;

'''1995''': Nasoree Saesang founded the [[Gerakan Mujahidin Islam Patani|GMIP]].&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

'''August 1996''': Thirty-six schools were torched in Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat allegedly by members of the New PULO faction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/20-schools-torched-arsenal-raided-91357.html |title=unk |publisher= |accessdate=13 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217095658/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/20-schools-torched-arsenal-raided-91357.html |archivedate=17 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly a dissident faction of the original PULO established by Arrong Moo-reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt; The Thai Interior Ministry and Thai Military Intelligence reported that New PULO used unemployed youth and young drug addicts to carry out its terrorist missions.&lt;ref name="RG&amp;AA"&gt;[[Rohan Gunaratna]] &amp; Arabinda Acharya , ''The Terrorist Threat from Thailand: Jihad Or Quest for Justice?''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1997''': Members of the [[Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani]] (BRN), [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|PULO]] and the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|New PULO]] established the United Mujahideen Front of Pattani to improve co-ordination between rebel factions.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt;

'''August 1997''': [[Bersatu]] launched an operation code named "Falling Leaves". Between August 1997 and January 1998, 33 separate attacks took place resulting in nine deaths.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt;

'''January 1998''': Malaysia and Thailand launched a joint operation code named "Pitak Tai" to crack down on insurgent outfits.&lt;ref name="RG&amp;AA"/&gt; Malaysian authorities arrested New PULO's leader,Abdul Rohman Bazo, its military chief, Haji Daoh Thanam, and Bazo's senior assistant, Haji Mae Yala in Kedah, as well as PULO's military commander, Haji Sama-ae Thanam, in [[Kuala Lumpur]], later handing them to Thai authorities.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt; The Thai government also encouraged local people to monitor the movements of drug traffickers and, as a result, the tough policy on drugs deprived PULO of recruits for its acts of terror.&lt;ref name="RG&amp;AA"/&gt;

===1999–2002===
* Following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] in the United States, leaflets calling for Holy War and support for [[Osama bin Laden]] were distributed in Yala by militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=893#.VHxpB9JSVqk|title=A Breakdown of Southern Thailand's Insurgent Groups|journal=Terrorism Monitor|volume=4|issue=17|author=Zachary Abuza|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|date=2006-09-08|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''24 December 2001''': Insurgents launched a number of attacks on police posts in the three provinces. Five police and one defence volunteer were killed.&lt;ref name=KiwL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/funstonfinalforwebsite2.pdf |title=Conflict in Southern Thailand |work=Melbourne Law School Paper |date=2008 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query.php?url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/funstonfinalforwebsite2.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Thai National Intelligence Agency estimated that fewer than 1,000 armed militants were taking part in the conflict as of 2001.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt; In that year, the Thai Ministry of Interior estimated that 50 insurgency-related incidents had occurred.&lt;ref name=AmER/&gt; By 2002, 75 insurgency-linked attacks had killed 50 police and army personnel.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt;

===2003===
* In 2003, officials counted 149 incidents. The mounting scale and sophistication of the insurgency eventually prompted the government into a recognition that there was a serious issue in the southern provinces.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt;

===2004===
'''4 January''': An escalation of the violence in the southern border provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat is reckoned to have begun on 4 January 2004 with the raiding of a Thai Army depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phongsutthirak|first1=Thitinan|title=Conflict and Terrorism in Southern Thailand (review)|journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International and Strategic Affairs|date=April 2006|volume=28|issue=1|pages=160–163|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/206156|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unidentified gunmen raided an army ammunition depot in [[Narathiwat Province]] in the early morning, and made off with over 400 rifles and ammunition.&lt;ref name=RAND-2008/&gt;

However, the emergency decree was highly popular, with 72 percent of Bangkok residents and 86 percent of people in the three southern provinces supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abacpoll.au.edu/in_news/2549/bangkokpost100706.pdf |title=Strategy based on hopelessness|date=2006-07-10|accessdate=2 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801084959/http://www.abacpoll.au.edu/in_news/2549/bangkokpost100706.pdf |archivedate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the insurgency escalated further.

[[Image:Deni ute muster 2002 two utes.jpg|thumb|250px|Two utes at the Deniliquin Ute muster, 2002]]

A '''ute muster''' is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[festival]] which brings together large numbers of [[ute (vehicle)|utes]] and their owners. These events typically include competitions and other side events, occur annually, and normally last several days and are held in rural and regional areas of Australia and New Zealand.

These events can be seen as a more rural version of the [[Summernats]], a festival which promotes a wider range of car culture.

The [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]] Urban Country Music Festival, which features a "Beaut Ute" competition, is a [[country music]] festival established in 2004.

==Background==
Often ute musters are combined with a larger festival such as a [[rodeo]], [[agricultural show]] or [[music festival]], and are usually sponsored by companies which are local to where the muster is being held.

Ute musters are often mis-represented as being attended by [[yobbo]]s who just like to drink, this is no longer the case, but instead an outlet for enthusiastic ute owners to show off their pride and joy in their vehicles which are personalised with lights, stickers, bull bars, and various after-market add-ons.  They are generally held to raise money for towns, charities and local causes, and have run in conjunction with agricultural shows or Bachelor and Spinster Balls which raise money for local charities.

The [[Deniliquin]] Ute Muster is the largest event of its kind in the world. It is a stand-alone event which began as a celebration of all things Australian and the Aussie icon of the ute, and has developed into a two-day festival, with live music concerts, ute driving competitions, the Australian National Circle Work Championships TM, show and shine arena, and bull ride.

Ute enthusiasts tend to have an obsession with [[bumper sticker]]s, often covering the entire rear window of the ute with them. Accumulating the most different stickers is a sort of status symbol which is often the deciding factor in many of the ''Beaut Ute'' competitions (see below). Some of the popular stickers are [[Bundaberg Rum]], [[Holden]], [[Jim Beam]], Ute Muster and the [[Conargo Pub]].

==Beaut ute==
[[File:2004–2007 Holden VZ Ute 01.jpg|thumb|[[Holden Ute|Holden VZ Ute]] at Deniliquin in 2008.]]
The event itself involves a congregation of ute enthusiasts who enter their utes in a number of competitions, sometimes referred to as a ''Beaut Ute Competition''. Some of the typical categories are:
* ''Best [[Feral]] Ute'' &amp;ndash; the dirtiest, worst maintained, lived-in Ute
* ''Best [[Bachelor and Spinster Balls|B&amp;S]] Ute'' &amp;ndash; generally decorated with bullbars,headlights,stickers of alcohol brands or rodeo/ute musters and various pubs
* ''Best [[4WD]]''
* ''Best Classic Ute'' &amp;ndash; pre-1980 in most original condition.
* ''Best Chick's Ute'' &amp;ndash; Ute owned and maintained by a woman.
* ''Best Street Ute'' &amp;ndash; immaculate, gleaming condition.
* ''Best Trade Ute'' &amp;ndash; Ute decorated with equipment from a particular trade.
* ''Best Rural Ute'' &amp;ndash; decorated for the rural life.
* ''Best VB Ute'' &amp;ndash; competition to see how many stubbies fit in the back. 
* Best Holden Ute,
* Best Ford Ute, 
* Best Work/Trade Ute
Other categories are also included and run on the day these are called novelty categories and normally take a side step from the general categories to make a bit of fun to fill in the day.
some novelty categories include:
* Best Dog in ute
* Ute With a Boot
* Furthest travelled
* Most Kilometers

==Records==
Most of the ute muster events around [[Australia]] try to compete with each other by continually breaking new records of gathering the most vehicles in the one place.

However, that mantle has been claimed by Deniliquin which previously held a small ute show as part of its annual Pastoral and Agricultural Show, but developed the idea into a tourist-attracting event. In 1999 a group of community-minded people got together with the idea of celebrating all things Australian, including the Aussie icon of the ute, to attract people to the agricultural town of Deniliquin, located in the southern Riverina region of New South Wales. In its first year, the event held a [[Guinness Book of Records]] count of ''the largest parade of legally registered utes in the world'', and each year new records are broken. 

In 1999, 2839 drivers took part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deniutemuster.com.au/pages/?ParentPageID=2&amp;PageID=76 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422231701/http://www.deniutemuster.com.au/pages/?ParentPageID=2&amp;PageID=76 |archivedate=2014-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing ''[[Deniliquin]]'' as the ute capital of the world. Since that time, the event has grown in popularity and each year breaks its existing world record. As of 2010, Deniliquin’s current record stands at 8,152 utes, with over 25,000 attendees in a town that normally has a population of about 8000. 

The Deniliquin Ute Muster also holds a record count for most number of people wearing blue singlets - in 2010 that Guinness Book of Records count stands at 3500 people.  

In 2013, a new ute record of 9,736 was set and a new blue singlet record of 3,924 was counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theutecanopyco.com.au/ute-muster-australias-biggest-celebration-of-the-ute/|title=The World's Biggest Celebration of The Ute: The Deni Ute Muster - The Ute Canopy Co|date=2016-09-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from other festivals==
[[Image:DeniliquinUteOnAStick.JPG|thumb|The "Ute on the Pole" at Deniliquin]]
Ute musters are often held to help raise funds for local charities, such as raising funds for local schools or hospitals. Often the ute musters are associated with local groups such as [[Apex Clubs of Australia|Apex]] or [[Rotary International|Rotary]]. They are seen as a good drawcard to bring in money from participants who are not members of the local community - so all money spent is extra money for the local community, whether it goes to the local charity, or just to the local economy.

Musters are often held in conjunction with local agricultural shows.  This will assists organisers in arranging advertising, insurance and other sponsorship. It can also assist in obtaining the cooperation of local emergency services such as police and ambulance, if the muster is one aspect of a larger, previously established local event.

Most ute musters charge a relatively small fee for participants, allowing them to enter any category they are qualified for. Most participants would enter between five and ten categories, as this keeps the event proceeding. Many participants travel long distances to enter and prefer activities to be held in a short timeframe to allow them to join in other parts of the festival.

Well organised events cater for camping. As this is a usual festival environment drawing participants from large distances in country areas there are limited opportunities for public transport. Both competitors and other participants often make extensive use of any bar facilities; in many events the bar provides a large portion of the funds raised. Well organised events provide for camping as often the most practical accommodation for all concerned.

Whilst larger musters can annoy some locals, this is seen as the exception rather than the rule.  Most musters attract between 20-100 utes, depending upon event advertising. Commonly, musters also have maximum numbers permitted to attend - this is often a requirement in obtaining event permits.

Event committees need to liaise carefully with local law enforcement.  The muster held at Deniliquin is a good example of close relationships with NSW Police.  Whilst the organisers recognise that some attendees can flout the law, this is seen as a minority and the event is able to proceed in a realistic environment. This achieves the event's goals of fundraising and ensures participants are able to enjoy the event.

{{History of Sri Lankan Tamils}}
The ''' Vaddukoddai Resolution''' was adopted on 14 May 1976 in [[Pannakam]] near [[Vaddukoddai]], [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]], [[Sri Lanka]]. It called for the creation of an independent [[Tamil Eelam]] by the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] under the leadership of [[S. J. V. Chelvanayakam]]. It contested the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1977]] on its demand for [[Tamil Eelam]] and won an overwhelming mandate in the Tamil areas, becoming the main opposition party in Sri Lanka, the only time a minority party has done so. It gave impetus to Tamil Nationalists who claimed it was a democratic endorsement of a separate state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slelections.gov.lk/pdf/General%20Election%201977.PDF | title=Parliamentary Election - 1977 | publisher=Department of Elections Sri Lanka | accessdate=March 14, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002624/http://www.slelections.gov.lk/pdf/General%20Election%201977.PDF | archive-date=17 July 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Sri Lanka-Tamilen zwischen Sezession und Integration | publisher=Steiner | year=2000 | location=Stuttgart | pages=394 | isbn=3515077170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Multination States in Asia: Accommodation or Resistance | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Jacques Bertrand ,Andre Laliberte | year=2010 | pages=109 | isbn=978-0521143639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sangam.org/FB_HIST_DOCS/TULFManifesto77.htm | title=Tamil United Liberation Front General Election Manifesto (July 1977) | publisher=www.sangam.org | accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpp.co.jp/lanka/gov/govd/govde/gov38e.htm | title=Parliament Election (1977) | publisher=jpp.co.jp | work=jpp.co.jp | accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Von Steuben Day''' is a holiday traditionally held on a weekend in mid-September (von Steuben was born September 17), celebrating the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian-born]] [[Baron Friedrich von Steuben]], who arrived in the [[United States]] as a volunteer offering his services to General [[George Washington]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Von Steuben is still regarded as one of the most important German Americans, as his training of the young American troops made victory against the British possible and thus his work helped in gaining independence for the United States of America. The day is generally considered the [[German-American]] event of the year; celebrations focus on parades in which participants march, dance, and play music.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Parades==
The '''German-American Steuben Parade''' is an annual [[parade]] traditionally held in cities across the United States on Von Steuben Day.

The [[New York City]] parade is held every third Saturday in September (on the 17th in 2016, on the 16th in 2017, and on the 15th in 2018). It was founded in 1957 by immigrants from [[Germany]] who, being part of the largest self-reported immigrant ancestral group in the United States, wanted to keep the traditions of their German homeland alive.

The [[Philadelphia]] parade, founded in 1970, is normally held every fourth Saturday in September.

The [[Chicago]] parade was featured in the film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''.

===New York===
While Steuben Day is celebrated in many cities all across the [[United States]], the largest crowds gather in [[New York City]]. Every year on the third Saturday in September, [[German-Americans]] celebrate the Annual [[Steuben Parade]] on [[Fifth Avenue]] and an [[Oktoberfest]]-style beer fest complete with food and live music in [[Central Park]]. The Parade was founded in 1957 and has grown into one of the largest celebrations of German and German-American culture in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYCParade&gt;[http://www.germanparadenyc.org/ NYC Steuben Parade Site]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Parade was held on September 25.&lt;ref name=NYCParade/&gt; In 2007, German-Americans celebrated the 50th Anniversary of this affair and welcomed former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] as [[Grand Marshal]] and former German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] as Guest of Honor.

The first Steuben Parade was held in the German neighborhood of Ridgewood Queens. In 1958, the parade moved to Yorkville known then as Germantown, and lined up on 86th Street. Over the years, as the event grew bigger, it drew an ever-larger number of spectators. Soon it gained the City's recognition and marched up Fifth Avenue, turning on to 86th St, and marching all the way across  to First Avenue to cheering crowds.
86th Street was once the heart of Little Germany and was affectionately called the "German Boulevard" It hosted many German shops, Konditereis, Biergartens, Vereins, theaters, restaurants, newspapers, and dance halls.

Today, the parade still marches up Fifth Avenue but now ends only at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. It is led by cadets representing the German Language Club of the Military Academy of West Point, which was founded by General von Steuben.  The three-hour-long parade is dominated by traditional German groups, spectacular colorful floats, and marching bands, clubs and organizations from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as the USA and Canada, wearing their traditional German costumes. The parade honors one or more Grand Marshals, who are either American citizens with a German background or German citizens with a distinct relationship to America.

[[Image:2006-steuben-parade-merlins.jpg|thumb|left|A German [[Guggenmusik]] band performs at the Steuben Parade in New York]]Every year the German-American Steuben Parade is led by cadets representing the German Language Club of the Military Academy of [[West Point]], which was founded by General von Steuben. However, it is not a parade in the military tradition. The rest of the about three-hour-long parade is dominated by traditional German [[brass music]] groups and marching bands, by clubs and organization wearing traditional German [[Tracht]], as well as by carnival groups, marksmen or representatives of other traditions. For many years, the parade has had a strong Bavarian theme, dominated by men wearing [[Lederhosen]], women in [[Dirndl]] and groups dancing the traditional [[Schuhplattler]]. Recently though, the parade opened up to represent more German themes.

====Grand Marshal and Guest of Honor====
Every year, the German-American Steuben Parade is led by one or more Grand Marshals, who are either American citizens with a German background or German citizens with a distinct relationship to America.

The Grand Marshals in 2009 were Congressman [[Michael McMahon]], Fox 5 TV reporter Linda Schmidt, [[The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company|A&amp;P]] Chairman [[Christian Haub]], and Parade Co-founder Ted Dengler. In previous years, Grand Marshals included Hollywood star [[Ralf Möller]], [[NYSE]] CEO [[Duncan Niederauer]] and Col. [[Gail Halvorsen]], the "Candy-Bomber" from the 1948–49 [[Berlin Airlift]].

In 2007, celebrating the 50th Anniversary German-American Steuben Parade, the Grand Marshal was former US Secretary of State, [[Henry Kissinger]], who was born in the Franconia region of Bavaria in Germany. The Guest of Honor was Dr. Klaus Scharioth, the German Ambassador to the United States. Also invited was former German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], who is known to have a deep personal friendship towards America.

[[Image:Steubenparade2006nycvip.jpg|thumb|Parade VIPs: German Ambassador Dr. [[Klaus Scharioth]], the Mayor of [[Hamburg]], Germany, [[Ole von Beust]], Grand Marshal [[Carol Alt]], General Chairman Lars Halter, and Heinz Buck, President of the German-American Committee of Greater New York]]
Over the years the Steuben Parade has been led by many distinguished Germans and Americans. Former Grand Marshals include [[Donald Trump]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], [[George Steinbrenner]], [[Carol Alt]], [[Eric Braeden]], [[John Roland]], [[Louis Freeh]], [[Norbert Schramm]]. Several [[Mayors of New York City]] of non-German background have also led the parade, including [[Michael Bloomberg]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]], and [[George Pataki]].

Among the Guests of Honor have been three German presidents: [[Walter Scheel]], [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] and [[Johannes Rau]], as well as other dignitaries from the political and economic fields, including state prime ministers [[Erwin Teufel]], [[Kurt Biedenkopf]] and [[Bernhard Vogel (politician)|Bernhard Vogel]].

====Parade events====
While the German-American Steuben Parade itself is held on the third Saturday in September, starting at noon, there are other festivities all weekend. Usually, up to 35 music and costume groups from overseas are greeted at [[City Hall Park]] on the Friday preceding the parade. On the eve of the parade a gala benefit banquet takes place as a fundraiser for the parade. 

The parade itself leads directly to the German-American Friendship Party in [[Central Park]]. This is the largest [[beer]] fest in New York, featuring many German brands on tap, as well as traditional German food such as [[bratwurst]].

====Miss German-America====
Each May, the German-American Steuben Parade Committee crowns a Miss German-America, who serves as Queen of the Steuben Day Parade in September.  She is selected on the basis of her German-American heritage and her knowledge of German culture, and is expected to promote the parade and its events and numerous German festivals throughout the New York region each summer.  Past winners include: Nicole Radske&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news1.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date=2006-09-16 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809020808/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news1.html |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006), Christina Rom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news3.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809020636/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news3.html |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2007), Melissa Gratzl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news5.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date=2008-09-20 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809021009/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news5.html |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2008), Virginia Kovak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news16.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809020828/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news16.html |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2009), Stephanie Russell-Kraft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news26.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809020913/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news26.html |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010), Denise Manukian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://germanparadenyc.org/news43.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date=2011-09-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313102324/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news43.html |archivedate=2014-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), Kirsten Mueller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://germanparadenyc.org/news57.html |title=German-American Steuben Parade of New York |publisher=Germanparadenyc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055316/http://www.germanparadenyc.org/news57.html |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012), Kristina Kren (2013) Stefanie Kraker (2014) and Samantha Hart (2015).

====German-American Friendship Month====
September is host to many German and German-American cultural events aside from the parade. They range from a reading with German comedian [[Hape Kerkeling]], concerts in [[Carnegie Hall]] to Jazz performances by German musicians, from a pop-art event with Berlin and New York based artist [[Jim Avignon]] to a German [[cartoon]] exhibition. There are also events celebrating the historic aspect of German-American traditions, like a walking tour through [[Little Germany, New York|Little Germany]] ''Kleindeutschland'' on New York's [[Lower East Side]] or a tour through the Tenement Museum there.

====Logo====
[[Image:Steuben-Parade-Cornflower-logo.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The [[cornflower]] is the official flower and logo of the German-American Steuben Parade in New York]]The cornflower is the official flower and the logo of the German-American Steuben Parade of New York City, as it widely grows in both Germany and the United States. Also, the color blue symbolizes friendship and hope. In addition the Cornflower was the national Flower of Prussia since its introduction by Kaiser [[Wilhelm I]] to honor his mother Queen [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] and because of its color ([[prussian blue]])

====Organization====
The parade and all related events are organized by the German-American Steuben Parade Committee. Since 2014, the committee has been led by General Chairman [[Bob Radske]], and two Vice Chairmen, Nicole Miskiewicz, and Herb Seeff. The membership of the committee consists of representatives of a multitude of German-American organizations from the New York metropolitan area, some involved in the founding of the parade in 1957. The Steuben Parade is overseen by the German-American Committee of Greater New York, a non-for-profit organization registered in New York with 501(c)3 status.

===Philadelphia===
To celebrate the accomplishments of Baron von Steuben, the Philadelphia Von Steuben Day Parade is 50 miles from Valley Forge, where Steuben trained the Revolutionary Army. Philadelphia is where the Continental Congress met to sign the Declaration of Independence. It was also home to Benjamin Franklin, who was sent to France by the Continental Congress. It was during this trip that Franklin was introduced to von Steuben. 

In addition, in 1683 William Penn invited the thirteen German families from Krefeld to join his "Grand Experiment". They eventually settled and founded Germantown, now a section of Philadelphia. In 1983, a parade celebrated the 300th anniversary of the founding of Germantown. At that time, a group from Krefeld brought with them the Tri-Centennial Bike, a thirteen-seat bicycle, that has become a feature of our annual parade.

====Parade events====
While the German–American Steuben Parade itself is held on the fourth Saturday in September, starting at noon, there are other festivities all weekend. On the eve of the parade a gala benefit banquet is held at the Cannstatter Volksfest Verein.

On Parade day itself, the day begins with an Ecumenical Service at 10:00 am. After the parade, participants are welcome to join the [[Oktoberfest]] held by the Bavarian Volksfest Verein, on the grounds of the United German - Hungarian Club. 

====Organization====
The parade and all related events are organized by the Steuben Day Observance Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity. The association is currently led by General Chairman Thomas Markow, and two Vice Chairmen, Werner Fricker and James Schwartz. The membership of the association consists of representatives of a multitude of German-American organizations from the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Steuben Day Observance Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity is a non-for-profit organization registered in Pennsylvania with 501(c)3 status.

== Von Steuben Day in pop culture ==
The [[Chicago]] parade was in the 1986 [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] movie ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', even though other movie details indicate that Ferris Bueller's Day Off takes place near the end of the school year, not in September or on a Saturday.

Captain '''Walter George Raymond Hinchliffe''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DFC}} (10 June 1894 – 13 March 1928), also known as '''Hinch''' (the surname is often incorrectly given as '''Hinchcliffe''') was a distinguished [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and [[Royal Air Force]] [[flying ace]] in [[World War I]] who was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://users.accesscomm.ca/magnusfamily/ww1gb.htm |title=Great Britain - World War One  |first=Allan |last=Magnus |work=Air Aces Homepage |date=13 August 2001 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wwi-models.org/mail-archive/archive.cci/824 |title=CCI Digest 824 |work=The World War I Modeling Mailing List |year=2003 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 31"&gt;{{cite book |last=Franks |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Franks |title=Sopwith Camel Aces of World War I |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ke_Z2Dpea0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;sig=XMlWwXBYh8E56i17U68sjYm5VXM&amp;hl=en#PPA48,M1 |accessdate=23 March 2015 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-84176-534-1 |pages=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A pioneering military and civilian flying career was cut short when he attempted a treacherous flight across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with [[Elsie Mackay]]&lt;ref name="Hinch 10"&gt;{{cite journal |author=

==Private life==
Hinchliffe was born in [[Liverpool]] in 1894 to Richard George Hinchliffe (1868 - circa 1942) and Florence Williams. His younger sister Gladys was born in 1897 in Liverpool.&lt;ref name="Hinch 05"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/ENG-MERSEYSIDE/2007-12/1197195442 |title=RootsWeb: ENG-MERSEYSIDE-L : Richard George Hinchliffe |first=Ross &amp; Lynn |last=Humphreys |work=Ancestry.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Liverpool College]], where he was a member of the [[Officer Training Corps]],&lt;ref name=Gazette28602&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28602|page=2991|date=26 April 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; then attended [[medical school]], training as a [[dentist]]. He spoke four languages (including German&lt;ref name="Service Record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=8228412 |title=RAF officers' service records 1918–1919, Hinchcliffe, Walter George Raymond (sic) |work=DocumentsOnline |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |accessdate=17 February 2010 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was an avid reader, a skilled artist, an accomplished sportsman and a skilled mechanic. He met his Dutch wife Emilie Gallizien&lt;ref name="Hinch 24"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GENBRIT/2002-12/1039117675 |title=RootsWeb: GENBRIT-L Re: English pilot Hinchliffe |work=Ancestry.com |date=5 December 2002 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was Chief Pilot of the [[Royal Dutch Airlines]] (KLM) and she was assistant to the company's General Manager.&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;

His brother in law F. C. Lay was the first Pupil to become head master at the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]].

==Military career==
Hinchliffe was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the North Lancashire Brigade Company, [[West Lancashire]] Divisional Transport and Supply Column ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]) of the British [[Army Service Corps]] on 20 March 1912,&lt;ref name=Gazette28602 /&gt; and promoted [[First Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] on 17 September 1914. He is then believed to have served in the [[Royal Artillery]] from 1914–16 before joining the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] where he underwent training at [[Redcar]],&lt;ref name="Hinch 25"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23857 |title=Redcar RNAS Station |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cranwell]] and [[Frieston]].&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 41"&gt;{{cite book |title=Royal Aero Club Year Book  |chapter=Aviators Certificates |date=30 September 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaining his [[Royal Aero Club]] Certificate in September 1916 as Flight [[Sub-Lieutenant]], [[Royal Naval Air Service]], he served as an Instructor at Cranwell before joining [[No. 210 Squadron RAF|10 Squadron RNAS]] in January 1918 to commence active service. During February and March his successful sorties in a [[Sopwith Camel]] named ''Allo Lil Bird'' included [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]] and downing two enemy aircraft in [[dogfight]]s at [[Rumbeke]] and [[Roeselare|Roulers]].&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 41"/&gt;

When the [[Royal Air Force]] was formed on 1 April 1918, he was appointed Lieutenant ([[Honorary rank|Honorary Captain]]) RAF in the (renamed) No. 210 Squadron RAF.&lt;ref name="Hinch 31" /&gt; Within three months he had shot down a further five enemy aircraft, at [[Roeselare|Roulers]], [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]], [[Neuve-Église]], [[Armentières]] and [[Hazebrouck]]. During the Hazebrouck night encounter he was shot through the forehead and crashed at [[Nieppe]] Forest (Dickebusch Lake). He suffered severe facial injuries and lost the sight in his left eye for which he wore a patch for the rest of his life. For his exploits he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.&lt;ref name="Hinch 41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31098|supp=y|page=96|date=31 December 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred to the RAF unemployed list on 21 August 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31751|page=984|date=23 January 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially hospitalised on 23 June 1918 and then invalided home on 27 June and treated at a hospital in central [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref name="Service Record" /&gt;

==Post war==
After the War he became a widely experienced pilot, pioneering, opening and flying many civilian routes for both KLM and [[Imperial Airways]]. In 1920 he made the first airmail flight from the Netherlands to England.&lt;ref name="Hinch 11"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europeanairlines.no/klm-and-the-fokker-f-ii-and-f-iii/ |title=KLM and the Fokker F.II and F.III |first=Rob |last=Mulder |work=European Airlines |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he made the first civilian passenger night-flights from [[Lympne]] to [[Amsterdam]], and Amsterdam to [[Berlin]]. His new routes included Amsterdam-[[Gelsenkirchen]]-[[Dortmund]]-London-Amsterdam in 11 hours flying time and Berlin-Amsterdam-London-Lowestoft-Lympne in just over 12 hours flying time. During 1922-1923 he was Chief Pilot of KLM.&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinch 31" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Hinch 21"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dutch-aviation.nl/index5/Civil/index5-2%20F2.html |title=Fokker F.II |work=Dutch Aviation |year=2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 he joined [[Instone Air Line]] covering Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, London and Paris, and after the merger into [[Imperial Airways]] he flew a [[De Havilland Hercules]] to [[Cairo]] and opened up the Imperial Airways Eastern route.&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;

His flying experience included over 40 types of aircraft including; [[Avro]], [[British Aerial Transport]], [[Blériot Aéronautique|Bleriot]], [[Bristol F2b]], [[Caudron]], [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtis]], [[De Havilland]], [[Fokker]], [[Grahame-White]] Boxkite, [[Handley-Page]], [[Nieuport]], [[Noel Pemberton Billing|Pemberton-Billing]] Scout, [[Sopwith Camel]], [[Sopwith Dolphin]], [[Sopwith 1½ Strutter]], [[Sopwith Pup]], [[Vickers Vimy]] and [[Vickers Vulcan]].&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;

In September 1927, Hinchliffe flew [[Charles A. Levine]] back to the US, replacing [[Clarence Chamberlin]] who had flown Levine from the U.S. to Germany. Hinchliffe and Levine were filmed at the [[Clapham Studios]] in London for a short film made in the [[Lee DeForest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process before their departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/F/FarewellMessageOfMiste1927.html |title=Farewell Message of Mr. Levine and Captain Hinchcliffe — Just Before Their Departure on Their Return Flight to America |work=Silent Era : Progressive Silent Film List |year=2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490925/ |title=Farewell Message of Mr. Levine and Captain Hinchcliffe, Just Before Their Departure on Their Return Flight to America (1927) |work=IMDb |year=2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transatlantic Flight==
Hinchliffe's peerless reputation made him the natural choice for pilot when [[Elsie Mackay]] attempted to achieve her ambition to be the first woman to fly across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The daughter of [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P &amp; O]] chairman [[James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape]] had bought a [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson Detroiter]], and had it shipped from the USA to England and delivered to the [[Brooklands]] [[Auto racing|motor racing]] track, which at the time was also used as an airfield. Named ''Endeavour'', it was a [[monoplane]] with gold tipped wings and a black [[fuselage]], powered by a 9 cylinder, 300 h.p. [[Wright Whirlwind]] [[Wright Whirlwind#Variants|J-6-9 (R-975) engine]], with a cruising speed of 84&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt;

In early March 1928 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' discovered that Captain Hinchliffe and Elsie were preparing for a transatlantic attempt by carrying out test flights at [[RAF Cranwell]] and were staying at The George Hotel in [[Leadenham]].&lt;ref name="Hinch 07"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thegeorgeatleadenham.co.uk/aboutus.shtml |title=About Us : History |work=The George Hotel, Leadenham |year=2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Grantham]]. The story was silenced by Elsie's threatened legal action as she intended to depart in secret while her father was in [[Egypt]], having promised her family she would not make the attempt.&lt;ref name="Hinch 03"/&gt; The ''Irish Times'' reported on 14 March 1928 "Captain Hinchcliffe and Captain Joynson-Wreford were at [[Baldonnel Aerodrome]] about a fortnight ago, and, although no absolute definite arrangements were made, it was understood that he would make the aerodrome the headquarters for his Transatlantic attempt."

At 08:35am on 13 March 1928 ''Endeavour'' took off from [[RAF Cranwell]], Lincolnshire,&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt; with minimal fuss as Walter had told only two friends and Elsie had registered under the [[pseudonym]] of 'Gordon Sinclair'.&lt;ref name="Hinch 09"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ngb.chebucto.org/Newspaper-Obits/xxviii2.shtml |title=Excerpts from Newfoundland Posts and Telegraphs Daily News Journals |work=Old News of Newfoundland |year=2002 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately five hours later, at 13.30pm the Chief [[lighthouse keeper]] at [[Mizen Head]] on the south west coast of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] [[Ireland]] saw the monoplane over the village of [[Crookhaven]],&lt;ref name="Hinch 01"/&gt; on the [[great circle]] course for [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. A French steamer later reported seeing them still on course,&lt;ref name="Hinch 09"/&gt; but [[List of aerial disappearances|nothing else is known]]. A crowd of 5,000 is reputed to have waited at [[Mitchel Field]], [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name="Hinch 10"/&gt; In December 1928, eight months later, a single piece of identifiable undercarriage washed ashore in North West Ireland.&lt;ref name="Hinch 03"/&gt;

'''William T. Phillips''' (1863 &amp;ndash; 1937) was a [[Spokane, Washington]] author, best remembered for ''The Bandit Invincible'', a biography of the outlaw [[Butch Cassidy]]. A copy of the book is held at The American Heritage Center at the [[University of Wyoming]]. Phillips claimed to have known Cassidy since childhood, and states in his book that Butch Cassidy's real name was not Robert Parker. Some have speculated that Phillips ''was'' Butch Cassidy but there is no evidence to support the claim.

In 2012, Larry Pointer stated that the original, unabridged manuscript of ''The Bandit Invincible'' had been brought to him for authentication by a collector in Utah. In it he found previously unknown references to an associate of Butch Cassidy's by the name of William T. Wilcox, who was described as having been in Wyoming Territorial Prison with Butch Cassidy. Given the name's similarity with "William T. Phillips," he searched for a prison mugshot of Wilcox. Upon receiving it and observing the similarities between the two men, he revised his previous theory and concluded that Phillips was in fact Wilcox, instead of Butch Cassidy.
