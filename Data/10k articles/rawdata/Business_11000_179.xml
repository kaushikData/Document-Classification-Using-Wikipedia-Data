The '''''Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain''''' is a bronze fountain sculpture by [[Sidney Waugh]] as a memorial to [[Andrew W. Mellon]]. It is located in [[Washington D.C.]], [[United States]], just north of the [[National Gallery of Art]], at [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], [[Constitution Avenue]], and 6th Street NW.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=1993| title=Andrew W.

Truman]].&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Truman"&gt;{{cite web|author= |year= |title=Mellon Memorial Fountain Dedication |work=Truman Library Photographs |publisher=[[Harry S.

==Description==

The round [[fountain]] is made up of three small-to-large nested [[bronze]] basins, which sit in a [[granite]] outer basin. The outer, and largest, bronze basin is decorated in [[zodiac sign]]s which sit in their "correct [[astrological]] position for the sun's rays."  The small basin serves as the venue for a 20 foot&lt;ref name="Kempley"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sculpture Under the Sun |author=Rita Kempley |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=23 August 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tall water spouting jet. The water then proceeds to spill over the small basin and over the edge of the other basins, eventually over and into the granite basin. Surrounding the fountain is a seven foot wide granite walkway and a semi-circular granite [[bench (furniture)|bench]].&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

The inscription on the bench reads:

:1855.ANDREW W. MELLON.1937
:FINANCIER.INDUSTRIALIST.STATESMAN
:SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 1921-1932 AMBASSADOR TO GREAT BRITAIN 1932-1933
:FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 1937
:THIS FOUNTAIN IS A TRIBUTE FROM HIS FRIENDS&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

==Information==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''It sits like an island, traffic whizzing by on the three major arteries.''" - Gary Tischler&lt;ref name="Tischler"&gt;{{cite news |title=Water becomes art at area fountains; Visitors find visual appeal, relief from heat |author=Gary Tischler |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |date=22 June 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The fountain serves as a tribute to [[Andrew Mellon]] who served as [[Secretary of the Treasury]] from 1921–1932 and [[ambassador]] to [[Great Britain]] from 1932-1933. The fountain shares a [[Classical architecture]] style with&lt;ref name="Eyewitness"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benoliel|first=Alice L. |coauthors= |title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Washington, Part 3 |publisher=[[DK Publishing]] |year=2010 |month= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits close by to the [[National Gallery of Art]] where Mellon donated his art collection, as well as funding to build the art museum. This memorial fountain cost $300,000, which was donated by Mellon's friends through the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Committee. The fountain was dedicated on May 9, 1952&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Truman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard2"/&gt; and sits on the former site of the Saint James Hotel.&lt;ref name="Ovason"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ovason|first=David |coauthors= |title=The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]] |date=March 2002|isbn=0-06-095368-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===

Its creation was authorized by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on July 16, 1947 by the Joint Resolution 1701:&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

{{Quote box
 |quote  = ''Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,'' That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to grant authority to the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Committee to erect a memorial fountain on public grounds in the vicinity of the intersection of Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, in the District of Columbia, such grounds being now owned by the United States:
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
''Provided'', That the design and location of the memorial shall be approved by the National Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and the United States shall be put to no expense in or by the erection of this memorial: 
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
''Provided further'', That unless funds, which in the estimation of the Secretary of the Interior are sufficient to insure the completion of the memorial, are certified available, and the erection of this memorial begun within five years from and after the date of passage of this joint resolution, the authorization hereby granted is revoked.&lt;ref&gt; 80TH Congress, 1ST Session -Chapter 257 - July 16, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The fountain's cascading design was inspired by a fountain in [[Genoa]], Italy.&lt;ref name="Eyewitness"/&gt; Tuck and Eipel served as the [[structural engineers]] and Edward E. Ashley Associates were the [[mechanical engineers]]. While excavating for the fountain a 7&amp;nbsp;ft. x 8&amp;nbsp;ft. [[underground tunnel]] was discovered. The tunnel had to be backfilled with [[concrete]] to make a proper [[bearing capacity]] for the fountain. Two [[concentric]] rings of 30-ton concrete piles had to be driven down 30–40&amp;nbsp;ft. into the ground to ensure that the ground was level. The largest bronze basin was the largest of its kind ever cast at the time and required "casting in four sections" which had to be fitted together "with great precision." The fountain was cast by the General Bronze Company and Modern Art Factory may have cast the zodiac signs.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt; The [[pink granite]] used is from the Swenson Pink Granite Quarry in [[South Berwick, Maine]].&lt;ref name="Quarries"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Quarries in Maine &amp; Quarry Links, Photographs, and Articles (Continued) | publisher=Stone Quarries and Beyond | url=http://quarriesandbeyond.org/states/me/me-quarries_8.html | accessdate= 23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] zodiac faces directly east with the [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] symbol facing west and the [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] symbol arranged along Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to some believing that [[Masonic]] influences were essential in the architecture.&lt;ref name="Ovason"/&gt; On the [[vernal equinox]] the sun directly hits Aries, which then faces the rising sun a month later.&lt;ref name="Kempley"/&gt;

===Condition===

In 1993 the fountain was surveyed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program and was described as "well maintained."&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

'''Bonifacio Global City''' (also known as '''BGC''', '''Global City''', or '''The Fort''') is a financial and lifestyle district in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It is located {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}} south-east of the center of [[Manila]]. The district experienced commercial growth following the sale of military land by the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA). The entire district used to be the part of the main [[Philippine Army]] camp.

It is under the administration of the city government of [[Taguig]]. The local governments of [[Makati]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] also claims jurisdiction.

In February 7, 1995, Bonifacio Land Development Corporation (BLDC) started planning a major urban development—Bonifacio Global City. BLDC made a successful bid to become BCDA's partner in the development of the district. The [[Ayala Corporation]] through Ayala Land, Inc., and Evergreen Holdings, Inc. of the Campos Group purchased a controlling stake in BLDC from [[Metro Pacific]] in 2003. BCDA and the two companies now control Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation, which oversees the master planning of Bonifacio Global City.

==History==
{{main|Fort Bonifacio}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:FortMcKinley.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Philippine Scouts]] at Fort McKinley (called today Fort Bonifacio) firing a 37-mm antitank gun in training]]
During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]], the US government acquired a 25.78 square kilometre property within what was then disputed area between Makati, Taguig and Pateros for military purposes. This area (TCT dated 1902) was turned into a camp then known as [[Fort William McKinley]] after the 25th US president, [[William McKinley]]. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US bestowed to the Republic of the Philippines all rights of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of their military bases. On May 14, 1949, Fort McKinley was turned over to the [[Philippine government]] by virtue of US Embassy Note No. 0570.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/b-ph-ust000011-0178.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the AFP leadership of Gen. Alfonso Arellano, Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taguig.gov.ph/portal/contents/about_Taguig/barangays/west_rembo_r.html Barangay West Rembo Profile]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, [[Andres Bonifacio]], whose father, Santiago Bonifacio, was a native of Taguig (then part of the Province of Manila / Tondo).

On December 9, 1937 the Deed of Absolute sale executed by the owner, Don Anacleto Madrigal Acopiado in favor of the American Government covering the area of 100 hectares, portion of Bicutan, Taguig, annotated at the back of TCT No. 408. During the American Commonwealth, it was converted to a Military base, named Fort McKinley. It was during the presidency of the late President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]' administration when Fort McKinley was renamed Fort Bonifacio and transferred to Makati. Taguig got the jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio after winning the case against Makati in filed in the Pasig Regional Trial Court in 1993. Makati appealed the ruling, but the Pasig RTC in 2011 still sided with Taguig, saying that Fort Bonifacio including the -EMBO Baranggays are all part of Taguig. Makati then asked the Court of Appeals to review the case. The Court of Appeals overturned the Pasig Regional Trial Court's decision and reverted jurisdiction of the BGC in favor of Makati. As of date, Taguig has filed a Motion of Reconsideration at the Court of Appeals seeking to revert the decision. Status quo (meaning the latest ruling) remains with Makati. Taguig currently has de facto control over the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/320707/news/nation/rich-get-richer-makati-gains-while-taguig-loses-fort-boni-in-court-decision |author=Mark Merueñas|title=Rich get richer: Makati gains while Taguig loses Fort Boni in court decision |publisher=GMA News Online |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 7, 1995, Bonifacio Land Development Corporation, a consortium led by [[Metro Pacific]], made a successful bid to become BCDA's partner in the development of Bonifacio Global City (BGC), the Home of Passionate Minds. [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala Land, Inc.]] and Evergreen Holdings, Inc. of the Campos Group purchased a controlling stake in BLDC from Metro Pacific in 2003. BCDA and the two companies control Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation, which oversees the master planning of Bonifacio Global City. The Bonifacio Global City is a rich district with a high number of skyscrapers, even as the city is still rising. Many skyscrapers are under construction and will be built in future.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Fort Bonifacio dispute==
[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Contested territory between [[Makati]] and [[Taguig]] which includes Bonifacio Global City]]

The city governments of [[Makati]] and [[Taguig]] have recently fought over the jurisdiction of Fort Bonifacio because of the area's growth potential. A portion of the base, including the Libingan ng mga Bayani and the American Cemetery, lies within Taguig, while the northern portion where the Global City development is centered was considered part of Makati. A 2003 ruling by a judge in the Pasig Regional Trial Court upheld the jurisdiction of Taguig over the entirety of Fort Bonifacio, including the Bonifacio Global City and Pinagsama.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080132/http://elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20%2F%20Signed%20Resolutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd646f43d0ea63cd Supreme Court E-Library - G.R.

===Ruling===
The Supreme Court on June 27, 2008 per [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], dismissed the suit of the [[Makati]], seeking to nullify Special Patents 3595 and 3596 signed by [[Fidel Ramos]] conveying to the Bases Conversion and Development Authority public land in Fort Bonifacio, [[Taguig]] City. Due to a pending civil case filed by the Taguig City government asking the court to define its territorial boundaries, Makati cannot halt Taguig from collecting taxes on land located in Fort Bonifacio because it does not have any other sufficient source of sufficient income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police2_june30_2008 |title=Court junks Taguig’s suit to nullify Ramos patents|website=www.manilastandardtoday.com|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/june2008/163175.htm ''Pateros v Taguig'', G.R.

===Reclaim by Pateros===
The municipality of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], the only municipality in [[Metro Manila]] and located near Fort Bonifacio, claims that its original land area was not its present land area of 2.10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but 1,040 hectares (10.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) including Fort Bonifacio, particularly Barangays Comembo, Pembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Cembo, South Cembo and Pitogo which are now part of Makati City and Bonifacio Global City, Aranai, Ususan and Palar, Pinagsama which was made part of Taguig, based on documents and official maps obtained from some libraries and offices including USA Library of Congress and USA Archives. ("Susi ng Pateros Newsletter", 2000)

Pateros' decrease in territory was accounted to a cadastral mapping in Metro Manila conducted in 1978. The late Pateros Mayor Nestor Ponce challenged the map through an objection letter dated June 23, 1978. In January 1986, former President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 2475 which stated that Fort Bonifacio is in [[Makati]] and it's open for disposition. Because of that, a boundary dispute arose which moved Pateros to request a dialogue about that with then Municipal Council of [[Makati]] in 1990. Pateros also filed a complaint against Taguig at the Makati RTC in 1996 but the trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The case was moved to the Court of Appeals in 2003, but was denied. The same case was moved to the Supreme Court in 2009, and it was denied again.&lt;ref&gt;"Susi ng Pateros Newsletter", 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court Decision===
The Supreme Court, on June 16, 2009, per Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura denied Pateros’ petition against Taguig but ruled out that the boundary dispute should be settled amicably by their respective legislative bodies based on Section 118(d) of the Local Government Code.&lt;ref&gt;Panaligan, R. 2009, June 22. [http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/207737/sc-wants-ft-bonifacio-land-dispute-settled-amicably "SC wants Ft. Bonifacio land dispute settled amicably"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},
 {{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} mb.com.ph; accessed July 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the decision, Pateros invited Taguig to a council-to-council dialogue on October 8, 2009. Four meetings were held and at the fourth dialogue on November 23, 2009, a joint resolution was made stating that Taguig is requesting a tripartite conference between Pateros, [[Taguig]] and [[Makati]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Court of Appeals Decision===
On August 5, 2013, after just a year and a half, the 20-year-long battle was decided in a 37-page decision that was written by Justice Marlene Gonzales-Sison of the Court of Appeals. It says that jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio has reverted to Makati from Taguig. The Court upheld the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamations 2475 and 518, both of which confirmed that portions of the aforementioned military camps are under the jurisdiction of Makati. The decision also cited the fact that voters from the barangays that are subject of the dispute between Makati and Taguig have long been registered as voters of Makati, thus bolstering the former's jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio. However, Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano maintained that this decision was not yet final and executory, and asked Justice Gonzales-Sison to recuse from the case as it was discovered that her family has close ties with the Binays of Makati.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Status quo remains===
On August 22, 2013, the Taguig city government filed a Motion for Reconsideration before the Court of Appeals's Sixth Division affirming its claim on Fort Bonifacio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/taguig-reaffirms-claim-over-fort-bonifacio |title=Taguig City files a Motion for Reconsideration|website=www.taguig.gov.ph| accessdate= July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the filing of the said Motion for Reconsideration, Taguig's jurisdiction forces itself over Fort Bonifacio. According to Taguig's legal department, jurisprudence and the rules of procedure in the country's justice system all say that the filing of a motion for reconsideration suspends the execution of a decision and puts it in limbo.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Supreme Court's Second Decision===
On August 1, 2016, in a 27-page decision by the Second Division of the Supreme Court, the decision sought Makati government found guilty of direct contempt for abusing the legal processes over the jurisdiction of BGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Makati guilty of direct contempt over BGC row with Taguig|last=Torres-Tupas|first=Tetch|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801669/makati-guilty-of-direct-contempt-over-bgc-row-with-taguig|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=August 1, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decision, recognition of Taguig's jurisdiction===
On October 3, 2017, the Court of Appeals upheld its final decision in favor of the city government of Taguig and not Makati. The SC also sought Makati guilty of forum shopping after simultaneously appealing the Pasig RTC ruling and filing a petition before the CA, both seeking the same relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CA: Taguig owns BGC, not Makati|last=Ramos|first=Marlon|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/943180/ca-taguig-owns-bgc-not-makati|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=November 6, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It’s final: BGC belongs to Taguig|last=Punay|first=Edu|url=http://www.philstar.com/metro/2017/11/06/1756019/its-final-bgc-belongs-taguig|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=November 6, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines''''' is a 2000 book by Robert McIntosh, published by [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]. The book is about [[child labour]] in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with special reference to the history of boys, aged 8 to 15, who worked in [[coal mines]]. These boys worked underground, leading horses along subterranean roads, manipulating ventilation doors, helping miners cut and lift tons of coal, and filling wagons with freshly mined coal.&lt;ref name=boys&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/03/bookrevs.htm Book reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/0424 Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications, speeches, and awards==
Halligan's first book, ''Inbound Marketing,'' was co-authored with HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah. The thesis of the book is that because people now block marketing that interrupts them, such as advertisements and spam, companies need to instead provide information that is useful to prospects, who will then self-identify. Reviewing the book, Meryl Evans said that it contains "elementary stuff..." but it "does a good job for those who don’t have a clue about how to use social media for business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Daniel Lyons incidents==
In his book ''[[Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start Up Bubble]]'', which is sharply critical of HubSpot's management and culture, former HubSpot employee [[Daniel Lyons]] accused Halligan of age discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Primack, Dan (April 16, 2016) [http://fortune.com/2016/04/06/tech-workers-and-investors-should-read-disrupted/ "Why Tech Workers and Investors Should Read 'Disrupted."] Forbes. (Retrieved 8-16-2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] showed that certain Hubspot executives working under Halligan considered the book "a financial threat to HubSpot, its share price, and the company’s future potential." The FBI report discusses "tactics such as email hacking and extortion" in the attempt to prevent the book from being published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/03/23/documents-released-hubspot-probe-involving-author-dan-lyons/VZH4CN4kR5p7iyhsKEdwJI/story.html Extortion, hacking claims sparked HubSpot investigation, FBI records show], Boston Globe, 24 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halligan was forced to pay financial penalties by the HubSpot board of directors because he failed to promptly alert the board after he discovered that staff members at HubSpot behaved inappropriately. "There was definitely some fishiness. But I didn’t report it. That was my bad," Halligan said about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/07/29/hubspot-fires-marketing-chief-sanctions-ceo-over-incident-involving-book-about-the-company/ beta Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/disrupted-excerpt-hubspot-startup-dan-lyons/ My Year in Startup Hell], Dan Lyons in ''Fortune'', April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward2016"&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:Zhang Bishi.jpg|thumb|Cheong Fatt Tze]]

'''Cheong Fatt Tze'''  or '''Tjong Tjen Hsoen''' ({{zh|s=张弼士|zh|t=張弼士|p=Zhāng Bìshì}}; 1840 – 1916) was a Chinese businessman and politician. He was a powerful [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]] industrialist and a first-class [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] in the Manchu government; he was made Consul-General in Singapore and economic advisor to the Empress Dowager. 

==Early life==
He was born in 1840 in [[Dabu County|Dabu]], [[Guangdong Province]] in South [[China]]. 
As he came from a poor [[Hakka people|Hakka]] family, he started working at an early age as a cowherd back in his village. In 1856, [[Taiping Rebellion|civil war]] ravaged much of China, and in that same year another war had broken out between the [[Emperor of China]] and the [[England|English]], known as the [[Second Opium War]] (1856–1862). The people had experienced hardship and suffering during the war. As a result, Cheong Fatt Tze migrated to [[South-East Asia]] together with other coastal Chinese families to seek their fortune.

==Career==
He started as a water-carrier and then became a shopkeeper in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. 
After his marriage, he established a trading company with the help of his father-in-law. Gradually, he began to accumulate his wealth through hard work and perseverance. In 1877, he expanded his business from [[Jakarta]] to [[Medan]]. His business was based on [[agricultural]] products such as [[rubber]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]] but he branched out to the financial sector by acquiring a bank. This move made him a wealthy man.

In 1886, he expanded again to [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. As his business grew, he owned three ships which plied between Penang and Medan. In the course of his work, he occasionally resided in Penang and owned a [[Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion|mansion]] in Leith Street, which stands to this day as protected heritage building.

==Political career==
In 1890, in recognition of his hard work and contribution, he was appointed the Chinese Consul, based in Penang. This office was shifted to [[Singapore]] when that city became established as a well-known trading port in [[South-East Asia]]. As the Chinese Consul, he worked tirelessly for the interests of overseas Chinese residents through diplomatic channels with the [[British Empire|British]] authorities.

In 1899, he was summoned to China twice by the [[Emperor of China]] and instructed to present a national development plan, which was well received by the government of the [[Qing dynasty]]. As a result, he was promoted to be the Minister for agriculture, industries, roads and mines for the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. Later he was instructed to conduct a study of trade and education in Penang and Singapore. Subsequently, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce was established. In 1904, he established the first Chinese school in Southeast Asia, the [[Chung Hwa Confucian School]] in Penang.

In 1912, the [[Kuomintang]] overthrew the Qing and established a [[Republic of China (1912–49)|republican government]]. Cheong was appointed as a member of the Legislative Assembly so that he could be actively involved with politics. He was also appointed as the Chairman of the Chinese national Chamber of Commerce, which was well received by all parties.

In 1915, he was sent to the [[United States]] to study all aspects of industrialization of that nation. During his journey, when he stopped over in [[Hong Kong]], he was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Law]].

==Death==
Cheong Fatt Tze died in [[Indonesia]] in 1916. His body was sent back to China to be buried. On its final journey through Penang, Singapore and Hong Kong, the overseas Chinese were greatly saddened by the loss of this great personality. The Chinese government sent a high-ranking official to his funeral and ordered the National Archives to record his life in historical documents so that his contributions would always be remembered. Both the British and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] authorities ordered flags to be flown at half mast to honour the man who was known as ''"the [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] of the East"''. He had eight wives and owned many residences throughout his trading empire (mostly [[Southeast Asia]]) but made Penang his base, where he raised his six sons.

==Legacy==
In 1894, [[Chung Keng Quee]] hosted in his own gardens, in the name of Vice Consul Chang, Pi Shih (Cheong Fatt Tze), a dinner to welcome Admiral Ting (see Battle of Yalu River (1894) and Battle of Weihaiwei) and the Chinese Imperial Fleet of warships that he commanded.

Cheong  Fatt Tze  first  introduced grape vineyards in China's  Shandong  province, and later  brought in Austrian wine-producing experts to improve the vineyard in  Yantai, Shandong.
Cheong  Fatt Tze  also  gave  shelter  to Sun Yat  Sen and  Sun Yat  Sen 's  fourth  wife in  Penang, Cheong Fatt Tze  also  helped  Sun Yat  Sen  with Money  to  promote  a Chinese  Nationalist  movement in China  after 1911.

A street in George Town, Penang, which was formerly named Hong Kong Street, was renamed after him, Jalan Cheong Fatt Tze. His blue mansion, [[Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion]], is a heritage building, located at Leith Street in George Town. It is open for guided tours, and also offers accommodation and has an on-site restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/08/malaysia-cheong-fatt-tze-mansion.html|work=Minor Sights|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left another mansion in his birthplace, Dabu, Guangdong Province, China.

[[File:COIL1.gif|thumb|300px|How cryogenic grinding with a solenoid works]]

'''[[Cryogenics|Cyrogenic]] grinding''', also known as '''freezer milling''', '''freezer grinding''', and '''cryomilling''', is the act of cooling or chilling a material and then reducing it into a small particle size. For example, [[thermoplastic]]s are difficult to grind to small particle sizes at [[ambient temperature]]s because they soften, adhere in lumpy masses and clog screens. When chilled by dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen, the thermoplastics can be finely ground to powders suitable for electrostatic spraying and other powder processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://composite.about.com/library/glossary/c/bldef-c1386.htm Cryogenic Grinding&lt;/ref&gt; Cryogenic grinding of plant and animal tissue is a technique used by [[microbiologists]]. Samples that require extraction of [[nucleic acid]]s must be kept at −80 °C or lower during the entire extraction process. For samples that are soft or flexible at room temperature, cryogenic grinding may be the only viable technique for processing samples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retsch.com/dltmp/www/102499-8ba31387ae33/tr_elastic_plastics_pah_sm300_cryo_0709_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spexcsp.com/pdfs/application%20note%20sp%20008%20(fm%20polymers).pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907081627/http://www.spexcsp.com/pdfs/application%20note%20sp%20008%20%28fm%20polymers%29.pdf |date=2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of recent studies report on the processing and behavior of nanostructured materials via cryomilling.&lt;ref&gt;http://filer.funmat.no/FUNMAT_meeting_2006/FridayII_H2/9_deledda_0106.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freezer milling==
Freezer milling is a type of cryogenic [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] that uses a solenoid to mill samples. The solenoid moves the grinding media back and forth inside the vial, grinding the sample down to analytical fineness. This type of milling is especially useful in milling temperature sensitive samples, as samples are milled at [[liquid nitrogen]] temperatures. The idea behind using a solenoid is that the only "moving part" in the system is the grinding media inside the vial. The reason for this is that at liquid nitrogen temperatures (–196°C) any moving part will come under huge stress leading to potentially poor reliability. Cryogenic milling using a solenoid has been used for over 50 years and has been proved to be a very reliable method of processing temperature sensitive samples in the laboratory.

==Cryomilling==
Cryomilling is a variation of mechanical [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], in which metallic powders or other samples (e.g. temperature sensitive samples and samples with volatile components) are milled in a [[cryogen]] (usually [[liquid nitrogen]] or liquid argon) [[slurry]] or at a [[cryogenic]]s temperature under processing parameters, so a nanostructured microstructure is attained. Cryomilling takes advantage of both the cryogenic temperatures and conventional mechanical milling.&lt;ref&gt;''Suryanarayana C. Mechanical alloying and milling'', Progress in Materials Science 46 (2001) 1–184&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely low milling temperature suppresses recovery and recrystallization and leads to finer grain structures and more rapid grain refinement.&lt;ref&gt;''Suryanarayana C. Mechanical alloying and milling'', Progress in Materials Science 46 (2001) 1-184&lt;/ref&gt; The embrittlement of the sample makes even elastic and soft samples grindable. Tolerances less than 5&amp;nbsp;µm can be achieved. The ground material can be analyzed by a [[laboratory analyzer]].

==Applications in biology==
Cryogenic grinding (or "cryogrinding") is a method of cell disruption employed by molecular life scientists to obtain broken cell material with favorable properties for protein extraction and affinity capture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdir.org/public-resources/protocols/ General methods&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biotechniques.com/rapiddispatches/Improved-methodology-for-the-affinity-isolation-of-human-protein-complexes-expressed-at-near-endogenous-levels/biotechniques-330982.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331030021/http://www.biotechniques.com/rapiddispatches/Improved-methodology-for-the-affinity-isolation-of-human-protein-complexes-expressed-at-near-endogenous-levels/biotechniques-330982.html |date=2013-03-31 }} Application to human tissue culture&lt;/ref&gt; Once ground, the fine powder consisting of broken cells (or "grindate") can be stored for long periods at –80°C without obvious changes to biochemical properties – making it a very convenient source material in e.g. proteomic studies including affinity capture / mass spectrometry.

&lt;!--The photo has been pulled because it is not David Combe, See talk page--&gt;
'''David Combe''' (born 26 April 1943) was National Secretary of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), a political consultant and lobbyist, an Australian Trade Commissioner, a Senior Vice-President International of [[Southcorp Wines]], and a consultant to the Australian wine industry.

==Early life==
Harvey David Mathew Combe was born in 1943 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia, and was educated at [[Prince Alfred College]] and the [[University of Adelaide]], where he earned a BA.. He became interested in politics at university and joined the ALP, partly through his friendship with [[Don Dunstan]]. (He has been Patron of the Don Dunstan Foundation since 2004.)&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;{{rp|pp.230,240}}

==Career==
Combe was National Secretary of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (1973–1981), a political consultant and lobbyist (1981–1985), and an Australian senior trade commissioner (1985–1991), and has held senior executive and board positions within the Australian wine industry (1991–2008).

===Politics===
In 1973 Combe became the youngest-ever National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party after [[Australian federal election, 1972|the election of the first Labor government for 23 years]]. In November 1975, he was allegedly co-instigator, with [[Gough Whitlam]] and [[Bill Hartley (activist)|Bill Hartley]], of an unsuccessful approach to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq for a gift of 500,000 U.S. dollars to help in funding Labor's 1975 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, Tony ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/tony-parkinson/shame-whitlam-shame/2005/11/14/1131951094949.html Shame, Whitlam, Shame]'' The Age, 15 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Labor lost the [[Australian federal election, 1975|election]]. In an article published in ''The Bulletin'' in January 1982 Combe propagated the notion that Labor's defeat was partly due to the influence of the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt;{{rp|p.232}}

Combe remained National Secretary until July 1981, when he resigned to establish a lobbying business, David Combe and Associates Pty Ltd. It reportedly "received a great fillip in [[Australian federal election, 1983|March 1983]], when the Labor Party was re-elected to office. Business perceived Combe as the most influential lobbyist then working in Canberra."&lt;ref name=Blesing/&gt;{{rp|p.1}}

====Combe-Ivanov affair &lt;!--[[Combe-Ivanov affair]] redirects here--&gt;====
In 1983 Combe was accused of compromising Australia's national security in dealings with a Soviet diplomat, [[Valery Ivanov]].&lt;ref name=Blesing&gt;Blesing, Meena. ''Was Your Dad a Russian Spy? The Personal Story of the Combe/Ivanov Affair.'' Sun Books, 1986.&lt;br /&gt;The National Library of Australia [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2041882 catalogue entry] states: "by David Combe's wife, Meena Blesing".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milli&gt;Milliken R ''[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-harvey-barnett-1594211.html Harvey Barnett Obituary]'' The Independent, London, 1 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cain&gt;Cain, Frank ''The Australian Security Intelligence Organization: An Unofficial History'', Abingdon: Frank Cass &amp; Co Ltd 1994 {{ISBN|0-7146-3477-8}}.

Of particular relevance, Ch. 10: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pi80__UBKmEC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ASIO in the 1980s] pp223-252;&lt;br /&gt;

"The Third Man – Lawrence Matheson" pp228-230 and&lt;br /&gt; 
"The Rise and Fall of David Combe" pp230-234.&lt;br /&gt;
The rest of the chapter discusses "ASIO and the Combe-Ivanov affair" and "Justice Hope's Royal Commission".&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Combe-Ivanov affair developed out of a trip Combe and his wife made to the USSR in 1982, in the course of preparations for which they met and developed a relationship with Valery Ivanov, then the First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. Soon after the formation of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] government ASIO raised concerns that Combe, closely aligned to the ALP, might be being compromised by a Soviet citizen with KGB links. Ivanov was expelled from Australia in 1983 by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/12/world/around-the-world-australia-scandal-erupts-over-soviet-diplomat.html |title=''Australia Scandal Erupts Over Soviet Diplomat'' |date=12 May 1983 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly publicised events were investigated by the Hope Royal Commission on Australia's security and intelligence agencies of 1983–1984. The commission found that Combe had indeed been targeted by the Soviets, but there was no proof of intelligence breaches or of any threat to national security. &lt;ref name=Pryor&gt;Pryor, Geoff, [http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview/?pi=nla.pic-an23136639], National Library of Australia, retrieved 1 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade commissioner===

Combe was Australia's senior trade commissioner in Western Canada from 1985 to 1989, and in Hong Kong from 1990 to 1991.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

===Wine industry===

Combe was Senior Vice-President International and ran the European operations of Penfolds and Southcorp Wines during the rise in popularity of Australian wines in the 1990s. He is credited with developing significant export business for [[Southcorp Wines]], whose exports increased in value from 40 million Australian dollars in August 1991 to 300 million dollars in June 2000.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt; In 2000 Combe was named Australia's Top Export Salesman by ''Overseas Trading'' magazine and was included in the list of "Twenty Five Most Influential Australians in Asia" published by ''Business Asia'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claxtonspeakers.com.au/speakers_profile/60 Speaker's profile: David Combe], at Claxton Speakers (undated)&lt;/ref&gt; 

From March 2001 to November 2003 Combe was a non-executive director for  the Western Australian wine producer Evans and Tate Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Tate media release, 22 February 2001
[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/ReferencesView.aspx?PersonID=67226540 copy available here]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, in a speech at Bordeaux, he lambasted the wine-purchasing policies of UK supermarkets, which, he said, "if committed in Australia, would represent major breaches of the trade practices laws".&lt;ref&gt;Erhlich, R ''[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/my-round-state-of-independence-559243.html My Round: State of Independence]'' The Independent, London, 11 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2004 he was appointed Chairman of Simon Gilbert Wines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=1849970857&amp;page_url=%2f%2fwww.skalliandrein.com%2fwinevolution%2fspeaker_david_combe.php&amp;page_last_updated=4%2f4%2f2007+12%3a46%3a10+AM&amp;firstName=David&amp;lastName=Combe Speaker's Profile], David Combe, Chairman of Simon Gilbert Wines Limited, Australia.

Retrieved on 1 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired as a director and chairman in February 2007, "to take up another position within the wine industry".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gilbert Wines [http://www.coonawarravineyard.com.au/content/pdf/capt/archive/SGV%20Proposed%20Rights%20Issue%2014022007.pdf board statement], 14 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrait==
In 1983, [[Keith Looby]] painted Combe's portrait. The portrait was an unsuccessful entry in the [[Archibald Prize]] of 1983, and conspiracy theories on this matter abound. David Combe said in 1998 that there was 'circumstantially a good case to believe that some trustees were heavied by the Party' into rejecting the work.&lt;ref name=npg&gt;[http://www.portrait.gov.au/site/collection_info.php?searchtype=advanced&amp;searchstring=:::::1:&amp;irn=28 David Combe and the portrait], National Portrait Gallery, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt; In 1998, Combe donated his portrait to the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Canberra, "through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program".&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

[[File:-Possible Productions knotwork- by Steve Ball.svg|right|thumb|alt=A knotwork, a design often associated with Celtic knots. The outer design is a circle, surrounding what appears to be a triangle surrounded by a Celtic knot at first glance. Closer inspection of the triangle reveals that it is in fact an organic part of the inner knot, which seems to have two continuous segments linked by knots. At first glance, the knotwork appears to be symmetric; closer inspection reveals that the right-hand knots seem to be the reverse of the left-hand knots and there are small differences among the "twin knots"; the right and left hands of the design have variations, much as our right and left hands have subtle distinctions.

'''Discipline Global Mobile''' ('''DGM''', or '''Discipline&amp;nbsp;GM''') is an [[independent record label]] founded in 1992 by [[Robert Fripp]] (best known as guitarist and main composer for the band [[King Crimson]]) and producer/online content developer [[David Singleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Wire|date=Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGM has released solo music by Fripp as well as work by various affiliated musicians and bands including King Crimson, The Vicar, the [[California Guitar Trio]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=About DGMLive|title=Statement at foot of homepage|url=http://www.dgmlive.com/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label has offices in [[Salisbury]], [[England]], and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

DGM has aimed to be "a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed," according to Fripp.&lt;ref name="FrippInBruns"&gt;{{harvtxt|Fripp|1998|p=9}} according to {{harvtxt|Bruns|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its policy is that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM's corporate logo is owned by its designer.&lt;ref name="Fripp98a"/&gt; The label was an early adopter of the digital download system. DGM's aims have been hailed as "exemplary", and the label has been credited with having expanded "the possibilities of experimental music" and having improved the environment for King Crimson.&lt;ref name="Martin269"/&gt;

The DGM label name is derived from the title of a 1981 King Crimson album (''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'') and from the name of Singleton’s previous recording business (The Mobile). The label logo also partly reflects the artwork for the ''Discipline'' album (featuring a new but similar knotwork commissioned from the artist Steve Ball).&lt;ref&gt;Discipline Global Mobile - Ball Diary 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and business aims==

[[File:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp ergonomically plays electric&amp;nbsp;guitar while sitting in a posture developed through years of application of the Alexander Technique.|The founder of Discipline Global Mobile, [[Robert Fripp]] has called music "an industry founded  on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed".&lt;ref name="FrippInBruns"/&gt;]]

Having been a professional musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), by the late 1980s [[Robert Fripp]] found himself in conflict with his longtime record label [[E.G.&amp;nbsp;Records]] and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer [[David Singleton]], initially on a [[Guitar Craft]] tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' ''Show of Hands'' and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-[[Toyah Willcox|Toyah]]-fronted group [[Sunday All Over the World]]. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's ''Frame by Frame'' and 1992's ''The Great Deceiver'') and continues to the present day under the name of TonProb.

After seven years, Fripp and E.G. reached a settlement&lt;ref name="Bambarger86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvtxt|Bruford|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=sv&amp;id=R4iW0tsxLqQC&amp;dq=Bill+Bruford&amp;q=EG%2C%20Virgin%2C%20EMI%2C%20Fripp&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=EG%2C%20Virgin%2C%20EMI%2C%20Fripp&amp;f=false  142]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but the experience left Fripp determined to take control of his own work and financial affairs wherever possible. As part of this aim, he founded Discipline&amp;nbsp;Global&amp;nbsp;Mobile (DGM) as an independent music&amp;nbsp;label in 1992, as a fifty-fifty partnership with Singleton.&lt;ref name="FT2012"&gt;{{cite news|date=3 August 2012|time=7:27 pm|title=The day the music died: In a rare interview, prog&amp;nbsp;rock legend Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp speaks about standing up to the music industry|first=Ludovic|last=Hunter-Tilney|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f588e100-d7ee-11e1-9980-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22cThb6xb|newspaper=The Financial Times|ref=harv|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bambarger"&gt;,

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The phrasing "Aims" (c.f.,"THE AIM" of a man with a plan) is characteristically Frippian, and so is used rather than "goals". --&gt;
DGM's [[mission statement]] consists of five "DGM business&amp;nbsp;aims", as follows:
* "The first aim of DGM is to help bring music into the world which would otherwise be unlikely to do so, or under conditions prejudicial to the music and / or musicians.",&lt;ref name="DGMAims"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgmlive.com/about.htm |title=About DGM: DGM business aims |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |ref=harv |access-date=25 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302061103/http://www.dgmlive.com/about.htm |archive-date=2 March 2012 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The second aim of DGM is to operate in the market place, while being free of the values of the market place."
* "The third aim of DGM is to help the artists and staff of DGM achieve what they wish for themselves."
* "The fourth aim of DGM is to find its audience."
* "The fifth aim of DGM is to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed."&lt;ref name="FrippInBruns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bambarger86" &gt;{{harvtxt|Bambarger|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGMAims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atton04"&gt;{{harvtxt|Atton|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fZa_x8DEP_oC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Discipline+Global+Mobile%22&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Discipline%20Global%20Mobile%22%2C%20copyright&amp;f=false Chapter&amp;nbsp;6 "Fan culture and the Internet: Musicians and fanzines", p.&amp;nbsp;153]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Paul Jones - 2010.jpg|left|thumb|alt=John Paul Jones plays bass guitar|Formerly the bass guitarist of Led Zeppelin, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John&amp;nbsp;Paul Jones]] has recorded albums with DGM without signing a contract, stating that the relationship "is pure trust".&lt;ref name="Shepherd"/&gt;]]
These aims were called "exemplary" by Bill Martin, who wrote that "Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music" in creating DGM, and that DGM "has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for" King Crimson.&lt;ref name="Martin269"&gt;{{harvtxt|Martin|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&amp;dq=Prog+Rock&amp;q=Discipline+Global+Mobile#v=snippet&amp;q=Discipline%20Global%20Mobile&amp;f=false 269]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least the early 1960s, the recording industry has required artists to sign&amp;nbsp;over [[copyright]]s and [[moral right (copyright)|moral right]]s to their cover&amp;nbsp;art, music, and lyrics. DGM rejects this practice, and since its 1992 founding has maintained its policy that its artists retain the copyrights and the moral&amp;nbsp;rights to their works,&lt;ref name="Bambarger86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atton04"/&gt; be those works musical or visual art.&lt;ref name="Atton01"/&gt;  Fripp wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The phonographic copyright in these performances is operated by Discipline Global Mobile on behalf of the artists, with whom it resides, contrary to common practice in the record industry. Discipline accepts no reason for artists to assign the copyright interests in their work to either record company or management by virtue of a 'common practice' which was always questionable, often improper, and is now indefensible."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kozar|2012|loc=[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/150412-robert-fripp-an-appreciation/P1 "Fripp's aim was to move his music in new directions that others did not always understand", p.&amp;nbsp;2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mail-order and on-line services==

According to a 1998 profile in ''Billboard'' magazine, Discipline Global Mobile had seven staff members in Salisbury, England, and three in Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt; DGM "is actually housed in a dull pebbledash building in a village near Salisbury, south-west England".&lt;ref name="FT2012"/&gt;

Its label&amp;nbsp;manager reported that the country with the largest market was Japan, where mail-orders accounted for only&amp;nbsp;10% of sales, but&amp;nbsp;50% of profits. In 1998, DGM was distributed in Japan by [[Pony Canyon]]; in the United Kingdom by [[Pinnacle Records|Pinnacle]];&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt;  and in the United States by [[Rykodisc]].&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spellman"/&gt; Sound samples have been offered in addition to DGM's mail-order services.&lt;ref name="Bambarger"/&gt; Free downloads from DGM have strengthened the relations between artists and fans.&lt;ref name="Atton04"/&gt;

In 2012, DGM's site had the following introduction: "The aim of DGM is to connect music, musician and audience in  a way that supports the power of music, the integrity of the musician  and the needs of the audience. DGM&amp;nbsp;Live offers music  for download with photographs, diary&amp;nbsp;archives and audience&amp;nbsp;commentary for browsing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmlive.com|title=Welcome to DGM&amp;nbsp;Live|publisher=Discipline Global Mobile|ref=harv|accessdate=25 March 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; DGM's successful transition to an age of digital distribution was called "unique" among music labels in 2009; this success was credited to its provision of legal, high-quality recordings of concerts, which effectively [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the [[Fence (criminal)|distribution-networks]] for [[Bootleg recording|unlicensed&amp;nbsp;recordings ("bootlegs")]] of concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|first=''Belfast Telegraph''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20648653.html|title=Jam and the joys of music&amp;nbsp;distribution in today's world|newspaper=Belfast&amp;nbsp;Telegraph|publisher=Independent News and Media PLC|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012|ref=harv|id={{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DGM publishes on-line diaries by Robert&amp;nbsp;Fripp, David Singleton and The Vicar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DGM Diaries|url=http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, the diaries and the fan&amp;nbsp;forum display delayed&amp;nbsp;dialogs in which the artists and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings. Fripp's public writing of his diary has challenged his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Atton|2001|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Grooveshark===

Fripp's diaries were internationally discussed following his publication of documents from a dispute with [[Grooveshark]], an on-line distributor of music. Fripp and Singleton complained that Grooveshark had been continuing to distribute his music, even after repeated [[notice and take down|takedown notice]]s and other complaints.

Fashion Revolution campaigns for systemic reform of the [[fashion]] industry with a focus on the need for greater [[Transparency (trade)|transparency]] in the fashion [[supply chain]].  Fashion Revolution has designated the anniversary of the [[Rana Plaza]] disaster in [[Bangladesh]] as Fashion Revolution Day. In 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 millions of people around the world called on brands to answer the question Who Made My Clothes? The [[hashtag]] #whomademyclothes became the no.1 global trend on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Muzaffar |first=Zareen |date=27 April 2015 |title=2 Years Later, Bangladesh's Rana Plaza Debacle Continues to Resonate Globally |url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/2-years-later-bangladeshs-rana-plaza-debacle-continues-to-resonate-globally/ |magazine=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dearden |first=Lizzie |date=24 April 2015 |title=Fashion Revolution Day: #whomademyclothes campaign remembers Rana Plaza disaster |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/fashion-revolution-day-whomademyclothes-campaign-remembers-rana-plaza-disaster-10201871.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ayre  |first=Josie |date=24 April 2015 |title=It's Fashion Revolution Day!

==History==
Fashion Revolution was created in 2013 in response to the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh by [[Carry Somers]] and Orsola de Castro.  Somers and De Castro had worked as [[fashion designers]] in the UK for over two decades and saw that the factory collapse could act as a catalyst for change in the industry.

==Fashion Revolution Day / Fashion Revolution Week==
Fashion Revolution Day takes place annually on 24 April, the anniversary of the [[2013 Savar building collapse|2013 Rana Plaza building collapse]] when 1133 died and over 2500 were injured.  In 2016, it expanded into Fashion Revolution Week.

The first Fashion Revolution Day took place on 24 April 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''Gross Enrollment Ratio''' ('''GER''') or '''Gross Enrollment Index''' ('''GEI''') is a [[statistics|statistical measure]] used in the [[education]] sector, and formerly by the [[UN]] in its [[Education Index]], to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), describes ‘Gross Enrolment Ratio’ as the total enrolment within a country ‘in a specific level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group corresponding to this level of education.’&lt;ref&gt;Official UN definition for GER&lt;/ref&gt;

The GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group. For instance, the GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates. This allows the total enrollment to exceed the population that corresponds to that level of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114955-how-can-gross-school-enrollment-ratios-be-over-100|title=How can gross school enrollment ratios be over 100 percent? – World Bank Data Help Desk|website=datahelpdesk.worldbank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN Human Development Index use==

A combined gross enrolment ratio (CGER), incorporating all three levels of education, was used to calculate the [[Human Development Index|Human Development Index (HDI)]], an annual [[measuring well-being|gauge of well-being]] for [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations member states|member states]], from 1990 to 2009. Amongst  other measures used in the calculation, the CGER was given one-third weight in assessing the [[knowledge]] component, represented by gross enrolment, while the adult [[literacy]] rate was given two-thirds weight.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/Techinical_notes.pdf page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Genta was born in Geneva to a Swiss mother and father of [[Piemonte]] (Northern Italian) descent. At age 20, Genta finished jewelry and [[goldsmith]] training in his native Switzerland, earning a Swiss federal diploma.

Subsequently, Genta was recruited by [[Universal Genève]] SA, at the time one of the most recognized manufactures in both the U.S. and Europe for its chronograph models. After Universal Genève settled a patent dispute involving the micro-rotor caliber, Genta designed Universal's [[Universal Genève#1950s-1960s: Microtor automatics|Polerouter Microtors]] in the 1950s, as well as the Golden and White Shadows during the mid-1960s. The Shadows contained a micro-rotor, [[Unisonic Products Corporation|unisonic]] and [[accutron]] movement, the latter two a result of the [[quartz crisis]] starting in the late 1960s.

Genta's work with Universal would be a precursor to future collaborations with other brands in Switzerland and throughout Europe, including Omega's ''Constellation'' (1959); [[Patek Philippe]]'s ''Golden Ellipse'' (1968). [[Audemars Piguet]]'s ''Royal Oak'' (1970), [[International Watch Company|IWC]]'s ''Ingenieur'' (1976); Patek Philippe's ''Nautilus'' (1976); and [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]]'s ''Pasha de Cartier'' (1985)

After starting his own brand in 1969, Genta would create the [[sonnerie]]s, among them the Gérald Genta ''Octo Granda Sonnerie Tourbillion'', which contained four [[gong]]s and an emulated [[Westminster Quarters]] bell ring at each quarter and on the hour, "the same melody rung out by London's Big Ben", and priced at $810,200.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Forster, "For whom the bell tolls; For thee if you wear a minute repeater, the most complicated watch there is", p. 101 December 2009 ''Forbes Life''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he designed the ''Grande Sonnerie Retro'', the world's most complicated wristwatch, and priced at approximately $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the 1980s, Genta obtained special licensing with [[The Walt Disney Company]] and distributed a limited edition of Disney character watches to the public; previously, they had been an unofficial private request by one of Genta's repeat customers. The dials consisted of illustrations of [[Mickey Mouse]], Minnie Mouse, [[Donald Duck]], Scrooge and Goofy, with cases made of [[18 carat]] gold. Designed in [[Le Brassus]], Switzerland, the watches retailed between $3250–$3650 in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Gerald Genta's clients have included professional athletes, business executives, rock musicians, [[rappers]], movie stars, politicians as well as royalty, including [[Prince Rainier of Monaco]], King [[Hassan II of Morocco]], King [[Juan Carlos]] and Queen [[Sofia of Spain]], King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watchtime.at/archive/wt_2006_06/WT_2006_06_134.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2013|title=The Genta Touch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his eponymous company was acquired by [[Bulgari]] in 1999, Genta resigned and created a new venture called ''Gerald Charles''. As of 2010, Gerald Genta watches were marketed solely under the Bulgari brand. As Bulgari had been acquired by upscale French conglomerate [[LVMH]] in 2011, all "Gerald Genta" brand watches would in effect be products of the LVMH portfolio.

Genta died in August 2011 at age 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audemarspiguet.com/manufacture/news/tribute-to-gerald-genta-98/|accessdate=28 August 2011|title=Tribute to Gérald Genta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910090905/http://www.audemarspiguet.com/manufacture/news/tribute-to-gerald-genta-98/|archivedate=10 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Wallace "Jay Boy" Adams''' (born December 8, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist from [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], known particularly for storytelling in his songs.

==Early years==
Adams was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] but reared in [[Colorado City, Texas|Colorado City]], the seat of [[Mitchell County, Texas|Mitchell County]] south of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]] in [[West Texas]], where his father was the local [[Chevrolet]] dealer and a rancher.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayboyadams.com/page2.htm|title=Jay Boy Adams biography|publisher=jayboyadams.com|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation in 1967 from [[Colorado Independent School District|Colorado City High School]], he entered the [[University of North Texas]] at [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], then North Texas State University, which is known for its arts and music curricula. There one of his English classmates was [[Don Henley]], later with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Adams also met [[Gary Nicholson (singer)|Gary Nicholson]] while at NTSU.  Adams went to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], to hear the guitarist [[Bugs Henderson]], who played an impact on Adams's musical development.  He fondly credits the late nights spent listening to Henderson for the neglect of his college studies.&lt;ref name=jba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetwaterreporter.com/content/jay-boy-adams-perform-texas-theatre|title=Jay Boy Adams to perform at Texas Theater|publisher=''Sweetwater Reporter'', March 5, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With hopes of a musical career of his own, Adams left UNT after two years and moved to Houston.  There he met John Carrick whose mother was the owner of Sand Mountain Coffee House.  His first solo performing was at Sand Mountain along with Carrick, Bobbie Jo Gentry, Jerry Jeff Walker and others.  Adams and Carrick formed "Hayseed" a short lived band experimenting with original songs and then performing in and around [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and at Alan's Landing.  Once there, Adams met the guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]] of The Moving Sidewalks, and played at The Cellar.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt; In late 1969 he moved to [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] where he joined the house band at The Chateau Club led by [[Johnny Heartsman]]. Adams credited Heartsman as a major influence.  He attended [[Howard College]], a [[community college]] in [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]], Texas, with the goal of improving his grade-point average so that he could re-enter a university. Meanwhile, he lost his draft deferment during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=intv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualubbock.com/intJayBoyAdams.html|title=Interview: Jay Boy Adams|publisher=virtuallubbock.com|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1972, [[Steve Moss]], a friend secured Adams a spot with the [[ZZ Top]] band in Lubbock. That summer he gained entry to [[Texas Tech University]] in Lubbock to study music and English. ZZ Top's  manager, [[Bill Ham]], soon invited Adams to play for the band at the Municipal Auditorium in Dallas. By 1976, Adams had signed with [[Atlantic Records]], which in 1977 released his first music. After two albums Atlantic did not renew his contract.  Late 1980 manager [[Bill Ham]] sent Adams to Capricorn Records in Macon, GA to record.  His last recordings were done there with Paul Hornsby producing.  Early 1981 before the album was completed Capricorn Records filed bandruptsy.  Probably his best unfinished work to date was locked away in the legal vault.  He and his band continued to perform and tour but by 1982 Adams had had enough and withdrew from the music scene.  Adams is known for his ability for storytelling in song, a mixture of blues, [[rock and roll]], [[Country music|country]], and folk music.  In those years, Adams often spent more than half of the year in concert tours.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt; He performed not only with ZZ Top, but the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Joe Cocker]], and many others. In the Cocker band for a time was a saxophone player, [[Bobby Keys]], originally from [[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] in [[Lubbock County, Texas|Lubbock County]], who began touring with many bands as a young teenager. Keys and Adams had not previously met but toured together for a time with Cocker.&lt;ref name=intv/&gt;  It had been years since Bobby Keys had seen Lubbock.  Adams  invited Keys to return and play with his band at the first Joe Ely Tornado Jam.

==Later career==
By 1982, faced with mounting family obligations, Adams left the music business and avoided music clubs and concerts for most of the following  fifteen years. Instead, he operated and still maintains the company, Roadhouse Transportation, which leases touring coaches to such celebrity singers as [[Celine Dion]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] and even the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. He did for a time make a few annual musical appearances in Lubbock and in 1986 played there at the Cattle Baron’s Ball with [[Reba McEntire]]. He moved his family to a ranch in the [[Texas Hill Country]] and his business to the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]] in [[Kendall County, Texas|Kendall County]], part of the [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. One evening Adams and his wife, Mary F. Adams, attended a show in San Antonio to hear the musician [[Lee Roy Parnell]], who invited Adams to join him on stage. Thereafter, Adams's desire to perform in public was rekindled and became irresistible.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt;

In 1999, Adams joined George Strait's national tour. He toured Europe with the [[Tejano]] group, the [[Texas Tornados]]. He became the co-manager of the popular singer [[Pat Green]], whom Adams met when Green came looking for touring accommodations. By 2007, Adams released the album "The Shoe Box", which reached No. 5 on the Americana chart. The album offers ten new Adams selections and three from the late 1970s. "The Shoe Box" produced three top 10 single songs the Texas Music Chart, where it was posted for some two years. Singer [[Stephen Stills]], an avid listener of "The Shoe Box," declared Adams "a great musician and a storyteller in the true Texas tradition" and invited him to join Stills' national tour.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt;

In 2005, Adams was featured on [[Bob Phillips]]'s ''[[Texas Country Reporter]]'' [[Television syndication|syndicated]] television [[anthology]] [[television series|series]], with an explanation for his return to professional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texascountryreporter.com/show05.htm |title=Jay Boy Adams |publisher=texascountryreporter.com, May 28, 2005 |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323074921/http://www.texascountryreporter.com/show05.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2011, Adams performed in concert at the landmark Texas Theater in [[Sweetwater, Texas|Sweetwater]] in [[Nolan County, Texas|Nolan County]], near his hometown of Colorado City. It was the first concert in some seventy years at that facility, which had originally been designed for musical programs but converted to films after its opening.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt;

The current lineup of Adams' band, The Roadhouse Scholars, include Sam Hendricks on Hammond B3 and piano, Mark Butzirus on drums, and Ronnie Leatherman on bass guitar.  It is commonplace to see other musicians join Adams on stage.  Currently Adams splits his time between Texas and Santa Fe, New Mexico, and plays regularly when in Santa Fe with a host of local and transplanted musicians from various parts of the USA.  He is frequently seen performing in most of the popular night spots in Santa Fe that include El Farol, Evangelo's, and The Cowgirl.

[[Image:Colorado City, TX, Opera House IMG_4536.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Opera House in [[Colorado City, Texas|Colorado City]], [[Texas]], where Adams has occasionally performed in the community where he was reared]]

Adams is an artist through [[Wounded Bird Records]]. He has recently joined forces with other musical veterans in the rock group, Brothers of the Southland which include key members from southern rock pioneers The Outlaws, The Allman Brothers Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, The Black Crowes, and new comer Bo Bice.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Though his touring coach business is based in Kendall County (San Antonio), Adams kept Lubbock as his musical home. "Lubbock is the capital of West Texas. There has been so much talent come out of there, and really . . . none of it has been very commercial. [[Buddy Holly]] wasn't commercial when he [first] came out of there."&lt;ref name=intv/&gt; Among those to whom Adams was referring was [[Don Allison]], an area musician associated with various genres of music and a long-time producer at the [[Cactus Theater]] in Lubbock, where Adams has also frequently performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/entertainment/2011-05-25/lubbock-musician-don-allison-loses-battle-cancer-age-49?v=1306287180|title=William Kerns, Lubbock musician Don Allison loses battle with cancer at age 49: Musician Don Allison lost four-year battle with cancer and died Tuesday", May 25, 2011|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bagot'''  J.P. (10 January 1849 – 29 August 1910) was a businessman and politician in the colony of South Australia.

John Bagot was born the second son of Christopher Michael Bagot (1817 – 8 November 1853) and Margaret Elizabeth Bagot, née Watts (ca.1823 – 6 November 1910) at his father's property "Koonunga", near [[Kapunda, South Australia]]. His mother was  a daughter of Capt. John Watts (of the 73rd Regiment), who was at one time Adelaide's Postmaster-General. His grandfather, who selected the property, was Capt. [[Charles Hervey Bagot]], of the 59th Regiment, who arrived in South Australia on the ''Birman'' in December 1840. It was on this same property that copper was discovered by Captain Bagot's youngest son Charles Samuel Bagot, which incorporated with the [[F. S. Dutton]]'s adjoining property "Anlaby", became Australia's first copper mine.

John Bagot was educated at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide|St. Peter's College]], then for several years worked for the National Bank of Australasia. In the 1870s he and his brother C. M. Bagot (1852–1899) took up the Peake Cattle Run, between Warrina and Lake Eyre, which they continued to run until around 1900. He also owned the "Springbank" property near Burra for a few years. For a long period he was a director of Bagot, Shakes, &amp; Lewis, Limited, Broken Hill Pty., the National Bank, the South Australian Brewing Company, the Alliance Assurance Company, and the [[South Australian Mining Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article164706051 |title=Obituary |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |location=Adelaide |date=3 September 1910 |accessdate=28 August 2015 |page=39 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was represented the seat of [[Electoral district of Victoria|Victoria]] in the [[South Australian House of Assembly]] from April 1884 to April 1887.

He married Lucy Josephine Ayers (ca.1857 – 11 May 1945), a daughter of [[Henry Ayers|Sir Henry Ayers]], on 24 September 1878. [[Walter Bagot (architect)|Walter Hervey Bagot]] (17 March 1880 – 27 February 1889), a noted architect, and founding partner in [[Woods Bagot|Woods and Bagot]] was the only child to survive to adulthood. They lived at Buxton Street, North Adelaide, later Park Terrace, Fitzroy until 1901, then "Forest Lodge", 19 Pine Street, [[Stirling, South Australia|Stirling]], where John established a fine garden. His library included a valuable collection of Australiana. For several years prior to his death Mr. Bagot was an invalid, and was obliged to retire altogether from public life, living on Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide, where he died.

==Recognition==
His widow endowed a prize for botany at the [[University of Adelaide]] in his name from 1912.&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/162342676?sortby=dateDesc&amp;q=%22of+John+Bagot%22&amp;c=picture&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Treasure''' (20 June 1924 – 9 February 2004) was a leading figure in the British advertising industry in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. He was chairman of [[J. Walter Thompson|J Walter Thompson]] in the UK while it was the country's number one agency, and then vice chairman of [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] when it in turn held the number one position; he was also Dean of [[Cass Business School|City University Business School]] and Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Marketors]]. He was a potent proponent of the economic and social value of his industry, and became known as "Mr Advertising."

== Early life and rise in BMRB and JWT ==
John Albert Penberthy Treasure was born at [[Usk]], in [[Monmouthshire]], on 20 June 1924. The son of a bank clerk, he was brought up in [[Cardiff]], where he was educated at the High School, and went on to take first-class honours in economics at University College, then part of the [[University of Wales]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; In 1947 he won a Kemsley Fellowship to spend two years in America. He returned to teach and read for a doctorate at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]; his thesis, ''On problems of the British export trade'', later had some influence on the reporting of balance of payments figures. Meanwhile, he made ends meet by offering guided tours of Cambridge's colleges which earned him £5 a day.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; He met and married Valerie Bell during this period, and to finance his PhD studies, in 1952 he joined the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB). By 1957, he was BMRB's managing director; by 1960, director of the marketing and research department at its parent company, [[J. Walter Thompson|J Walter Thompson]]. While running this 60-strong department, he set up a research and development committee to plan and manage JWT's substantial research budget. Innovations during this period included the TV Attention Survey (a prototype of modern TV audience research which gave useful insights, enabled JWT to buy airtime better and became a remarkable new business tool) and the creative workshop, which tested new and experimental ideas with qualitative research. JWT became the standard bearer of modern market research and the theory of how advertising works, what it does and how to measure it.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1028027.ece The Times], 24 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Mr Advertising' ==
In 1967, at the age of 43, Treasure became JWT chairman. Between then and 1976, when he resigned, he presided over one of the most successful periods in the long life of that agency: under his chairmanship, JWT in the UK grew fourfold in recorded billings from £20 million to £80 million.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/18/guardianobituaries.advertising The Guardian], obituary by Jeremy Bullmore, 18 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure became a director of the J Walter Thompson company worldwide, becoming vice chairman in 1974, and was president of both the [[Institute of Practitioners in Advertising]] and the Market Research Society. He was also president of the National Advertising Benevolent Society and later of the [[History of Advertising Trust]], where he remained a governor until 2002; he also headed a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] committee on communications.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Not only to the advertising village, but also to a much wider world outside, he became known as ‘Mr Advertising’.&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt; When he was the subject of [[Bernard Levin]]'s chat show The Levin Interview in 1966,&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1743583/ The Levin Interview], aired 5 April 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; the television critic of [[The Sunday Times]] wrote: “On the level of civil, intelligent Q&amp;A it was very good. A good deal of rubbish that is talked about advertising, from both sides, was sensibly disposed of.”&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt;

== Academia and the Saatchis ==
He left the agency world in 1977 at the age of 52 to become Dean and Professor of Marketing at the [[Cass Business School|City University Business School]], where in four years he raised the school's profile, expanded its range and secured new professorial posts and premises.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; He returned to the commercial advertising world in 1980, running his own agency John Treasure and Partners, which then merged with Freeman Mathews Milne to become Freeman Mathews Treasure, before the Saatchi brothers, possibly in recognition of the role he had played in suggesting them to [[Margaret Thatcher]] for the Conservative Party account, invited him to become vice-chairman of their rapidly growing agency. He joined [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] in 1983, and added weight and gravitas to the predominantly young and aggressive management team there for several years.

== Taylor Nelson and the Marketors ==
In 1989 he moved back to his first love, market research, to become chairman of [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|Taylor Nelson AGB plc]], and presided over its acquisition of Sofres to become the world’s number two market research group.  In the Millennium year he was a well-connected, highly regarded Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Marketors]].&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt; He retired the following year, and though he was active in [[Richmond, London|Richmond, Surrey]] (he chaired the Friends of Old Deer Park and raised money for [[Richmond Theatre]] and the Museum of Richmond)&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt; his health declined from then on.

== Character and influence ==
Colleague and industry commentator Jeremy Bullmore wrote: "Although he retained a certain reserve all his life, Treasure was always possessed of presence; he commanded attention. He chaired meetings and spoke in public with natural confidence and evident enjoyment.... The source of this authority was a clear and analytical mind, combined with an enviable ability to express complicated thoughts in jargon-free language.... Treasure's intellectual curiosity, his withering contempt for flabby thinking and his fascination with theory had a liberating effect on others. His presence seemed to grant implicit permission to experiment, to speculate and to innovate."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

Possibly the best evidence of Treasure’s intense focus and competitive nature came from golf. He took up the game at the age of 50, becoming an active member of Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club – and within five years, with RMS professional David Talbot, he had become good enough to compete in the [http://www.pga.info/PGANationalProAmChampionship/40868009.htm State Express 555 National Pro-Am Championship] at Penina in Portugal. He holed a 40-footer on the 18th green to draw level with the leaders, and the pair went on to win the play-off;&lt;ref name="PGA"&gt;[http://www.pga.info/PGANationalProAmChampionship/40868009.htm PGA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129031356/http://www.pga.info/PGANationalProAmChampionship/40868009.htm |date=29 November 2010 }}, National Pro-Am website.&lt;/ref&gt; at the winners' press conference, Treasure revealed that he had dreamed the night before that he would win with just such a putt, provoking the [[Daily Mail]] headline "Prophetic Prof Sinks Dream Putt".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454437/Professor-John-Treasure.html The Daily Telegraph], 16 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Good publicity was in his nature.

John Treasure's influence on the advertising profession and its image in the UK was significant and lasting: [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Maurice (later Baron) Saatchi]] called him “one of the great figures of advertising”.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Hamish Pringle, the IPA director-general, said: "With John's passing we have lost another giant of UK advertising. His contribution to the industry was enormous."&lt;ref name="Campaign"&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/203128/Former-JWT-chief-John-Treasure-dies-aged-79/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH Campaign Magazine], 20 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Treasure died in Kingston Hospital on 9 February 2004. His papers from his time at JWT are stored as the John Treasure Collection at the [[History of Advertising Trust]].&lt;ref name="HAT"&gt;[http://www.hatads.org.uk/hat/newsitem.php?A=127&amp;C=22 The History of Advertising Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001506/http://www.hatads.org.uk/hat/newsitem.php?A=127&amp;C=22 |date=20 July 2011 }}, website.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also chaired the [[Fiji Kava Council]], which promotes the sale of [[Kava|yaqona]] locally and internationally.

As chairman of the Provincial Council, Nawalowalo promoted aggressive infrastructural development programs.  He also strongly supported the central government of [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Laisenia Qarase]], and refused to let [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]] teams tour Kadavu to campaign against the government's controversial [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill]], which Nawalowalo strongly supported.

On 29 March 2006, Nawalowalo expressed interest in contesting the [[Kadavu (Fijian Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Kadavu]] [[Fijians|Fijian]] [[Communal constituencies|Communal Constituency]] for the ruling [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] Party (SDL), but ended up withdrawing in favour of the incumbent, [[Konisi Yabaki]].

In the aftermath of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military takeover]] of 5 December 2006, Nawalowalo changed his views, and threw his support behind the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's time for a cleansing exercise|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=52986|publisher=[[Fiji Times]]|date=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provoked an angry reaction from some of his fellow chiefs, who were reported by [[Fiji Television]] on 9 December as instructing him to refrain from making any further public statements without their approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Justice Center Complex''' is a building complex located in the [[Civic Center (Cleveland)|Civic Center]] District in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], in the United States. The complex consists of the '''Cleveland Police Headquarters Building''', the '''Cuyahoga County and Cleveland Municipal Courts Tower''', and the '''Correction Center''' (Jail I), and '''Jail II'''. It occupies a city block bounded by Lakeside Avenue, Ontario Street, West 3rd Street, and St. Clair Avenue. The Lakeside Avenue entrance faces the [[Cuyahoga County Court House]], erected in 1912.

==About the Justice Center==
When the Justice Center was proposed in 1969, then-Mayor [[Carl B. Stokes]] did not want to be part of the Justice Center project. At the time, the Cleveland Police were at an older headquarters on East 22nd Street. In 1971, voters elected Mayor [[Ralph Perk]], who accepted the police department recommendation to move to the proposed Justice Center. The original cost for the Justice Center was set at $60 million, but infighting between Cuyahoga County and City of Cleveland officials escalated the cost to $128 million.&lt;ref name=littscared /&gt; On October 20, 1972, ground was broken for the Justice Center. Construction was complete in 1976.

The Courts Tower component, 26 stories high, was designed by [[Prindle, Patrick and Associates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Norman |title=Cleveland: A Brutalist Tour |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2007/06/cleveland_a_brutalist_tour.html |work=The Plain Dealer|date=June 21, 2007 |accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jail I was built in 1976, when the rest of the construction of the complex was completed. It had 956 beds, arranged in pods of 23, and each pod was designed to take extensive advantage of natural light. The Courts Tower has been criticized by Steven Litt in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' as menacing, cold, and distracting.&lt;ref name=littscared /&gt;

In 1995, the Robert P. Madison International-designed, $68 million Jail II was erected on the southern corner of the block.&lt;ref name=littscared&gt;{{cite news|last=Litt|first=Steven|title=Jail II At Justice Center Could Scare Crooks Straight|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 28, 1995|page=K3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A suburban location was considered for the facility, but county officials found it was cheaper to demolish two older structures next to the Justice Center.&lt;ref name=littscared /&gt; Jail II added 480 beds. Determined to avoid cost overruns on the structure, Jail II was left without stone cladding—which made it clash with the three buildings beside it.&lt;ref name=littscared /&gt;  Jail II was harshly criticized by Steven Litt in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' as "straight out of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]''" and for clashing with historic structures in the nearby [[Warehouse District, Cleveland|Warehouse District]].&lt;ref name=littscared /&gt;

A four-story atrium exists in the center of the block, and serves as the secure public entry to the complex.&lt;ref name=farkasnew&gt;{{cite news|last=Farkas|first=Karen|title=Cuyahoga County needs new downtown courthouse and jail, officials say|work=The Plain Dealer|date=September 30, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2016|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county/index.ssf/2015/09/cuyahoga_county_needs_new_downtown_courthouse_and_jail_officials_say.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atrium helps resolve ground-level changes at the site, and connects the Courts Tower, Police Headquarters, and Correction Center (Jail I) structures internally.  The north, south, and east walls of the atrium are glass curtain walls. An enclosed, elevated walkway connects Jail I and Jail II, while an enclosed walkway connects Cleveland Police Headquarters with Jail II.

The entire complex contains about {{convert|2300000|sqft|m2}} of interior space.&lt;ref name=farkasnew /&gt;

The bases of both the Cleveland Police Headquarters and the Correction Center are deeply recessed with a regular spacing of bays and perimeter columns.  Bronze tinted glass enhances the play of shadow upon the surface of the structures.

Cleveland Police Headquarters and the atrium are set much further back from Ontario Street than the Courts Tower. An open paved plaza occupies this space. Located at the northwestern end of this plaza is the [[Isamu Noguchi]] sculpture, ''Portal'', donated by the Gund Foundation in 1977.  The $100,000, {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=on}} high sculpture was cast by the Patterson-Leitch Company of Cleveland.  It is one of [[Isamu Noguchi]]'s famous sculptures, and the most recognizable symbol of the Justice Center. One Cleveland art critic said ''Portal'' looked like "justice going down the drain".&lt;ref name=campden&gt;{{cite book|last=Campen|first=Richard N.|title=Outdoor Sculpture in Ohio|location=Chagrin Falls, Ohio|publisher=West Summit Press|date=1980|isbn=9780960135622|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; But artist [[John Clague]] highly praised it, and sculptor [[Clement Meadmore]] says it is Noguchi's best work.&lt;ref name=campden /&gt;

===Renovations===
The granite veneer of the Courts Tower, Police Headquarters, and Corrections Center underwent a $3.2 million refurbishment in 1995.&lt;ref name=littscared /&gt;

A $13 million renovation of the Corrections Center and Jail II was completed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rollenhagen|first=Mark|title=Whole Cuyahoga Jail Floor Stood Empty|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 21, 1999|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Sweeney|first=James F.|title=County Seeking Millions for Jails Bond Issue|work=The Plain Dealer|date=October 22, 1998|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovations increased the capacity of Jail I to 1,749 beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dissell|first=Rachel|title=County Jail operating beyond capacity|work=The Plain Dealer|date=November 14, 2014|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the Justice Complex==
In 2013, [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] officials commissioned a study from Osborne Engineering to assess the condition of the Justice Center Complex.  The report, issued in spring 2014, found that the Justice Center Complex was in significant disrepair. The study cited significant architectural and construction issues which have affected the longevity of the three original structures, and Cuyahoga County Public Works Director Michael Dever said the electrical system, plumbing, elevators, and [[HVAC]] system all need replacing. The structures also have little capacity for modern communications and computer systems (such as [[broadband]] telecommunications), and currently systems are installed in insecure or temporary fashions. The buildings were not constructed to accommodate [[Wi-Fi]] or [[mobile phone]]s, neither of which can be accommodated in many parts of the complex. The cost of renovation was pegged at a minimum of $300 million. The Osborne Engineering report estimated the cost of new construction at $429 million, which involved demolishing the Cleveland police headquarters and the Courts Tower and constructing a one or two new buildings in their place.

County officials came to the preliminary conclusion that the Justice Complex should be demolished, and a new "justice center" erected elsewhere in downtown Cleveland. Cuyahoga County Council member Michael Gallagher told ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper that advances in corrections design made the existing Corrections Center/Jail I significantly outdated. He also claimed that renovations could not correct the design and other deficiencies of the buildings. But county officials emphasized that no alternative site had been identified, and no budget proposals or even preliminary architectural discussions had occurred.&lt;ref name=farkasnew /&gt;

==In Popular Culture==
The Justice Center Complex plays an important role in the third season of the [[Serial (podcast)|Serial Podcast]]. The season opens with a general description of day-to-day lives inside the complex and then focusses on specific cases being handled and (sometimes) trialled in the building. Several of the audio recordings take place inside the complex and feature the host, [[Sarah Koenig]], discussing and interviewing those involved in the cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/23/17887612/serial-season-3-review-sarah-koenig-cleveland-criminal-justice-system&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">The '''lead chamber process''' was an industrial method used to produce [[sulfuric acid]] in large quantities. It has been largely supplanted by the [[contact process]].

In 1746 in [[Birmingham]], England, [[John Roebuck]] began producing [[sulfuric acid]] in [[lead]]-lined chambers, which were stronger and less expensive, and could be made much larger, than the [[glass]] containers which had been used previously. This allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production and, with several refinements, this process remained the standard method of production for almost two centuries. So robust was the process that as late as 1946, the chamber process still accounted for 25% of sulfuric acid manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Jones, "Chamber Process Manufacture of Sulfuric Acid", ''Industrial and Engineering Chemistry'', Nov 1950, Vol 42, No. 11, pp 2208–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Sulfur dioxide]] is introduced with steam and [[nitrogen dioxide]] into large chambers lined with sheet [[lead]] where the gases are sprayed down with water and [[chamber acid]] (62–70% Sulfuric acid). The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve and over a period of approximately 30 minutes the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfuric acid. The presence of nitrogen dioxide is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. The process is highly [[exothermic]], and a major consideration of the design of the chambers was to provide a way to dissipate the heat formed in the reactions.

Early plants used very large lead-lined wooden rectangular chambers (Faulding box chambers) that were cooled by ambient air. The internal lead sheathing served to contain the corrosive sulfuric acid and to render the wooden chambers waterproof. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, such plants required about half a cubic meter of volume to process the sulfur dioxide equivalent of a kilogram of burned sulfur.{{citation needed|reason=Great fact worthy of inclusion here, but I can't find supporting data.|date=March 2014}}  In the mid-19th century, French chemist [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|Gay-Lussac]] redesigned the chambers as stoneware packed masonry cylinders. In the 20th century, plants using Mills-Packard chambers supplanted the earlier designs. These chambers were tall tapered cylinders that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber.

Sulfur dioxide for the process was provided by burning [[sulfur|elemental sulfur]] or by the [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] of [[Sulfide mineral|sulfur-containing metal ores]] in a stream of air in a furnace. During the early period of manufacture, nitrogen oxides were produced by the decomposition of [[nitre|niter]] at high temperature in the presence of acid, but this process was gradually supplanted by the air oxidation of [[ammonia]] to [[nitric oxide]] in the presence of a catalyst.  The recovery and reuse of oxides of nitrogen was an important economic consideration in the operation of a chamber process plant.

In the reaction chambers, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to produce [[nitrogen dioxide]].  Liquid from the bottom of the chambers is diluted and pumped to the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards in a fine mist. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are absorbed in the liquid and react to form sulfuric acid and nitric oxide. The liberated nitric oxide is sparingly soluble in water and returns to the gas in the chamber where it reacts with oxygen in the air to reform nitrogen dioxide. Some percentage of the nitrogen oxides are sequestered in the reaction liquor as [[nitrosylsulfuric acid]] and as nitric acid, so fresh nitric oxide must be added as the process proceeds. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover tower to reclaim the oxides of nitrogen.

Sulfuric acid produced in the reaction chambers is limited to about 35% concentration.  At higher concentrations, nitrosylsulfuric acid precipitates on the lead walls as [[nitrosylsulfuric acid|chamber crystals]] and is no longer able to [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the oxidation reactions.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Gooch and C. F. Walker, ''Outlines of Inorganic Chemistry'', MacMillan, London, 1905, pp 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemistry ==
Sulfur dioxide is generated by burning elemental [[sulfur]] or by roasting [[pyrite|pyritic ore]] in a current of air:

:S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
:4 FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Nitrogen oxides are produced by decomposition of [[nitre|niter]] in the presence of sulfuric acid or hydrolysis of [[nitrosylsulfuric acid]]:

:2 NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NO + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 NOHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NO + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the reaction chambers, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in the reaction liquor.  Nitrogen dioxide is hydrated to produce [[nitrous acid]] which then oxidizes the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and nitric oxide.  The reactions are not well characterized but it is known that nitrosylsulfuric acid is an intermediate in at least one pathway. The major overall reactions are:

:2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NOHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:NOHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NO
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 2 HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NO

Nitric oxide escapes from the reaction liquor and is subsequently reoxidized by molecular oxygen to nitrogen dioxide.  This is the overall rate determining step in the process:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp 2209.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 NO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Nitrogen oxides are absorbed and regenerated in the process, and thus serve as a [[catalysis|catalyst]] for the overall reaction:

:2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Lee Mark Chang''' is a [[Belize]]an politician and restaurateur. A member of the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]], he was the first [[Ethnic Chinese in Belize|ethnic Chinese]] person to hold the post of [[President of the Senate of Belize|President]] (''[[pro tempore]]'') of the [[Senate of Belize]].&lt;ref name="Reporter20100820"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reporter.bz/index.php?mod=archive&amp;act=view&amp;article=4557|title=Belize's first Chinese President of the Senate|work=The Belize Reporter|date=2010-08-20|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Lee got his start in life working at the Chon Saan Palace restaurant which his father Armando Chang opened in 1974. From a small family restaurant, under his management he grew it to a chain with three locations and fifty staff, making it "one of the biggest names in restaurants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=12628|title=7 On the Inside of Chon Saan Palace's Kitchen|work=7 News Belize|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the president of the Chinese Association of Belize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/13922|title=Chinese-Belizeans celebrate New Year|work= News 5 Belize|date=2004-01-22|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his tenure as president, the CAB worked closely with the [[Belize Police Department]] on issues of crime prevention, and also donated several motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=16923|title=The Chinese Community’s Contribution|work=7 News Belize|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served in a variety of public positions, for example sitting on the Belize District Liquor Licensing board and working as an occasional court translator.&lt;ref name="Amandala20090220"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=8190|first=Aaron|last=Humes|title=Archie Lee and Wilmot square off!|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://belize.me.uk/2010/05/14/chinese-national-pays-fine/|title=Chinese National pays $1000 fine for frying chicken|work=Belize Local News|date=2010-05-14|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In politics===
Chang first announced his intention to join electoral politics in August 2009.&lt;ref name="News520090806"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/904|title=Lee Mark Chang: 1 citizenship and 100% Belizean|work=News 5 Belize|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, [[Prime Minister of Belize|PM]] [[Dean Barrow]] appointed Chang to the Senate and made him acting President, to fill in for [[Andrea Gill]] who was on [[maternity leave]]. Politicians from both sides of the aisle such as the PUP's [[Lisa Shoman]] offered congratulations to him on what they described as "the epitome of Belize's cultural diversity" and an "important milestone" for Belize's Chinese community.&lt;ref name="Reporter20100820"/&gt;

Lee entered the [[Belizean general and local elections, 2012|2012 "double election"]] as the UDP's [[National Assembly of Belize|National Assembly]] candidate for the Freetown constituency.  In the run-up to the election, an unknown person released a forged letter claiming to be from Chang, promising to distribute land in Belama to the Belize Chinese Association in exchange for campaign contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=21897|title=Lee Mark Cries Foul in Freetown|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-02-29|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Belize Times]]'' also published a number of racist comments about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.bz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4450:pup-trying-to-inject-racism-in-freetown&amp;catid=53:headlines|first=Shane|last=Williams|title=PUP Trying to Inject Racism in Freetown|work=Belize Guardian|date=2012-03-01|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee lost the election to PUP party leader [[Francis Fonseca]] by 1,558 to 1,408 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lovetv.com.bz/2012/04/04/cj-approves-application-for-election-petition-against-francis-fonseca/|title=CJ approves application for election petition against Francis Fonseca|work=Love TV Belize|date=2012-04-04|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April Chang filed a motion for an [[election petition]] in April, alleging that Fonseca's agents engaged in bribery of the electorate. [[Chief Justice of Belize|Chief Justice]] [[Kenneth Benjamin (judge)|Kenneth Benjamin]] granted him leave to bring the petition; it was the first election petition in Belize's history to be granted on the grounds of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=22149|title=Bribery Petition Against PUP Leader Granted Leave To Be Heard|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-04-04|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2015: He became the President of the Senate, after the United Democratic Party won their 3rd term.

==Personal life==
Chang's parents are Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name="Reporter20100820"/&gt; He was born at the former Holden Memorial Hospital on the Marine Parade in [[Belize City]].&lt;ref name="News520090806"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8744">'''Low-cost country sourcing''' (LCCS) is [[procurement]] strategy in which a company sources materials from countries with lower [[Workforce|labour]] and production costs in order to cut [[operating expense]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} LCCS falls under a broad category of procurement efforts called [[global sourcing]].

The process of low-cost sourcing consists of two parties. The customer and the supplier countries like US, UK, Canada, Australia, and West European nations are considered as [[high-cost countries]] (HCC) whereas resource rich and regulated wage labor locations like [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], and [[East Europe]]an nations are considered [[low-cost countries]] (LCC). In low-cost-country sourcing the material ([[Product (business)|product]]s) flows from LCC to HCC while the [[technology]] flows from HCC to LCC.

The primary principle behind LCCS is to obtain sourcing efficiencies through identifying and exploiting cost [[arbitrage]] between geographies.

Aside from price other reasons for engaging in global sourcing can include improved manufacturing capacity/ time frames, quality of goods, improved customer services and logistics benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.resource2source.com.au/thinking-space/low-cost-country-sourcing-2/|title=Low Cost Country Sourcing|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:318924/fulltext01|title=Problems and Challenges of Global Sourcing|last=|first=|date=|website=J Ö N K Ö P I N G I N T E R N A T I O N A L B U S I N E S S S C H O O L|publisher=Master thesis within BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destination==
Not necessarily all "low cost countries" are destinations for LCCS. Only those countries with relatively stable political and economic [[PEST analysis|environment]], modern infrastructure and acceptably compatible legal system are considered to be ideal for sourcing. Examples and most popular regions are China, [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name=ibtimes/&gt; [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]],&lt;ref name=ibtimes&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/india-asean-economies-become-next-china-manufacturing-foreign-direct-investment-fdi-1039684&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaysia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Mexico]], [[Bolivia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Czech Republic]].

==Labour costs==
Labour costs have been rising across Asia as Asians now are more willing to pay a premium for the products and services they receive and thus causing production cost to increase. Many countries in Asia have seen a rapid rise in wages since the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Rural wages in Asia|author=Steve Wiggins and Sharada Keats|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9186.pdf|publisher= Overseas Development Institute|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asia Soaring Wages Mean Rising Prices Worldwide|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-02/asia-soaring-wages-stoke-inflation-as-factory-costs-rise|publisher=Bloomberg|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor contributing to the wage rises is due to the shift of labour from agricultural work into more productive jobs in industry, labour [[productivity]] has increased quickly thus leading to [[wages|wage]] growth. Workers will demand for better wages as [[Singapore]]'s [[economic growth]] and [[living costs]] are gradually increasing. Businesses will thus face pressure on their [[profit margin]]s as rising [[labour costs]] leads to higher [[production costs]].

Labour costs in China and India have been increasing over the years. China was initially one of the lowest labour cost countries known. However, due to the rising demands of people and the increase in the cost of goods, China is no longer regarded as the ‘cheapest’ country to manufacture goods anymore. China is now deemed as less competitive compared to other countries. The increased labour costs have resulted in some foreign firms exiting the country, in search of countries where labour cost is cheaper, like [[Thailand]] and [[Philippines]]. Other countries apart from China are beginning to provide [[raw materials]] at a lower cost, leaving manufacturers with more choices as regards their suppliers.

A 2012 [[E&amp;Y]] report says that "Wages have been pushed up by long-term decline in the aggregate [[labor force]], combined with a rapid depletion in [[rural]] [[surplus labor]], which has until recently provided an ultimate source of cheap labor,".&lt;ref name=ey/&gt; But it warned that the massive reallocation of labor "from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity manufacturing is coming to an end".&lt;ref name=ey&gt;http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/China_productivity_imperative_en/$FILE/China-Productivity-Imperative_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the Chinese economy started to turn down, there were concerns that it was facing a [[middle income trap]], widely identified by economists as showing the danger of a [[Lewis Turning Point]], a phenomenon observed in history of Japan, which showed that rapid [[urbanization]] led to a growth in manufacturing. However, eventually, the phenomenon comes to an end as wages rise and the country's competitive edge disappears. The number of [[migrant worker]]s in China has been increasing at a slower pace since 2005.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt; Although there are 320 million laborers still in [[agriculture]], only 20 million have the potential to migrate to cities, pushing the country to a point at which "the excess labor in the [[subsistence]] sector is fully absorbed into the modern sector, and where further [[capital accumulation]] begins to increase wages" - pointing to a Lewis scenario.

===Situation in China===
[[Labor shortage]] is not yet a major problem in China, as there are still governmental measures to free up the pool of rural labor, such as the further easing of the [[hukou system|hukou]], or household registration, system. “However, these are unlikely to reverse the trend of increasing labor costs".&lt;ref name=ey/&gt; They will continue to rise as minimum wages and [[social welfare]] improve, adding that on top of the 13 percent annual increase in the minimum wage as set in the 12th [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] (2011–15), mandatory social welfare will add another 35 to 40 percent to the payroll cost.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;

Because there is a large supply of workers, especially in rural sector, wage growth for unskilled labor will grow slowly. At the same time, “wage growth for skilled labor will also likely taper off because of the convergence of college wage premiums to international standards in recent years and the anticipated robust supply of university graduates and professionals returning from overseas”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Dennis Tao|last2=Chen|first2=Vivian Weijia|last3=Monarch|first3=Ryan|date=2010-10-01|title=Rising Wages: Has China Lost Its Global Labor Advantage?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0106.2009.00465.x/abstract|journal=Pacific Economic Review|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=482–504|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0106.2009.00465.x|issn=1468-0106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, overall wage will slowly grow in the near future.

"Rising wages are most significant to primary producers and services industries, as labor takes the major share of total costs in these sectors,".&lt;ref name=ey/&gt; Apart from labor, capital - still relatively cheap in China - will also become more expensive as policymakers move the country toward interest rate liberalization.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;
Material costs, too, will continue to rise and will reach global levels. As the economy slows down, it becomes harder and harder for companies to pass on the costs to customers. For example, India, being a poor country, will soon emerge to be the cheapest manufacturer.

China's rising labor costs will help other South Asian countries gain a foothold in low-end manufacturing.&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite web|title=China Labor Cost Rise to Boost Rivals in Asia|author=Katy Barnato|publisher=CNBC|date=2013-01-17|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100387910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Men's parking space''' is an [[antonym]] to [[women's parking space]].

Normally mentioned only in satire, in July 2012 two men's parking spaces were opened in [[Triberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] of [[Germany]]. Planned as a practical joke presenting a specific challenge to unskilled drivers, they produced worldwide media interest in the combination of humour to lampoon the idea of [[political correctness]] and of successful [[city marketing]].&lt;ref name=Euronews&gt;{{cite web|title=Triberg Mayor boosts carpark as tourist magnet|url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/07/10/germany-triberg-mayor-boosts-carpark-as-tourist-magnet|publisher=Euronews|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical and local background==
[[File:TRIORANG.jpg|thumb|plan of a level of the parking garage, men's parking slot with [[Mars symbol]]]]
Triberg, a small city of five thousand inhabitants, has an extremely steep topography. It has waterfalls. In 2010, Triberg was reportedly visited by about 250,000 tourists per year,&lt;ref Name="TEW"&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/suedwest-1/erlebniswelt-triberg-steht-vor-dem-aus--27998858.html Millionenprojekt Erlebniswelt Triberg steht vor dem Aus] Mo, 8. March 2010 00:04 [[Badische Zeitung]]&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom came to see the waterfalls on a day-tour basis. After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], Americans, who had been frequent visitors, became less likely to visit. That and the decline of the local [[Watchmaker|watchmaking]] industry have caused problems for Triberg's economy.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune&gt;{{cite news|last=Siegert|first=Alice|title=Time Running Out For Clockmakers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-03-12/news/8701200045_1_cuckoo-clockmakers-clock-shops|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 12, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Max-Dieter Mack {{Who|date=July 2013}} presented preliminary plans for a €90&amp;nbsp;million [[Amusement park]], ''Erlebniswelt Triberg,'' on a former industrial site in the municipality. Mack, an architect, is a Triberg native and relative of leisure park mogul [[Roland Mack]]. The parking garage at Kreuzstraße is the only planned building constructed so far. Mack was not commissioned for this.&lt;ref Name="TEW"/&gt; Instead of the theme park, a smaller shopping mall and some comparably humble attractions are now on schedule.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;[http://www.suedkurier.de/region/schwarzwald-baar-heuberg/triberg/Parkhaus-statt-Erlebniswelt;art410964,5541249 "Triberg Parkhaus statt Erlebniswelt"], suedkurier.de, 9 June 2012. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The back of the parking garage is angled to follow the course of the [[Gutach (Kinzig)|River Gutach]]. Therefore, two parking bays, one on each level, have a peculiar shape and can be reached only by a complicated parking maneuver. Mayor Strobel and the architects, Judith Haas and Mattias Huismanns, deliberated about excluding those two bays from the garage of 220 bays, which was built for €2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pz-news.de/baden-wuerttemberg_artikel,-Maennerparkplaetze-in-Triberg-Besonders-schwer-zu-beparken-_arid,354954.html ''"Männerparkplätze" in Triberg: Besonders schwer zu beparken''], [[Pforzheimer Zeitung]], 6. July 6th 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article107919900/Darum-gibt-es-in-Triberg-Parkplaetze-nur-fuer-Maenner.html ''Darum gibt es in Triberg Parkplätze nur für Männer''], ''Welt Online'', 6 July 2012. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Strobel decided to declare them ''men's parking spaces''.  Per the state garage regulations in force in [[Baden-Wuerttemberg]], ten per cent of all stalls (numbering twelve and of the standard shape and size) had to be declared for women in any event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dejure.org/gesetze/GaVO/4.html|title=§ 4 GaVO Stellplätze und Fahrgassen, Frauenparkplätze - dejure.org|work=dejure.org|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but their misuse by men is not punishable according to the StVO (the federal ''Straßenverkehrsordnung'', or Highway Code of [[Germany]]).  Accordingly, the only recourse available to property owners is to eject the misuser for trespassing or to tow his (or her) car; the operator of this particular garage (i.e. the government of the city of Triberg) declines to take either of these actions and instead appeals to the [[honour system]] in the case of the women's spaces and to the skill of the driver, whatsoever his or her sex, for the 'men's'.&lt;ref name="fo"/&gt;

==General background==
{{see also|Women's parking space}}
According to Ruth Becker's {{Who|date=July 2013}} research about risk zones in town planning, women have more to fear in personal surroundings and at home, while men are the object (and dominantly subject) of attacks in the outside world.&lt;ref name="rb"&gt;Ruth Becker Zeitschrift für Frauenforschung und Geschlechterstudien, Jg. 18, H. 4, 2000, p. 49-65 (5 Tab.); {{ISSN|0946-5596}} Standort: USB Köln(38)-FHM XG6137&lt;/ref&gt; Becker refers to U.S. author Elizabeth Wilson's ''Sphinx in the city''&lt;ref&gt;''The sphinx in the city: urban life, the control of disorder, and women'', University of California Press, 1992 &lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and assume that women overestimate the dangers of urban surroundings. Herbert Glasauer doubts that women's parking spaces have a positive effect, and sees them as a sort of backlash perpetuating a [[damsel in distress]] perspective instead of addressing actual violence.&lt;ref name="rb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="püt"&gt;Herbert Glasauer Gewalt ist nicht immer und überall, Georg Glasze, Robert Pütz, Manfred Rolfes: ''Diskurs, Stadt, Kriminalität: Städtische(Un-)Sicherheiten aus der Perspektive von Stadtforschung und kritischer Kriminalgeographie.'' transcript Verlag, 2005. S.206ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's parking spaces, as in the Triberg example, are ''for the brave''&lt;ref name="fo"&gt;''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus Online]]'': [http://www.focus.de/auto/ratgeber/unterhaltung/deutschlands-erste-maennerparkplaetze-ist-das-sexistisch-hier-rangieren-nur-echte-kerle_aid_779440.html "Deutschlands erste Männerparkplätze: Ist das sexistisch? Hier rangieren nur echte Kerle"], focus.de retrieved 15 July 2012. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and ask their users to cope with risk, darkness, wilderness, and skill. Even before the Triberg controversy, for example, German satirist Florian Willet demanded in 2011 that the riskiest places in garages to be reserved for ''"real men"''.&lt;ref&gt;"Deutschlands Frauen schaffen ihre Männer ab: Florian Willet erklärt weiblichen Chauvinismus", verlag-ludwig.de, 2011, p. 209. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; An American reporter in [[Utah]] noted that an American mayor attempting to set up a men's parking space would face greater legal risk compared to Strobel.&lt;ref Name="mor"&gt;[http://www.ksl.com/?nid=151&amp;sid=22114877 Gender-specific parking stalls: A lawsuit waiting to happen?] Rachel Lewis, ksl.com 12.9.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-up==
The dedication, planned as a practical joke and a way to alert unskilled drivers to the specific challenge of the two parking slots, attracted worldwide media coverage.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;''[[Spiegel Online]]'': [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/maennerparkplaetze-in-der-schwarzwald-stadt-triberg-a-843013.html "Hier nur Männer!"], spiegel.de/panorama, 15 July 2012.

(in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|US]] television networks, including [[ABC News|ABC]] and [[NBC News]], reported the story.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;[http://abcnewsradioonline.com/world-news/sexist-parking-plan-german-mayor-creates-male-only-spots.html "Sexist Parking Plan? German Mayor Creates Male-Only Spots"], abcnewsradioonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Becky Bratu, a news journalist with NBC News, suggested that Mayor Gallus Strobel had increased the threshold for drivers to attract more tourists. NBC News quoted Mayor Strobel's interview with ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' to challenge political correctness, and his hope the tight spaces would be an attraction for ambitious drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/10/12664764-german-mayor-designates-parking-spaces-just-for-men?lite "German mayor designates parking spaces just for men"], worldnews.nbcnews.com, 10 July  2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Strobel had media contacts and interviews with French,&lt;ref name="lf"&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2012/07/11/01003-20120711ARTFIG00335-en-allemagne-des-places-de-parking-interdites-aux-femmes.php?page=&amp;pagination=3 "En Allemagne, des places de parking interdites aux femmes"], ''Le Figaro'', 11 July 2012.

''[[Le Figaro]]'' quoted Strobel as stating "Une ville touristique se doit de faire parler d'elle" ("A tourist town has to make people talk about it.").&lt;ref name="lf"/&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reported: "A town in southwest Germany has drawn accusations of sexism after designating two particularly tricky parking spaces "men only".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/13/men-only-parking-comes-to_n_1670852.html "'Men Only' Parking Comes To German Town"], ''Huffington Post'', 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] was on site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/07/12/triberg-germany-all-men-parking.html "German mayor defends 'men only' parking spots"], Associated Press, 12 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and compared the Triberg Challenge to Chinese Woman only parking lots.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2171709/Triberg-mayor-risks-sexism-row-designating-tricky-parking-slots-men-only.html "Achtung! German mayor risks sexism row by designating tricky parking slots as 'men only'"], ''The Daily Mail'', 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in UK,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9393451/Easy-parking-spots-for-women-introduced-by-German-mayor.html "'Easy' parking spots for women introduced by German mayor"], telegraph.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; a women's magazine in [[Morocco]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/vamp_magazine/docs/vamp_06/search?q=triberg "Are women worse driver than men?"], issuu.com/vamp_magazine/docs&lt;/ref&gt; and Norway's ''[[Aftenposten]]'' also all reported.&lt;ref&gt;Arild Færaas, [http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/Tysk-by-reserverer-parkeringsplasser-kun-for-menn-6937772.html#.UZ6Pu9jxeSo "Tysk by reserverer parkeringsplasser kun for menn Byen Triberg har reservert to plasser i et parkeringsplass for mannlige sjåfører. Årsak: Det er så vanskelig å parkere der."] ''Aftenposten'', 6 July 2012. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times of India|Times of India]]'' reporter Kritika Kapoor wrote an article on the issue. She quoted Strobel about his secretary's failure to park on the slot, saying "Five times she tried and no success", and inviting women to stand for the challenge. "Women can come here and prove me wrong, and while they're at it, they can see the town's attractions." Kapoor pointed out that Triberg's introduction of gendered parking is not the first example of sexist parking spots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-06/man-woman/33064457_1_spaces-spots-parallel-park "Women, a parking menace?"], TNN, 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional feedback===
[[File:Triboll.JPG|thumb|A lady with a traditional Black Forest hat occupies the spot]]
[[The Greens (Germany)|The Greens]]' youth association of [[Ortenau]] wrote an open letter against the parking spots&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gj-ortenau.de/shared/brief.pdf "Offener Brief der Grünen Jugend Ortenau"], gj-ortenau.de (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and gender equality official Anette Klaas of the neighboring [[Waldshut-Tiengen]] district criticized them as "a foolhardy provocation".&lt;ref name="FB"&gt;[http://www.bo.de/Lokales/Ortenau/Geschlechterkampf-im-Parkhaus2 "Geschlechterkampf im Parkhaus Triberger Männerparkplätze sorgen für Furore/Für die einen ein netter Gag, für die anderen Sexismus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304234442/http://www.bo.de/lokales/ortenau/geschlechterkampf-im-parkhaus2 |date=2016-03-04 }}, bo.de, 23 August 2012.

Strobel, who has a legal background and holds a PhD in the history of law,&lt;ref&gt;Gallus Strobel, ''Zum Fabrikarbeitsvertrag in Deutschland im 19. Jahrhundert. Vertragsfreiheit und Kinderschutz'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; countered that the critics were being humourless and described the dedication as usage of a cliché for city marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suedkurier.de/region/schwarzwald-baar-heuberg/triberg/Strobel-antwortet-gruener-Jugend;art410964,5646777 "Strobel antwortet grüner Jugend"], suedkurier.de (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Dieter Stein, a writer living in Triberg, published a humorous booklet about the story.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzwälder Bote: [http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.triberg-humorvolle-hotelgeschichten.2800066a-6355-4a74-8f39-9c5dfe1fbbbc.html "Triberg Humorvolle Hotelgeschichten"], schwarzwaelder-bote.de (in Germam)&lt;/ref&gt; The men's parking slots are included in city tours, and Triberg also sells merchandising articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/auto/ratgeber/unterhaltung/jetzt-gibt-es-sogar-t-shirts-neuer-zoff-um-maennerparkplaetze_aid_801914.html "Neuer Zoff um Männerparkplätze"], [[Focus (German magazine)|focus.de]], 17 August 2012. (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender-based parking has been featured in annual TV retrospectives in Germany and South Africa. In 2013, Gallus Strobel was a guest on several television programmes, and the local carnival association baptized and tested the parking lots.{{Clarify|date=July 2013}} The number of tourists and visitors to Triberg increased to almost 400,000 in 2012, compared to 250,000 annually before.&lt;ref name="FB"/&gt; Neighboring [[Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald|St. Georgen]] came up with a temporary men's parking place, in the sense of ''a place where men are being parked'' ([[Männergarten]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwarzwaelder-bote.de/inhalt.st-georgen-modeflohmarktmit-maennerparkplatz.efa1d01e-3f6c-4f5f-a095-bdf453a69a53.html "Modeflohmarkt mit Männerparkplatz"], ''Schwarzwälder Bote'', 19 April 2013; accessed 15 May 2013.

'''Oscar Hammerstein I''' (8 May 1846{{spaced ndash}}1 August 1919) was a German-born businessman, [[theater]] [[impresario]], and composer in [[New York City]].  His passion for [[opera]] led him to open several opera houses, and he rekindled opera's popularity in America.  He was the grandfather of American lyricist [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and the father of theater manager [[Willie Hammerstein|William Hammerstein]] and American producer [[Arthur Hammerstein]].

==Early life==
Oscar Hammerstein I was born in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] (capital of the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|province of Pomerania]]), [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now Szczecin, [[Poland]]), to [[German (language)|German]] [[Jew]]ish parents Abraham and Berthe Hammerstein.  He took up the [[flute]], [[piano]], and [[violin]] at an early age.  His mother died when he was fifteen years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  During his youth, Hammerstein's father wanted him to continue with his education, and to specialize in subjects such as [[algebra]], but Hammerstein wanted to pursue music.  After Oscar went skating in a park one day, his father found out and whipped him as punishment; this would spur Hammerstein to run away to [[North America]].  After selling his violin, Hammerstein ran away to [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;"Oscar Hammerstein."  Jewish Virtual Library.  The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, 2012.  Web.  4 Mar 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and from there, took a three-month journey to the United States arriving in New York City in 1864.

==Cigar manufacturer==
Hammerstein made ends meet initially by working at a [[cigar]] factory on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]].  He worked his way up to become a cigar maker himself, and also founded the ''U.S Tobacco Journal.''  Hammerstein would eventually become the owner of at least 80 patents, with most of them being related to the machines he made for the cigar-making process.  Hammerstein's most well-known contribution to the cigar-making process is adding an air-suctioning component to the traditional cigar-making machines, and the component would hold down the [[tobacco]] leaves firmly so that they could be cut more cleanly.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Opera Built on Smoke." New York Times (1857-1922): SM5. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Nov 18 1906. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial machine only sold for $6,000, but later reinventions would boost his machine's worth to around $200,000.  Another invention that Hammerstein created was a more efficient [[plumbing]] system for his sink when it had leaked one night.

He also moonlighted as a theater manager in the downtown German theaters.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

He became wealthy industrializing cigar manufacturing, and his tobacco fortune provided the money he used to pursue his theater interests.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Producer and impresario==
Hammerstein built his first theater, the [[Harlem Opera House]], on [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]] in 1889, along with 50 housing developments. His second theater, the Columbus Theatre, was built in 1890 on the same street, featuring light theatrical productions.

His third theater was the first Manhattan Opera House, built in 1893 on 34th Street.  This failed as an opera house and was used, in partnership with [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall|Koster and Bial]], to present [[variety show]]s. Hammerstein was displeased with the partnership to the point that it fell into bitterness: "When I get through with you, everybody will forget there ever was a Koster and Bial.  I will build a house the likes of which has never been seen in the whole world.".&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Opera Built on Smoke." ''The New York Times'' (1857-1922): SM5. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: ''The New York Times'' (1851-2008). Nov 18 1906. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 he opened a fourth venue, the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|Olympia Theatre]], on [[Longacre Square]], where he presented a [[comic opera]] that he wrote himself, ''[[Santa Maria (operetta)|Santa Maria]]'' (1896).  While it was positively received by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Hammerstein's personal experience was less than peaceful, with the production being plagued by monetary issues with the cast and stage set.  In the end, Hammerstein had profited only one-tenth of the costs that were put into the ''Santa Maria'' production.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Vincent. Oscar Hammerstein I. The Life and Exploits of an Impresario. (1956). Jewish Social Studies, 18, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine years later, Longacre Square was renamed [[Times Square]], and the area had become, through his efforts, a thriving theater district.

Hammerstein built three more theaters there, the [[Victoria Theater (Hammerstein's)|Victoria Theatre]] (1899), which turned to [[vaudeville]] presentation in 1904 and was managed by his son, [[Willie Hammerstein]] before closing in 1915; the [[New Victory Theater|Theatre Republic]] was built in 1900 and leased to eccentric producer [[David Belasco]], in 1901, and the [[Wallack's Theatre|Lew Fields Theatre]] for [[Lew Fields]] (half of the Vaudeville team Weber and Fields, and the father of lyricist [[Dorothy Fields]]), in 1904.  He wrote a [[Musical theater|musical]] called ''Punch, Judy &amp; Co.''  in 1903.  Hammerstein also opened Hammerstein's [[Paradise Roof Garden]] above the Victoria and Republic theatres.

==Opera and later years==
[[Image:Oscar Hammerstein I and Cleofonte Campanini.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Oscar Hammerstein I (left) with conductor [[Cleofonte Campanini]] in New York, 1908.]]

In 1906, Hammerstein, dissatisfied with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s productions, opened an eighth theater, his second [[Manhattan Center|Manhattan Opera House]], to directly (and successfully) compete with it. He also opened the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Opera House]] in 1908, which, however, he sold early in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Philadelphia Opera House" at the ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced contemporary operas and presented the American premieres of ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'', ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame]]'', ''[[Thaïs (opera)|Thaïs]]'', and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', as well as the American debuts of [[Mary Garden]] and [[Luisa Tetrazzini]]. Since the star soprano [[Nellie Melba]] was disenchanted with the Metropolitan, she deserted it for Hammerstein's company, rescuing it financially with a successful season.  He also produced the successful [[Victor Herbert]] [[operetta]] ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' in 1910.

Hammerstein became famous during his opera years for putting noticeably large budgets out for his productions, ''Santa Maria'' being one example.  More often than not, he would fall into financial trouble within a short period of time.  ''The New York Times'' conducted an interview with Hammerstein, and when the interviewer asked him about his financial habits, Hammerstein responded:

:Financially, I never undertake anything without plenty of ammunition.  I am never afraid of being ambushed in this account.  I decided that my preliminary contracts should be drawn up provisionally upon my success in securing the great stars.  I always contemplated an honorable retreat.&lt;ref&gt;"Hammerstein Tells how to Start an Opera Company." New York Times (1857-1922): X5. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). May 06 1906. Web. 6 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Hammerstein's high-quality productions were ultimately too expensive to sustain, and by his fourth opera season, he was going bankrupt. The costs at the Metropolitan, too, were skyrocketing, as the Metropolitan spent more and more in order to effectively compete. Hammerstein's son [[Arthur Hammerstein|Arthur]] negotiated a payment of $1.2&amp;nbsp;million from the Metropolitan in exchange for an agreement not to produce grand opera in the United States for 10 years.

With this money, Hammerstein built his tenth theater, the [[London Opera House]], in London, where he again entered competition with an established opera house, [[Covent Garden]]'s [[Royal Opera House]]. He had run through his money in two years and thereupon returned to America.  During a trip to [[Paris]], a special cable was sent to him out of curiosity asking whether he wanted to quit opera in New York, given that during his 1909-1910 opera seasons in New York and Philadelphia, Hammerstein had failed in successfully maintaining audiences in his two venues in each city.  He simply responded by saying, "[Opera in New York is] what I'm here for.  I can't say anymore." &lt;ref&gt;"Before Hammerstein Heard." ''The New York Times'' (1857-1922): 2. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Apr 28 1910. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With money obtained selling the sole booking rights to the Victoria Theatre, he built his eleventh and final theatre, the ''Lexington Opera House.''  Unable to present opera there, he opened it as a movie theatre, selling it shortly thereafter.  On April 28, 1910, Hammerstein officially ended producing opera, opting to solely focus on dramatic productions.  All of his contracts and buildings of operation were turned over to the Metropolitan Opera Company.&lt;ref&gt;"Quits Opera for Good", ''The New York Times'' (1857-1922): 9. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Apr 29 1910. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerstein's first wife was Rosa (Rose) Blau.  After Rosa died, he married Melvina Jacobi.  The marriage took place on December 7, 1879 in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].  Melvina's parents, Henrietta and Simon Jacobi, were Jews from Bavaria (Ingerheim) who settled in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and, later, Montgomery, Alabama.  Melvina and Oscar had two daughters - Rose and Estella ([[Stella Hammerstein|Stella]]).

==Legal problems==
[[File:Stella Hammerstein 001.jpg|thumb|90px|Stella Hammerstein]]
Late in his career, Hammerstein experienced numerous legal troubles, most of them in regards to his opera houses.  He went through many of them with an air of pride.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

One of his more infamous accusations was from a Frances Lee, an opera singer, who accused him of preventing her from singing in the Manhattan Opera House after one performance.  Hammerstein was found not guilty and settled his possible payment for up to $35.&lt;ref&gt;"Did i Write? Sure, Says Hammerstein." New York Times (1857-1922): 11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Nov 22 1908. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerstein had given his two daughters, Stella and Rose Hammerstein, $200 a week for financial support after the death of his first wife.  The payments were given to them by the [[Equitable Trust Company]] securely in exchange for stock shares in Hammerstein's Victoria Theatre.  In 1912, Hammerstein requested his stocks back from the company and chose to no longer pay for his daughters.  Stella and Rose sought to fight against their father, who believed that they could support themselves on their own.  Infamously, he compared paying his daughters to "the eccentricities and actions of the late lamented [[King Lear]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Hammerstein Wont Support Daughters." New York Times (1857-1922): 1. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Oct 09 1912. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hammerstein contracted [[kidney]] problems and [[paralysis]], eventually permanently falling into a [[coma]]. He died in 1919 in [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] at [[Park Avenue]] and 77th Street in Manhattan. His contractual ban on presenting opera was due to expire in 1920; at his death he was busy planning his return to the opera stage.

The Manhattan Opera House was bid for $145,000 by Hammerstein's two daughters.  They would also sue Hammerstein's third wife, Emma Swift Hammerstein, over money and ownership of the building.  Emma Hammerstein would go to court claiming ownership through Hammerstein Opera Company stock, but the stocks were found to be null and void by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;"Manhattan Opera House is Auctioned." New York Times (1857-1922): 27. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Jun 23 1921. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manhattan Opera House on 34th Street in New York City was renamed the "[[Hammerstein Ballroom]]" at the [[Manhattan Center|Manhattan Center Studios]] in his honor.

{{Capitalism}}
Throughout [[modern history]], a variety of perspectives on [[capitalism]] have evolved based on different [[School of thought|schools of thought]].

==Overview==
[[Adam Smith]] was one of the first influential writers on the topic with his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', which is generally considered to be the start of [[classical economics]] which emerged in the 18th century. To the contrary, [[Karl Marx]] considered [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to be a historically specific [[mode of production]] and considered capitalism a phase of economic development that would pass and be replaced by [[Communist society|pure communism]]. In conjunction with his [[criticism of capitalism]] was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a [[social revolution]] to a [[Socialist economics|socialist-style economy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheen, Francis ''Books That Shook the World: Marx's Das Kapital''. 1st ed. London: Atlantic Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] or the [[bourgeoisie]] becomes the basis of [[class struggle]].

This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]] asserting that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit. [[Max Weber]] considered [[Market (economics)|market]] [[trade|exchange]] rather than production as the defining feature of capitalism. In contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, capitalist enterprises was their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]]; a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping rationalization. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between [[Master craftsman|master]] and [[journeyman]] in a [[guild]], or between [[lord]] and [[peasant]] in a [[Manorialism|manor]].

Meanwhile [[institutional economics]], once the main [[school of economic thought]] in the United States, holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. In the late 19th century, the [[Historical school of economics|German Historical School]] of economics diverged with the emerging [[Austrian School]] of economics, led at the time by [[Carl Menger]]. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the [[creative destruction]] of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change.

The Austrian economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were among the leading defenders of [[market economy]] against 20th century proponents of socialist [[Planned economy|planned economies]]. Among Mises's arguments were the [[economic calculation problem]], which was first proposed by Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Hayek.&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book |title= Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=2008-09-08|last= Von Mises|first= Ludwig |authorlink= Ludwig von Mises|year= 1990|format= pdf|publisher= [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url= https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A. Hayek, 1935 pp. 1-40"&gt;F. A. Hayek, (1935), "The Nature and History of the Problem" and "The Present State of the Debate,"  in F. A. Hayek, ed. ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources [[Rational choice theory|rationally]] in an economy. The [[free market]] solution is the [[price mechanism]], wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good or service should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy.

Partially opposed to that view, the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued in his 1937 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'' that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] despite high [[unemployment]]. Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx’s problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that [[regulation]] can be effective and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive [[Economic expansion|expansions]] and [[Recession|recessions]] that Marx disliked.

These changes sought to create more stability in the [[business cycle]] and reduce the abuses of [[laborers]].

Today, the majority academic research on capitalism in the [[English-speaking world]] draws on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic thought]]. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated [[Labour economics|labor markets]]; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on [[capital market]]-based financing rather than state financing.

[[Milton Friedman]] took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'', where he claims that the social responsibility of business is "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud". This is similar to Smith’s argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Milton 1970"&gt;Friedman, Milton.

Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming [[marketization]] (or [[privatization]]) of state enterprises and the supply-side economics of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School of economics]] is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas.

==Classical political economy==

{{main|Classical economics|Classical liberalism}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
The [[classical economics|classical school of economic thought]] emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. The classical political economists [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] published analyses of the production, distribution and exchange of goods in a [[Market (economics)|market]] that have since formed the basis of study for most contemporary economists.

In France, [[Physiocrats]] like [[François Quesnay]] promoted [[free trade]] based on a conception that wealth originated from land. Quesnay's ''Tableau Économique'' (1759) described the economy analytically and laid the foundation of the Physiocrats' economic theory, followed by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] who opposed tariffs and [[customs duties]] and advocated [[free trade]]. [[Richard Cantillon]] defined long-run equilibrium as the balance of flows of income and argued that the [[supply and demand]] mechanism around land influenced short-term prices.

Smith's attack on [[mercantilism]] and his reasoning for "the system of natural liberty" in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) are usually taken as the beginning of classical political economy. Smith devised a set of concepts that remain strongly associated with capitalism today, particularly his theory of the "[[invisible hand]]" of the market, through which the pursuit of individual self-interest unintentionally produces a collective good for society. It was necessary for Smith to be so forceful in his argument in favor of free markets because he had to overcome the popular mercantilist sentiment of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Degen, Robert. ''The Triumph of Capitalism''. 1st ed. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Among civilized and thriving nations, on the contrary, though a great number of people do no labor at all, many of whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times more labour than the greater part of those who work; yet the produce of the whole labour of the society is so great, that all are often abundantly supplied, and a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire. — [[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''|sign=|source=}}
He criticized monopolies, tariffs, duties and other state enforced restrictions of his time and believed that the market is the most fair and efficient arbitrator of resources. This view was shared by David Ricardo, second most important of the classical political economists and one of the most influential economists of modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hunt, E.K.|title=History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2002|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation|The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' (1817), Ricardo developed the law of [[comparative advantage]], which explains why it is profitable for two parties to trade, even if one of the trading partners is more efficient in every type of economic production. This principle supports the economic case for free trade. Ricardo was a supporter of [[Say's law]] and held the view that full employment is the normal equilibrium for a competitive economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1991|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that [[inflation]] is closely related to changes in quantity of money and [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and was a proponent of the law of [[diminishing returns]], which states that each additional unit of input yields less and less additional output.&lt;ref name="Skousen2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Skousen, Mark|title=The Making of Modern Economics: The Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers|publisher=M.E.

The values of classical political economy are strongly associated with the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] doctrine of minimal government intervention in the economy, though it does not necessarily oppose the state's provision of a few basic [[public goods]].&lt;ref name="aaron2003"&gt;Eric Aaron, ''What's Right?''

==Marxist political economy==
{{main|Marxian economics}}
{{see also|Socialism|Communism}}
{{Marxism}}
[[Karl Marx]] considered capitalism to be a historically specific [[mode of production]] (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding [[social relations of production|social relations]] between individuals based on their connection with the process of production).&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{cite book |author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or "[[bourgeois]] society" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]] transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"To Marx, the problem of reconstituting society did not arise from some prescription, motivated by his personal predilections; it followed, as an iron-clad historical necessity—on the one hand, from the productive forces grown to powerful maturity; on the other, from the impossibility further to organize these forces according to the will of the [[law of value]]." — [[Leon Trotsky]], "Marxism in our Time", 1939: "Inevitability of Socialism" [http://wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/time-n01.shtml WSWS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]] in 1875]]
Following [[Adam Smith]], Marx distinguished the [[use value]] of commodities from their [[exchange value]] in the market. According to Marx, [[capital (economics)|capital]] is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism because the exchange value of labor power—as reflected in the wage—is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.

He argues this difference in values constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers—all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital. v. 3. Chapter 47: Genesis of capitalist ground rent|author=Karl Marx |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent and must instead be compelled to survive to sell their labor for a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx.

{{quote|The commodity is first of all, an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind. The nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach, or the imagination, makes no difference.

In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that exploited labor would be the driving force behind a revolution to a socialist-style economy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For Marx, this cycle of the extraction of the surplus value by the owners of capital or the bourgeoisie becomes the basis of [[class struggle]]. This argument is intertwined with Marx's version of the [[labor theory of value]] asserting that labor is the source of all value and thus of profit.

{{quote|Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature.

The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. — [[Karl Marx]], ''[[Grundrisse]]''|sign=|source=}}
In ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916), [[Vladimir Lenin]] modified [[Classical Marxism|classic Marxist theory]] and argued that capitalism necessarily induced [[monopoly capitalism]]—which he also called "imperialism"—to find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/index.htm|title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|publisher=Marxists|accessdate=26 February 2008|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th-century [[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the works of Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff.&lt;/ref&gt;

To these thinkers, capitalist class processes are simply those in which surplus labor takes the form of [[surplus value]], usable as capital whiles other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes are predominant. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ste. Croix |author2=G. E. M. de |title=The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World|year=1982|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] extends Marxian thinking through which he theorizes the differential production of place, space and political activism under capitalism. He uses Marx’s theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its "fixes", but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be.

This idea of fix is suggestive and could mean fix as in stabilize, heal or solve, or as in a junky needing a fix—the idea of preventing feeling worse in order to feel better. In ''Limits to Capital'' (1982), Harvey outlines an overdetermined, spatially restless capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and its resolution. Furthermore, his work has been central for understanding the contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows.&lt;ref name="Lawson, Victoria 2007"&gt;Lawson, Victoria. Making Development Geography (Human Geography in the Making). New York: A Hodder Arnold Publication, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay, "Notes towards a theory of uneven geographical development", Harvey examines the causes of the extreme volatility in contemporary political economic fortunes across and between spaces of the world economy. He bases this uneven development on four conditionalities, being the material embedding of capital accumulation processes in the web of socio-ecological life; accumulation by dispossession; the law-like character of capital accumulation in space and time; and political, social and "class" struggles at a variety of geographical scales.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David.

==Weberian political sociology==
[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Max Weber]] in 1917]]
In some [[social science]]s, the understanding of the defining characteristics of capitalism has been strongly influenced by 19th century German social theorist [[Max Weber]]. Weber considered [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Trade|exchange]] rather than production as the defining feature of capitalism. In contrast to their counterparts in prior modes of economic activity, capitalist enterprises are characterized by their rationalization of production, directed toward maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], a tendency leading to a sociological process of enveloping rationalization. According to Weber, workers in pre-capitalist economic institutions understood work in terms of a personal relationship between [[Master craftsman|master]] and [[journeyman]] in a [[guild]], or between [[lord]] and [[peasant]] in a [[Manorialism|manor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y64l10.html|title=Max Weber: On Capitalism |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Macquarie University|author=Kilcullen, John|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904–1905), Weber sought to trace how a particular form of religious spirit, infused into traditional modes of economic activity, was a condition of possibility of modern Western capitalism. For Weber, the spirit of capitalism was in general that of ascetic Protestantism—this ideology was able to motivate extreme rationalization of daily life, a propensity to accumulate capital by a religious ethic to advance economically and thus also the propensity to reinvest capital: this was sufficient then to create "self-mediating capital" as conceived by Marx.

This is pictured in Proverbs 22:29 "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling? He shall stand before kings" and in Colossians 3:23 "Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men". In the ''Protestant Ethic'', Weber further stated that "moneymaking—provided it is done legally—is, within the modern economic order, the result and the expression of diligence in one’s calling" and "If God show you a way in which you may lawfully get more than in another way (without wrong to your soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful way, you cross one of the ends of your calling, and you refuse to be God's steward, and to accept His gifts and use them for him when He requireth it: you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin" (p.&amp;nbsp;108).

Most generally for Weber, Western capitalism was the "rational organization of formally free labor". The idea of the "formally free" laborer meant in the double sense of Marx that the laborer was both free to own property and free of the ability to reproduce his labor power, i.e. was the victim of expropriation of his means of production. It is only on these conditions, still abundantly obvious in the modern world of Weber, that Western capitalism is able to exist.

For Weber, modern Western capitalism represented the order "now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt" (p.&amp;nbsp;123).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economyandsociety.com/events/Ethic&amp;SpiritCapsm_Conf_Agenda2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Conference Agenda|publisher=Economy and Society|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further seen in his criticism of "specialists without spirit, [[Hedonism|hedonists]] without a heart" that were developing in his opinion with the fading of the original [[Puritan]] "spirit" associated with capitalism.&lt;ref name="minerva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grytten|first=Ola H.|title=Protestantisk etikk og entreprenørskapets ånd|journal=[[Minerva (Norwegian periodical)|Minerva]]|year=2010|volume=86|issue=4|authorlink=Ola Honningdal Grytten|page=70|trans-title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Entrepreneurship|publisher=[[Conservative Students' Association (Norway)|Conservative Students' Association]]|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|issn=0805-7842|oclc=477895639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional economics==
{{main|Institutional economics}}
{{see also|New institutional economics}}
[[File:Veblen3a.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Thorstein Veblen]]]]
Once the main school of economic thought in the United States, institutional economics holds that capitalism cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded. It emphasizes the legal foundations of capitalism (see [[John R. Commons]]) and the evolutionary, habituated and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see [[John Dewey]], [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[Daniel Bromley]]).

One key figure in institutional economics was [[Thorstein Veblen]] who in his book ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' (1899) analyzed the motivations of wealthy people in capitalism who [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] their riches as a way of demonstrating success. The concept of [[conspicuous consumption]] was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.

In ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]'' (1904), Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power.

==German Historical School and Austrian School==
{{main|Historical school of economics|Austrian School}}
From the perspective of the [[Historical school of economics|German Historical School]], capitalism is primarily identified in terms of the organization of production for [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Although this perspective shares similar theoretical roots with that of Weber, its emphasis on markets and money lends it different focus.&lt;ref name="Burnham"/&gt; For followers of the German Historical School, the key shift from traditional modes of economic activity to capitalism involved the shift from medieval restrictions on credit and money to the modern [[monetary system|monetary economy]] combined with an emphasis on the [[profit motive]].

[[File:MisesLibrary.jpg|thumb|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]]
In the late 19th century, the German Historical School of economics diverged with the emerging [[Austrian School]] of economics, led at the time by [[Carl Menger]]. Later generations of followers of the Austrian School continued to be influential in Western economic thought through much of the 20th century. The Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], a forerunner of the Austrian School of economics, emphasized the "[[creative destruction]]" of capitalism—the fact that market economies undergo constant change.

At any moment of time, posits Schumpeter, there are rising industries and declining industries. Schumpeter and many contemporary economists influenced by his work argue that resources should flow from the declining to the expanding industries for an economy to grow, but they recognized that sometimes resources are slow to withdraw from the declining industries because of various forms of institutional resistance to change.

The Austrian economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were among the leading defenders of [[market economy]] against 20th century proponents of socialist [[planned economies]]. Mises and Hayek argued that only market capitalism could manage a complex, modern economy.

{{quote|The effect of the people's agreeing that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together without agreeing where they want to go; with the result that they may all have to make a journey which most of them do not want at all. — [[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''|sign=|source=}}
Among their arguments were the [[economic calculation problem]], which was first proposed by Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Hayek.&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A. Hayek, 1935 pp. 1-40"/&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources [[Rational choice theory|rationally]] in an economy. The [[free market]] solution is the [[price mechanism]], wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good or service should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. The price conveys embedded information about the [[Supply and demand|abundance of resources as well as their desirability]] which in turn allows corrections that prevent [[Economic shortage|shortages]] and [[Economic surplus|surpluses]] on the basis of individual consensual decisions.

Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution and without the information provided by market prices socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources. Mises argued in a famous 1920 article "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned or controlled the [[means of production]], then no rational prices could be obtained for [[capital goods]] as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not "objects of exchange", unlike final goods, therefore they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt; This led him to declare "that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt; Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis]]''.

Since a modern economy produces such a large array of distinct goods and services and consists of such a large array of consumers and enterprises, asserted Mises and Hayek, the information problems facing any other form of economic organization other than market capitalism would exceed its capacity to handle information. Thinkers within [[supply-side economics]] built on the work of the Austrian School and particularly emphasize [[Say's law]] that "supply creates its own demand". To this school, capitalism is defined by lack of state restraint on the decisions of producers.

Austrian economists claim that Marx failed to make the distinction between [[capitalism]] and [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref name="rothbard"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Future of Peace and Capitalism |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray N.

==Keynesian economics==
{{main|Keynesian economics}}
{{see also|New Keynesian economics}}
[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|180px|[[John Maynard Keynes]]]]
In his 1937 ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'', the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued that capitalism suffered a basic problem in its ability to recover from periods of slowdowns in investment. Keynes argued that a capitalist economy could remain in an indefinite [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] despite high [[unemployment]].

Essentially rejecting [[Say's law]], he argued that some people may have a [[liquidity preference]] that would see them rather hold money than buy new goods or services, which therefore raised the prospect that the [[Great Depression]] would not end without what he termed in the ''General Theory'' "a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment".

[[Keynesian economics]] challenged the notion that ''laissez-faire'' capitalist economics could operate well on their own without state intervention used to promote [[aggregate demand]], fighting high unemployment and [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] of the sort seen during the 1930s. He and his followers recommended "[[Deficit spending|pump-priming]]" the economy to avoid [[recession]]: cutting taxes, increasing government borrowing and spending during an economic down-turn. This was to be accompanied by trying to control wages nationally partly through the use of [[inflation]] to cut real wages and to deter people from holding money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch01.htm |title=Marx and Keynes: the limits of the mixed economy |author=Paul Mattick |accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Marxists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes tried to provide solutions to many of Marx’s problems without completely abandoning the classical understanding of capitalism. His work attempted to show that regulation can be effective and that economic stabilizers can rein in the aggressive expansions and recessions that Marx disliked. These changes sought to create more stability in the business cycle and reduce the abuses of laborers. Keynesian economists argue that Keynesian policies were one of the primary reasons capitalism was able to recover following the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Erhardt III 2008"/&gt; However, the premises of Keynes’s work have since been challenged by neoclassical and [[supply-side economics]] and the Austrian School.

Another challenge to Keynesian thinking came from his colleague [[Piero Sraffa]] and subsequently from the [[Neo-Ricardianism|Neo-Ricardian school]] that followed Sraffa. In Sraffa's highly technical analysis, capitalism is defined by an entire system of social relations among both producers and consumers, but with a primary emphasis on the demands of production. According to Sraffa, the tendency of capital to seek its highest [[rate of profit]] causes a dynamic instability in social and economic relations.

{{main|Supply-side economics}}
Supply-side economics is a school of [[macroeconomic]] thought that argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering barriers for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as adjusting [[income tax]] and [[capital gains tax]] rates and by allowing greater flexibility by reducing regulation. Consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices.

The term "supply-side economics" was thought for some time to have been coined by journalist [[Jude Wanniski]] in 1975, but according to Robert D. Atkinson's ''Supply-Side Follies''&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Robert D. Supply-side Follies: Why Conservative Economics Fails, Liberal Economics Falters, and Innovation Economics Is the Answer. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "supply side" ("supply-side fiscalists") was first used in 1976 by Herbert Stein (a former economic adviser to President Nixon) and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski. Its use connotes the ideas of economists [[Robert Mundell]] and [[Arthur Laffer]]. Today, supply-side economics is often conflated with the politically rhetorical term "[[trickle-down economics]]", but as Jude Wanniski points out in his book ''The Way The World Works'' trickle-down economics is conservative Keynesianism associated with the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |title=Jude Wanniski, 69, Journalist Who Coined the Term 'Supply-Side Economics,' Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/business/31wanniski.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2005-08-31 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economics are lower [[marginal tax rate]]s and less regulation.&lt;ref name="Wanniski 1978"/&gt; Maximum benefits from taxation policy are achieved by optimizing the marginal tax rates to spur growth, although it is a common misunderstanding that supply side economics is concerned only with taxation policy when it is about removing barriers to production more generally.&lt;ref name="Brownlee"/&gt;

Many early proponents argued that the size of the economic growth would be significant enough that the increased government revenue from a faster-growing economy would be sufficient to compensate completely for the short-term costs of a tax cut and that tax cuts could in fact cause overall revenue to increase.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Bartlett |title=How Supply-Side Economics Trickled Down |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/opinion/06bartlett.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassical economics and the Chicago School==
{{main|Neoclassical economics}}
{{see also|Monetarism|Chicago school (economics)}}
Today, the majority academic research on capitalism in the [[English-speaking world]] draws on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic thought]]. It favors extensive market coordination and relatively neutral patterns of governmental market regulation aimed at maintaining property rights; deregulated [[labor market]]s; corporate governance dominated by financial owners of firms; and financial systems depending chiefly on [[capital market]]-based financing rather than state financing.

[[Milton Friedman]] took many of the basic principles set forth by [[Adam Smith]] and the classical economists and gave them a new twist. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times'', where he claims that the social responsibility of business is "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…(through) open and free competition without deception or fraud". This is similar to Smith’s argument that self-interest in turn benefits the whole of society.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Milton 1970"/&gt; Work like this helped lay the foundations for the coming [[marketization]] (or [[privatization]]) of state enterprises and the [[supply-side economics]] of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].

The [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School of economics]] is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to Friedman and other monetarists, market economies are inherently stable [[laissez-faire|if left to themselves]] and depressions result only from government intervention.&lt;ref name="Felderer, Bernhard"/&gt;

{{quote|One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. — [[Milton Friedman]], interview with [[Richard Heffner]] on ''[[The Open Mind (TV series)|The Open Mind]]'' (7 December 1975)|sign=|source=}}
Friedman argued that the [[Great Depression]] was result of a contraction of the money supply controlled by the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] and not by the lack of investment as [[John Maynard Keynes]]: "There is likely to be a lag between the need for action and government recognition of the need; a further lag between recognition of the need for action and the taking of action; and a still further lag between the action and its effects".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman (1967) p.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bernanke]], former Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke  |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|accessdate=26 February 2008|date=8 November 2002|author=Ben Bernanke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists, today the majority of economists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yonary, Yuval P.|title=The Struggle Over the Soul of Economics|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03419-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider value to be subjective, varying from person to person and for the same person at different times and thus reject the labor theory of value. [[Marginalism]] is the theory that economic value results from marginal utility and [[marginal cost]] (the [[marginal concepts]]). These economists see capitalists as earning profits by forgoing current consumption, by taking risks, and by organizing production.

==Mainstream economics==
{{main|Mainstream economics}}
{{see also|Neoclassical synthesis|econophysics|behavioral economics|evolutionary economics}}
[[Mainstream economics]] is a loose term used to refer to the non-[[heterodox economics]] taught in prominent universities. It is most closely associated with [[neoclassical economics]],&lt;ref&gt;David C. Colander, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IESEfQVI1vgC&amp;pg=PA35 ''Complexity and History of Economic Thought''], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; or more precisely by the [[neoclassical synthesis]], which combines neoclassical approach to microeconomics with [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian approach]] to macroeconomics.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary orthodox [[schools of economics|economic schools of thought]] are the "[[saltwater and freshwater economics|saltwater and freshwater schools]]". The saltwater schools consist of the [[universities]] and other institutions located near the East and West Coast of the [[United States]], such as [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Stanford]] and [[Yale]]. Freshwater schools include the [[University of Chicago]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Rochester]] and the [[University of Minnesota]]. They were referred to as the "freshwater school" since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester and Minneapolis are located nearer to the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon: Productivity ... "four universities placed on or near bodies of fresh water, Carnegie-Mellon, Chicago, Minnesota and Rochester"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saltwater school is associated with Keynesian ideas of government intervention into the [[free market]] while the Freshwater schools are skeptical of the benefits of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kilborn PT. (1988). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DB1338F930A15754C0A96E948260 'Fresh water' Economists Gain]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream economists do not in general identify themselves as members of a particular school, but they may be associated with approaches within a field such as the [[rational expectations|rational-expectations]] approach to [[macroeconomics]].

'''''Quote''''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[magazine]] with editorial offices based in [[Amsterdam]], notable for publishing the ''[[:nl:Quote 500|Quote 500]]'', a list of the 500 wealthiest people in the [[Netherlands]] together with their relative financial position, similar to the list produced by ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''.

''Quote'' is published monthly and provides information about [[business]], [[money]], [[career]]s, [[social network|networks]] and lives of people at the top. In December 1999, the magazine was named "Magazine of the Year" by the ''Nederlandse Uitgeversbond'' (Dutch Publishers Association). First published in November 1986, and named for a term for a [[stock price]], ''Quote'' was sold by the founder, [[Maarten van den Biggelaar]], and two friends to [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]] (HFM) on July 21, 2006. Editor [[Jort Kelder]] then stepped down in April 2007 after more than thirteen years at the helm.

In November 2002, ''Quote'' published the first picture of real estate speculator [[Willem Endstra]] together with released felon [[Willem Holleeder]], who had served a prison sentence as the convicted [[Kidnapping of Freddy Heineken|kidnapper]] of beer magnate [[Freddy Heineken|Alfred Heineken]]. The two were sitting on a bench outside Endstra's offices in the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid]] borough. Endstra, who had always denied his links with the underworld, filed for a [[preliminary injunction]] demanding that ''Quote'' be withdrawn from sale. He said he feared for his safety. Initially, his claim was upheld, but a few days later the injunction was overturned. Endstra was murdered two years later, and Holleeder was reimprisoned after having been convicted on a charge of extortion.

In November 2003, the editor of ''Quote'' was shot; the culprit was never found. A few days earlier, the home of Van den Biggelaar was shot at as well.

In January 2005, ''Quote'' was in the headlines with a claim that in 1998, [[Nina Brink]], the founder of [[World Online]], a Dutch [[Internet service provider]], had been involved in a premeditated [[sex scandal]] and was forced to resign. Brink announced that she would take legal action, but failed to bring a lawsuit. A declaration that she subsequently filed with the Amsterdam public prosecutor to support her [[libel]] claim was declared inadmissible in May due to the lack of solid legal basis.

On 1 November 2011, Mirjam van den Broeke succeeded Sjoerd van Stokkum as the new editor. Former editor Jort Kelder temporarily returned to the business magazine as advisor to the new editor. Since November 2016 Sander Schimmelpenninck has been the editor.

      <comment>/* Origins and background */ I do not thinl you can say that scholars "generally" hold that Penrose made a substantive contribution; two scholars have advanced this view, but the reality is that such a view is widely dismissed by scholars more generally; an article about RBV is simply not the place to debate Penrose's contributions to management theory; editors who want to do so should put their comments on Penrose's article directly</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18683">The '''resource-based view''' ('''RBV''') is a managerial framework used to determine the strategic resources with the potential to deliver comparative advantage to a firm. These resources can be exploited by the firm in order to achieve sustainable [[competitive advantage]].

Barney's 1991 article "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" is widely cited as a pivotal work in the emergence of the resource-based view. However, some scholars argue that there was evidence for a fragmentary resource-based theory from the 1930s. RBV proposes that firms are heterogeneous because they possess heterogeneous resources, meaning firms can have different strategies because they have different resource mixes.

The RBV focuses managerial attention on the firm's internal resources in an effort to identify those assets, capabilities and competencies with the potential to deliver superior competitive advantages.

==Origins and background==

During the 1990s, the ''resource-based view'' (also known as the ''resource-advantage theory'') of the firm became the dominant paradigm in strategic planning. RBV  can be seen as a reaction against the positioning school and its somewhat prescriptive approach which focused managerial attention on external considerations, notably [[Porter's five forces analysis|industry structure]]. The so-called positioning school had dominated the discipline throughout the 1980s. In contrast, the emergent resource-based view argued that the source of sustainable advantage derives from doing things in a superior manner; by developing superior capabilities and resources. [[Jay Barney]]'s article, "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" (1991), is seen as pivotal in the emergence of the resource-based view.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prahalad | first1 = C. K. | last2 = Hamel | first2 = G. | year = | title = The Core Competence of the Corporation | url = | journal = Harvard Business Review | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 79–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of scholars point out that a fragmentary resource-based perspective was evident from the 1930s, noting that Barney was heavily influenced by Wernerfelt's earlier work which introduced the idea of resource position barriers being roughly analogous to entry barriers in the positioning school.&lt;ref name="priem1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based 'View' a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 20–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Pandian | first2 = J.R. | year = | title = The Resource-Based View Within the Conversation of Strategic Management | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 363–380 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250130505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars suggest that the resource-based view represents a new paradigm, albeit with roots in "Ricardian and Penrosian economic theories according to which firms can earn sustainable supranormal returns if, and only if, they have superior resources and those resources are protected by some form of isolating mechanism precluding their diffusion throughout the industry."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, A. and Kipley, D., "Resource-Based View," in: Matthew R. Marvel (ed), ''Encyclopedia of New Venture Management,'' Sage Publications, 2012, p. 397, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781452218571.n158 &lt;/ref&gt;  While its exact influence is debated, Edith Penrose's 1959 book ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' is held by two scholars of strategy to state many concepts that would later influence the modern, resource-based theory of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Penrose's (1959) "Contributions to the Resource-based View of Strategic Management", Yasemin Y. Kor and Joseph T. Mahoney, ''Journal of  Management Studies'' 41:1 January 2004 0022-2380 http://www.business.illinois.edu/josephm/Publications/jms_kor%20and%20mahoney%20(2004).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBV is an interdisciplinary approach that represents a substantial shift in thinking.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The resource-based view is interdisciplinary in that it was developed within the disciplines of economics, ethics, law, management, marketing, supply chain management and general business.&lt;ref&gt; Hunt, S.D., "A General Theory of Business Marketing: R-A theory, Alderson, the ISBM Framework and the IMP Theoretical Structure," ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 41, 2013, pp 283-293&lt;/ref&gt; 

RBV focuses attention on an organisation's internal resources as a means of organising processes and obtaining a competitive advantage. Barney stated that for resources to hold potential as sources of sustainable competitive advantage, they should be valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and not substitutable (now generally known as ''VRIN'' criteria).&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view suggests that organisations must develop unique, firm-specific core competencies that will allow them to outperform competitors by doing things differently.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"/&gt;

Although the literature presents many different ideas around the concept of the resource-advantage perspective, at its heart, the common theme is that the firm's resources are financial, legal, human, organisational, informational and relational; resources are heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile and that management's key task is to understand and organise resources for sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, pp 387-401; Hunt, D. S. and Derozier, C., "The Normative Imperatives of Business and Marketing Strategy: Grounding Strategy in Resource-Advantage View," ''Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,'' Vol. 19, No. 1, 2004, pp. 5–22&lt;/ref&gt; Key theorists who have contributed to the development of a coherent body of literature include [[Jay Barney|Jay B. Barney]], [[George S. Day]], [[Gary Hamel]], [[Shelby D. Hunt]], G. Hooley and [[C.K. Prahalad]].

== Concept ==

Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage lies at the heart of much of the literature in both strategic management and strategic marketing.&lt;ref name="fahy1"&gt;Fahy, J and Smithee, A. "Strategic Marketing and the Resource Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science Review,'' Vol. 1999, 10, online at http://www.amsreview.org/articles/fahy10-1999.pdf or https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/025b/5aa7e682f4cbf1d7637a0bbe51a2a0d602e7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view offers strategists a means of evaluating potential factors that can be deployed to confer a competitive edge. A key insight arising from the resource-based view is that not all resources are of equal importance, nor possess the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The sustainability of any competitive advantage depends on the extent to which resources can be imitated or substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, R., "The Nature of Operations Strategy: Combining Strategic Decisions from an Operations and Market based Perspective," ''Management Decision,'' Vol. 41, No, 6, pp.  538–49&lt;/ref&gt; Barney and others point out that understanding the causal relationship between the sources of advantage and successful strategies can be very difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 108–09; Barney uses the term "causally ambiguous" which he describes as a situation when "the link between the resources controlled by the firm and the firm's sustained competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a great deal of managerial effort must be invested in identifying, understanding and classifying core competencies. In addition, management must invest in organisational learning to develop, nurture and maintain key resources and competencies.

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Wensley | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Assessing Advantage: A Framework for Diagnosing Competitive Superiority | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.2307/1251261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G.

The key managerial tasks are:

1)   Identify the firm’s potential key resources.

2)   Evaluate whether these resources fulfill the following criteria (also known as ''VRIN'' criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad, C. K. and Hamel, G., "The Core Competence of the Corporation," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 79–91; Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt;

* Valuable - they enable a firm to implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness.
* Rare - not available to other competitors.
* Imperfectly imitable - not easily implemented by others.
* Non-substitutable - not able to be replaced by some other non-rare resource.

3) Develop, nurture and protect resources that pass these evaluations.

== Definitions ==

Given the centrality of resources in terms of conferring competitive advantage, the management and marketing literature carefully defines and classifies resources and capabilities.

=== Resources ===

Barney  defines firm resources as: "all [[assets]], capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. controlled by a firm that enable the firm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 101 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Capabilities===

Capabilities are “a special type of resource, specifically an organizationally embedded non-transferable firm-specific resource whose purpose is to improve the productivity of the other resources possessed by the firm.” &lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, No. 5, pp. 387–401 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive advantage===

Barney defined a [[competitive advantage]] as "when [a firm] is able to implement a “value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 102 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of resources and capabilities===

Firm-based resources may be tangible or intangible.

: ''Tangible resources'' include: physical assets such as financial resources and human resources including real estate, raw materials machinery, plant, inventory, brands, patents and trademarks and cash.&lt;ref&gt;Andriessen, D., ''Making Sense of Intellectual Capital: Designing a Method  for the Valuation of Intangibles,''  Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, Burlington, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Intangible resources'' may be embedded in organisational routines or practices such as an organization's reputation, culture, knowledge or know-how, accumulated experience, relationships with customers,  suppliers or other key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Lev, B., ''Intangibles:    Management,  Measurement, and Reporting,'' Brookings Institution Press, Washington,, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==RBV and strategy formulation==

Firms in possession of a resource, or mix of resources that are rare among competitors, are said to have a ''comparative advantage.'' This comparative advantage enables firms to produce marketing offerings that are either (a) perceived as having superior value or (b) can be produced at lower costs. Therefore, a comparative advantage in resources can lead to a competitive advantage in market position.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, S.D. and Morgan, R.M., "The Comparative Advantage of the Firm," ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 59, April, 1995, pp 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation. Hooley et al. suggest the following classification of competitive positions:&lt;ref&gt;Hooley, G., Broderick, A. and Moller, K., "Competitive Positioning and the Resource-Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of Strategic Marketing,'' Vol. 6, 1998, pp. 97–115&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Price positioning
:* Quality positioning
:* Innovation positioning
:* Service positioning
:* Benefit positioning
:* Tailored positioning (one-to-one marketing)

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of RBV have been widely cited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 41–56 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are as follows:

* The RBV is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collis | first1 = D. J. | year = | title = Research Note: How Valuable Are Organizational Capabilities? | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 1994 | issue = | pages = 143–152 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250150910}}; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Tautology in the Resource-Based View and Implications of Externally Determined Resource Value: Further Comments | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 57–66 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different resource configurations can generate the same value for firms and thus would not be competitive advantage {{cn|date=January 2018}}
* The role of product markets is underdeveloped in the argument &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based Theory a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 22–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory has limited prescriptive implications.&lt;ref name="priem1"/&gt;

Other criticisms include:

* The failure to consider factors surrounding resources; that is, an assumption that they simply exist, rather than a critical investigation of how key capabilities are acquired or developed.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe, A.L., "On Equilibrium, Organizational Form, and Competitive Strategy, in Joel A.C. Baum, Frank Dobbin (eds), ''Economics Meets Sociology in Strategic Management (Advances in Strategic Management),'' Volume 17, Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp 271 - 284&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is perhaps difficult (if not impossible) to find a resource which satisfies all of Barney's VRIN criteria.
* An assumption that a firm can be profitable in a highly competitive market as long as it can exploit advantageous resources does not always hold true. It ignores external factors concerning the industry as a whole; [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure Analysis]] ought also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelt, R. P., "How Much does Industry Matter?" ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 12, No. 3, 1991, pp. 167-185&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Said Tawfiq Khoury''' ({{lang-ar|سعيد الخوري}}&amp;lrm;) (June 6, 1923 - October 15, 2014) was a prominent [[Palestinian Christian]] [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]]. He was one of the three founders of [[Consolidated Contractors Company]], currently based in [[Athens]].  Khoury set up the business with his cousin Hasib Sabbagh in [[Beirut]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/construction-billionaire-said-khoury-dies-aged-91-568256.html|title=Construction billionaire Said Khoury dies, aged 91|last=|first=|date=17 October 2014|website=|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCC is the largest construction company in the [[Middle East]] and ranks among the [[Engineering News-Record#ENR rankings|top 25 international contractors]] with a revenue of 5.3 billion USD in 2013.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Engineering News Record|first=(ENR)|title=The 2011 Top 225 International Contractors|url=http://enr.construction.com/toplists/InternationalContractors/001-100.asp|work=ENR Top Lists|publisher=McGrawHill Construction}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCC has offices and projects in over 40 countries, and a workforce of more than 130,000 employees.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;http://www.ccc.me/revenue.php&lt;/ref&gt; Khoury who is listed as a billionaire by [[Forbes]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Said-Khoury_LCDK.html&lt;/ref&gt; is ranked 10th on the [[Arabian Business]] world's richest Arabs in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-world-s-richest-arabs-530591.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past few years, Khoury dedicated most of his time to the organisation he founded, '''The Bethlehem Development Foundation'''  that aims to rejuvenate the birthplace of [[Jesus Christ]] [[Bethlehem]] in Palestine, a holy city for [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethlehemdevelopment.org/about-us26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Khoury was born in [[Safed]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1923. He was nourished in an atmosphere of strong family ties, pervasive moral influence, and a deep sense of ethnic and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb"&gt;http://www.aub.edu.lb/doctorates/recipients/2006/Pages/khoury-profile.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; After attending St. Luke's School in [[Haifa]], he followed his cousin Hasib Sabbagh to [[Lebanon]] in order to study in the [[American University of Beirut]], where both of them graduated from the faculty of engineering. Upon returning home, each of them founded a small construction company in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb" /&gt;

After the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] in 1948, both men fled back again, this time with their families, to the capital of [[Lebanon]], [[Beirut]], where they began working on construction projects. Said and Sabbagh's first task was in the Tripoli airport.&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb"/&gt; Khoury said they were motivated by the catastrophic expulsion from their homeland.&lt;ref name="aub.edu.lb"/&gt;

In the early 1950s a contract to construct a storage yard for oil pipes in [[Homs]] for the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] introduced the young engineers to the world's largest construction company of that time, the [[Bechtel Group]]. The connection remained solid for many years, spearheading the [[Consolidated Contractors Company|CCC]]'s extraordinary transformation from a small subcontracting construction company into the international giant it is today

Said has three sons and two daughters, from which he has fourteen grandchildren. While Said remains as the president of the [[Consolidated Contractors Company|CCC]], his sons alongside the sons on Sabbagh are also at the helm of company.

He was a significant supporter of philanthropic activities in Palestine.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/2013-construction-week-power-100-507098.html?view=profile&amp;itemid=506945#.Uz1RG1eehFs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==

Said Khoury held a Legion of Merit from the [[President of Lebanon|President of Lebanese Republic]] and a Legion of Unity from the President of the Republic of Yemen. He held as well as many other Medals of Merit and Honour from different parts of the World.&lt;ref name="usmep.us"&gt;http://www.usmep.us/usmep/international-board/said-t-khoury/&lt;/ref&gt;

Said has sponsored the establishment of the Said Khoury Information Technology Center of Excellence (SKITCE) at [[Al-Quds University]] in [[Abu Dis]].
Khoury received the HCEF Palestinian Diaspora Award given to individuals who have sustained commitment to revitalize Palestinian culture.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"/&gt;

The '''San Francisco Ferry Building''' is a [[terminal station|terminal]] for [[ferry|ferries]] that travel across the [[San Francisco Bay]], a [[food hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.atlantamagazine.com/covereddish/diningnews/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10261127 |title = Jamestown's Michael Phillips on Ponce City Market |department = ATL Food Chatter |work = Atlanta |date = July 18, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326123104/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/covereddish/diningnews/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10261127 |archivedate = March 26, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an office building. It is located on [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|The Embarcadero]] in [[San Francisco]], California.

On top of the building is a {{convert|245|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[clock tower]] with four clock dials, each {{convert|22|ft|m}} in diameter, which can be seen from [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]], a main thoroughfare of the city.

Designed in 1892 by American architect [[A. Page Brown]] in the [[Beaux Arts style]], the ferry building was completed in 1898. At its opening, it was the largest project undertaken in the city up to that time. Brown designed the clock tower after the 12th-century [[Giralda]] bell tower in [[Seville]], Spain, and the entire length of the building on both frontages is based on an arched arcade.

With decreased use since the 1950s, after bridges were constructed carry transbay traffic and most streetcar routes were converted to buses, the building was adapted to office use and its public spaces broken up. In 2002, a restoration and renovation were undertaken to redevelop the entire complex. The {{convert|660|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Great Nave was restored, together with its height and materials. A marketplace was created on the ground floor, the former baggage handling area. The second and third floors were adapted for office and Port Commission use. During daylight, on every full and half-hour, the clock bell chimes portions of the [[Westminster Quarters]]. The ferry terminal is a designated San Francisco landmark and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
[[File:A Trip Down Market Street (High Res).webm|thumb|left|The Ferry Building is in the center of this film from 1906]]
Opened in 1898, the building replaced a wooden predecessor constructed on the same site in 1875. The well built reinforced building with its arched arcades survived both the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906]] and the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 earthquakes]] with little damage. It served as the destination for commuters to San Francisco from the East Bay, who rode the ferry fleets of the Southern Pacific and the [[Key System]]. In the afternoon, they caught ferries returning across the bay. A [[balloon loop|loop track]] in front of the building enabled convenient transfers to streetcars. A large pedestrian bridge spanned the Embarcadero in front of the Ferry building to facilitate safe crossing of the busy plaza and transit hub. In the 1940s, the bridge was dismantled to supply scrap metal for the Second World War.

Until the completion of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] (which began to carry railroad traffic) and [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in the 1930s, the Ferry Building was the second busiest transit terminal in the world, second only to London's [[Charing Cross Station]]. After the bridges opened, and the new Key System trains began running to the East Bay from the [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal|Transbay Terminal]] in 1939, passenger ferry use fell sharply. In the second half of the 20th century, although the Ferry Building and its clock tower remained a part of the San Francisco skyline, the condition of the building interior declined with changes. Beginning in the 1950s, unsympathetic renovations installed a mezzanine level, broke up the grand space of the Great Nave, and partitioned the ticketing counters and waiting room areas into office space. The formerly grand public space was reduced to a narrow and dark corridor, through which travelers passed en route to the piers. Passengers were made to wait for ferries on outdoor benches, and the ticketing booths were moved to the pier.&lt;ref name="Ferry"/&gt;

[[File:Ferry Building and Embarcadero Freeway, February 1982.jpg|thumb|left|Embaradero Freeway limiting access to the Ferry Building, February 1982]]
In the late 1950s, the [[California State Route 480|Embarcadero Freeway]] was built, which passed right in front of the Ferry Building, and views of the once-prominent landmark were greatly obscured from Market Street. Pedestrian access was treated as an afterthought, and the public was cut off from the waterfront.&lt;ref name="Ferry"/&gt;

[[Market Street Railway (transit operator)|Market Street Railway]] services terminated at a loop in front of the building prior to the construction of the [[Transbay Terminal]]. The last streetcars ran on July 2, 1949.&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{Muni Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the structural failure of the Embarcadero Freeway during the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco was offered the choice of whether to rebuild it or remove the freeway and reconnect the city with the eastern waterfront and the historic Ferry Building. As part of the larger rejection of the 1950s comprehensive freeway plan as unsympathetic to the city's character, and the general unpopularity of the freeway, Mayor [[Art Agnos]] led the charge to remove the Embarcadero freeway entirely. It was replaced with a ground-level boulevard, which reconnected a significant portion of San Francisco's waterfront and the rest of the city. Access was restored to Justin Herman Plaza and the foot of Market Street, of which the Ferry Building had been an integral part for so many decades.

===Renovations===
[[File:Second floor of the Ferry Building.jpg|thumb|left|"Great Nave" of the Ferry Building after its renovations]]
By 1992, the freeway had been removed and San Francisco began to create a comprehensive port development plan that would revitalize the newly cleared space, create public access, and reintroduce the ferry service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Port of San Francisco |year = 1993 |title = The Ferry Building, San Francisco, California: Workshop Summary and Development Concepts |location = [San Francisco, CA] |publisher = Port of San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the most iconic element of the waterfront, the Ferry Building was central to the aesthetic and the overall success of the development plan, and its status as a historic landmark for both architecture and engineering made a sympathetic restoration essential. The 1903 Ferry Building was a symbol of San Francisco's history as a bustling port city, but with the redevelopment plan, the city was choosing to also make the structure a symbol of San Francisco's future.

The vastness of the project resulted in the selection of a group of firms that could each focus on a key aspect of the redevelopment plan. ROMA Design Group—site design architects—designed the bayside and cityside promenades and plazas and reoriented the public spaces of the area to the building and to the bay. ROMA Design Group also designed new ferry terminals and the main historic streetcar stop that re-established the area as a multi-modal transit hub and gateway into the city. Simon Martin-Vegue Winkelstein Moris Architects (SMWM), founded by [[Cathy Simon]], created an overall plan for the building; Baldauf Catton Von Eckartsberg Architects (BCVE) examined and planned for the needs of new retail spaces; [[Page &amp; Turnbull]], specialists in historic preservation, dealt with the restoration, replacement, and recreation of the historic elements of the structure.&lt;ref name="Klara"&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Klara |first = Robert |year = 2005 |title = Going With The Faux |magazine = Architecture |volume =  94 |issue = 8 |pages = 61–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/events-media/events/smwm-exhibit-at-the-environmental-design-archives|title=CED Exhibition: SMWM exhibit at the Environmental Design Archives Wednesday, 06/04/14–10/01/14 280 Wurster Hall|access-date=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the project was a restoration project, the structure would not be returned to its pure historic use as a nexus of bay transit. While the demand for ferry transit has experienced increasing demand in recent years by cross-bay commuters, the ferry service will never again reach historic levels. Therefore, in order to draw visitors, the Ferry Building has been transformed into a retail and restaurant space on the ground floor that focuses on local, sustainable products. The Port and the project developers believed that the combination of transit, office use, and unique retail would make the Ferry Building a destination for locals and tourists alike that would drive the greater goal of stimulating the waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Port of San Francisco |year = 2009 |chapter = The Ferry Building Waterfront |title = Port of San Francisco: Waterfront Land Use Plan |location =  San Francisco |publisher = Port of San Francisco |edition = Revised |pages = 118–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on creating a viable economic use for the Ferry Building was fundamental in developing the final restoration plan and while important historic features that are key to the structure's integrity were largely restored, some adaptations were allowed more license to meet the needs of the reuse proposal. The restored Ferry Building was opened in 2003. The lead developer was [[Equity Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Newman| first = Morris| title = COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; Ferry Building Recalled to Life in San Francisco| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-04| date = 2003-07-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/23/business/commercial-real-estate-ferry-building-recalled-to-life-in-san-francisco.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity Office was acquired by [[The Blackstone Group]] in 2007.

==Architecture and design==
[[File:Ferrybuilding.jpg|thumb|The Ferry Building after the 1906 earthquake]]
The present structure was designed in 1892 by [[A. Page Brown]], a New York architect who had started with [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] and later moved to California. Influenced by studies at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he designed the clock tower after the 12th-century [[Giralda]] bell tower in [[Seville]], Spain.

Brown designed it to satisfy needs of an industrial society in high style associated with traditional buildings; the entire base is an arched arcade reminiscent of European buildings. The highest quality materials were used, such as marble and mosaics for the state seal. The {{convert|660|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Great Nave on the second floor was the major public space for arriving and departing ferry passengers.&lt;ref name="Ferry"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/ |title = History and Renovations |work = Ferry Building Marketplace |access-date = April 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Nave===
[[File:Ferry Building Marketplace, San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|Ferry Building Marketplace]]
The original description of the Ferry Building as published in the ''Board of Harbor Commissioners' Biennial Report'' (1888) specified that "Passengers should pass from the upper decks of the ferries through the second story, with a bridge over the crowded and dangerous portion of East [now Embarcadero] Street."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Olmsted |first = Nancy |year = 1998 |title = The Ferry Building: Witness to a Century of Change, 1898–1998 |location = San Francisco |publisher = The Port of San Francisco }}{{page needed|date =October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor was not intended for public viewing or access and was filled with the movement of baggage, mail, and freight. Instead, the public was meant to enter the structure from an elevated walkway and move through the more refined spaces of the second floor lit by the nave. By 1992, the nave had been turned into private offices and the loss of the foot bridge meant that all public approach to the building would be at street level, altering the way in which the building was understood and experienced.

With the restoration however, the developers argued that the public's historic interaction with the space was defined by the natural light cascading from the nave, not by the elevated entry way. With the movement of the primary public space to the first floor, it became essential to their proposal that this historic experience would be recreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Sensing |first = Chris |year = 2007 |title = The Ferry Building: San Francisco, CA |magazine = Places |volume = 19 |issue = 3 |pages = }}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond removing an added third floor and restoring the {{convert|660|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} nave to its two-story height, the proposal included cutting two openings, each at {{convert|33|by|150|ft|m}}, into the floor of the second level. These openings would allow for this historic feature to be extended to the visitor's experience of the first floor. This was a controversial choice, and due to the building's historic status, the proposal had to be approved by the [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO); this was the subject of multiple hearings.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite magazine |last = King |first = John |year = 2004 |title= Surviving controversy, SMWM's quiet mix of old and new has returned San Francisco's Ferry Building to the center of urban life |magazine = Architectural Record |volume = 192 |issue = 11 |pages = 165–173 |via = Art Source, EBSCOhost}}&lt;!-- (accessed 2015).--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marble mosaics===
The greatest debate raised by the opening of the second floor cuts, however, surrounded the treatment of the historic mosaic tiling of the second floor. The second floor Grand Nave was tiled with a mosaic marble floor of white and gray tesserae with a border of red and purple. In the center of the space at the top of the main stairway is a reproduction of the Great Seal of the State of California worked entirely in mosaics. At the time of the restoration, this surface was primarily covered with linoleum, and some small sections had been lost to prior alterations.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: the restoration|url=http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/faq.php#3|website=Ferry Building Marketplace}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature was considered integral to the historic character of the building, and as a primary public space, the tiling was a key component of community memory.

In allowing the amplification of one feature (the nave), the loss of another (the mosaics) was inherently tied. The final agreement reached between the SHPO and the development team found that as long as the important decorative portions of the flooring were restored and extra tesserae would be used to repair damaged sections, the cuts would be approved.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;

In order to restore the mosaic, the applied linoleum surface had to be carefully peeled away and a mixture of crushed walnut shells was then used to clean the marble surface without damaging the material.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

===Arch reproduction and patinization===
In the process of removing of the 1947 and 1950 third-floor additions, [[Page &amp; Turnbull]] discovered the extent of the damage to the brick and terra cotta arches of the nave. Twenty-two arches span the length of the nave on each side, and of the 44 total, 11 had been destroyed. Over 25 percent of the original material had been removed in the first remodel, including terra cotta scroll-work, the arches themselves, and sections of the surrounding brickwork.&lt;ref name="Klara"/&gt; In order to restore the highly significant nave, Page &amp; Turnbull had to design and create replacements for these 11 arches that would be accurate enough not to detract from the sight line of the second story that these arches flank.

The prohibitive cost and effort of replacing these materials in kind led to the choice of a cast-stone with fiberglass support that mimics the buff brick in both color and finish. Through the use of a cast material, Page &amp; Turnbull was able to create a fiberglass mold to be used for casting each arch as a unit that could then be inserted into sections where original fabric had been lost.&lt;ref name="Klara"/&gt; The addition of fiberglass as a support material—that allows for both flexibility and compressive strength—was seen as an added benefit in meeting concerns over the building's continued seismic safety.

Creating visual continuity between the new and the old was critical in this instance due to the significance of the long stretch of the nave; here an obvious alteration in material or color would detract from the pattern of springing arches that continues through the length of the structure. Page &amp; Turnbull invited faux-finishing specialist [[Jacquelyn Giuffre]] to disguise the new sections and recreate the continuity of pattern and color.&lt;ref name="Klara"/&gt; Guiffre's job was made more difficult by the fact that the structure had not been completely sealed against the elements during the restoration and the salts of the bay air triggered a staining process that created green marks in the yellow and buff brick. In order to match the texture and patina of the old brick, Guiffre used six different pigments applied by hand, and then applied green shading to mimic the new staining process. Once the pieces were installed, a final stage of blending was completed on site to ensure the greatest possible accuracy.&lt;ref name="Klara"/&gt;

===Clocks===
The original clock mechanism was refurbished in 2000; it is complete and intact, despite two previous modifications. The Ferry Building has its original Special #4 clock made in 1898 by the Boston clock maker [[E. Howard]]. It is the largest wind-up, mechanical dial clock in the world. The four dials are each {{convert|22|ft|m}} in diameter, and a portion of the dial appears to be back-lit at night. This is the effect of two concentric dials on each clock face, in which the inner dial is lit and visible at night.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Although the hands and a small portion of the works are now powered by an accurate electric motor, the entire clock mechanism is still there. The huge weight hangs in its {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} shaft; once wound, it formerly kept the clock running for eight days. The {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} pendulum also remains, but it is motionless, replaced by more modern, reliable, and accurate electric power.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} There is also a set of horn [[loudspeakers]] above the clock that play [[Westminster Quarters|Westminster Chimes]] on the hour and makes a loud siren noise every Tuesday at noon on the hour.

==Ferry service==
The Ferry Building is the primary San Francisco terminal for commuter ferry service. (Service to [[Pier 41]] by [[Blue &amp; Gold Fleet]] and other operators is primarily for excursions rather than commuting.) The building has four ferry piers lettered Gate B through Gate E. Gate B, used by the [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]] Vallejo/Mare Island route, is adjacent to the north end of the building. Gates C and D are the '''Golden Gate Ferry Terminal''', located on a larger wharf near the center of the Ferry Building. They are used by [[Golden Gate Ferry]] service on the Sausalito, Tiburon, and Larkspur routes. Gate E is located south of the south end of the building; it is used by San Francisco Bay Ferry services on the Oakland/Alameda and Alameda Harbor Bay routes. Privately-run service to Berkeley docks at Pier 1{{frac|1|2}} to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actransit.org/wp-content/uploads/HSP_FE-stops.pdf |title=Transit Stops: Ferry Terminal |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Commission |date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, which is located on a wharf built in the late 1960s as part of the [[Transbay Tube]], opened with the introduction of Golden Gate Ferry in 1976. Vallejo service was added in September 1986. When emergency ferry service was added after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 earthquake]], Alameda service docked between Pier 7 and Pier 9, Berkeley service docked at Pier 1{{frac|1|2}}, and all other service used the existing Ferry Building piers.&lt;ref name=relief&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/trr/1991/1297/1297-017.pdf |title=Bay Area Emergency Ferry Service: Transportation Relief After the October 17, 1989, Earthquake |journal=Transportation Research Record |year=1991 |issue=1297 |first1=Richard M. |last=Fahey |first2=George E. |last2=Gray |publisher=Transportation Research Board |pages=148-161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley and Richmond service ended in March 1990, but Oakland/Alameda service continued, with Harbor Bay service added in March 1992.&lt;ref name=relief /&gt;&lt;ref name=transition&gt;{{cite web |url=https://weta.sanfranciscobayferry.com/sites/default/files/weta/publications/TP0618909.pdf |title=Water Emergency Transportation Authority Draft Final Transition Plan |publisher=San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority |date=June 18, 2009 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services used a new pier constructed north of the Ferry Building at Pier {{frac|1|2}} (adjacent to Pier 1). The modern Gate B and Gate E opened in October 2001 as part of the larger renovation of the Ferry Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baycrossings.com/dispnews.php?id=891 |title=Early Morning First Ride to New Ferry Terminal |magazine=Bay Crossings |date=November 2001 |volume=2 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transit connections==
[[San Francisco Municipal Railway]]'s [[E Embarcadero]] and [[F Market &amp; Wharves]] [[heritage railway]] lines have [[Market and The Embarcadero Station|a station]] located on the pedestrian plaza in front of the Ferry Building.

In addition, the main line of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] system runs under the building. The dock area on the eastern side is used as the transition point from the [[Transbay Tube]] to the [[Market Street Subway]]. The [[Embarcadero Station]] a block away is a BART and [[Muni Metro]] station; it connects the terminal with the city, [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] and [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]].

The terminal is also served by Vallejo Baylink buses (operated by [[SolTrans]]).

'''[[Dimension (data warehouse)|Dimensions]]''' in [[data management]] and [[data warehousing]] contain relatively static [[data]] about such entities as geographical locations, customers, or products. Data captured by '''Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)''' change slowly but unpredictably, rather than according to a regular schedule.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Ralph |last1=Kimball |first2=Margy |last2=Ross |title=The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scenarios can cause [[Referential integrity]] problems.

For example, a [[database]] may contain a [[fact table]] that stores sales records. This fact table would be linked to dimensions by means of [[foreign key]]s. One of these dimensions may contain data about the company's salespeople: e.g., the regional offices in which they work. However, the salespeople are sometimes transferred from one regional office to another. For historical sales reporting purposes it may be necessary to keep a record of the fact that a particular sales person had been assigned to a particular regional office at an earlier date, whereas that sales person is now assigned to a different regional office.

Dealing with these issues involves SCD management methodologies referred to as Type 0 through 6. Type 6 SCDs are also sometimes called Hybrid SCDs.

== Type 0: retain original ==
The '''Type 0''' dimension attributes never change and are assigned to attributes that have durable values or are described as 'Original'. Examples: ''Date of Birth'', ''Original Credit Score''. Type 0 applies to most Date Dimension attributes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kimballgroup.com/2013/02/design-tip-152-slowly-changing-dimension-types-0-4-5-6-7/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type 1: overwrite == 
This methodology overwrites old with new data, and therefore does not track historical data.

Example of a supplier table:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code!! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State
|-
|123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA
|}

In the above example, Supplier_Code is the [[natural key]] and Supplier_Key is a [[surrogate key]]. Technically, the surrogate key is not necessary, since the row will be unique by the natural key (Supplier_Code). However, to optimize performance on joins use integer rather than character keys (unless the number of bytes in the character key is less than the number of bytes in the integer key).

If the supplier relocates the headquarters to Illinois the record would be overwritten:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State
|-
|123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL
|}

The disadvantage of the Type 1 method is that there is no history in the data warehouse. It has the advantage however that it's easy to maintain.

If one has calculated an aggregate table summarizing facts by state, it will need to be recalculated when the Supplier_State is changed.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit" /&gt;

== Type 2: add new row ==
This method tracks historical data by creating multiple records for a given [[natural key]] in the dimensional tables with separate [[surrogate key]]s and/or different version numbers.  Unlimited history is preserved for each insert.

For example, if the supplier relocates to Illinois the version numbers will be incremented sequentially:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State !! Version.
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 0
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || 1
|}

Another method is to add 'effective date' columns.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 21-Dec-2004
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || 22-Dec-2004 || {{CNone|{{null result}}}}
|}
The null End_Date in row two indicates the current tuple version. In some cases, a standardized surrogate high date (e.g. 9999-12-31) may be used as an end date, so that the field can be included in an index, and so that null-value substitution is not required when querying.

And a third method uses an effective date and a current flag.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State !! Effective_Date !! Current_Flag
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || N
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || 22-Dec-2004 || Y
|}

The Current_Flag value of 'Y' indicates the current tuple version.

Transactions that reference a particular [[surrogate key]] (Supplier_Key) are then permanently bound to the time slices defined by that row of the slowly changing dimension table. An aggregate table summarizing facts by state continues to reflect the historical state, i.e. the state the supplier was in at the time of the transaction; no update is needed. To reference the entity via the natural key, it is necessary to remove the unique constraint making [[Referential integrity]] by DBMS impossible.

If there are retroactive changes made to the contents of the dimension, or if new attributes are added to the dimension (for example a Sales_Rep column) which have different effective dates from those already defined, then this can result in the existing transactions needing to be updated to reflect the new situation. This can be an expensive database operation, so Type 2 SCDs are not a good choice if the dimensional model is subject to change.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit" /&gt;

== Type 3: add new attribute ==
This method tracks changes using separate columns and preserves limited history.  The Type 3 preserves limited history as it is limited to the number of columns designated for storing historical data.  The original table structure in Type 1 and Type 2 is the same but Type 3 adds additional columns. In the following example, an additional column has been added to the table to record the supplier's original state - only the previous history is stored.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Original_Supplier_State !! Effective_Date !! Current_Supplier_State
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 22-Dec-2004 || IL
|}

This record contains a column for the original state and current state—cannot track the changes if the supplier relocates a second time.

One variation of this is to create the field Previous_Supplier_State instead of Original_Supplier_State which would track only the most recent historical change.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit" /&gt;

== Type 4: add history table ==
The '''Type 4''' method is usually referred to as using "history tables", where one table keeps the current data, and an additional table is used to keep a record of some or all changes. Both the surrogate keys are referenced in the Fact table to enhance query performance.

For the above example, the original table name is '''Supplier''' and the history table is '''Supplier_History.'''

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+Supplier
!Supplier_key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme &amp; Johnson Supply Co || IL
|}

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+Supplier_History
!Supplier_key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State !! Create_Date
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 14-June-2003
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme &amp; Johnson Supply Co || IL || 22-Dec-2004
|}

This method resembles how database audit tables and [[change data capture]] techniques function.

==Type 5==
Reserved for future expansion.

==Type 6: Combined Approach==
The '''Type 6''' method combines the approaches of types 1, 2 and 3 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). One possible explanation of the origin of the term was that it was coined by [[Ralph Kimball]] during a conversation with Stephen Pace from Kalido{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. [[Ralph Kimball]] calls this method "Unpredictable Changes with Single-Version Overlay" in ''The Data Warehouse Toolkit''.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit" /&gt;

The Supplier table starts out with one record for our example supplier:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Row_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Current_State !! Historical_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date !! Current_Flag
|-
|123 || 1 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 31-Dec-9999 || Y
|}

The Current_State and the Historical_State are the same. The optional Current_Flag attribute indicates that this is the current or most recent record for this supplier.

When Acme Supply Company moves to Illinois, we add a new record, as in Type 2 processing, however a row key is included to ensure we have a unique key for each row:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Row_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Current_State !! Historical_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date !! Current_Flag
|-
| 123 || 1 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 21-Dec-2004 || N
|-
| 123 || 2 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || CA || 22-Dec-2004 || 31-Dec-9999 || Y
|}

We overwrite the Current_Flag information in the first record (Row_Key = 1) with the new information, as in Type 1 processing. We create a new record to track the changes, as in Type 2 processing. And we store the history in a second State column (Historical_State), which incorporates Type 3 processing.

For example, if the supplier were to relocate again, we would add another record to the Supplier dimension, and we would overwrite the contents of the Current_State column:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Row_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Current_State !! Historical_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date !! Current_Flag
|-
| 123 || 1 || ABC || Acme Supply Co ||CA || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 21-Dec-2004 || N
|-
| 123 || 2 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || CA || 22-Dec-2004 || 03-Feb-2008 || N
|-
| 123 || 3 ||ABC || Acme Supply Co || NY || IL || 04-Feb-2008 || 31-Dec-9999 || Y
|}

==Type 2 / type 6 fact implementation==

===Type 2 surrogate key with type 3 attribute===
In many Type 2 and Type 6 SCD implementations, the [[surrogate key]] from the dimension is put into the fact table in place of the [[natural key]] when the fact data is loaded into the data repository.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit" /&gt; The surrogate key is selected for a given fact record based on its effective date and the Start_Date and End_Date from the dimension table. This allows the fact data to be easily joined to the correct dimension data for the corresponding effective date.

Here is the Supplier table as we created it above using Type 6 Hybrid methodology:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Current_State !! Historical_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date !! Current_Flag
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co ||CA|| CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 21-Dec-2004 || N
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme Supply Co ||IL||CA|| 22-Dec-2004 || 03-Feb-2008 || N
|-
| 125 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || NY ||IL|| 04-Feb-2008 || 31-Dec-9999 || Y
|}
Once the Delivery table contains the correct Supplier_Key, it can easily be joined to the Supplier table using that key. The following SQL retrieves, for each fact record, the current supplier state and the state the supplier was located in at the time of the delivery:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT
  delivery.delivery_cost,
  supplier.supplier_name,
  supplier.historical_state,
  supplier.current_state
FROM delivery
INNER JOIN supplier
  ON delivery.supplier_key = supplier.supplier_key
&lt;/source&gt;

===Pure type 6 implementation===
Having a Type 2 surrogate key for each time slice can cause problems if the dimension is subject to change.&lt;ref name="KimballToolkit" /&gt;

A pure Type 6 implementation does not use this, but uses a Surrogate Key for each master data item (e.g. each unique supplier has a single surrogate key).

This avoids any changes in the master data having an impact on the existing transaction data.

It also allows more options when querying the transactions.

Here is the Supplier table using the pure Type 6 methodology:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date
|-
| 456 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 21-Dec-2004
|-
| 456 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || 22-Dec-2004 || 03-Feb-2008
|-
| 456 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || NY || 04-Feb-2008 || 31-Dec-9999
|}

The following example shows how the query must be extended to ensure a single supplier record is retrieved for each transaction.
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT
  supplier.supplier_code,
  supplier.supplier_state
FROM supplier
INNER JOIN delivery
  ON supplier.supplier_key = delivery.supplier_key
 AND delivery.delivery_date BETWEEN supplier.start_date AND supplier.end_date
&lt;/source&gt;

A fact record with an effective date (Delivery_Date) of August 9, 2001 will be linked to Supplier_Code of ABC, with a Supplier_State of 'CA'. A fact record with an effective date of October 11, 2007 will also be linked to the same Supplier_Code ABC, but with a Supplier_State of 'IL'.

While more complex, there are a number of advantages of this approach, including:

# [[Referential integrity]] by DBMS is now possible, but one cannot use Supplier_Code as [[foreign key]] on Product table and using Supplier_Key  as foreign key each product is tied on specific time slice.
# If there is more than one date on the fact (e.g. Order Date, Delivery Date, Invoice Payment Date) one can choose which date to use for a query.
# You can do "as at now", "as at transaction time" or "as at a point in time" queries by changing the date filter logic.
# You don't need to reprocess the Fact table if there is a change in the dimension table (e.g. adding additional fields retrospectively which change the time slices, or if one makes a mistake in the dates on the dimension table one can correct them easily).
# You can introduce [[Temporal database#Bitemporal Relations|bi-temporal]] dates in the dimension table.
# You can join the fact to the multiple versions of the dimension table to allow reporting of the same information with different effective dates, in the same query.

The following example shows how a specific date such as '2012-01-01 00:00:00' (which could be the current datetime) can be used.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT
  supplier.supplier_code,
  supplier.supplier_state
FROM supplier
INNER JOIN delivery
  ON supplier.supplier_key = delivery.supplier_key
 AND '2012-01-01 00:00:00' BETWEEN supplier.start_date AND supplier.end_date
&lt;/source&gt;

===Both surrogate and natural key===
An alternative implementation is to place ''both'' the [[surrogate key]] and the [[natural key]] into the fact table.&lt;ref name="SCDnot123"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Margy |last1=Ross |first2=Ralph |last2=Kimball |title=Slowly Changing Dimensions Are Not Always as Easy as 1, 2, 3 |journal=Intelligent Enterprise |date=March 1, 2005 |url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=VQABJR4PDJSW1QE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=59301280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the user to select the appropriate dimension records based on:
* the primary effective date on the fact record (above),
* the most recent or current information,
* any other date associated with the fact record.

This method allows more flexible links to the dimension, even if one has used the Type 2 approach instead of Type 6.

Here is the Supplier table as we might have created it using Type 2 methodology:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Supplier_Key !! Supplier_Code !! Supplier_Name !! Supplier_State !! Start_Date !! End_Date !! Current_Flag
|-
| 123 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || CA || 01-Jan-2000 || 21-Dec-2004 || N
|-
| 124 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || IL || 22-Dec-2004 || 03-Feb-2008 || N
|-
| 125 || ABC || Acme Supply Co || NY || 04-Feb-2008 || 31-Dec-9999 || Y
|}

The following SQL retrieves the most current Supplier_Name and Supplier_State for each fact record:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT
  delivery.delivery_cost,
  supplier.supplier_name,
  supplier.supplier_state
FROM delivery
INNER JOIN supplier
  ON delivery.supplier_code = supplier.supplier_code
WHERE supplier.current_flag = 'Y'
&lt;/source&gt;

If there are multiple dates on the fact record, the fact can be joined to the dimension using another date instead of the primary effective date. For instance, the Delivery table might have a primary effective date of Delivery_Date, but might also have an Order_Date associated with each record.

The following SQL retrieves the correct Supplier_Name and Supplier_State for each fact record based on the Order_Date:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT
  delivery.delivery_cost,
  supplier.supplier_name,
  supplier.supplier_state
FROM delivery
INNER JOIN supplier
  ON delivery.supplier_code = supplier.supplier_code
 AND delivery.order_date BETWEEN supplier.start_date AND supplier.end_date
&lt;/source&gt;

Some cautions:
* [[Referential integrity]] by DBMS is not possible since there is not a unique key to create the relationship.
* If relationship is made with surrogate to solve problem above then one ends with entity tied to a specific time slice.
* If the join query is not written correctly, it may return duplicate rows and/or give incorrect answers.
* The date comparison might not perform well.
* Some [[Business Intelligence]] tools do not handle generating complex joins well.
* The [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] processes needed to create the dimension table needs to be carefully designed to ensure that there are no overlaps in the time periods for each distinct item of reference data.

==Combining types==
[[File:Scd model.png|thumb|Scd model example]]
Different SCD Types can be applied to different columns of a table. For example, we can apply Type 1 to the Supplier_Name column and Type 2 to the Supplier_State column of the same table.

Stewardship theorists assume that given a choice between self-serving behavior and pro-organizational behavior, a steward will place higher value on cooperation than defection. Stewards are assumed to be collectivists, pro-organizational, and trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, J. H., Schoorman, F. D., &amp; Donaldson, L. (1997). Toward a stewardship theory of management. Academy of Management Review, 22(1), 20-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American politics, an example of the stewardship theory is where a president practices a governing style based on belief, they have the duty to do whatever is necessary in national interest, unless prohibited by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Presidential-Power-The-stewardship-theory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the procedure is named using the generic [[alternative dispute resolution]] title, Turnaround ADR is not a procedure for resolving disputes. Rather, it offers a way for [[financial distress|financially stressed companies]] to reassess and restructure debts.

== Features ==
When a Turnaround ADR is applied, the [[debtor]] can maintain payment to business partners and customers. Only claims held by financial institutions participating in this procedure become subject to adjustment; if the relevant institutions reach consensus, the debts can be minimized.

Turnaround ADR is frequently misunderstood in the [[United States]] and other Western nations because no equivalent procedure exists there. Applying for or initiating a Turnaround ADR is not considered a [[Default (finance)|default]] triggering event. Rather, adopting a Turnaround ADR is considered a preferable procedure for financially distressed companies as it provides breathing space for such companies to focus on revitalizing their business. Such space is gained by the alleviation of debts against relevant financial institutions without adversely affecting integral business relationships with partners and customers.

A private operator certified by the [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]] and the [[Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry]], provides mediation services in a Turnaround ADR.  The [[Japanese Association of Turnaround Professionals]] (JATP) is the only private operator certified to provide mediation services for Turnaround ADR.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news | title = Japan Credit-Default Swaps Seen Unraveling on Aiful’s Bad Debts  | author = Yusuke Miyazawa | author2 = Shannon D.

'''Walter Elias Disney''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|z|n|i}};&lt;ref name="OD: pronunciation" /&gt; December 5, 1901{{snds}}December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the [[Modern animation in the United States|American animation industry]], he introduced several developments in the production of [[cartoon]]s. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most [[Academy Awards]] earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] Special Achievement Awards and an [[Emmy Award]], among other honors. Several of his films are included in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].

Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Brothers Studio]] with his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]. With [[Ub Iwerks]], Walt developed the character [[Mickey Mouse]] in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip [[Technicolor]], [[feature-length]] cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and [[live-action]] films followed after World War II, including the critically successful ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950) and ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.

In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the [[amusement park]] industry, and in 1955 he opened [[Disneyland]]. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Disneyland]]'' and ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''; he was also involved in planning the [[American National Exhibition|1959 Moscow Fair]], the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], and the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]], the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the "[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life, and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.

Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was [[Racism|racist]] or [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of [[American imperialism]]. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national [[cultural icon]]. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1901–1920===
Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's [[Hermosa, Chicago|Hermosa]] neighborhood.{{efn|In 1909, in a renumbering exercise, the property's address changed to 2156 North Tripp Avenue.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=8}}}} He was the fourth son of [[Elias Disney]]{{nsmdns}}born in the [[Province of Canada]], to Irish parents{{nsmdns}}and [[Flora Call Disney|Flora]] ({{nee}} Call), an American of German and English descent.&lt;ref name="ST: background" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt;{{efn|Disney was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny, a Frenchman who had traveled to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.{{sfnm|1a1=Mosley|1y=1990|1p=22|2a1=Eliot|2y=1995|2p=2}} The family [[anglicisation|anglicized]] the d'Isigny name to "Disney" and settled in the English village now known as [[Norton Disney]] in the [[East Midlands]].&lt;ref name=Ancestors /&gt;}} Aside from Disney, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, Raymond and [[Roy O.

In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=9–10, 15}} Elias was a subscriber to the ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'' newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of [[Ryan Walker (cartoonist)|Ryan Walker]].{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=13}} Disney also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons.&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt; He lived near the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] line and became enamored with trains.{{sfn|Broggie|2006|pp=33–35}} He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=16}}

In 1911, the Disneys moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=10}} There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School, where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of [[vaudeville]] and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=13}} Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[Kansas City Times]]''. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the ''Times'' before school and repeated the round for the evening ''Star'' after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=18–19}} He attended Saturday courses at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] and also took a [[correspondence course]] in cartooning.&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KCL: WD" /&gt;

===Early career: 1920–1928===
[[File:Walt Disney envelope ca. 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Walt Disney's business envelope featured a self-portrait {{circa|1921}}]]
In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1p=56|2a1=Barrier|2y=2007|2pp=24–25}} Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.&amp;nbsp;V. Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=25}} The company produced commercials using the [[cutout animation]] technique.{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=63}} Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' and ''[[Koko the Clown]]''. With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=57–58}}{{efn|The book, Edwin G. Lutz's ''Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development'' (1920), was the only one in the local library on the subject; the camera he borrowed from Cauger.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=57–58}}}} He came to the conclusion that [[cel animation]] was more promising than the cutout method.{{efn|Cutout animation is the technique of producing cartoons by animating objects cut from paper, material or photographs and photographing them moving incrementally. Cel animation is the method of drawing or painting onto transparent celluloid sheets ("cels"), with each sheet an incremental movement on from the previous.{{sfn|Withrow|2009|p=48}}}} Unable to persuade Cauger to try [[cel]] animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, [[Fred Harman]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=56}} Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as "Newman's Laugh-O-Grams".{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=14}} Disney studied [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry's]] ''[[Aesop's Fables (film series)|Aesop's Fables]]'' as a model, and the first six "Laugh-O-Grams" were modernized fairy tales.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=60}}

[[File:Newman Laugh-O-Gram (1921).webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|''Newman Laugh-O-Gram'' (1921)]]
In May 1921, the success of the "Laugh-O-Grams" led to the establishment of [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio]], for which he hired more animators, including Fred Harman's brother [[Harman and Ising|Hugh]], [[Harman and Ising|Rudolf Ising]] and Iwerks.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=60–61, 64–66}} The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the company solvent, so Disney started production of ''[[Alice's Wonderland]]''{{nsmdns}}based on ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''{{nsmdns}}which combined live action with animation; he cast [[Virginia Davis]] in [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the title role]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=15}} The result, a 12-and-a-half-minute, [[short film|one-reel]] film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.{{sfnm|1a1=Gabler|1y=2006|1pp=71–73|2a1=Nichols|2y=2014|2p=102}}

Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923. Although New York was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from [[tuberculosis]] there.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=39}} Disney's efforts to sell ''Alice's Wonderland'' were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor [[Margaret J. Winkler]]. She was losing the rights to both the ''[[Out of the Inkwell]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'' cartoons, and needed a new series. In October, they signed a contract for six [[Alice Comedies|''Alice'' comedies]], with an option for two further series of six episodes each.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=40}} Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studio{{nsmdns}}which later became [[The Walt Disney Company]]{{nsmdns}}to produce the films;{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=78}}&lt;ref name="WDC: About" /&gt; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=73–75}}

Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian Bounds]]. They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her hometown of [[Lewiston, Idaho]].&lt;ref name=wddiofclmt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D7peAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fC8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4762%2C3438544 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Walt Disney dies of cancer at 65 |date=December 16, 1966 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer [[Neal Gabler]] she did not "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=544}}{{efn|One possible exception to the stable relationship was during the making ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), where the stresses and turmoil associated with the production led to the couple discussing divorce.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=544}}}} Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, "content with household management and providing support for her husband".{{sfn|Watts|2013|p=352}} Their marriage produced two daughters, [[Diane Disney Miller|Diane]] (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously).{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=102, 131}}{{efn|Lillian had two miscarriages during the eight years between marriage and the birth of Diane; she suffered a further miscarriage shortly before the family adopted Sharon.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=102, 131}}}} Within [[Disney family|the family]], neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point.{{sfnm|1a1=Mosley|1y=1990|1p=169|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=280}} The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1p=196|2a1=Watts|2y=2013|2p=352}}

[[File:Trolley Troubles poster.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A cartoon rabbit is driving a tramcar; other cartoon rabbits are in, under, on and around the car.|Theatrical poster for ''[[Trolley Troubles]]'' (1927)]]
By 1926 Winkler's role in the distribution of the ''Alice'' series had been handed over to her husband, the film producer [[Charles Mintz]], although the relationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Alice Skids" /&gt; The series ran until July 1927,&lt;ref name="WDFM: Final Alice" /&gt; by which time Disney had begun to tire of it and wanted to move away from the mixed format to all animation.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Alice Skids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: Oswald" /&gt; After Mintz requested new material to distribute through [[Universal Pictures]], Disney and Iwerks created [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], a character Disney wanted to be "peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim".&lt;ref name="BBC: Oswald" /&gt;{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=83}}

In February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the ''Oswald'' series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for him, including Harman, Ising, [[Carman Maxwell]] and [[Friz Freleng]]. Disney also found out that Universal owned the [[intellectual property rights]] to Oswald. Mintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if Disney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=109}}&lt;ref name="WDFM: Secret Talks" /&gt;{{efn|In 2006, [[the Walt Disney Company]] finally re-acquired Oswald the Lucky Rabbit when its subsidiary [[ESPN]] purchased rights to the character, along with other properties from [[NBCUniversal]].&lt;ref name="EPSN: Oswald" /&gt;}}

===Creation of Mickey Mouse to the first Academy Awards: 1928–1933===
To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed [[Mickey Mouse]], possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are unclear.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=88}}{{efn|Several stories about the origins exist. Disney's biographer, [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], observes that "The birth of Mickey Mouse is obscured in legend, much of it created by Walt Disney himself."{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=88}}}} Disney's original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but Lillian thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey instead.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=112}}{{efn|The name Mortimer Mouse was used in the 1936 cartoon ''[[Mickey's Rival]]'' as a potential love-interest for [[Minnie Mouse]]. He was portrayed as a "humorous denigration of the smooth [[city slicker]]" with a smart car, but failed to win over Minnie from the more homespun Mickey.{{sfn|Watts|2013|p=73}}}} Iwerks revised Disney's provisional sketches to make the character easier to animate, and Disney provided Mickey's voice until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, "Ub designed Mickey's physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul."&lt;ref name="WDFM: MM" /&gt;

[[File:Steamboat-willie.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A cartoon mouse is operating a ship's steering wheel|The first appearance of [[Mickey Mouse]], in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928)]]
Mickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short ''[[Plane Crazy]]'', but it, and the second feature, ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'', failed to find a distributor.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=116}} Following the 1927 sensation ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', to create the first post-produced [[sound film|sound cartoon]]. After the animation was complete, Disney signed a contract with the former executive of Universal Pictures, [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], to use the "Powers Cinephone" recording system;{{sfn|Langer|2000}} Cinephone became the new distributor for Disney's early sound cartoons, which soon became popular.{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=23–24|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=129}}

To improve the quality of the music, Disney hired the professional composer and arranger [[Carl Stalling]], on whose suggestion the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, ''[[The Skeleton Dance]]'' (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]].{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=26–27|2a1=Langer|2y=2000}}{{efn|The [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]] consisted of [[Eric Larson]], [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], [[Les Clark]], [[Milt Kahl]], [[Ward Kimball]], [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Ollie Johnston]], [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] and [[John Lounsbery]].{{sfn|Langer|2000}}}} Both the Mickey Mouse and ''Silly Symphonies'' series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting lower-paid assistants [[Inbetweening|sketch the inbetween poses]]. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close.{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=26–27|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=142–44}} Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931{{nsmdns}}which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overwork{{nsmdns}}so he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|pp=59–60}}

[[File:Walt Disney 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Disney in 1935]]
With the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became increasingly popular, including internationally.&lt;ref name="Time: Rodent" /&gt;{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=26–27|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=142}}{{efn|By 1931 he was called Michael Maus in Germany, Michel Souris in France, Miguel Ratonocito or Miguel Pericote in Spain and Miki Kuchi in Japan.&lt;ref name="Time: Rodent" /&gt;}} Disney, always keen to embrace new technology, filmed ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' (1932) in full-color three-strip [[Technicolor]];{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=178}} he was also able to negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process until August 31, 1935.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrier|1y=1999|1p=167|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=179}} All subsequent ''Silly Symphony'' cartoons were in color.{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=28}} ''Flowers and Trees'' was popular with audiences{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=178}} and won the [[Academy Award]] for best [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Short Subject (Cartoon)]] at the [[5th Academy Awards|1932 ceremony]].

In 1933, Disney produced ''[[The Three Little Pigs (film)|The Three Little Pigs]]'', a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as "the most successful short animation of all time".&lt;ref name="SoC: 3 Pigs" /&gt; The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category. The film's success led to a further increase in the studio's staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=184–86}} Disney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that would interest the audience,{{sfn|Lee|Madej|2012|pp=55–56}} and he invested in a "story department" separate from the animators, with [[storyboard artist]]s who would detail the plots of Disney's films.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=186}}

===Golden age of animation: 1934–1941===

By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts,{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=129}} and began a four-year production of a feature-length cartoon, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', based on [[Snow White|the fairy tale]]. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it "Disney's Folly".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=270}} The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5&amp;nbsp;million to produce{{nsmdns}}three times over budget.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrier|1y=1999|1p=130|2a1=Finch|2y=1999|2p=59}} To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the [[Chouinard Art Institute]];&lt;ref name="Disney Myth" /&gt; he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement.&lt;ref name="Disney Experience" /&gt; To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney's animators developed a [[multiplane camera]] which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene. The first work created on the camera{{nsmdns}}a ''Silly Symphony'' called ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937){{nsmdns}}won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power. Although ''Snow White'' had been largely finished by the time the multiplane camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects.{{sfn|Williams|Denney|Denney|2004|p=116}}

''Snow White'' premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and by May 1939 its total gross of $6.5&amp;nbsp;million made it the most successful sound film made to that date.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=270}}{{efn|$1.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1937 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1937}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}; $6.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1939 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6500000|1936}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, according to calculations based on the [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|US}}}} Disney won another Honorary Academy Award, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar statuettes.&lt;ref name="AA: 1939" /&gt;{{efn|The citation for the award reads: "To Walt Disney for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, recognized as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field for the motion picture cartoon."&lt;ref name="AA: 1939" /&gt;}} The success of ''Snow White'' heralded one of the most productive eras for the studio; [[the Walt Disney Family Museum]] calls the following years "the 'Golden Age of Animation'{{nnbsp}}".&lt;ref name="WDFM: Golden Age" /&gt;{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=87}} With work on ''Snow White'' finished, the studio began producing ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' in early 1938 and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940, and neither performed well at the box office{{nsmdns}}partly because revenues from Europe had dropped following the start of [[World War II]] in 1939.

In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's [[Initial public offering|first public stock offering]] in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to [[Disney animators' strike|a 1941 animators' strike]] which lasted five weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ceplair|1a2=Englund|1y=1983|1p=158|2a1=Thomas|2y=1994|2pp=163–65|3a1=Barrier|3y=1999|3pp=171–73}} While a federal mediator from the [[National Labor Relations Board]] negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1pp=170–71|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=370–71}}{{efn|The trip inspired two combined live-action and animation works ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1945).{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=76}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=394–95}}}} As a result of the strike{{nsmdns}}and the financial state of the company{{nsmdns}}several animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result.{{sfnm|1a1=Langer|1y=2000|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=378}} The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1p=71|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=380–81}}

Shortly after the release of ''Dumbo'' in October 1941, the U.S. entered World War&amp;nbsp;II. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as ''Four Methods of Flush Riveting'' and ''Aircraft Production Methods''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1pp=184–85|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=382–83}} Disney also met with [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], and agreed to produce short [[Donald Duck]] cartoons to promote [[Series E bond|war bonds]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=384–85}} Disney also produced several [[Walt Disney's World War II propaganda production|propaganda productions]], including shorts such as ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]''{{nsmdns}}which won an Academy Award{{nsmdns}}and the 1943 feature film ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]''.{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=77}}

The military films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the feature film ''[[Bambi]]''{{nsmdns}}which had been in production since 1937{{nsmdns}}underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=399}} On top of the low earnings from ''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'', the company had debts of $4&amp;nbsp;million with the [[Bank of America]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Fiscal Crisis" /&gt;{{efn|$4&amp;nbsp;million in 1944 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1944}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, according to calculations based on the [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|US}}}} At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss the future of the company, the bank's chairman and founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]], told his executives, "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk.&amp;nbsp;...

Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions.{{sfn|Langer|2000}}{{efn|These included ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946), ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948) and ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949).{{sfn|Langer|2000}}}} In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'', with ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' the first; the film won the Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)]] category.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=445–46}}

In 1949, Disney and his family moved to a new home in the [[Holmby Hills]] district of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends [[Ward Kimball|Ward and Betty Kimball]], who already had their own [[Grizzly Flats Railroad|backyard railroad]], Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature [[live steam]] railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, [[Carolwood Pacific Railroad]], came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer [[Roger E.

===Theme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966===
In early 1950, Disney produced ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', his studio's first animated feature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences.

From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|p=110}}

[[File:WaltDisneyplansDisneylandDec1954.jpg|thumb|left|Disney shows the plans of [[Disneyland]] to officials from [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in December 1954]]
For several years Disney had been considering building a theme park. When he visited [[Griffith Park]] in Los Angeles with his daughters, he wanted to be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Dreaming" /&gt; He visited the [[Tivoli Gardens]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of the park.&lt;ref name="Disney Myth 2" /&gt; In March 1952 he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=233–34}} This site proved too small, and a larger plot in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], {{convert|35|mi|km}} south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studio{{nsmdns}}which might attract the criticism of shareholders{{nsmdns}}Disney formed WED Enterprises (now [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans;&lt;ref name="WDFM: WED" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WDFM: Genesis" /&gt; those involved became known as "Imagineers".{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=139}} After obtaining bank funding he invited other stockholders, [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres]]{{nsmdns}}part of [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC){{nsmdns}}and [[Western Publishing|Western Printing and Lithographing Company]].{{sfn|Langer|2000}} In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=246}} Construction work started in July 1954, and [[Disneyland]] opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70&amp;nbsp;million viewers.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=524, 530–32}} The park was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central [[Main Street, U.S.A.]]{{nsmdns}}a replica of the main street in his hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]], [[Frontierland]], [[Fantasyland]] and [[Tomorrowland]]. The park also contained the [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[Disneyland Railroad]] that linked the lands; around the outside of the park was a high [[berm]] to separate the park from the outside world.{{sfn|Eliot|1995|pp=225–26}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=498}} An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered that Disney had "tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow".&lt;ref name="NYT: Topics" /&gt; Although there were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a month's operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of its first year, it attracted 3.6&amp;nbsp;million guests.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=537}}

The money from ABC was contingent on Disney television programs.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=508–09}} The studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of ''Alice in Wonderland''. Roy believed the program added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to shareholders, he wrote that "television can be a most powerful selling aid for us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise that we enter television when we do".{{sfn|Langer|2000}} In 1954, after the Disneyland funding had been agreed, ABC broadcast ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Disneyland]]'', an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library. The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=511}}{{efn|Even repeats of the program proved more popular than all other television shows—aside from [[Lucille Ball]]'s ''[[I Love Lucy]]''; no ABC program had ever been in the top 25 before ''Disneyland''.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=511}}}} In April 1955, ''[[Newsweek]]'' called the series an "American institution".&lt;ref name="NW: Wonderful" /&gt; ABC was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney's first daily television program, ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', a variety show catering specifically to children.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=520–21}} The program was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to the show).{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=245}} One of the segments of ''Disneyland'' consisted of the five-part [[miniseries]] ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' which, according to Gabler, "became an overnight sensation".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=514}} The show's theme song, "[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]", became internationally popular, and ten million records were sold.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=257}} As a result, Disney formed his own record production and distribution entity, [[Walt Disney Records|Disneyland Records]].{{sfn|Hollis|Ehrbar|2006|pp=5–12, 20}}

As well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects away from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 [[American National Exhibition]] in Moscow; Disney Studios' contribution was ''[[America the Beautiful (Disney)|America the Beautiful]]'', a 19-minute film in the 360-degree [[Circle-Vision 360°|Circarama theater]] that was one of the most popular attractions.{{sfn|Langer|2000}} The following year he acted as the chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley, California]], where he designed the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening, closing and medal ceremonies]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=566}}

[[File:Walt disney portrait right.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Disney in 1954]]
Despite the demands wrought by non-studio projects, Disney continued to work on film and television projects. In 1955, he was involved in "[[Man in Space]]", an episode of the ''Disneyland'' series, which was made in collaboration with [[NASA]] rocket designer [[Wernher von Braun]].{{efn|The program, which was produced by [[Ward Kimball]], was nominated for an Academy Award for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary (Short Subject)]] at the [[29th Academy Awards|1957 Awards]].&lt;ref name="AA:1957" /&gt;}} Disney also oversaw aspects of the full-length features ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (the first animated film in [[CinemaScope]]) in 1955, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (the first animated film in [[Technirama]] [[70 mm film]]) in 1959, ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (the first animated feature film to use [[Traditional animation#Xerography|Xerox cels]]) in 1961, and ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' in 1963.{{sfn|Finch|1999|pp=82–85}}

In 1964, Disney produced ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', based on [[Mary Poppins|the book series]] by [[P. L. Travers]]; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s.{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=130}} It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although Travers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights.&lt;ref name="DT: Travers dislike" /&gt; The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=298}}

Disney provided four exhibits for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], for which he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For [[PepsiCo]], who planned a tribute to [[UNICEF]], Disney developed [[It's a Small World]], a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]] contained an animatronic [[Abraham Lincoln]] giving excerpts from his speeches; [[Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress|Carousel of Progress]] promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibits{{nsmdns}}principally concepts and technology{{nsmdns}}were re-installed in Disneyland, although It's a Small World is the ride that most closely resembles the original.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=293}}&lt;ref name="WDFM: Fair" /&gt;

During the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a [[ski resort]] in [[Mineral King]], a glacial valley in California's [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]]. He hired experts such as the renowned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer [[Willy Schaeffler]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=621–23}}&lt;ref name="Ski: Schaeffler" /&gt;{{efn|Disney's death in 1966, and opposition from conservationists, stopped the building of the resort.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=631}}}} With income from Disneyland accounting for an increasing proportion of the studio's income, Disney continued to look for venues for other attractions. In late 1965, he announced plans to develop another theme park to be called "Disney World" (now [[Walt Disney World]]), a few miles southwest of [[Orlando, Florida]]. Disney World was to include the "Magic Kingdom"{{nsmdns}}a larger and more elaborate version of Disneyland{{nsmdns}}plus golf courses and resort hotels. The heart of Disney World was to be the "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" ([[EPCOT (concept)|EPCOT]]),{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=606–08}} which he described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed, but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and systems. And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise.{{sfn|Beard|1982|p=11}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=307}} He increased his involvement in the studio's films, and was heavily involved in the story development of ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', the live-action musical feature ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'' (both 1967) and the animated short ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1p=343|2a1=Barrier|2y=2007|2p=276}}

==Personality and reputation==
[[File:Disney1968.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A portrait of Disney with cartoon representations of different nationalities on a 6 cent US stamp|1968 U.S. postage stamp]]
Disney's public persona was very different from his actual personality.&lt;ref name="PBS trailer 2" /&gt; Playwright [[Robert E. Sherwood]] described him as "almost painfully shy&amp;nbsp;... diffident" and self-deprecating.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=204}} According to his biographer [[Richard Schickel]], Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity.{{sfn|Schickel|1986|p=341}} Kimball argues that Disney "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" and knew that he was doing so.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=205}} Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that "I'm not Walt Disney. I do a lot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink."&lt;ref name="PBS trailer 1" /&gt; Critic [[Otis Ferguson]], in ''[[The New Republic]]'', called the private Disney: "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=205}} Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise.{{sfn|Norman|2013|p=64}} Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=77}}

Views of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions.{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=84}} Mark Langer, in the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', writes that "Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture."{{sfn|Langer|2000}} Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney "as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas",{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=84}} while [[PBS]] records that critics have censured his work because of its "smooth façade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history".&lt;ref name="PBS: AmEx" /&gt; Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time,{{sfn|Langer|2000}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} there were criticisms by reviewers. [[C. A. Lejeune|Caroline Lejeune]] comments in ''[[The Observer]]'' that ''Snow White'' (1937) "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn."&lt;ref name="Obs: Snow White" /&gt; Robin Allen, writing for ''The Times'', notes that ''Fantasia'' (1940) was "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into [[bathos]]",&lt;ref name="Times: Fantasia" /&gt; while Lejeune, reviewing ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1951), feels the film "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy".&lt;ref name="Obs: Alice" /&gt; ''Peter Pan'' (1953) was criticized in ''The Times'' as "a children's classic vulgarized" with "Tinker Bell&amp;nbsp;... a peroxided American cutie". The reviewer opined that Disney "has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place".&lt;ref name="Times: PP" /&gt;

Disney has been accused of [[antisemitism|anti-Semitism]],&lt;ref name="NYT: Dargis" /&gt;{{efn|For example, the animator [[Art Babbitt]], an organizer of the 1941 strike at Disney's studio, claimed that he saw Disney and his lawyer attend meetings of the [[German American Bund]], a pro-Nazi organization, during the late 1930s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=448}} Gabler questions Babbitt's claim on the basis that Disney had no time for political meetings and was "something of a political naïf" during the 1930s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=448, 457}}}} although none of his employees{{nsmdns}}including the animator [[Art Babbitt]], who disliked Disney intensely{{nsmdns}}ever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=448, 457}} The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons.{{efn|Examples include ''The Three Little Pigs'' (in which the Big Bad Wolf comes to the door dressed as a Jewish peddler) and ''[[The Opry House]]'' (in which Mickey Mouse is dressed and dances as a [[Hasidic Jew]]).{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=456}}&lt;ref name="Creative Explosion" /&gt;}} Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named "1955 Man of the Year" by the [[B'nai B'rith]] chapter in Beverly Hills,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=456}}&lt;ref name="Creative Explosion" /&gt; and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=455}}{{efn|As pointed out by story artist [[Joe Grant]], which included himself, production manager Harry Tytle, and head of merchandising [[Kay Kamen]], who once quipped that Disney's New York office had "more Jews than The Book of Leviticus"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=455}}}} Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-Semitism and that Disney was "not [anti-Semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning some members of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|MPAPAI]]], and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life".&lt;ref name="CBS: Gabler" /&gt; Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=611}}

Disney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}{{efn|Examples include ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'', in which Mickey Mouse dresses in [[blackface]]; the black-colored bird in the short ''Who Killed Cock Robin''; the American Indians in ''Peter Pan''; and the crows in ''Dumbo'' (although the case has been made that the crows were sympathetic to Dumbo because they knew what it was like to be ostracized).{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}}} The feature film ''[[Song of the South]]'' was criticized by contemporary film critics, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], and others for its perpetuation of [[Stereotypes of African Americans|black stereotypes]],{{sfn|Cohen|2004|p=60}} but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, [[James Baskett]], the first black actor so honored.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=438–39}}{{efn|Baskett died shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for his support.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=438–39}}}} Gabler argues that "Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}} [[Floyd Norman]], the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, "Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of people{{nsmdns}}and by this I mean all people{{nsmdns}}can only be called exemplary."{{sfn|Korkis|2012|p=xi}}

Watts argues that many of Disney's post World War II films "legislated a kind of cultural [[Marshall Plan]]. They nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States."{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=107}} Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney's studio as an "agent of manipulation and repression", although he observes that it has "labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy".{{sfn|Telotte|2008|p=19}} John Tomlinson, in his study ''Cultural Imperialism'', examines the work of [[Ariel Dorfman]] and [[Armand Mattelart]], whose 1971 book {{lang|es|Para leer al Pato Donald}} (trans: ''[[How to Read Donald Duck]]'') identifies that there are "imperialist&amp;nbsp;... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome façade of the world of Walt Disney"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as "it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children."{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=41}} Tomlinson views their argument as flawed, as "they simply ''assume'' that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent&amp;nbsp;... ['[[Yankee]]'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=44}}

Several commentators have described Disney as a [[cultural icon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mannheim|1y=2016|1p=40|2a1=Krasniewicz|2y=2010|2p=xxii|3a1=Watts|3y=2013|3p=58| 4a1=Painter| 4y=2008|4p=25}} On Disney's death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those "considered valuable in American Christian society", which include "individualism, decency,&amp;nbsp;... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration".&lt;ref name="Izard: Master" /&gt; Disney's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' calls the films "wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining&amp;nbsp;... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty".&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; Journalist [[Bosley Crowther]] argues that Disney's "achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history."&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt; Correspondent [[Alistair Cooke]] calls Disney a "folk-hero&amp;nbsp;... the Pied Piper of Hollywood",&lt;ref name="Guard: Cooke" /&gt; while Gabler considers Disney "reshaped the culture and the American consciousness".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} In the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', Langer writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Disney remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.{{sfn|Langer|2000}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
