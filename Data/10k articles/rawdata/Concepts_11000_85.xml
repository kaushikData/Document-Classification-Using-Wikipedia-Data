{{UML diagram types}}
'''Activity diagrams''' are graphical representations of [[workflow]]s of stepwise activities and actions&lt;ref&gt;[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0077110005/student_view0/glossary.html Glossary of Key Terms] at McGraw-hill.com. Retrieved 20 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with support for choice, iteration and concurrency. In the [[Unified Modeling Language]], activity diagrams are intended to model both computational and organizational processes (i.e., workflows), as well as the data flows intersecting with the related activities.&lt;ref&gt;UML Revision Task Force. OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification, Version 1.4 (final draft). February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Rumbaugh, I. Jacobson, and G. Booch. The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual. Addison-Wesley, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Although activity diagrams primarily show the overall flow of control, they can also include elements showing the flow of data between activities through one or more data stores.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Construction==
Activity diagrams are constructed from a limited number of shapes, connected with arrows.&lt;ref&gt;OMG Unified Modeling Language Superstructure Specification, version 2.1.1. Document
formal/2007-02-05, Object Management Group, February 2007. http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/2007-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important shape types:
* ''ellipses'' represent ''actions'';
* ''diamonds'' represent ''decisions'';
* ''bars'' represent the start (''split'') or end (''join'') of concurrent activities;
* a ''black circle'' represents the start (''initial node'') of the workflow;
* an ''encircled black circle'' represents the end (''final node'').
Arrows run from the start towards the end and represent the order in which activities happen.

Activity diagrams can be regarded as a form of a structured [[flowchart]] combined with a traditional data flow diagram. Typical flowchart techniques lack constructs for expressing concurrency.&lt;ref&gt;Jibitesh Mishra and Ashok Mohanty. Software Engineering. Pearson Education, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the join and split symbols in activity diagrams only resolve this for simple cases; the meaning of the model is not clear when they are arbitrarily combined with decisions or loops.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

While in UML 1.x, activity diagrams were a specialized form of state diagrams,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dumas, Marlon]], and [[Arthur H.M. Ter Hofstede]]. "UML activity diagrams as a workflow specification language." ≪ UML≫ 2001—The Unified Modeling Language. Modeling Languages, Concepts, and Tools. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2001. 76-90.&lt;/ref&gt; in UML 2.x, the activity diagrams were reformalized to be based on [[Petri net]]-like semantics, increasing the scope of situations that can be modeled using activity diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Störrle, Harald, and J. H. Hausmann. "semantics of uml 2.0 activities." Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes cause many UML 1.x activity diagrams to be interpreted differently in UML 2.x.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

UML activity diagrams in version 2.x can be used in various domains, e.g. in design of embedded systems. It is possible to verify such a specification using model checking technique.&lt;ref&gt;I. Grobelna, M. Grobelny, M. Adamski, "Model Checking of UML Activity Diagrams in Logic Controllers Design", Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Dependability and Complex Systems DepCoS-RELCOMEX, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing Volume 286, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, pp. 233-242, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirects here|Adaptive|other uses|Adaptation (disambiguation)}}
'''Adaptive behavior''' refers to behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to get along in his or her environment with greatest success and least conflict with others.  This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education.  Adaptive behavior relates to every day skills or tasks that the average person is able to complete, similar to the term [[life skills]].

Nonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome. For example, a constant [[habit (psychology)|repetitive action]] could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something. In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else.

In contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive. For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term. Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of [[abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]] or [[mental dysfunction]], since its assessment is relatively free from [[subjectivity]]. However, many behaviors considered [[morality|moral]] can be maladaptive, such as [[dissent]] or [[abstinence]].

Adaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living. Behavior patterns change throughout a person's development, across life settings and social constructs, changes in personal values, and the expectations of others. It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally.

==Examples==
*A child born with cerebral palsy will most likely have a form of [[hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] (the weakening, or loss of use, of one side of the body). In order to adapt to one's environment, the child may use these limbs as helpers, in some cases even adapt the use of their mouth and teeth as a tool used for more than just eating or conversation.
*Frustration from lack of the ability to verbalize one's own needs can lead to tantrums. In addition, it may lead to the use of signs or sign language to communicate one's desires. One subject that is pertinent to this article is [[ABA therapy]]. "Applied means that interventions are geared toward achieving socially-important goals, helping people be more successful in natural settings such as homes, schools, and communities. Behavioral means that ABA focuses on what people say or do, rather than interpretations or assumptions about behavior. And analytic means that assessments are used to identify relationships between behavior and aspects of the environment (e.g., screaming occurs most when Johnny is given a difficult task and allows him to delay or avoid that activity) before proceeding to intervention."&lt;ref name="Meme Hieneman, Viviana Gonzalez, &amp; Paula Chan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hieneman|first=Meme|url=http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com/news/what-aba-now-really-autism-33299272|publisher=Autism Support Network|accessdate=10 May 2013|title=What is ABA Therapy now, really?|author2=Viviana Gonzalez|author3=Paula Chan|page=2}} cited at [http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com Austism Support Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core problems==
Limitations in self-care skills and social relationships, as well as behavioral excesses are common characteristics of individuals with mental disabilities. Individuals with mental disabilities who require extensive supports are often taught basic self care skills such as dressing, eating, and hygiene.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt; Direct instruction and environmental supports, such as added prompts and simplified routines are necessary to ensure that deficits in these adaptive areas do not come to seriously limit one's quality of life.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt;

Most children with milder forms of mental disabilities learn how to take care of their basic needs, but they often require training in self-management skills to achieve the levels of performance necessary for eventual [[activities of daily living|independent living]]. Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships present significant challenges for many persons with mental disabilities. Limited cognitive processing skills, poor language development, and unusual or inappropriate behaviors can seriously impede interacting with others. Teaching students with mental disabilities appropriate social and interpersonal skills is one of the most important functions of special education. Students with mental disabilities more often exhibit behavior problems than children without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt; Some of the behaviors observed by students with mental disabilities are difficulties accepting criticism, limited self-control, and inappropriate behaviors. The greater the severity of the mental disabilities, generally the higher the incidence of behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt;

==Adaptive behaviors in education==
In education, adaptive behavior is defined as that which (1) meets the needs of the community of stakeholders (parents, teachers, peers, and later employers) and (2) meets the needs of the learner, ''now'' and ''in the future''. Specifically, these behaviors include such things as effective speech, self-help, using money, cooking, and reading, for example.

Training in adaptive behavior is a key component of any educational program, but is critically important for children with special needs. The [[US Department of Education]] has allocated billions of dollars ($12.3 billion in 2008) for Special Education programs aimed at improving educational and early intervention outcomes for children with disabilities. 
In 2001, the [[United States National Research Council]] published a comprehensive review of interventions for children and adults diagnosed with [[autism]]. The review indicates that interventions based on [[applied behavior analysis]] have been effective with these groups.

Adaptive behavior includes socially responsible and independent performance of daily activities. However, the specific activities and skills needed may differ from setting to setting. When a student is going to school, school and academic skills are adaptive. However, some of those same skills might be useless or maladaptive in a job settings, so the transition between school and job needs careful attention.

==Specific skills==
Adaptive behavior includes the age-appropriate behaviors necessary for people to live independently and to function safely and appropriately in daily life. Adaptive behaviors include life skills such as grooming, dressing, safety, food handling, working, money management, cleaning, making friends, social skills, and the personal [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] expected of their age and [[social group]].&lt;ref name="Heward"&gt;William Heward: ''Exceptional Children'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Specific skills include:

==Adaptive skills==
Every human being must learn a set of skills that is beneficial for the environments and communities they live in. Adaptive skills are stepping stones toward accessing and benefiting from local or remote communities. This means that, in urban environments, to go to the movies, a child will have to learn to navigate through the town or take the bus, read the movie schedule, and pay for the movie. Adaptive skills allow for safer exploration because they provide the learner with an increased awareness of his/her surroundings and of changes in context, that require new adaptive responses to meet the demands and dangers of that new context. Adaptive skills may generate more opportunities to engage in meaningful social interactions and acceptance. Adaptive skills are socially acceptable and desirable at any age and regardless of gender (with the exception of gender specific biological differences such as menstrual care skills, etc.)

===Learning adaptive skills===
Adaptive skills encompass a range of daily situations and they usually start with a [[task analysis]]. The task analysis will reveal all the steps necessary to perform the task in the natural environment. The use of behavior analytic procedures has been documented, with children, adolescents and adults, under the guidance of behavior analysts&lt;ref&gt;[[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]&lt;/ref&gt; and supervised behavioral technicians. The list of applications has a broad scope and it is in continuous expansion as more research is carried out in applied behavior analysis (see ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'', ''[[The Analysis of Verbal Behavior]]'').

== Practopoietic theory ==
According to '''practopoietic''' theory,&lt;ref name=Nikolic2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; creation of adaptive behavior involves special, ''poietic'' interactions among different levels of system organization. These interactions are described on the basis of [[cybernetic]] theory in particular, [[good regulator]] theorem. In practopoietic systems, lower levels of organization determine the properties of higher levels of organization, but not the other way around. This ensures that lower levels of organization (e.g., genes) always possess cybernetically more general knowledge than the higher levels of organization&amp;mdash;knowledge at a higher level being a special case of the knowledge at the lower level. At the highest level of organization lies the overt behavior. Cognitive operations lay in the middle parts of that hierarchy, above genes and below behavior. For behavior to be adaptive, at least three adaptive traverses are needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15380">'''Alternatives assessment''' or '''alternatives analysis''' is a problem-solving approach used in [[environmental design]], [[environmental technology|technology]], and [[environmental policy|policy]]. It aims to minimize environmental harm by comparing multiple potential solutions in the context of a specific problem, design goal, or policy objective. It is intended to inform decision-making in situations with many possible courses of action, a wide range of variables to consider, and significant degrees of uncertainty. Alternatives assessment was originally developed as a robust way to guide [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] action and avoid [[Analysis paralysis|paralysis by analysis]]; authors such as O'Brien have presented alternatives assessment as an approach that is complementary to [[risk assessment]], the dominant decision-making approach in environmental policy.&lt;ref name="obrien_2000"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-15051-4| last = O'Brien| first = Mary| title = Making better environmental decisions: An alternative to risk assessment| location = Cambridge| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Ashford has described the similar concept of ''technology options analysis'' as a way to generate innovative solutions to the problems of industrial pollution more effectively than through risk-based regulation.&lt;ref name="ashford_1994"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Resources for the Future| isbn = 0-915707-74-8| pages = 275–314| editor = Adam M. Finkel| editor2 = Dominic Golding| last = Ashford| first = Nicholas A.| title = Worst things first?

Alternatives assessment is practiced in a variety of settings, including but not limited to [[green chemistry]], [[sustainable design]], supply-chain chemicals management, and chemicals policy.&lt;ref name="geiser_2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-51206-0| last = Geiser| first = Ken| title = Chemicals without harm: Policies for a sustainable world| location = Cambridge, Mass.| series = Urban and industrial environments| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent application area for alternatives assessment is the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, also known as chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| isbn = 978-1-84973-723-4| editor = Roy M. Harrison| editor2 = Ronald E. Hester| title = Chemical alternatives assessments| location = Cambridge| series = Issues in Environmental Science and Technology| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

Generally, alternatives assessment involves considering a number of possible options to achieve a specific objective, and applying a principled comparative analysis. The objective is usually to improve the environmental performance or safety of a specific product, material, process, or other activity. Potential alternatives considered in the analysis may include different chemical substances, materials, technologies, methods of use, or even extensive redesign to enable new ways of achieving the objective while avoiding the problem. Understanding the consequences of each available option is central to the process and goals of alternatives assessment, because this helps avoid decisions that substitute one problem with another (unknown) problem. The comparative analysis can involve any number of criteria for evaluating options, and these are typically focused on environmental health and sustainability.&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| last1 = Rossi| first1 = Mark| last2 = Tickner| first2 = Joel| last3 = Geiser| first3 = Ken| title = Alternatives assessment framework of the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| location = Lowell, MA| url=http://www.sustainableproduction.org/downloads/FinalAltsAssess06_000.pdf| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single protocol that dictates how options should be identified, evaluated, and compared in an alternatives assessment. Rather, a number of different alternatives assessment ''frameworks'' exist, which serve to structure decision-making and to enable systematic consideration of the key factors. Jacobs and colleagues identify six major components of alternatives assessment: evaluation of [[Hazard (risk)|hazard]], exposure, [[Life-cycle assessment|life cycle]] impacts, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility; and an overall decision-making strategy.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.1409581| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 124| issue = 3| last1 = Jacobs| first1 = Molly M.| last2 = Malloy| first2 = Timothy F.| last3 = Tickner| first3 = Joel A.| last4 = Edwards| first4 = Sally| title = Alternatives assessment frameworks: Research needs for the informed substitution of hazardous chemicals| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2016-03-01| pmid=26339778| pmc=4786344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major framework, the [https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/ Lowell Center for Sustainable Production] Alternatives Assessment Framework,&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk" /&gt; conceives of alternatives assessment very broadly, as a reflexive problem-solving process that recognizes the social and technical complexity of environmental problems. It emphasizes aspects such as stakeholder participation, transparency of the process, and open discussion of values in decision-making. Most other frameworks are more narrow and primarily focused on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016" /&gt;

=== Chemical alternatives assessment ===

Chemical alternatives assessment (or ''substitution of hazardous chemicals'') is the use of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances. Safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals may simply be other chemical substances, or may involve deeper changes in material or product design.&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es1015789| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 44| issue = 24| pages = 9244–9249| last1 = Lavoie| first1 = Emma T.| last2 = Heine| first2 = Lauren G.| last3 = Holder| first3 = Helen| last4 = Rossi| first4 = Mark S.| last5 = Lee| first5 = Robert E.| last6 = Connor| first6 = Emily A.| last7 = Vrabel| first7 = Melanie A.| last8 = DiFiore| first8 = David M.| last9 = Davies| first9 = Clive L.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: Enabling substitution to safer chemicals| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2010-12-15| pmid=21062050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tickner_2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es503328m| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 49| issue = 2| pages = 742–749| last1 = Tickner| first1 = Joel A.| last2 = Schifano| first2 = Jessica N.| last3 = Blake| first3 = Ann| last4 = Rudisill| first4 = Catherine| last5 = Mulvihill| first5 = Martin J.| title = Advancing safer alternatives through functional substitution| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment aims to provide the basis for well-informed decision-making by thoroughly characterizing chemicals and materials (and other design options) across a wide range of environmental and health impact categories. The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a [[carcinogen]]ic chemical with a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] one), 
and to minimize the [[unintended consequences]] of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance—in other words, to prevent "[[Hazard substitution#Regrettable substitutions|regrettable substitutions]]", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad.&lt;ref name="howard_2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.02.034| issn = 0045-6535| last = Howard| first = Gregory J.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: The case of flame retardants| journal = Chemosphere| date = 2014| volume=116| pages=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An array of methodologies and tools for chemical alternatives assessment have been developed worldwide and have been deployed in a variety of industry sectors.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd_toolbox"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| title = OECD substitution and alternatives assessment toolbox| url = http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment frameworks include [[chemical hazard]] assessment methods that consider a wide range of hazard [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], such as those defined in the
[[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]] or the [[GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals]].

=== Examples ===

* The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute has conducted alternatives assessments for the substitution of hazardous substances like lead and formaldehyde.&lt;ref name="turi_five"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Toxics Use Reduction Institute| title = Five Chemicals Alternatives Assessment Study| accessdate = 2016-07-31| date = 2006| url = http://www.turi.org/TURI_Publications/TURI_Methods_Policy_Reports/Five_Chemicals_Alternatives_Assessment_Study._2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of alternatives assessment ==

Scientists from a variety of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and firms have contributed to developing the practice of alternatives assessment.

=== In the United States ===

Scientific research in the US federal government has contributed to alternatives assessment frameworks and practices. In 2014 the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] released a chemical alternatives assessment framework developed by an expert working group.&lt;ref name="nrc_2014"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The National Academies Press| isbn = 978-0-309-31013-0| author = National Research Council (US)| title = A framework to guide selection of chemical alternatives| location = Washington, D.C| url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18872/a-framework-to-guide-selection-of-chemical-alternatives| date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] ran a program called ''Design for the Environment'' (now called [https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice Safer Choice]), which developed chemical alternatives assessment methodology&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010" /&gt; and created partnerships to undertake numerous alternatives assessments for chemicals of concern in products.&lt;ref name="usepa_dfe"&gt;{{Cite web| author = US Environmental Protection Agency| title = Design for the Environment alternatives assessments| url = https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/design-environment-alternatives-assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives assessment has featured in some state-level chemicals policies and regulatory activities. The [[Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute]] has provided public technical assistance for "toxics use reduction planning", which includes alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="eliason_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.05.011| issn = 0959-6526| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 517–526| last1 = Eliason| first1 = Pamela| last2 = Morose| first2 = Gregory| title = Safer alternatives assessment: The Massachusetts process as a model for state governments| journal = Journal of Cleaner Production| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] is implementing new regulations that require firms to undertake alternatives assessments for selected priority chemicals in products.&lt;ref name="ca_dtsc_aa"&gt;{{Cite web| author = California Department of Toxic Substances Control| title = Alternatives analysis| work = Safer Consumer Products (SCP)| url = http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/AA.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse, an association of state governments, has also produced its own guide to alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="ic2_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse| title = IC2 Alternatives assessment guide, version 1.0| url=http://theic2.org/article/download-pdf/file_name/IC2_AA_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US-based companies have begun to use chemical alternatives assessment to address chemical safety issues in supply chains. For example, firms that participate in the [http://bizngo.org/ Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials] have produced their own guidance for chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="bizngo_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials (BizNGO)| title = BizNGO chemical alternatives assessment protocol| url=http://www.bizngo.org/alternatives-assessment/chemical-alternatives-assessment-protocol| date = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

The Sweden-based non-governmental organization [[ChemSec]] has been active in developing resources and tools for the substitution of hazardous chemicals.  The [http://www.subsport.eu/ Substitution support portal (SUBSPORT)] is an EU-based collaboratively-developed resource for chemical substitution.&lt;ref name="lissner_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2190/NS.21.3.l| issn = 1541-3772| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 477–497| last1 = Lissner| first1 = Lothar| last2 = Romano| first2 = Dolores| title = Substitution for hazardous chemicals on an international level—The approach of the European project "SUBSPORT"| journal = NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy| date = 2011-01-01| pmid=22001043}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes alternatives assessment case studies.

'''Ars Electronica''' Linz GmbH is an [[Austria]]n cultural, educational and scientific institute active in the field of [[new media art]], founded in [[Linz]] in 1979. It is based at the [[Ars Electronica Center]], which houses the Museum of the Future, in the city of [[Linz]]. Ars Electronica’s activities focus on the interlinkages between art, technology and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts [[R&amp;D]] facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] awards.

==History==
[[File:Linz Ars electronica center rotblau DL.jpg|thumb|left|Night view of the Center]]
Ars Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, [[Hubert Bognermayr]], [[Herbert W. Franke]], and Ulrich Rützel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz [[GmbH]] was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodelled in 2009.

Funding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of [[Upper Austria]] and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. In 2014 the organization is headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.aec.at/about/en/ Ars Electronica website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Ars Electronica festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as "a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention".&lt;ref name=website /&gt; The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding  lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Each year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, from 4–8 September, had as its theme "C... What it Takes to Change", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/c/en/ Ars Electronica website, “Ars Electronica 2014”]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features at the 2014 festival===

====Device art====
[[File:Ars electronica center 2012 j.jpg|thumb|left|"Außer Kontrolle" (Out of Control), exhibit at the Center during Ars Electronica 2012]]
A form of [[concept art]], Device Art has been described as "...a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different".&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Skyring, [http://www.dw.de/when-technology-takes-over-your-life-turn-your-machine-into-the-message/a-17932400 When technology takes over your life, turn your machine into the message], [[Deutsche Welle]], 19 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:
* "Otamatone" – a musical instrument shaped like a musical note.
* "Food Simulator", in which a pressure sensor in the user's mouth simulates the sensation of chewing food.
* "Lenticular Bicycle" - an old fashioned bicycle with a screen carousel mounted above the handlebars, known as "Sustainable Cinema No. 2" and created by Scott Hessels.
* A robot that performs street begging, made from recycled computer parts, with a voice and robotic hands.
* "Touchy", a "human camera", devised by the Hong Kong-based artist Eric Suiss.

{{Main|Ars Electronica Center}}
The Center, also known as the "Museum of the Future", is housed in a modern complex of buildings by the [[Danube]]. It acts as Ars Electronica’s permanent base and showcase. The majority of the space is used for public exhibitions and events, with an emphasis on interactivity and participation. Major themes are life sciences, environmental issues, and preparation for impending technological developments with likely impacts on society.

There is also provision for conferences, workshops, and R&amp;D. The Center was enhanced and expanded in 2009, coincident with Linz’s term as [[European Capital of Culture]]. It is the most-visited museum in Linz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/center/en/ Ars Electronica website, “Ars Electronica Center”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Futurelab==
The Futurelab, housed at the Ars Electronica Center, is a center of expertise for multidisciplinary research and development of new cyberarts technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/aktuelles/about/ Ars Electronica website, "About Ars Electronica Futurelab"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is staffed by about 25 permanent team members, and offers residencies to established and emerging artists and researchers.

The Futurelab has produced infrastructure and content for the Center and Festival. More recently it has engaged in joint ventures with universities and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/network/ Ars Electronica website, "Futurelab Network"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trent Nathaniel Grover has included an Appendix about Ars Electronica in his book "Dream of the Techno-Shaman" (2008).&lt;ref name=Grover&gt;Trent Nathaniel Grover (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EOOulf5psXEC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Ars+Electronica%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NpdCVKipDYbP7gaY4oGQCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ars%20Electronica%22&amp;f=false Dream of the Techno-Shaman], Appendix A ("Ars Electronica: Towards the Integration of Art, Technology, and Society"), pp. 53-68, ProQuest&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the institute’s activities as “a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society”.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|53}} Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as “beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology”.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|67}} Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the [[Modernism|Modernist]] call for "art for art’s sake".&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Grover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica "will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society".&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

In [[Developmental psychology|development]] or [[morality|moral]], [[political]], and [[bioethics|bioethical]] [[philosophy]], '''autonomy'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Greek]]: αὐτονομία ''autonomia'' from αὐτόνομος ''autonomos'' from αὐτο- ''auto-'' "self" and νόμος ''nomos'', "law", hence when combined understood to mean "one who gives oneself one's own [[law]]"&lt;/ref&gt; is the capacity to make an informed, un-coerced decision. '''Autonomous''' [[organization]]s or [[institution]]s are independent or self-governing. Autonomy can also be defined from human resource perspective and it means a level of discretion granted to an employee in his or her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=C.R.|title=Autonomy without a self}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, autonomy is known to bring some sense of job satisfaction among the employees. Autonomy is a term that is also widely used and in the field of medicine. As a matter of fact, personal autonomy is greatly recognized and valued in health care.

==Sociology==
In the [[sociology of knowledge]], a branch of [[sociology]], a controversy over the boundaries of autonomy stopped at the concept of relative autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Pierre Bourdieu|BOURDIEU, 2001]] (MARANHÃO, 2005; [http://www.encontroanpocs.org.br/2006/lista_gt.asp?atvid=26&amp;entid=66 2006]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008165230/http://www.encontroanpocs.org.br/2006/lista_gt.asp?atvid=26&amp;entid=66 |date=October 8, 2010 }}; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610214637/http://www.sbsociologia.com.br/congresso_v02/papers/GT3%20Ci%C3%AAncia%2C%20Tecnologia%20e%20Inova%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Social/A%20Autonomia%20Reflexiva%20e%20o%20Fomento%20do%20CNPq%20%C3%A0%20Pesquisa%20no%20Campo%20da%20Sociologia%20%282000-2006%29.pdf 2007]; [http://www.flacsoandes.org/dspace/bitstream/10469/382/1/Íconos%20no.31%20-%20mayo%202008.pdf SOBRAL &amp; MARANHÃO, 2008]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; until a typology of autonomy was created and developed within [[science and technology studies]]. According to it, the contemporary form of science's existing autonomy is the [[reflexive autonomy]]: actors and structures within the [[scientific]] field are able to translate or to reflect diverse themes presented by social and political fields, as well as influence them regarding the thematic choices on research projects.

===Institutional autonomy===
[[Institutional]] autonomy is having the capacities as a legislator to be able to implant and pursue official goals. The institutions are responsible for finding the right amount of resources or modify their current plans, programs, courses, responsibilities, and services to be able to have the means fit the end.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. B., Rueschemeyer, D., &amp; Skocpol, T. (1985). Bringing the state back in.&lt;/ref&gt; But in order to do so, they must counter the obstacles that can occur, such as social pressure and socioeconomic difficulties. From a legislator's point of view, to increase institutional autonomy, conditions of [[self-managed economy|self-management]] and institutional self-governance must be put in place. An increase in leadership and a redistribution of the responsibilities of decision-making would be beneficial to the research of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Neave, G. (2012). The evaluative state, institutional autonomy and re-engineering higher education in Western Europe: The prince and his pleasure.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Institutional autonomy was often seen as a synonym for [[self-determination]], and the government feared that it would lead institutions to an [[irredentist]] or [[secessionist]] state.  But autonomy should be seen as the solution to the struggles of self-determination.  Self-determination is a movement toward independence, whereas autonomy is a way to accommodate the separatist in a country.  Institutional autonomy has been the answer to conflicts regarding minorities and ethnic groups in a society. Allowing more autonomy to groups and institutions helps create diplomatic relationships with them and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, M., &amp; Wolff, S. (2014). Autonomy, self-governance, and conflict resolution: Innovative approaches to institutional design in divided societies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{main|Political freedom}}
In governmental parlence, autonomy refers to self-governance. An example of an autonomous jurisdiction was the former United States governance of the [[Philippine Islands]]. The ''Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916'' provided the framework for the creation of an autonomous government under which the [[Filipino people]] had broader domestic autonomy than previously, although it reserved certain privileges to the United States to protect its [[sovereignty|sovereign]] rights and interests.&lt;ref name=CorpusJuris&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Philippine Bill of 1902 (note: Philippine Autonomy Act) |encyclopedia=Corpus Juris |url=http://thecorpusjuris.com/constitutions/philippine-autonomy-act.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525075502/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/constitutions/philippine-autonomy-act.php |archivedate=2016-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the status of [[Kosovo]] as the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]] under the former Yugoslav government of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Melissa Katherine |last1=Bokovoy |first2=Jill A. |last2=Irvine |first3=Carol S. |last3=Lilly |year=1997 |title=State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |pages=295–301 |isbn=978-0-312-12690-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Autonomy is a key concept that has a broad impact on different fields of [[philosophy]]. In [[metaphysical philosophy]], the concept of autonomy is referenced in discussions about [[free will]], [[fatalism]], [[determinism]], and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. In ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] developed an 'Autonomy Principle', which he defines as "Let people choose for themselves, unless we know their interests better than they can."&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1847-063-472}}. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  King argues it is not enough to know someone else's interests better than the person; autonomy should only be infringed if a person is ''unable'' to know their own interests on a particular matter.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 17, 'Letting People Choose for Themselves', of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1847-063-472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[moral philosophy]], autonomy refers to subjecting oneself to objective moral law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/#BasDis Autonomy in Moral and Political Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) defined autonomy by three themes regarding [[contemporary ethics]]. Firstly, autonomy as the right for one to make their own decisions excluding any interference from others. Secondly, autonomy as the capacity to make such decisions through one's own independence of mind and after personal reflection. Thirdly, as an ideal way of living life autonomously. In summary, autonomy is the [[Moral rights|moral right]] one possesses, or the capacity we have in order to think and make decisions for oneself providing some degree of control or power over the events that unfold within one's everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HlJ8BbjLXSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+and+autonomy+and+kant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC1u7Oz6DZAhUD7oMKHZfaDG4Q6AEILjAB#v=snippet&amp;q=autonomy&amp;f=false|title=Kant on Moral Autonomy|last=Sensen|first=Oliver|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107004863|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context in which Kant addresses autonomy is in regards to [[moral theory]], asking both foundational and abstract questions. He believed that in order for there to be [[morality]], there must be autonomy. He breaks down autonomy into two distinct components. '''“Auto”''' can be defined as the negative form of [[independence]], or to be free in a negative sense. This is the aspect where decisions are made on your own. Whereas, '''“nomos”''' is the positive sense, a [[freedom]] or lawfulness, where you are choosing a law to follow. Kantian autonomy also provides a sense of [[Rationality|rational]] autonomy, simply meaning one rationally possesses the [[motivation]] to govern their own life. Rational autonomy entails making your own decisions but it cannot be done solely in [[Social isolation|isolation]]. Cooperative rational interactions are required to both develop and exercise our ability to live in a world with others.

Kant argued that morality presupposes this autonomy ({{lang-de|Autonomie}}) in moral agents, since moral requirements are expressed in [[categorical imperative]]s. An imperative is categorical if it issues a valid command independent of personal desires or interests that would provide a reason for obeying the command. It is hypothetical if the validity of its command, if the reason why one can be expected to obey it, is the fact that one desires or is interested in something further that obedience to the command would entail. "Don't speed on the freeway if you don't want to be stopped by the police" is a hypothetical imperative. "It is wrong to break the law, so don't speed on the freeway" is a categorical imperative. The hypothetical command not to speed on the freeway is not valid for you if you do not care whether you are stopped by the police. The categorical command is valid for you either way. Autonomous moral agents can be expected to obey the command of a categorical imperative even if they lack a personal desire or interest in doing so. It remains an open question whether they will, however.

The Kantian concept of autonomy is often misconstrued, leaving out the important point about the autonomous agent's self-subjection to the moral law. It is thought that autonomy is fully explained as the ability to obey a categorical command independently of a personal desire or interest in doing so—or worse, that autonomy is "obeying" a categorical command independently of a natural desire or interest; and that heteronomy, its opposite, is acting instead on personal motives of the kind referenced in hypothetical imperatives.

In his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', Kant applied the concept of autonomy also to define the concept of personhood and human [[dignity]]. Autonomy, along with [[rationality]], are seen by Kant as the two criteria for a meaningful life. Kant would consider a life lived without these not worth living; it would be a life of value equal to that of a plant or insect.&lt;ref name="Shafer-Landau, Russ 2010 Pp161"&gt;Shafer-Landau, Russ. "The fundamentals of ethics." (2010). p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant autonomy is part of the reason that we hold others morally accountable for their actions. Human actions are morally praise- or blame-worthy in virtue of our autonomy. Non- autonomous beings such as plants or animals are not blameworthy due to their actions being non-autonomous.&lt;ref name="Shafer-Landau, Russ 2010 Pp161"/&gt; Kant's position on crime and punishment is influenced by his views on autonomy. Brainwashing or drugging criminals into being law-abiding citizens would be immoral as it would not be respecting their autonomy. Rehabilitation must be sought in a way that respects their autonomy and dignity as human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer-Landau, Russ. "The fundamentals of ethics." (2010). p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote about autonomy and the moral fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24779-nietzsche-on-freedom-and-autonomy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407061713/https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24779-nietzsche-on-freedom-and-autonomy/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomy in this sense is referred to as the free self and entails several aspects of the self, including self-respect and even self-love. This can be interpreted as influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] ([[Self respect|self-respect]]) and [[Aristotle]] ([[self-love]]). For Nietzsche, valuing [[Ethics|ethical]] autonomy can dissolve the conflict between love (self-love) and law (self-respect) which can then translate into reality through experiences of being self-responsible. Because Nietzsche defines having a sense of freedom with being [[Personal responsibility|responsible]] for one's own life, freedom and self-responsibility can be very much linked to autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=D2a9e-FarAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+and+autonomy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi51c_XzqDZAhUD_4MKHZEXCpU4ChDoAQhPMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=autonomy&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche on Freedom and Autonomy|last=Gemes|first=Ken|last2=May|first2=Simon|date=2009-05-07|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191607882|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to Piaget ===

The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] philosopher [[Jean Piaget]] (1896-1980) believed that autonomy comes from within and results from a “free decision”. It is of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] and the morality of autonomy is not only accepted but obligatory. When an attempt at social interchange occurs, it is reciprocal, ideal and natural for there to be autonomy regardless of why the collaboration with others has taken place. For Piaget, the term autonomous can be used to explain the idea that rules are self-chosen. By choosing which rules to follow or not, we are in turn determining our own [[Behavior|behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3zEfxTytFnIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=autonomy+and+piaget&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5sLHkz6DZAhVFyYMKHYZ5BZcQ6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=autonomy&amp;f=false|title=Piaget's Construction of the Child's Reality|last=Sugarman|first=Susan|date=1990-01-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521379670|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget studied the cognitive development of children by analyzing them during their games and through interviews, establishing (among other principles) that the children moral maturation process occurs in two phases, the first of heteronomy and the second of autonomy:
* Heteronomous reasoning: 
Rules are objective and unchanging. They must be literal because the authority are ordering it and do not fit exceptions or discussions. The base of the rule is the superior authority (parents, adults, the State), that it should not give reason for the rules imposed or fulfilled them in any case. Duties provided are conceived as given from oneself. Any moral motivation and sentiments are possible through what one believes to be right. 
* Autonomous reasoning:
Rules are the product of an agreement and, therefore, are modifiable. They can be subject to interpretation and fit exceptions and objections. The base of the rule is its own acceptance, and its meaning has to be explained. Sanctions must be proportionate to the absence, assuming that sometimes offenses can go unpunished, so that collective punishment is unacceptable if it is not the guilty. The circumstances may not punish a guilty. Duties provided are conceived as given from the outside. One follows rules mechanically as it is simply a rule, or as a way to avoid a form of punishment.

=== According to Kohlberg ===

The American psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] (1927-1987) continues the studies of Piaget. His studies collected information from different latitudes to eliminate the cultural variability, and focused on the moral reasoning, and not so much in the behavior or its consequences. Through interviews with adolescent and teenage boys, who were to try and solve “moral dilemmas,” Kohlberg went on to further develop the [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]]. The answers they provided could be one of two things. Either they choose to obey a given law, authority figure or rule of some sort or they chose to take actions that would serve a human need but in turn break this given rule or command.

The most popular moral dilemma asked involved the wife of a man approaching death due to a special type of cancer. Because the drug was too expensive to obtain on his own, and because the pharmacist who discovered and sold the drug had no compassion for him and only wanted profits, he stole it. Kohlberg asks these adolescent and teenage boys (10-, 13- and 16-year-olds) if they think that is what the husband should have done or not. Therefore, depending on their decisions, they provided answers to Kohlberg about deeper rationales and thoughts and determined what they value as important. This value then determined the “structure” of their moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cShtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA491&amp;dq=social+and+personality+development&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuy5L_6NzZAhUizIMKHamHBr4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20and%20personality%20development&amp;f=false|title=Social and Personality Development|last=Shaffer|first=David|date=2008-09-19|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111807269|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg established three stages of morality, each of which is subdivided into two levels. They are read in progressive sense, that is, higher levels indicate greater autonomy.
* '''Level 1:''' Premoral/Preconventional Morality: Standards are met (or not met) depending on the hedonistic or physical consequences.
** [Stage 0: Egocentric Judgment: There is no moral concept independent of individual wishes, including a lack of concept of rules or obligations.]
** Stage 1:  Punishment-Obedience Orientation: The rule is obeyed only to avoid punishment. Physical consequences determine goodness or badness and power is deferred to unquestioningly with no respect for the human or moral value, or the meaning of these consequences. Concern is for the self.
** Stage 2: Instrumental-Relativist Orientation: Morals are individualistic and egocentric. There is an exchange of interests but always under the point of view of satisfying personal needs. Elements of fairness and reciprocity are present but these are interpreted in a pragmatic way, instead of an experience of gratitude or justice. Egocentric in nature but beginning to incorporate the ability to see things from the perspective of others.
* '''Level 2:''' Conventional Morality/Role Conformity: Rules are obeyed according to the established conventions of a society.
** Stage 3: Good Boy-Nice Girl Orientation: Morals are conceived in accordance with the stereotypical social role. Rules are obeyed to obtain the approval of the immediate group and the right actions are judged based on what would please others or give the impression that one is a good person. Actions are evaluated according to intentions.
** Stage 4: Law and Order Orientation: Morals are judged in accordance with the authority of the system, or the needs of the social order. Laws and order are prioritized.
* '''Level 3:''' Postconventional Morality/Self-Accepted Moral Principles: Standards of moral behavior are internalized. Morals are governed by rational judgment, derived from a conscious reflection on the recognition of the value of the individual inside a conventionally established society. 
** Stage 5:  Social Contract Orientation: There are individual rights and standards that have been lawfully established as basic universal values. Rules are agreed upon by through procedure and society comes to consensus through critical examination in order to benefit the greater good.
** Stage 6: Universal Principle Orientation: Abstract ethical principles are obeyed on a personal level in addition to societal rules and conventions. Universal principles of justice, reciprocity, equality and human dignity are internalized and if one fails to live up to these ideals, guilt or self-condemnation results.

==Child development==
Autonomy in childhood and adolescence is when one strives to gain a sense of oneself as a separate, self-governing individual.&lt;ref name="Berk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berk|first1=Laura|title=Child Development|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between ages 1–3, during the second stage of Erikson's and Freud's stages of development, the psychosocial crisis that occurs is autonomy versus shame and doubt.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David|title=Social and Personality Development|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significant event that occurs during this stage is that children must learn to be autonomous, and failure to do so may lead to the child doubting their own abilities and feel ashamed.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt; When a child becomes autonomous it allows them to explore and acquire new skills. Autonomy has two vital aspects wherein there is an emotional component where one relies more on themselves rather than their parents and a behavioural component where one makes decisions independently by using their judgement.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt; The styles of child rearing affect the development of a child's autonomy. Authoritative child rearing is the most successful approach, where the parents engage in autonomy granting appropriate to their age and abilities.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt; Autonomy in adolescence is closely related to their quest for identity.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt; In adolescence parents and peers act as agents of influence. Peer influence in early adolescence may help the process of an adolescent to gradually become more autonomous by being less susceptible to parental or peer influence as they get older.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt; In adolescence the most important developmental task is to develop a healthy sense of autonomy.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt;

==Religion==
In [[Christianity]], autonomy is manifested as a partial self-governance on various levels of church administration. During the history of Christianity, there were two basic types of autonomy. Some important parishes and monasteries have been given special autonomous rights and privileges, and the best known example of monastic autonomy is the famous [[Eastern Orthodox]] monastic community on [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]]. On the other hand, administrative autonomy of entire ecclesiastical provinces has throughout history included various degrees of internal self-governance.

In [[ecclesiology]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, there is a clear distinction between autonomy and [[autocephaly]], since autocephalous churches have full self-governance and independence, while every autonomous church is subjected to some autocephalous church, having a certain degree of internal self-governance. Since every autonomous church had its own historical path to ecclesiastical autonomy, there are significant differences between various autonomous churches in respect of their particular degrees of self-governance. For example, churches that are autonomous can have their highest-ranking bishops, such as an [[archbishop]] or [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], appointed or confirmed by the [[patriarch]] of the [[mother church]] from which it was granted its autonomy, but generally they remain self-governing in many other respects.

In the history of [[Western Christianity]] the question of ecclesiastical autonomy was also one of the most important questions, especially during the first centuries of Christianity, since various archbishops and metropolitans in [[Western Europe]] have often opposed centralizing tendencies of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]].{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=59-66, 130-139}} For example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is governed by its [[canon law]] which applies to all Roman Catholic churches which are thus not considered autonomous. Various denominations of [[Protestant church]]es usually have more decentralized power, and churches may be autonomous, thus having their own rules or laws of government, at the national, local, or even individual level.

[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] brings the notion of the Cartesian god being totally free and autonomous. He states that existence precedes essence with god being the creator of the essences, eternal truths and divine will. This pure freedom of god relates to human freedom and autonomy; where a human is not subjected to pre-existing ideas and values.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=The Autonomy Theme in the Church Dogmatics: Karl Barth and his Critics|last=Macken|first=John|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]], In the [[United States|United States of America]], the federal government is restricted in building a national church. This is due to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment's]] recognizing people's freedom's to worship their faith according to their own belief's. For example, [[Federal government of the United States|the American government]] has removed the church from their "sphere of authority"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/nkenlr35&amp;div=11&amp;id=&amp;page=&amp;collection=journals|title=Spheres of Sovereignty: Church Autonomy Doctrine and the Theological Heritage of the Separation of Church and State|last=Renaud|first=Robert Joseph|last2=Weinberger|first2=Laed Daniel|date=2008|website=heinonline.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the churches historical impact on politics and their authority on the public. This was the beginning of the disestablishment process. The Protestant churches in the United States had a large impact on American culture, in the nineteenth century, where they organized the establishment of schools, hospitals, orphanages, colleges, magazines etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and personal autonomy: the third disestablishment in America.|last=Hammond|first=Phillip|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has brought up the famous, however, misinterpreted term of the separation of church and state. These churches lost the legislative and financial support from the state.

=== The disestablishment process ===

The first disestablishment began with the introduction of the [[bill of rights]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Religion and personal autonomy: the third disestablishment in America|last=Hammond|first=Phillip|date=1992|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, due to the [[Great Depression|great depression]] of the 1930s and the completion of the second world war, the American churches were revived. Specifically the Protestant churches. This was the beginning of the second disestablishment&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; were churches had become popular again but held no legislative power. One of the main reasons why the churches gained attendance and popularity was due to the [[baby boom]]. Where soldiers came back from the [[World War II|second world war]] and started their families. The large influx of newborns gave the churches a new wave of followers. However, these followers did not hold the same beliefs as their parents and brought upon the political, and religious revolutions of the 1960s.

During the 1960s, the collapse of religious and cultural middle brought upon the third disestablishment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Religion became important to the individual and less likely the community. The changes brought from these revolutions significantly increased the personal autonomy of individuals due to the lack of structural restraints giving their added freedom of choice. This concept is known as "new voluntarism"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where individuals have free choice on how to be religious and the free choice whether to be religious or not.

==Medicine==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
In a [[medicine|medical]] context, respect for a patient's personal autonomy is [[medical ethics|considered]] one of many fundamental ethical principles in medicine. Autonomy can be defined as the ability of the person to make his or her own decisions. This faith in autonomy is the central premise of the concept of [[informed consent]] and [[shared decision making]]. This idea, while considered essential to today's practice of medicine, was developed in the last 50 years. According to [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]] (in ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''), the [[Doctors' Trial|Nuremberg trials]] detailed accounts of horrifyingly exploitative medical "experiments" which violated the subjects' physical integrity and personal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/808107441|title=Principles of biomedical ethics|last=L.|first=Beauchamp, Tom|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Childress, James F.|isbn=9780199924585|edition=7th |location=New York|oclc=808107441}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidences prompted calls for safeguards in [[medical research]], such as the [[Nuremberg Code]] which stressed the importance of voluntary participation in medical research. It is believed that the Nuremberg Code served as the premise for many current documents regarding research ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Bernard A|date=January 2006|title=A Summary of Important Documents in the Field of Research Ethics|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–80|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj005|issn=0586-7614|pmc=2632196|pmid=16192409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect for autonomy became incorporated in health care and patients could be allowed to make personal decisions about the health care services that they receive. Notably, autonomy has several aspects as well as challenges that affect health care operations. The manner in which a patient is handled may undermine or support autonomy of a patient and for this reason, the way a patient is communicated to becomes very crucial. A good relationship between a patient and a health care practitioner needs to be well defined to ensure that autonomy of a patient is respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=A.H|title=Autonomy, culture and healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like in any other life situation, a patient would not like to be under the control of another person. The move to emphasize respect for patient's autonomy rose from the vulnerabilities that were pointed out in regards to autonomy.

However, autonomy does not only apply in a research context. Users of the health care system have the right to be treated with respect for their autonomy, instead of being dominated by the [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1DNCNNX8AIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=silent+world+of+doctor+and+patient&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ubamT9WcAoaH6QG-tZWvBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=silent%20world%20of%20doctor%20and%20patient&amp;f=the physician]. This is referred to as paternalism. While paternalism is meant to be overall good for the patient, this can very easily interfere with autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandman|first1=Lars|title=Adherence, Shared Decision-Making and Patient Autonomy|journal=Medicine, Health Care, and Philosophy|date=2012|pages=115–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the [[therapeutic relationship]], a thoughtful dialogue between the client and the physician may lead to better outcomes for the client, as he or she is more of a participant in [[decision-making]].

Autonomy varies and some patients find it overwhelming especially the minors when faced with emergency situations. It is important to note that not every patient is capable of making an autonomous decision. those who are unable to make the decisions prompt a challenge to medical practitioners since it becomes difficult to determine the ability of a patient to make a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole, Willard, Mummery|title=Problematising autonomy and advocacy in nursing|journal=Nursing ethics|volume=21|issue=5|pages=576–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some extent, it has been said that emphasis of autonomy in health care has undermined the practice of health care practitioners to improve the health of their patient as necessary. The scenario has led to tension in the relationship between a patient and a health care practitioner. This is because as much as a physician want to prevent a patient from suffering, he or she still has to respect autonomy. Beneficence allows physicians to act responsibly in their practice, which may involve overlooking autonomy. The gap between a patient and a physician has led to problems because in other cases, the patients have complained of not being adequately informed.

The seven elements of informed consent (as defined by Beauchamp and Childress) include threshold elements (competence and voluntariness), information elements (disclosure, recommendation, and understanding) and consent elements (decision and authorization).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6w7V7gCkSIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=informed+consent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K7imT8eODciv6AG2mIm6BA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=informed%20consent&amp;f=false Informed Consent : Legal Theory and Clinical Practice: Legal Theory and ...] - Schools of Law and Medicine Jessica W.

Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers such as Harry Frankfurt consider Beauchamp and Childress criteria insufficient. They claim that an action can only be considered autonomous if it involves the exercise of the capacity to form higher-order values about desires when acting intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Mappes Thomas, A., and David DeGrazia. "Biomedical Ethics." (2006). Pp54-55&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that patients may understand their situation and choices but would not be autonomous unless the patient is able to form value judgements about their reasons for choosing treatment options they would not be acting autonomously.

There are many different definitions of autonomy, many of which place the individual in a social context. See also: relational autonomy, which suggests that a person is defined through their relationships with others, and "supported autonomy"&lt;ref name="library.yorku.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.library.yorku.ca/find/Record/2376624 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524174134/https://www.library.yorku.ca/find/Record/2376624 |archivedate=2015-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that in specific circumstances it may be necessary to temporarily compromise the autonomy of the person in the short term in order to preserve their autonomy in the long-term. Other definitions of the autonomy imagine the person as a contained and self-sufficient being whose rights should not be compromised under any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634749.The_Inner_Citadel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145857/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634749.The_Inner_Citadel |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain unique circumstances, government may have the right to temporarily override the right to [[bodily integrity]] in order to preserve the life and well-being of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of "supported autonomy",&lt;ref name="library.yorku.ca"/&gt; a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the [[forced feeding]] of a person dying from the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], or the temporary treatment of a person living with a [[psychotic disorder]] with [[antipsychotic medication]]). While controversial, the principle of supported autonomy aligns with the role of government to protect the life and liberty of its citizens. Terrence F. Ackerman has highlighted problems with these situations, he claims that by undertaking this course of action physician or governments run the risk of misinterpreting a conflict of values as a constraining effect of illness on a patient's autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Mappes Thomas, A., and David DeGrazia. "Biomedical Ethics." (2006). pp62&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there have been attempts to increase patient autonomy including the requirement that physician's take bioethics courses during their time in medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pilnick|first1=Alison|last2=Dingwall|first2=Robert|title=On the Remarkable Persistence of Asymmetry in Doctor/Patient Interaction: A Critical Review|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=April 2011|volume=72|pages=1374–82|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.02.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite large-scale commitment to promoting patient autonomy, public mistrust of medicine in developed countries has remained.&lt;ref&gt;O'neill, Onora. Autonomy and Trust in bioethics. Cambridge University Press, 2002. Pp3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Onora O'Neill]] has ascribed this lack of trust to medical institutions and professionals introducing measures that benefit themselves, not the patient. O’Neill claims that this focus on autonomy promotion has been at the expense of issues like distribution of healthcare resources and public health.

One proposal to increase patient autonomy is through the use of support staff. The use of support staff including medical assistants, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and other staff that can promote patient interests and better patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheather|first1=Julian|title=Patient Autonomy|journal=Student BMJ; London|date=2011|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses especially can learn about patient beliefs and values in order to increase informed consent and possibly persuade the patient through logic and reason to entertain a certain treatment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charles|first1=Sonya|title=The Moral Agency of Institutions: Effectively Using Expert Nurses to Support Patient Autonomy|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2017|volume=43.8|pages=506–509|doi=10.1136/medethics-2016-103448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=Sally|title=Patient Autonomy|journal=British Journal of Perioperative Nursing|date=January 2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=35–38, 40–41, 43|doi=10.1177/175045890501500103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would promote both autonomy and beneficence, while keeping the physician's integrity intact. Furthermore, Humphreys asserts that nurses should have professional autonomy within their scope of practice (35-37). Humphreys argues that if nurses exercise their professional autonomy more, then there will be an increase patient autonomy (35-37).

==International human rights law==
After the Second World War there was a push for international human rights that came in many waves. Autonomy as a basic human right started the building block in the beginning of these layers alongside with liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/567444414|title=Personal freedom through human rights law? : autonomy, identity and integrity under the European Convention on Human Rights|last=1966-|first=Marshall, Jill,|date=2009|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9004170596|location=Leiden|oclc=567444414}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal declarations of Human rights of 1948 has made mention of autonomy or the legal protected right to individual self-determination in article 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples reconfirm international law in the aspect of human rights because those laws were already there, but it is also responsible for making sure that the laws highlighted when it comes to autonomy, cultural and integrity and land rights are made within an indigenous context by taking special attention to their historical and contemporary events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geoff|first=G.|date=1997-02-01|title=Religious Minorities and Their Rights: A Problem of Approach |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/15718119720907435 |journal=International Journal on Minority and Group Rights |language=en |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=97–134 |doi=10.1163/15718119720907435 |issn=1571-8115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] article 3 also through international law provides Human rights for Indigenous individuals through its third article by giving them a right to self-determination meaning they have all the liberties to chose their political status, and are capable to go and improve their economics social, and cultural statuses in society by developing it. Another example of this is article 4 of the same document which gives them autonomous rights when it comes to their internal or local affairs and how they can fund themselves in order to be able to self govern themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/61/295|title=A/RES/61/295 - E|last=|first=|date=|website=undocs.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minorities in countries are also protected as well by international law; the 27th article of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|United Nations International covenant on Civil and Political rights]] or the ICCPR does so by allowing these individuals to be able to enjoy their own culture or use their language. Minorities in that manner are people from ethnic religious or linguistic groups according to the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court of Human rights]], is an international court that has been created on behalf of the European Conventions of Human rights. However, when it comes to autonomy they did not explicitly state it when it comes to the rights that individuals have. The current article 8 has remedied to that when the case of ''[[Pretty v United Kingdom|Pretty v the United Nations]] which was a case in 2002 involving assisted suicide'' where autonomy was used as a legal right in law. It was where Autonomy was distinguished and its reach into law was marked as well making it the foundations for legal precedent in making case law originating from the European Court of Human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898273667 |title=Caring autonomy : European human rights law and the challenge of individualism|last=Lõhmus |first=Katri |isbn=1107081777 |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|oclc=898273667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document with no binding effect in [[international human rights law]], contend that "self-determination" used as meaning of autonomy on one's own matters including informed consent or sexual and [[reproductive rights]], is integral for one's self-defined or [[gender identity]] and refused any medical procedures as a requirement for legal recognition of the gender identity of transgender.&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 3, The Right to Recognition before the Law&lt;/ref&gt; If eventually accepted by the international community in a [[treaty]], this would make these ideas human rights in the law. The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] also defines autonomy as principles of rights of a person with disability including "the freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons".&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] Article 3, (a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity culture on teenage autonomy==
A study conducted by David C. Giles and John Maltby conveyed that after age effecting factors were removed a high emotional autonomy was a significant predictor of celebrity interest, as well as high attachment to peers with a low attachment to parents. Patterns of intense personal interest in celebrities was found to be conjunction with low levels of closeness and security. Furthermore, the results suggested that adults with a secondary group of pseudo-friends during development from parental attachment, usually focus solely on one particular celebrity, which could be due to difficulties in making this transition.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, David &amp; Maltby, John. (2004). The Role of Media Figures in Adolescent Development: Relations Between Autonomy, Attachment, and Interest in Celebrities. Personality and Individual Differences. 36. 813-822. 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00154-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baldin Collection''' is a group of 364 [[masterpiece]]s removed from Germany to the Soviet Union by Russian Army officer Victor Baldin at the end of [[World War II]]. The ensemble consists of 362 drawings and 2 paintings by [[Dürer]], [[van Gogh]], [[Manet]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Titian]] and other famous artists. Historically part of the collection at the [[Kunsthalle Bremen]], the Baldin group came from a much larger cache of artworks stored by the Germans in a [[Brandenburg]] castle to protect it from [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|air raids]]. In 1945 the castle was occupied by the [[Red Army]] and the storage vaults were looted, mainly by Russian soldiers but also by the local German population. The works Baldin took were then hidden at a Soviet Research Institute for many years. In 1991 the collection was moved to the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] where its existence was revealed to the world in 1992. It remains there today.

Since then the Baldin Collection has been regarded as [[looted art]] and is the subject of fierce debate among experts, between [[Germany]] and [[Russia]], and among politicians inside Russia itself. While Victor Baldin did steal the works, he is also credited with having saved them from destruction. For decades he appealed to senior officials, including Soviet leaders [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], to get them returned to Germany. In 1989 Baldin even traveled to [[Bremen]], [[West Germany]], to reveal the existence of the secret collection to the Kunsthalle. In the 1990s the government of [[Boris Yeltsin]] finally agreed to return the works, but subsequent Russian governments have blocked such plans. Today the Collection has been called "of singular importance to the entire issue of trophy art" by the Russians&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Mikhail Borisovich Piotrovsky, State Hermitage Museum Director: Interview in ''The Gazette'' 12 March 2003 Moscow [http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/02/hm2_6_0_3.html English summary at the website of the State Hermitage Museum]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206130013/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/02/hm2_6_0_3.html|date=6 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[cause célèbre]] of German-Russian Restitution Politics" by those who support its return.&lt;ref name = akinsha&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0940739110000111|title=Why Can't Private Art "Trophies" Go Home from the War?|year=2010|last1=Akinsha|first1=Konstantin|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|volume=17|issue=27|pages=257–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Kunsthalle Bremen Collection ===
[[File:Kunsthalle-HB 20110824 img-01.jpg|thumb|330px|The [[Kunsthalle Bremen|Kunsthalle]] in [[Bremen]], Germany]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the Bremen Art Museum (German: ''[[Kunsthalle Bremen]]'') was closed and its priceless paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture were stored in the basement. [[Bremen]], an important manufacturing center, became an early target for [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Allied strategic bombing]]. On the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six gallery rooms of the museum. It also burned a version of [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', which because of its size could not be moved. After this damage, the Kunsthalle collections were moved to more secure storage in various bank vaults underneath Bremen. In 1943, as bombing intensified, Bremen's mayor decreed that the museum's collections be moved to safety outside the city. The collection was divided up between four castles in Germany. A set of 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and 3000 prints were moved to Schloss Karnzow, the hunting lodge of Count von Königsmarck, near the small town of [[Kyritz]] north of [[Berlin]] in the [[Province of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name = kunsthalle&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen: ''Geschichte 1914–1945'' [http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/emil-waldmann-1914-1945/ online] {{icon de}} retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karnzow Castle and Victor Baldin, 1945 ===

After Germany's defeat, [[Brandenburg]] and specifically the area around Karnzow Castle was occupied by the [[Red Army]]. On 29 May 1945 soldiers and officers of the 38th Field Engineers' Brigade billeted at the Castle began looting it.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt; Victor Baldin, an Army captain and combat engineer, found opened boxes in the cellar, saw documents trampled on the floor, and observed soldiers lighting their way by using burning papers. Baldin, an art restorer before the war, recognized these as drawings by the great masters.&lt;ref name = novosti&gt;"Baldin's Collection and Restitution Problems" in: ''Russian News &amp; Information Agency RIA Novosti'' 8 December 2005 [http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20051208/42393080.html online version] {{en icon}} retrieved 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Baldin intervened and sealed the cellar. Scrutinizing the treasures lying about, he found works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Degas]], [[Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyke]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Goya]], [[Manet]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Rubens]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Titian]].&lt;ref name=dolinina&gt;Kira Dolinina and Maia Stravinskaya: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184500/http://www.kommersant.com/p549322/r_1/Ministry_of_Culture_Won_t_Give_Back_What_Doesn_t_Belong_to_It/ "Ministry of Culture Won't Give Back What Doesn't Belong to It"].

Baldin became determined to save what he could. He later said "I started in on the beautiful things, then I saw it was all beautiful."&lt;ref name = latimes/&gt; He took drawings away from soldiers by force, by deception and in exchange for personal items.&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; In one case, it took him three days to obtain a drawing of Christ's head by [[Albrecht Dürer]] from another officer. Baldin managed to coax the officer into exchanging it for his chrome boots.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt; Of the thousands of works stored in the cellar, Baldin managed to save just 362 drawings and 2 paintings. Among them was the only known pen and ink study  by [[van Gogh]] of his famous painting, ''[[Starry Night]]''&lt;ref name = latimes/&gt; As the Soviet Army withdrew, the cellars were left open and what little remained of the collection was lost to local looters and the weather.&lt;ref name = kunsthalle/&gt;

Baldin's actions and motives are still debated today. He did indeed cut the drawings from their mounts, put them into a suitcase, carry them to Russia and hide them in his apartment. However, while at the castle Baldin also wrote down descriptions of every work he saw, copied the German signatures and labels, and later carefully documented their [[provenance]]. He also begged for an official military transport so the collection could be handled more securely, but none were available, and his request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes, Constance Richards, Rhea Schoenthal: "Spoils of War": ''Time Magazine'', 3 April 1995 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982773,00.html abstract online] retrieved 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is generally agreed that Baldin's efforts rescued priceless [[masterpiece]]s from outright destruction. In addition, because of his specialized art knowledge, what would become known as the "Baldin Collection" became the most important part of the Kunsthalle collection remaining from Schloss Karnzow.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

In contrast to Baldin's efforts, works looted by Baldin's comrades from Karnzow have been found as far afield as [[Azerbaijan]] and in varying states of decay. In the late 1990s eight disputed drawings, including the world-famous ''Frauenbad'' ("Women's Bathhouse") by Albrecht Dürer, were seized by [[United States Customs]] in an incident of [[black market]] trading.&lt;ref name = duerer&gt;Jo Ann Lewis, "Duerer, Drawing a Hot Bath" in: ''The Washington Post'', 26 October 1997, at G9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constance Lowenthal, ''U.S. Customs Recovers Old Masters Drawings'', IFAR Report, Oct. 1997, at 4&lt;/ref&gt; Today over 1,500 items from the Kunsthalle collection that were stored at Karnzow remain missing.&lt;ref name = clark/&gt;

=== Postwar period, 1946–1990 ===
After their return home, some of the officers who had participated in the looting at Karnzow donated their pieces to museums around the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1948 Baldin deposited his at the A. V. Shchusev State Scientific Research Museum of Architecture in [[Moscow]], where the masterpieces became a Soviet state secret.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt; Baldin worked as an art restorer at the museum and eventually became its general director in 1963, a post he held for 25 years.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

Baldin then tried for decades to give the stolen art back to Germany. He took the courageous steps of writing to Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1973, to the chief ideologist of the Communist Party [[Yegor Ligachev]] in 1987, and many other Soviet political and cultural officials including [[Mikhail Suslov]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and [[Raisa Gorbachev]]&amp;nbsp;– all to no avail.&lt;ref name=ingram/&gt; In 1989, during the period of increased transparency in the Soviet Union known as [[perestroika]], Baldin took another unprecedented step. He traveled to Bremen, [[West Germany]], and met with the director of the Kunsthalle, Dr Siegfried Salzmann. The director was shocked to learn that important parts of the long lost collection had survived. With hands shaking, he read the list of the missing masterpieces that Baldin had prepared years before. Baldin had put pencil marks next to those works he had personally rescued. He has since been called the "hero of the story."&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

=== Post-Soviet period, 1991–2000 ===
In 1991, Baldin wrote to Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and finally received his first reply, in which the president agreed it would be politically correct to return the works to Germany.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt; However, that same year nationalist elements in the Russian government hurriedly transferred the collection to the State [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] in a cover-up attempt.&lt;ref name=dolinina/&gt; As of 2012 it is still unclear if one of the most famous works in the collection, ''Cypresses in [[Starry Night]]'' (1889) by Van Gogh, is at the Hermitage or remains in Moscow.&lt;ref name = clark/&gt;

In legal proceedings and political debates during the following years it appeared that collection might return to its rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ann Lewis. "World War II German Art Hoard To Be Returned by Soviets; 360 Master Drawings Taken for Safekeeping" in: ''The Washington Post''. 16 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, a group of 101 pieces from another part of Baldin's brigade, including Albrecht Duerers' 1494 watercolor ''View of a Rock Castle by a River'', were returned to the Kunsthalle by Russia. This was followed by the simultaneous return of two artifacts of the [[Amber Room]], bought and financed by a Bremen businessman to speed up the process.&lt;ref name=finnbremen&gt;Peter Finn: "Bremen Basks In Return of Art Looted by Soviet Army" in: ''The Washington Post''. 24 November 2000, A Section&lt;/ref&gt; Anatoly Vilkov, from the Russian ministry of culture, stated that "Russia has no right to keep the Baldin collection. We did not receive this right through a gift, since by law the collection did not belong to the donor Baldin."&lt;ref name = schossig&gt;Rainer B.

=== Latest disputes, 2003–present ===
[[File:Gubenko NN.jpg|thumb|[[Nikolai Gubenko]] in 2005]]
The potential return of the collection to Germany began to face increasing opposition from Russian nationalist leaders, including [[Communist]] legislator and former Culture Minister of the USSR [[Nikolai Gubenko]]. Gubenko had been one of those involved in the 1991 transfer of the art to the Hermitage to hide it.&lt;ref name=ingram/&gt; The State [[Duma]], which included Gubenko as a member,&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; passed a non-binding resolution on 12 March 2003 asking President [[Vladimir Putin]] to prevent the Culture Ministry from returning the Baldin Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030503040021/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2003/03/130303.asp "Duma Calls for Go-Slow Approach on Trophy Art"] ''Radio Free Europe Newsline'' 13 March 2003. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930063953/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2003/03/130303.asp|date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy opposed these moves to keep the collection in Russia; he regarded it as illegal loot based on a 1998 law that protected only those artworks from World War II taken by official Soviet trophy brigades and not private citizens. In 2003 he confirmed an order by the Russian General Prosecutor confirming a resolution of the [[Hanse]] Supreme court, which had decided the entire 364 remaining items were the official property of the Bremen Kunsthalle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfromrussia.com/culture/2003/04/07/45701_.html "Russian Minister of Culture: Return of 'Baldin Collection' to Germany is Legally Relevant"].

''[[Die Welt]]''. 22 March 2003 {{icon de}} retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Shvydkoy later received an official reprimand and was threatened by deputy prosecutor Vladimir Kolsenikov with criminal charges if he attempted to return the rest of the collection to Germany.&lt;ref name=zolotov/&gt; In 2005 [[Aleksandr Sergeyevich Sokolov]], Russia's new Culture Minister, then contradicted previous promises and stated that he opposed the return of the Baldin collection to Germany. As of 2010, it appeared that the collection would not be returning to Germany any time soon.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt;

== Legacy ==
According to a 2005 interview with Baldin's widow Julia Siwakowa, it was always his wish that the looted art be returned to the Kunsthalle. Baldin's last will stated: "The collection belongs to humankind, not only Germany, and as the collection was located at the Kunsthalle Bremen, it must be returned to this place."&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; The history of Victor Baldin, the stolen paintings and their odyssey is featured in the 2007 book ''Victor Baldin&amp;nbsp;– The Man with the Suitcase/Victor Baldin&amp;nbsp;– Der Mann mit dem Koffer''.&lt;ref name = schossig/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">'''Benjamin Heidersberger''' (born in 1957 in Braunschweig, Germany) is a German [[media art]]ist, journalist, entrepreneur and culture manager. He lives and works in [[Berlin]] and [[Wolfsburg]].

== Early life  ==
Heidersberger studied physics, biology, and computer science at the [[Technical University of Braunschweig]] in 1978. From 1978 to 1984, he was part of the interdisciplinary artist group ''Head Resonance'' in Wolfsburg. Along with vocalist and percussionist Peter Elsner, they conducted research on how ideas become reality in architecture, music, performance and installation. 

== Career ==
In 1984, he moved to [[Hamburg]] to work for a PC-dealer. From 1988 onward, he was an editor of the Computer-Magazine, ''MACup,'' about hardware and software, and later about art, technology, and society. 

In 1989, he co-founded the ''Ponton-Lab'' as an artist group and realised interactive media and TV-projects on [[Documenta]]- 8 and Documenta- IX, in Japan 1993 as well as on [[Ars Electronica]] 1986, 89, 90 and 96 under the brand ''Van Gogh TV''. 

In 1992, the international project Piazza virtuale was realised, transmitting during the 100 days of Documenta daily 90 minutes of live-TV from 12 studios across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13680903.html Spiegel.de: Die imaginäre Pizza], 21.

In 1993 and 1994, Heidersberger taught Design of Electronic Media at Merz-Academy in [[Stuttgart]]. Ponton-Lab was formed into a full-service internet agency with up to 20 employees and realised the websites for the Lower Saxony State Government and for the Federal Press Office and later the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 1998 he launched Kulturserver, an [[online community]] for art and culture consisting of online-services for 20.000 artists similar to [[social media]]. The project was invited to present at the international conference “Cultura y Desarrollo” in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/jul/22/onlinesupplement The Guardian: Cuba faces the web revolution], July 22, 1995, retrieved August 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he founded the Heidersberger Institute in Wolfsburg Castle to archive and publish the work of his father, photographer Heinrich Heidersberger. The Institute collaborates with contemporary artists to contextualise that work. In the same year he was curator for netart on the 4th Werkleitz Binnale.

'''Betsy Graves Reyneau''' (1888–1964) was an [[United States|American]] painter, best known for a series of portraits of prominent [[African American]]s once owned by the [[Harmon Foundation]]. [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], [[George Washington Carver]], [[Joe Louis]], and [[Thurgood Marshall]] were among her sitters.

== Early life ==
Reyneau was raised in [[Detroit]], and although discouraged by her father from becoming an artist on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a woman, she broke ties with the family to pursue that career, and as a young woman attended the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. She later lived in France for a time before returning to the United States and becoming active in civil rights causes. She was later selected by the Circuit Court of Detroit, unbeknownst to her family, to paint a portrait of her grandfather, Michigan Supreme Court Justice [[Benjamin F. Graves]]. Reyneau was also a [[suffragette]]; she became, in 1917, one of the first woman to be arrested and imprisoned for protesting [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s stance on women's voting rights.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyaxYvSG6gAC|title=After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists|last=Adams|first=Katherine H.|last2=Keene|first2=Michael L.|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|isbn=9780786456475|location=|pages=57–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Many of Reyneau's portraits are currently in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.67.81|title=Aaron Douglas|last=|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.67.77|title=Richmond Barthe|last=|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]].

'''Cabin fever''' is an [[idiom]]atic term for a [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] reaction that takes place when a person or group ends up in an isolated or solitary location, or stuck indoors in confined quarters for an extended period of time. Cabin fever describes the extreme irritability and restlessness a person may feel in these limiting situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cabin+fever?show=0&amp;t=1341386865|title= Cabin fever|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabin fever is also associated with [[boredom]] from being indoors for a lengthy amount of time.

A person may experience cabin fever in a situation such as being isolated within a [[vacation]] cottage out in the country, or away from a civilization.

When experiencing cabin fever, a person may tend to sleep, to have a distrust of anyone they are with, or to have an urge to go outside even in bad weather. The phrase is also used humorously to indicate simple [[boredom]] from being home alone for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/garden/reports-from-the-bunkers-by-some-survivors-homebound-and-happy.html|title= Reports From the Bunkers, by Some Survivors; Homebound and Happy|author=Ron Alexander|date=2004-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabin fever is not directly fatal to an individual suffering from the peculiar disorder. However, related symptoms can lead the sufferer to make irrational decisions that could potentially cause them to lose their life. Some examples would be suicide from the seclusion or paranoia, or leaving the safety of a cabin during a terrible snow storm that one may be stuck in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kehoe|first=J.

==Therapy==



One therapy for cabin fever is as simple as getting out and interacting with nature directly. Research has demonstrated that even brief interactions with nature can promote improved cognitive functioning, support a positive mood, and overall well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berman|first=Marc G.|author2=John Jonides|author3=Stephen Kaplan|date=2008-02-18|title=The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting With Nature|url=http://www.umich.edu/~jlabpsyc/pdf/2008_2.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=12|pages=1207–1212|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02225.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escaping the confinement of the indoors and changing one’s scenery and surroundings can easily help an individual experiencing cabin fever overcome their mania. Going outside to experience the openness of the world will stimulate the brain and body enough to eliminate feelings of intense claustrophobia, paranoia, and restlessness associated with cabin fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblatt|first=Paul C.|last2=Anderson|first2=Roxanne Marie|last3=Johnson|first3=Patricia A.|date=June 1984|title=The Meaning of “Cabin Fever”|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00224545.1984.9924512|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1080/00224545.1984.9924512|issn=0022-4545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little evidence of those suffering from cabin fever seeing therapists or counselors for treatment, most sufferers simply discuss their symptoms with family or friends as a way of changing the feelings of loneliness and boredom. However, there are cases of “cabin fever” that are diagnosed as mid-winter depression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Russ|last2=Dowrick|first2=Peter W.|date=1983|title=Myths of mid-winter depression|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00759551|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1007/bf00759551|issn=0010-3853}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Seasonal affective disorder|Seasonal Affective Disorder]] (SAD). &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rohan|first=Kelly J.|title=Symptoms, Prevalence, and Causes of SAD|date=September 2008|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/med:psych/9780195341379.003.0002|work=Coping with the Seasons: Workbook|pages=7–16|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195341379|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==In popular culture==

The concept of Cabin fever was used as a theme in Charlie Chaplin's 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'', the 1980 horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Mountain of Madness]]", and the 2010 video game ''[[Alan Wake]]''. A song called "Cabin Fever" features in the 1996 musical comedy ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'', afflicting sailors on a ship trapped in the [[doldrums]]. Cabin Fever was the name of Wiz Khalifa's 2011 mixtape which was released February 17th. There is a quest in the popular [[Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game|MMORPG]] ''[[RuneScape]]'' of the same name.

Cabin fever is one of the possible afflictions the [[player character]] can suffer from in the video game set in the post-apocalyptic Canadian wasteland, ''[[The Long Dark]]''; the condition prevents one from sleeping indoors, thus forcing them to brave the elements in order to rest.

In ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', fictional female character Joi, who is a virtual girlfriend of main character K, at the beginning of the movie is stating that she is suffering from "cabin fever".

''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'' is a 2002 American horror film directed by [[Eli Roth]] and starring [[Rider Strong]], [[Jordan Ladd]], James DeBello, and [[Giuseppe Andrews]].
The story follows a group of college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods and begin to fall victim to a [[Necrotizing fasciitis|flesh-eating virus]]. The inspiration for the film's story came from a real life experience during a trip to [[Iceland]] when Roth developed a skin infection. The film spawned a sequel ''[[Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever]]'' (2009), a prequel ''[[Cabin Fever: Patient Zero]]'' (2014), and a 2016 remake of the original, also called ''[[Cabin Fever (2016 film)|Cabin Fever]]''.

[[File:Cavalieri's Principle in Coins.JPG|thumb|250px|Two stacks of British coins with the same volume, illustrating Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions]]

In [[geometry]], '''Cavalieri's principle''', a modern implementation of the '''method of indivisibles''', named after [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, "Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence", ''The College Mathematics Journal'', volume 22, number 2, March, 1991), pages 118&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in a plane are included between two parallel lines in that plane. If every line parallel to these two lines intersects both regions in line segments of equal length, then the two regions have equal areas.
* '''3-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes.

Today Cavalieri's principle is seen as an early step towards [[integral calculus]], and while it is used in some forms, such as its generalization in [[Fubini's theorem]], results using Cavalieri's principle can often be shown more directly via integration. In the other direction, Cavalieri's principle grew out of the ancient Greek [[method of exhaustion]], which used limits but did not use [[infinitesimal]]s.

== History ==
[[File:Bonaventura Cavalieri.jpeg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], the mathematician the principle is named after.]]
Cavalieri's principle was originally called the method of indivisibles, the name it was known by in [[Renaissance Europe]]. Cavalieri developed a complete theory of indivisibles, elaborated in his ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'' (''Geometry, advanced in a new way by the indivisibles of the continua'', 1635) and his ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (''Six geometrical exercises'', 1647).&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor J. Katz|Katz, Victor J.]] (1998), ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2nd ed.), Addison-Wesley, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]], using a method resembling Cavalieri's principle,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593 "Archimedes' Lost Method"]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to find the volume of a sphere given the volumes of a cone and cylinder in his work ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''. In the 5th century AD, [[Zu Chongzhi]] and his son [[Zu Gengzhi]] established a similar method to find a sphere's volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |edition=3 |first1=Dennis G. |last1=Zill |first2=Scott |last2=Wright |first3=Warren S. |last3=Wright |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |year=2009 |isbn=0-7637-5995-3 |page=xxvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C&amp;pg=PR27 Extract of page 27]&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Cavalieri's indivisibles to [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s and [[John Wallis]]'s [[infinitesimal]]s was a major advance in the history of the [[integral calculus|calculus]]. The indivisibles were entities of [[codimension]] 1, so that a plane figure was thought as made out of an infinity of 1-dimensional lines. Meanwhile, infinitesimals were entities of the same dimension as the figure they make up; thus, a plane figure would be made out of "parallelograms" of infinitesimal width. Applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, Wallis computed the area of a triangle by partitioning it into infinitesimal parallelograms of width&amp;nbsp;1/∞.

== Examples ==

=== Spheres ===
[[Image:sphere cavalieri.svg|500px|thumb|The disk-shaped cross-section of the sphere has the same area as the ring-shaped cross-section of that part of the cylinder that lies ''outside'' the cone.]]

If one knows that the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\left(\text{base} \times \text{height}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then one can use Cavalieri's principle to derive the fact that the volume of a [[sphere]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius.

That is done as follows: Consider a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and a cylinder of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Within the cylinder is the cone whose apex is at the center of one base of the cylinder and whose base is the other base of the cylinder. By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the plane located &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; units above the "equator" intersects the sphere in a circle of area &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The area of the plane's intersection with the part of the cylinder that is ''outside'' of the cone is also &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. As we can see, the area of every intersection of the circle with the horizontal plane located at any height &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equals the area of the intersection of the plane with the part of the cylinder that is "outside" of the cone; thus, applying Cavalieri's principle, we could say that the volume of the half sphere equals the volume of the part of the cylinder that is "outside" the cone. The aforementioned volume of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder, thus the volume ''outside'' of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; the volume of the cylinder. Therefore the volume of the upper half of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{base} \times \text{height} = \pi r^2 \cdot r = \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

("Base" is in units of ''area''; "height" is in units of ''distance''. Area&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;volume.)

Therefore the volume of the upper half-sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; and that of the whole sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Cones and pyramids ===

The fact that the volume of any [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], regardless of the shape of the base, whether circular as in the case of a cone, or square as in the case of the Egyptian pyramids, or any other shape, is (1/3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;base&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;height, can be established by Cavalieri's principle if one knows only that it is true in one case. One may initially establish it in a single case by partitioning the interior of a triangular prism into three pyramidal components of equal volumes. One may show the equality of those three volumes by means of Cavalieri's principle.

In fact, Cavalieri's principle or similar infinitesimal argument is ''necessary'' to compute the volume of cones and even pyramids, which is essentially the content of [[Hilbert's third problem]] – polyhedral pyramids and cones cannot be cut and rearranged into a standard shape, and instead must be compared by infinite (infinitesimal) means. The ancient Greeks used various precursor techniques such as Archimedes's mechanical arguments or [[method of exhaustion]] to compute these volumes.

===The napkin ring problem===

{{main|Napkin ring problem}}

[[Image:sphere bands.svg|thumb|400px|If a hole of height ''h'' is drilled straight through the center of a sphere, the volume of the remaining band does not depend on the size of the sphere. For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer.]]

In what is called the [[napkin ring problem]], one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height ''h'', the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere.  The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the sphere's radius and ''y'' is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(''h''/2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  When these are subtracted, the ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon&amp;nbsp;''r''.

=== Cycloids ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[visual calculus]]. --&gt;

[[Image:Folded cycloid.svg|thumb|400px|The horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by two cycloidal arcs traced by a point on the same circle rolling in one case clockwise on the line below it, and in the other counterclockwise on the line above it, has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the circle.]]

N. Reed has shown&lt;ref&gt;N. Reed, "[[Elementary proof]] of the area under a cycloid", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'', volume 70, number 454, December, 1986, pages 290&amp;ndash;291&lt;/ref&gt; how to find the area bounded by a [[cycloid]] by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius ''r'' can roll in a clockwise direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which it would have turned clockwise and that through which it would have turned counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids.  By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region.

Consider the rectangle bounding a single cycloid arch. From the definition of a cycloid, it has width {{math|2π''r''}} and height {{math|2''r''}}, so its area is four times the area of the circle. Calculate the area within this rectangle that lies above the cycloid arch by bisecting the rectangle at the midpoint where the arch meets the rectangle, rotate one piece by 180° and overlay the other half of the rectangle with it. The new rectangle, of area twice that of the circle, consists of the "lens" region between two cycloids, whose area was calculated above to be the same as that of the circle, and the two regions that formed the region above the cycloid arch in the original rectangle. Thus, the area bounded by a rectangle above a single complete arch of the cycloid has area equal to the area of the circle, and so, the area bounded by the arch is three times the area of the circle.

'''Cowardice''' is a trait wherein [[fear]] and excessive self-concern override doing or saying what is right, good, and of help to others or oneself in a time of need—it is the opposite of [[courage]]. As a label, "cowardice"  indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge. One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward.&lt;ref&gt; Dictionary.com [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cowardice cowardice]:  "[the] lack of courage to face danger, difficulty, opposition, pain, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[military law|military codes of justice]] proscribe cowardice in [[combat]] as a crime punishable by [[death]] (note the phrase "[[Execution by firing squad|shot at dawn]]").

As the opposite of an action or trait that many existing and formerly extant cultures [[Cultural norm|demand]], cowardice rates as a character flaw that many societies and their representatives stigmatize and/or punish.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the word ''coward'' came into English from the [[Old French]] word ''coart'' (modern French [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/couard ''couard'']), which is a combination of the word for "tail" (Modern French ''queue'', [[Latin]] ''cauda'') and an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] [[noun]] [[suffix]]. It would therefore have meant "one with a tail", which may conjur an image of an animal displaying its tail in flight of fear ("turning tail"), or a [[dog]]'s habit of putting its tail between its legs when it is afraid. Like many other English words of French origin, this word was introduced in the English language by the French-speaking [[Normans]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.uml.edu/jgarreau/FromFrenchtoEnglish.htm From French to English:]. Faculty.uml.edu. Retrieved on 16 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English language|English]] [[surname]] Coward (as in [[Noël Coward]]), however, has the same origin and meaning as the word "cowherd".

==Military law==
Acts of cowardice have long been punishable by military law, which defines a wide range of cowardly offenses, including [[desertion]] in face of the enemy and surrendering to the enemy against orders. The punishment for such acts is typically severe, ranging from [[corporal punishment]] to the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]]. Cowardly conduct is specifically mentioned within the [[United States]] [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], in Article 99.

Generally, cowardice was punishable by execution during [[World War I]], and those who were caught were often court-martialed and, in many cases, [[executed by firing squad]]. British men executed for cowardice were often not commemorated on war memorials, and their families often did not receive benefits and had to endure social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Executed WW1 soldiers to be given pardons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/16/military.immigrationpolicy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Call to rethink cases of French WWI 'coward' soldiers|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24356041|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many decades later, those soldiers all received posthumous pardons in the [[Armed Forces Act 2006#Pardon|Armed Forces Act 2006]] and have been commemorated with the [[Shot at Dawn Memorial]]. Unlike British, French, German, and Soviet/Russian forces, the United States forces tried soldiers for cowardice but never followed through with execution while German commanders were less inclined to use execution as a form of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=World War I Almanac|first=David R. |last=Woodward|page=28|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable controversy was generated by military historian [[S.L.A. Marshall]], who claimed that 75% of U.S. combat troops in World War II never fired at the enemy for the purpose of killing, even while under direct threat.  [[Dave Grossman (author)|Author Dave Grossman]] attempted to explain these findings in his book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society ]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6750">In [[general relativity]],  '''curvature invariants''' are a set of [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s formed from the [[Riemann tensor|Riemann]], [[Weyl tensor|Weyl]] and [[Ricci tensor|Ricci]] tensors - which represent [[curvature]], hence the name, - and possibly operations on them such as [[Tensor contraction|contraction]], [[covariant differentiation]] and [[Dual tensor|dualisation]].

Certain invariants formed from these curvature tensors play an important role in classifying [[spacetime]]s. Invariants are actually less powerful for distinguishing locally non-[[isometry|isometric]] [[Lorentzian manifold]]s than they are for distinguishing [[Riemannian manifold]]s. This means that they are more limited in their applications than for manifolds endowed with a [[positive definite]] [[metric tensor]].

==Principal invariants==

The principal invariants of the Riemann and Weyl tensors are certain [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[polynomial]] [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (i.e., sums of squares of components).

The principal invariants of the [[Riemann tensor]] of a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold are
#the ''[[Kretschmann scalar]]'' &lt;math&gt;K_1 = R_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''Chern–Pontryagin scalar'' &lt;math&gt;K_2 = {{}^\star R}_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''Euler scalar'' &lt;math&gt;K_3 = {{}^\star R^\star}_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
These are quadratic polynomial invariants (sums of squares of components).  (Some authors define the Chern–Pontryagin scalar using the [[Hodge dual|right dual]] instead of the [[Hodge dual|left dual]].)

The first of these was introduced by [[Erich Kretschmann]].  The second two names are somewhat anachronistic, but since the integrals of the last two are related to the [[instanton]] number and [[Euler characteristic]] respectively, they have some justification.

The principal invariants of the [[Weyl tensor]] are
# &lt;math&gt;I_1 = C_{abcd} \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;I_2 = {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
(Because &lt;math&gt;{{}^\star C^\star}_{abcd} = -C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;, there is no need to define a third principal invariant for the Weyl tensor.)

===Relation with Ricci decomposition===

As one might expect from the [[Ricci decomposition]] of the Riemann tensor into the Weyl tensor plus a sum of fourth-rank tensors constructed from the second rank [[Ricci tensor]] and from the [[Ricci scalar]], these two sets of invariants are related (in d=4):
:&lt;math&gt;K_1 = I_1 + 2 \, R_{ab} \, R^{ab} - \frac{1}{3} \, R^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K_3 = -I_1 + 2 \, R_{ab} \, R^{ab} - \frac{2}{3} \, R^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation with Bel decomposition===

In four dimensions, the [[Bel decomposition]] of the Riemann tensor, with respect to a timelike unit vector field &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily geodesic or hypersurface orthogonal, consists of three pieces
#the ''[[electrogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;E[\vec{X}]_{ab} = R_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''[[magnetogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;B[\vec{X}]_{ab} = {{}^\star R}_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''[[topogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;L[\vec{X}]_{ab} = {{}^\star R^\star}_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
Because these are all ''transverse'' (i.e. projected to the spatial hyperplane elements orthogonal to our timelike unit vector field), they can be represented as linear operators on three-dimensional vectors, or as three by three real matrices.  They are respectively symmetric, [[traceless]], and symmetric (6,8,6 linearly independent components, for a total of 20).  If we write these operators as '''E''', '''B''', '''L''' respectively, the principal invariants of the Riemann tensor are obtained as follows:
*&lt;math&gt;K_1/4&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2 '''B''' '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;-K_2/8&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''B''' ( '''E''' - '''L''' ),
*&lt;math&gt;K_3/8&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''E''' '''L''' - '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Expression in Newman–Penrose formalism===

In terms of the [[Weyl scalar]]s in the [[Newman–Penrose formalism]], the principal invariants of the Weyl tensor may be obtained by taking the real and imaginary parts of the expression
:&lt;math&gt;I_1 - i \, I_2 = 16 \, \left( 3 \Psi_2^2 + \Psi_0 \, \Psi_4 - 4 \, \Psi_1 \Psi_3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
(But note the minus sign!)

The principal quadratic invariant of the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R_{ab} \, R^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, may be obtained as a more complicated expression involving the ''Ricci scalars'' (see the paper by Cherubini et al. cited below).

==Distinguishing Lorentzian manifolds==
An important question related to Curvature invariants is when the set of polynomial curvature invariants can be used to (locally) distinguish manifolds. To be able to do this is necessary to include higher-order invariants including derivatives of the Riemann tensor but in the Lorentzian case, it is known that there are spacetimes which cannot be distinguished; e.g., the [[VSI spacetimes]] for which all such curvature invariants vanish and thus cannot be distinguished from flat space. This failure of being able to distinguishing Lorentzian manifolds is related to the fact that the [[Lorentz group]] is non-compact.

There are still examples of cases when we can distinguish Lorentzian manifolds using their invariants. Examples of such are fully general [[Petrov type]] I spacetimes with no Killing vectors, see Coley ''et al.'' below. Indeed, it was here found that the spacetimes failing to be distinguished by their set of curvature invariants are all [[Kundt spacetime]]s.

The '''East Pole–West Pole divide''' in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] is an intellectual schism between researchers subscribing to the [[psychological nativism|nativist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] schools of thought.  The term arose from the fact that much of the theory and research supporting [[psychological nativism|nativism]], [[modularity of mind]], and [[computational theory of mind]] originated at several universities located on the East Coast, including [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[Tufts University]]. Conversely, much of the research and theory supporting [[empiricism]], [[emergentism]], and [[embodied cognition]] originated at several universities located on the West Coast, including the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Salk Institute]], and, most notably, the [[University of California, San Diego]].  In reality, the divide is not so clear, with many universities and scholars on both coasts (as well as the Midwest and around the world) supporting each position, as well as more moderate positions in between the two extremes.  The phrase was coined by [[Jerry Fodor]] at an [[MIT]] conference on [[cognition]], at which he referred to another researcher as a "West Coast theorist," apparently unaware that the researcher worked at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blank Slate:The Modern Denial of Human Nature |last=Pinker |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few researchers adhere strictly to the extreme positions highlighted by the East Pole–West Pole debate.  That is, there are very few empiricists who believe in the [[John Locke|Lockean]] ideal of the ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (namely, that children are born with no innate knowledge or constraints), and there are very few nativists who agree with [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor's]] assertion that all concepts that are learned over the course of life are present in the mind prior to birth.  Nevertheless, most scholars within the fields of [[cognitive science]] and [[developmental psychology]] affiliate themselves with one of the two positions through the means of their research.

The two books best known for espousing the empiricist and nativist positions within the context of cognitive psychology are ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]'' by [[Jeffrey Elman]] et al. and ''[[The Modularity of Mind]]'' by [[Jerry Fodor]], respectively.  Incidentally, the authors are affiliated with the two institutions on which the East Pole–West Pole metaphor is based, [[UCSD]] and [[MIT]], affirming the relevance and pervasiveness of this moniker for the intellectual divide.

The '''Eight Consciousnesses''' (Skt. ''aṣṭa vijñānakāyāḥ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/hvsatssu.htm|title=Sātyasiddhiśāstra|last=Harivarman|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|postscript=At vargaḥ 62 (nācaitasikavargaḥ): "ya ādhyātmiko 'sti vijñānakāyāḥ"}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a classification developed in the tradition of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. They enumerate the five sense consciousnesses, supplemented by the mental consciousness (''manovijñāna''), the '''defiled mental consciousness''' (''kliṣṭamanovijñāna''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), and finally the fundamental '''store-house consciousness''' (''ālāyavijñāna''),  which is the basis of the other seven.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; This eighth consciousness is said to store the impressions (''[[vasanas|vāsanāḥ]]'') of previous experiences, which form the seeds (''[[bīja]]'') of future [[karma]] in this life and in the next after [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].

==The eightfold network of primary consciousnesses==
All surviving schools of Buddhist thought accept&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;"in common"&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;the existence of the first six primary consciousnesses (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|[[vijñāna]]}}'', {{bo|t=རྣམ་ཤེས་|w=rnam-shes}}).&lt;ref name="Berzin MMF Quote"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=Mind and Mental Factors: the Fifty-one Types of Subsidiary Awareness|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors|publisher=Study Buddhism|accessdate=4 June 2016|location=Berlin, Germany; June 2002; revised July, 2006|quote=Unlike the Western view of consciousness as a general faculty that can be aware of all sensory and mental objects, Buddhism differentiates six types of consciousness, each of which is specific to one sensory field or to the mental field.  A primary consciousness cognizes merely the essential nature (''ngo-bo'') of an object, which means the category of phenomenon to which something belongs.  For example, eye consciousness cognizes a sight as merely a sight.  The Chittamatra schools add two more types of primary consciousness to make their list of an eightfold network of primary consciousnesses (''rnam-shes tshogs-brgyad''): deluded awareness (''nyon-yid''), ''alayavijnana'' (''kun-gzhi rnam-shes'', all-encompassing foundation consciousness, storehouse consciousness).  ''Alayavijnana'' is an individual consciousness, not a universal one, underlying all moments of cognition.  It cognizes the same objects as the cognitions it underlies, but is a nondetermining cognition of what appears to it (''snang-la ma-nges-pa'', inattentive cognition) and lacks clarity of its objects.  It carries karmic legacies (''sa-bon'') and the mental impressions of memories, in the sense that both are nonstatic abstractions imputed on the ''alayavijnana''.  The continuity of an individual ''alayavijnana'' ceases with the attainment of enlightenment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The internally coherent {{IAST|Yogācāra}} school associated with [[Maitreya]], [[Asaṅga]], and [[Vasubandhu]], however, uniquely&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;or "uncommonly"&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;also posits the existence of two additional primary consciousnesses, ''kliṣṭamanovijñāna'' and ''{{IAST|ālayavijñāna}}'', in order to explain the workings of ''[[karma]]''.&lt;ref name="Sparham" /&gt;  The first six of these primary consciousnesses comprise the five sensory faculties together with mental consciousness, which is counted as the sixth.&lt;ref name="Berzin Primary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=English Glossary of Buddhist Terms|url=http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xprimary_20consciousness|work=Primary Consciousness|publisher=The Berzin Archives|accessdate=14 February 2013|location=Berlin, Germany|quote=Within a cognition of an object, the awareness of merely the essential nature of the object that the cognition focuses on.  Primary consciousness has the identity-nature of being an individualizing awareness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gareth Sparham, &lt;blockquote&gt;The ''{{IAST|ālaya-vijñāna}}'' doctrine arose on the Indian subcontinent about one thousand years before Tsong kha pa.  It gained its place in a distinctly {{IAST|Yogācāra}} system over a period of some three hundred years stretching from 100 to 400 {{smallcaps|C.E.}}, culminating in the ''{{IAST|[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]}}'', a short text by Asaṅga (circa 350), setting out a systematic presentation of the ''{{IAST|ālaya-vijñāna}}'' doctrine developed over the previous centuries.  It is the doctrine found in this text in particular that Tsong kha pa, in his ''Ocean of Eloquence'', treats as having been revealed in toto by the Buddha and transmitted to suffering humanity through the {{IAST|Yogācāra}} founding saints (Tib. ''shing rta srol byed''): Maitreya&lt;nowiki&gt;[-nātha]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu.&lt;ref name="Sparham" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;While some noteworthy modern scholars of the [[Gelug]] tradition (which was founded by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]]'s reforms to [[Atisha]]'s [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] school) assert that the ''{{IAST|ālāyavijñāna}}'' is posited only in the Yogācāra philosophical tenet system, all non-Gelug schools of Tibetan buddhism maintain that the ''{{IAST|ālāyavijñāna}}'' is accepted by the various [[Madhyamaka]] schools, as well.&lt;ref name="Berzin AEFC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=English Glossart of Buddhist Terms: 'All-encompassing Foundation Consciousness'|url=http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xall-encompassing_20foundation_20consciousness|publisher=The Berzin Archives|accessdate=6 February 2013|location=Berlin, Germany|quote=An unspecified, nonobstructive, individual consciousness that underlies all cognition, cognizes the same objects as the cognitions it underlies, but is a nondetermining cognition of what appears to it and lacks clarity of its objects.

It is also translated as 'foundation consciousness' and, by some translators, as 'storehouse consciousness.'  According to Gelug, asserted only by the Chittamatra system; according to non-Gelug, assserted by both the Chittamatra and Madhyamaka systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{IAST|Yogācāra}} eightfold network of primary consciousnesses&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''{{IAST|[[aṣṭavijñānāni]]}}'' in Sanskrit (from compounding ''{{IAST|[[aṣṭa]]}}'', "eight", with ''{{IAST|vijñānāni}}'', the plural of ''vijñāna'' "consciousnesses"), or {{bo|t=རྣམ་ཤེས་ཚོགས་བརྒྱད་|w=rnam-shes tshogs-brgyad}}&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp; is roughly sketched out in the following table.

==Origins and development==

===Early Buddhist Texts ("EBTs")===
The first five sense-consciousnesses along with the sixth consciousness are identified in the Suttapiṭaka, especially the Salayatanavagga subsection of the [[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyuttanikāya]]:
{{quote|"Monks, I will teach you the All. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."&lt;br /&gt;
"As you say, lord," the monks responded.&lt;br /&gt;
The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye &amp; forms, ear &amp; sounds, nose &amp; aromas, tongue &amp; flavors, body &amp; tactile sensations, intellect &amp; ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html|title=Sabba Sutta: The All|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, the early Buddhist texts speak of [[anusaya|anusayā]] (Sanskrit: anuśayāḥ), the “underlying tendencies” or “latent dispositions” which keep beings caught in the circle of samsara. These potential tendencies are generally seen as unconscious processes which "lie beneath" our everyday consciousness, and according to Waldron "they represent the potential, the tendency, for cognitive and emotional afflictions (Pali: ''kilesā'', Sanskrit: ''kleśāḥ'') to arise".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sautrāntika and Theravāda theories====
The Sautrāntika school of Buddhism, which relied closely on the sutras, developed a theory of seeds (''bīja'', 種子) in the mindstream (''cittasaṃtāna'', 心相續,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?q=%E5%BF%83%E7%9B%B8%E7%BA%8C|title=Digital Dictionary of Buddhism - 心相續|last=Charles|first=Muller|date=2004-09-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lit. "mind-character-continuity") to explain how karma and the latent dispositions continued throughout life and rebirth. This theory later developed into the alayavijñana view.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theravāda theory of the [[Bhavanga|bhavaṅga]] may also be a forerunner of the ālāyavijñana theory. [[Vasubandhu]] cites the bhavaṅgavijñāna of the [[Sinhala Kingdom|Sinhalese]] school (''Tāmraparṇīyanikāya'') as a forerunner of the ālāyavijñāna. The Theravadin theory is also mentioned by Xuánzàng.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmithausen. Ālayavijñāna: On the Origin and Early Development of a Central Concept of Yogācāra Philosophy, Tokyo, 1987, I, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogācāra===
{{Main|Yogācāra}}
The texts of the Yogācāra school gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. It is "meant to be an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} The theory of the ālāyavijñana and the other consciousnesses developed out of a need to work out various issues in Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] thought. According to [[Lambert Schmithausen]], the first mention of the concept occurs in the [[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhumiśāstra]], which posits a basal consciousness that contains seeds for future cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Schmithausen, Lambert. Ālayavijñāna: On the Origin and the Early Development of a Central Concept of Yogācāra Philosophy, International Institute for Buddhist Studies (1987), pp 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; It is also described in the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra|Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra]] and in the [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]] of [[Asanga|Asaṅga]].

[[Vasubandhu]] is considered to be the systematizer of Yogācāra thought.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} Vasubandhu used the concept of the [[Vijñāna#Six vijñānas|six consciousnesses]], on which he elaborated in the ''Triṃśikaikākārikā'' (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas).{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135-143}}

==Vijñānāni==
According to the traditional interpretation, Vasubandhu states that there are eight consciousnesses (''vijñānāni'', singular: ''vijñāna''):
* Five sense-consciousnesses,
* Mind (perception),
* Manas (self-consciousness),{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138-140}}
* Storehouse-consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137-139}}
According to Kalupahana, this classification of eight consciousnesses is based on a misunderstanding of Vasubandhu's Triṃśikaikākārikā by later adherents.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Kalupahana: "The above explanation of ''alaya-vijnana'' makes it very different from that found in the ''Lankavatara''. The latter assumes ''alaya'' to be the eight consciousness, giving the impression that it represents a totally distinct category. Vasubandhu does not refer to it as the eight, even though his later disciples like Sthiramati and Hsuan Tsang constantly refer to it as such".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

===Ālayavijñāna===
The ālayavijñāna (Japanese: 阿頼耶識 arayashiki), or the "All-encompassing foundation consciousness",&lt;ref name="Berzin AEFC" /&gt; forms the "base-consciousness" (''mūlavijñāna'') or "causal consciousness". According to the traditional interpretation, the other seven consciousnesses are "evolving" or "transforming" consciousnesses originating in this base-consciousness. 
The store-house consciousness accumulates all potential energy as seeds (''bīja'') for the mental (''nāma'') and physical (''rūpa'') manifestation of one's existence ([[namarupa|nāmarūpa]]). It is the storehouse-consciousness which induces [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], causing the origination of a new existence.

====Role====
The ālayavijñāna is also described in the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra|Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra]] as the "mind which has all the seeds" (''sarvabījakam cittam'') which enters the womb and develops based on two forms of appropriation or attachment (''[[upādāna]]''); to the material sense faculties, and to predispositions (''[[vāsanā]]ḥ'') towards conceptual proliferations (''[[papañca|prapañca]]'').&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Waldron, William S. How Innovative is ALAYAVIJÑANA&lt;/ref&gt; The Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra also defines it in varying ways:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''This consciousness is also called the appropriating consciousness ("adana-vijñana") because the body is grasped and appropriated by it.''

''It is also called the "alaya-vijñana" because it dwells in and attaches to this body in a common destiny ("ekayogakṣema-arthena").''

''It is also called mind ("citta") because it is heaped up and accumulated by [the six cognitive objects, i.e.:] visual forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles and dharmas.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a seemingly innovative move, the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra states that the alayavijñana is always active subliminally and occurs simultaneously with, "supported by and depending upon" the six sense consciousnesses.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to [[Asanga]]'s [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]], the alayavijñana is taught by other Buddhist schools by different names. He states that the alaya is what the [[Mahasamghikas]] call the “root-consciousness” (''mulavijñana''), what the Mahīśāsakas call “the aggregate which lasts as long as samsara” (''asaṃsārikaskandha'') and what the [[Sthaviras]] call the [[bhavanga|bhavaṅga]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rebirth and purification====
The store-house consciousness receives impressions from all functions of the other consciousnesses, and retains them as potential energy, ''[[bīja]]'' or "seeds", for their further manifestations and activities. Since it serves as the container for all experiential impressions it is also called the "seed consciousness" (種子識) or '''container consciousness'''.

According to Yogācāra teachings, the seeds stored in the store consciousness of sentient beings are not pure.{{refn|group=note|name="individual"|Each being has his own one and only, formless and no-place-to-abide store-house consciousness. Our "being" is created by our own store-consciousness, according to the karma seeds stored in it. In "coming and going" we definitely do not own the "no-coming and no-going" store-house consciousness, rather we are owned by it. Just as a human image shown in a monitor can never be described as lasting for any instant, since "he" is just the production of electron currents of data stored and flow from the hard disk of the computer, so do seed-currents drain from the store-consciousness, never last from one moment to the next.}}

The store consciousness, while being originally immaculate in itself, contains a "mysterious mixture of purity and defilement, good and evil". Because of this mixture the transformation of consciousness from defilement to purity can take place and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]] is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lankavatara Sutra, A Mahayana Text,'' Suzuki's introduction at p. xxvi, available online: [http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the process of purification the dharma practitioner can become an [[Arhat]], when the four defilements of the mental functions {{refn|group=note|心所法), self-delusion (我癡), self-view (我見), egotism (我慢), and self-love (我愛)}} of the manas-consciousness are purified.{{refn|group=note|By then the polluted mental functions of the first six consciousnesses would have been cleansed. The seventh or the manas-consciousness determines whether or not the seeds and the contentdrain from the alaya-vijnana breaks through, becoming a "function" to be perceived by us in the mental or physical world.}} {{refn|group=note|In contrast to an Arhat, a Buddha is one with all his seeds stored in the eighth Seed consciousness. Cleansed and substituted, bad for good, one for one, his polluted-seeds-containing eighth consciousness (Alaya Consciousness) becomes an all-seeds-purified eighth consciousness (Pure consciousness 無垢識 ), and he becomes a Buddha.}}

====Tathagata-garbha thought====
According to the [[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatārasūtra]] and the schools of Chan and Zen Buddhism, the ālāyavijñāna is identical with the ''[[tathagata-garbha|tathāgatagarbha]]''{{refn|group=note|The womb or matrix of the Thus-come-one, the Buddha}}, and is fundamentally pure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}}

The equation of ālāyavijñāna and tathāgatagarbha was contested. It was seen as "something akin to the Hindu notions of ''ātman'' (permanent, invariant self) and ''{{IAST|prakṛti}}'' (primordial substrative nature from which all mental, emotional and physical things evolve)." According to Lusthaus, the critique led by the end of the eighth century to the rise of the logico-epistemic tradition of Yogācāra and a hybrid school combining ''Tathāgatagarbha'' thought with basic Yogācāra doctrines:&lt;ref name=Lusthaus /&gt;

{{quote|The logico-epistemological wing in part sidestepped the critique by using the term ''citta-santāna'', "mind-stream", instead of ''ālaya-vijñāna'', for what amounted to roughly the same idea. It was easier to deny that a "stream" represented a reified self. On the other hand, the Tathāgatagarbha hybrid school was no stranger to the charge of smuggling notions of selfhood into its doctrines, since, for example, it explicitly defined the ''tathāgatagarbha'' as "permanent, pleasurable, ''self'', and pure (''nitya'', ''sukha'', ''ātman'', ''śuddha'')". Many Tathāgatagarbha texts, in fact, argue for the acceptance of selfhood (''ātman'') as a sign of higher accomplishment. The hybrid school attempted to conflate ''tathāgatagarbha'' with the ''ālaya-vijñāna''.&lt;ref name=Lusthaus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lusthaus|first1=Jan|title=What is and isn't Yogācāra|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm|accessdate=12 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190312/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm|archivedate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Transformations of consciousness===
The traditional interpretation of the eight consciousnesses may be discarded on the ground of a reinterpretation of Vasubandhu's works. According to Kalupahana, instead of positing such an consciousnesses, the Triṃśikaikākārikā describes the ''transformations'' of this consciousness:
{{quote|Taking ''vipaka'', ''manana'' and ''vijnapti'' as three different kinds of functions, rather than characteristics, and understanding ''vijnana'' itself as a function (''vijnanatiti vijnanam''), Vasubandhu seems to be avoiding any form of substantialist thinking in relation to consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}}}

These transformations are threefold:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}
{{quote|Whatever, indeed, is the variety of ideas of self and elements that prevails, it occurs in the transformation of consciousness. Such transformation is threefold, [namely,]{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=192, Trimsika verse 1}}}}

The first transformation results in the ''ālāya'':
{{quote|the resultant, what is called mentation, as well as the concept of the object. Herein, the consciousness called ''alaya'', with all its seeds, is the resultant.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=194, Trimsika verse 2}}}}

The ālāyavijñāna therefore is not an eighth consciousness, but the resultant of the transformation of consciousness:
{{quote|Instead of being a completely distinct category, ''alaya-vijnana'' merely represents the normal flow of the stream of consciousness uninterrupted by the appearance of reflective self-awareness. It is no more than the unbroken stream of consciousness called the life-process by the Buddha. It is the cognitive process, containing both emotive and co-native aspects of human experience, but without the enlarged egoistic emotions and dogmatic graspings characteristic of the next two transformations.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

The second transformation is ''manana'', self-consciousness or "Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}} According to the Lankavatara and later interpreters it is the seventh consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} It is "thinking" about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} The alaya is defiled by this self-interest;
{{quote|[I]t can be purified by adopting a non-substantialist (''anatman'') perspective and thereby allowing the ''alaya''-part (i.e. attachment) to dissipate, leaving consciousness or the function of being intact.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}}}}

The third transformation is ''viṣayavijñapti'', the "''concept'' of the object".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}} In this transformation the ''concept'' of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become "susceptible to grasping after the object":{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}}
{{quote|Vasubandhu is critical of the third transformation, not because it relates to the conception of an object, but because it generates grasping after a "real object" (''sad artha''), even when it is no more than a conception (''vijnapti'') that combines experience and reflection.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141-142}}}}

A similar perspective is give by [[Walpola Rahula]]. According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogācāra storehouse-consciousness are already found in the Pāli Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the three layers of the mind (''citta'', ''manas'', and ''vijñāna'') as presented by Asaṅga are also mentioned in the Pāli Canon:
{{quote|Thus we can see that 'Vijñāna' represents the simple reaction or response of the sense organs when they come in contact with external objects. This is the uppermost or superficial aspect or layer of the 'Vijñāna-skandha'. 'Manas' represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning, conceiving ideas, etc. 'Citta' which is here called 'Ālayavijñāna', represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the Aggregate of consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of the past actions and all good and bad future possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Understanding in Buddhist Tradition==

===China===

==== Fǎzàng and Huayan ====
According to Thomas McEvilley, although Vasubandhu had postulated numerous ālāya-vijñāna-s, a separate one for each individual person in the parakalpita,{{refn|group=note|name="individual"}} this multiplicity was later eliminated in the [[Dharma character school|Fa Hsiang]] and [[Huayan school|Huayan]] metaphysics.{{refn|group=note|See also [[Buddha-nature#Popularisation in Chinese Buddhism]]}} These schools inculcated instead the doctrine of a single universal and eternal ālaya-vijñāna. This exalted enstatement of the ālāyavijñāna is described in the Fa Hsiang as "primordial unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTfm8KHn900C&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq=Fa-hsiang+Storehouse+McEvilley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I92PoQErVo&amp;sig=_ueayedFHrmyNbKIjqjxOhJ8Ojw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|first=Thomas|last=McEvilley|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Allworth Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas McEvilley further argues that the presentation of the three natures by Vasubandhu is consistent with the Neo-platonist views of [[Plotinus]] and his universal 'One', 'Mind', and 'Soul'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTfm8KHn900C&amp;pg=PA572&amp;lpg=PA572&amp;dq=Plotinian+Neoplatonism+Consciousness-Only+Storehouse+McEvilley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I92PoQysSt&amp;sig=37KFY-9Sv6RKj-EmdXMpNxniNpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|first=Thomas|last=McEvilley|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Allworth Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chán====
A core teaching of Chan/Zen Buddhism describes the transformation of the Eight Consciousnesses into the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Wisdoms]].{{refn|group=note|It is found in Chapter 7 of the [[Platform Sutra]] of the Sixth Ancestor Zen Master [[Huineng]] and other Zen masters, such as [[Hakuin Ekaku]], in his work titled ''Keiso Dokuqui'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terebess.hu/zen/hakuin1.html#1|title=Hakuin Ekaku (1685-1768). Selected  Writings|website=terebess.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hsu Yun|Xuyun]], in his work titled ''Daily Lectures at Two Ch'an Weeks'', Week 1, Fourth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsuyun.budismo.net/en/dharma/chan_sessions3.html|title=Master Hsu Yun (Xu Yun) - Daily Lectures at Two Ch'an Weeks|website=hsuyun.budismo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In this teaching, Buddhist practice is to turn the light of awareness around, from misconceptions regarding the nature of reality as being external, to kenshō, "directly see one's own nature".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Thus the Eighth Consciousness is transformed into the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the Seventh Consciousness into the Equality (Universal Nature) Wisdom, the Sixth Consciousness into the Profound Observing Wisdom, and First to Fifth Consciousnesses into the All Performing (Perfection of Action) Wisdom.

The [[Huayan#Interpenetration|Interpenetration]] (通達) and [[Essence-Function (體用)]] of [[Wonhyo]] (元曉) is described in the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Treatise on Awakening Mahāyāna Faith]] (大乘起信論, ''Mahāyānaśraddhotpādaśāstra,'' AMF in the excerpt below):
{{quote|The author of the ''AMF'' was deeply concerned with the question of the respective origins of ignorance and enlightenment. If enlightenment is originally existent, how do we become submerged in ignorance? If ignorance is originally existent, how is it possible to overcome it? And finally, at the most basic level of mind, the ''alaya'' consciousness (藏識), is there originally purity or taint? The ''AMF'' dealt with these questions in a systematic and thorough fashion, working through the Yogacāra concept of the ''alaya'' consciousness. The technical term used in the ''AMF'' which functions as a metaphorical synonym for interpenetration is "permeation" or "perfumation (薫)," referring to the fact that defilement (煩惱) "perfumates" suchness (眞如), and suchness perfumates defilement, depending on the current condition of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Charles A. |title=The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa |work=Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University |number=3 |date=March 1995 |pages=33–48 |url=http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |accessdate=18 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072632/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |archivedate=28 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:NewtonsLawOfUniversalGravitation.svg|thumb|right|200px|The theory of ''entropic gravity'' abides by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] on Earth and at interplanetary distances but diverges from this classic nature at interstellar distances.]]

'''Entropic gravity''', also known as '''emergent gravity''', is a theory in modern physics that describes [[gravity]] as an ''[[entropic force]]''—a force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to [[Quantum fluctuation|quantum-level]] disorder—and not a [[fundamental interaction]]. The theory, based on [[string theory]], [[black hole]] physics, and [[quantum information theory]], describes gravity as an ''emergent'' phenomenon that springs from the [[quantum entanglement]] of small bits of [[spacetime]] information. As such, entropic gravity is said to abide by the [[second law of thermodynamics]] under which the [[entropy]] of a physical system tends to increase over time.

At its simplest, the theory holds that when gravity becomes vanishingly weak—levels seen only at interstellar distances—it diverges from its classically understood nature and its strength begins to decay ''linearly with distance'' from a mass.

Entropic gravity provides the underlying framework to explain [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]], or MOND, which holds that at a [[gravitational acceleration]] threshold of approximately {{val|1.2e-10}} m/s², gravitational strength begins to vary ''inversely'' (linearly) with distance from a mass rather than the normal [[inverse-square law]] of the distance. This is an exceedingly low threshold, measuring only 12&amp;nbsp;trillionths [[Standard gravity|gravity’s strength at earth’s surface]]; an object dropped from a height of one meter would fall for 36 hours were earth’s gravity this weak. It is also 3,000 times less than exists at the point where {{nowrap|''[[Voyager 1]]''}} crossed our solar system’s [[Heliosphere#Heliopause|heliopause]] and entered interstellar space.

The theory claims to be consistent with both the macro-level observations of [[Newtonian gravity]] as well as Einstein's [[general relativity|theory of general relativity]] and its gravitational distortion of spacetime. Importantly, the theory also explains (without invoking the existence of [[dark matter]] and its accompanying math featuring new [[free parameter]]s that are tweaked to obtain the desired outcome) why [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation curves]] differ from the profile expected with visible matter.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The theory of entropic gravity posits that what has been interpreted as unobserved dark matter is the product of quantum effects that can be regarded as a form of ''positive [[dark energy]]'' that lifts the [[vacuum energy]] of space from its ground state value. A central tenet of the theory is that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal-volume law contribution to entropy that overtakes the area law of [[anti-de Sitter space]] precisely at
the [[Hubble volume|cosmological horizon]].

The theory has been controversial within the physics community but has sparked research and experiments to test its validity.

==Origin==
The thermodynamic description of gravity has a history that goes back at least to research on [[black hole thermodynamics]] by [[Jacob Bekenstein|Bekenstein]] and [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] in the mid-1970s. These studies suggest a deep connection between [[gravity]] and thermodynamics, which describes the behavior of heat. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Jacobson]] demonstrated that the [[Einstein field equations]] describing relativistic gravitation can be derived by combining general thermodynamic considerations with the [[equivalence principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobson |first=Theodore|title=Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260|date=4 April 1995|pages=1260–1263|issue=7|volume=75|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|arxiv=gr-qc/9504004|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1260J|pmid=10060248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other physicists, most notably [[Thanu Padmanabhan]], began to explore links between gravity and [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padmanabhan|first=Thanu|title=Thermodynamical Aspects of Gravity: New insights|year=2010|pages=6901|issue=4|volume=73|journal=Rep. Prog. Phys. |arxiv=0911.5004|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/73/4/046901|bibcode=2010RPPh...73d6901P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Mok|first=H.M.|title=Further Explanation to the Cosmological Constant Problem by Discrete Space-time Through Modified Holographic Principle|eprint=physics/0408060|date=13 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erik Verlinde's theory==
In 2009, [[Erik Verlinde]] proposed a conceptual model that describes gravity as an entropic force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=van Calmthout|first=Martijn|title=Is Einstein een beetje achterhaald?|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article1326775.ece/Is_Einstein_een_beetje_achterhaald|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=de Volkskrant|date=12 December 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues (similar to Jacobson's result) that gravity is a consequence of the "information associated with the positions of material bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E.P. Verlinde |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2011)029 |journal=JHEP |title=On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton |bibcode = 2011JHEP...04..029V |arxiv = 1001.0785 |volume=2011|issue=4 |pages=29 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model combines the thermodynamic approach to gravity with [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s [[holographic principle]]. It implies that gravity is not a [[fundamental interaction]], but an [[emergent phenomenon]] which arises from the statistical behavior of microscopic [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] encoded on a holographic screen.  The paper drew a variety of responses from the scientific community. [[Andrew Strominger]], a string theorist at Harvard said "Some people have said it can't be right, others that it's right and we already knew it — that it’s right and profound, right and trivial."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A Scientist Takes On Gravity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13gravity.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Verlinde presented the further development of his ideas in a contribution to the Strings 2011 conference, including an explanation for the origin of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.physics.uu.se/external/strings2011/presentations/5%20Friday/1220_Verlinde.pdf E.

Verlinde's article also attracted a large amount of media exposure,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527443.800-the-entropy-force-a-new-direction-for-gravity.html?page=1 The entropy force: a new direction for gravity], [[New Scientist]], 20 January 2010, issue 2744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/01/gravity-is-an-entropic-form-of-holographic-information/ Gravity is an entropic form of holographic information], ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and led to immediate follow-up work in cosmology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1001.3237 |author1=Fu-Wen Shu |author2=Yungui Gong |title=Equipartition of energy and the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon |year=2011 |doi=10.1142/S0218271811018883 |volume=20 |issue=4 |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |pages=553–559|bibcode = 2011IJMPD..20..553S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rong-Gen Cai |author2=Li-Ming Cao |author3=Nobuyoshi Ohta |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.061501 |journal=Phys.

==Derivation of the law of gravitation==
The law of gravitation is derived from classical statistical mechanics applied to the [[holographic principle]], that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; bits of binary information, encoded on a boundary to that region, a closed surface of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The information is evenly distributed on the surface with each bit requiring an area equal to &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called ''Planck area'', from which &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can thus be computed:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A}{\ell_\text{P}^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck length]]. The Planck length is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P} = \sqrt\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. When substituted in the equation for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; we find:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A c^3}{\hbar G}&lt;/math&gt;

The statistical [[equipartition theorem]] defines the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a system with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom in terms of its energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} N k_\text{B} T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. This is the [[mass–energy equivalence|equivalent energy]] for a mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;E = Mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The effective temperature experienced due to a uniform acceleration in a [[vacuum state|vacuum field]] according to the [[Unruh effect]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_\text{B}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is that acceleration, which for a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; would be attributed to a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; according to [[Newton's second law]] of motion:

:&lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the holographic screen to be a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the surface area would be given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

From algebraic substitution of these into the above relations,  one derives from first principles [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{2\pi c k_\text{B} T}{\hbar} = m \frac{4\pi c}{\hbar} \frac{E}{N} = m \frac{4\pi c^3}{\hbar} \frac{M}{N} = m 4\pi \frac{GM}{A} = G \frac{m M}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Criticism and experimental tests==

Entropic gravity, as proposed by Verlinde in his original article, reproduces the [[Einstein field equations]] and, in a Newtonian approximation, a 1/r potential for gravitational forces. Since its results do not differ from Newtonian gravity except in regions of extremely small gravitational fields, testing the theory with earth-based laboratory experiments doesn’t appear feasible. Spacecraft-based experiments performed at [[Lagrangian point]]s within our solar system would be expensive and challenging.

Even so, entropic gravity in its current form has been severely challenged on formal grounds. [[Matt Visser]] has shown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Conservative entropic forces|journal=JHEP|volume=1110|issue=10|pages=140|arxiv=1108.5240|year=2011|doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2011)140}}, to appear in JHEP&lt;/ref&gt; that the attempt to model conservative forces in the general Newtonian case (i.e. for arbitrary potentials and an unlimited number of discrete masses) leads to unphysical requirements for the required entropy and involves an unnatural number of temperature baths of differing temperatures. Visser concludes:
{{quote|There is no reasonable doubt concerning the physical reality of entropic forces, and no reasonable doubt that classical (and semi-classical) general relativity is closely related to thermodynamics [52–55]. Based on the work of Jacobson [1–6], [[Thanu Padmanabhan]] [7– 12], and others, there are also good reasons to suspect a thermodynamic interpretation of the fully relativistic Einstein equations might be possible. Whether the specific proposals of Verlinde [26] are anywhere near as fundamental is yet to be seen — the rather baroque construction needed to accurately reproduce n-body Newtonian gravity in a Verlinde-like setting certainly gives one pause.}}

For the derivation of Einstein's equations from an entropic gravity perspective, Tower Wang shows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Wang |first=Tower |title=Modified entropic gravity revisited |eprint=1211.5722|class=hep-th |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the inclusion of energy-momentum conservation and cosmological homogeneity and isotropy requirements severely restrict a wide class of potential modifications of entropic gravity, some of which have been used to generalize entropic gravity beyond the singular case of an entropic model of Einstein's equations. Wang asserts that:
{{quote|As indicated by our results, the modified entropic gravity models of form (2), if not killed, should live in a very narrow room to assure the energy-momentum conservation and to accommodate a homogeneous isotropic universe.}}

Cosmological observations using available technology can be used to test the theory. On the basis of lensing by the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, Nieuwenhuizen concludes that EG is strongly ruled out unless additional (dark) matter like eV neutrinos is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Zwicky already ruled out modified gravity theories without dark matter|first=Theodorus M.|last=Nieuwenhuizen |journal=Fortschritte der Physik|volume=65|issue=6–8|page=1600050|doi=10.1002/prop.201600050|arxiv=1610.01543|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from [[Leiden Observatory]] statistically observing the [[Gravitational lens|lensing effect of gravitational fields]] at large distances from the centers of more than 33,000 galaxies, found that those gravitational fields were consistent with Verlinde's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein’s gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using conventional gravitational theory, the fields implied by these observations (as well as from measured [[galaxy rotation curves]]) could only be ascribed to a particular distribution of [[dark matter]].

In June 2017, a study by [[Princeton University]] researcher Kris Pardo asserted that Verlinde's theory is inconsistent with the observed rotation velocities of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].&lt;ref name="QuantaMagazine2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Researchers Check Space-Time to See if It's Made of Quantum Bits | website=Quanta Magazine | date=2017-06-21 | url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-check-space-time-to-see-if-its-made-of-quantum-bits-20170621/ | access-date=2017-08-11 | quote=Emergent gravity successfully predicts the rotation velocities of the smallest galaxies in the sample. But it predicts velocities far too low for the more massive galaxies, especially the ones full of gas clouds.

[[Sabine Hossenfelder]] argues that "one should interpret these studies with caution" because "approximations must be made to arrive at [the tested] equation[s]" and it's not yet clear that the approximations are themselves correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/02/28/is-dark-matter-about-to-be-killed-by-emergent-gravity/ |title=Recent Claims Invalid: Emergent Gravity Might Deliver A Universe Without Dark Matter |last1=Hossenfelder |first1=Sabine |date=28 February 2017 |website=forbes.com |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entropic gravity and quantum coherence===
Another criticism of entropic gravity is that entropic processes should, as critics argue, break [[quantum coherence]]. Experiments with ultra-cold neutrons in the gravitational field of Earth are claimed to show that neutrons lie on discrete levels exactly as predicted by the [[Schrödinger equation]] considering the gravitation to be a conservative potential field without any decoherent factors. Archil Kobakhidze argues that this result disproves entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobakhidze |first=Archil |title= Gravity is not an entropic force |eprint=1009.5414 |journal= Physical Review D |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luboš Motl]] gives explanations of this position in his blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motl|first1=Luboš|title=Why gravity can't be entropic|url=http://motls.blogspot.ru/2010/01/erik-verlinde-why-gravity-cant-be.html|website=The Reference Frame|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motl|first1=Luboš|title=Once more: gravity is not an entropic force|url=http://motls.blogspot.ru/2011/08/once-more-gravity-is-not-entropic-force.html|website=The Reference Frame|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chaichian et al. suggest a potential loophole in the argument in weak gravitational fields such as those affecting Earth-bound experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4650.pdf On Gravity as an Entropic Force ArXiv 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon"''' was a  [[song]] written by [[Will A. Heelan]], and [[J. Fred Helf]] that was popular in the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The song followed the previous success of "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]", written in 1896 by [[Ernest Hogan]]. [[H. L. Mencken]] cites it as being one of the three [[coon songs]] which "firmly established the term ''coon'' in the American vocabulary".

The song was a musical hit of the day by A. M. Rothschild and Company in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 15 -- No Title. (1901, September 15). Chicago Daily Tribune (1872-1963), p. 45.

(Document ID: 425880041)&lt;/ref&gt;  New York's [[Siegel Cooper Company]] referred to it as one of his greatest hits in April a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 9 -- No Title. (1902, April 10).

(Document ID: 101946057).&lt;/ref&gt; The next month it was sung during "Music on the Piers" in New York, being the first song played at the Metropolitan Avenue pier.&lt;ref&gt;DELAY IN GAMBLING CASES: Moral Value Lost Unless Prosecutions Are Speedy, Jerome Says..

(Document ID: 118471848).&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen'', [[Nick Clooney]] refers to the song as part of the "hit parade" of popular music one could use to measure the temper of the times when ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' premiered in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003), pp. 285-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The tune is repeatedly referred to in the literature as having the ability to incite violence merely by whistling it in the direction of an African American. It was also [[Marie Dressler|Marie Dressler's]] contribution to the 'coon' genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Marie Dressler: A Biography, With a Listing of Major Stage Performances, a Filmography and a Discography'' (Jefferson NC: McFarland &amp; Company, December 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lottie Gilson]], [[Bert Williams|Williams and Walker]], [[Frances Curran]], [[Hodges and Launchmere]], [[Libby and Bennett]], [[Zoa Matthews]], [[Johnnie Carroll]], [[Clarice Vance]], [[Gerie Gilson]], [[Joe Bonnell]], [[The Eldridges]] and "100 other artists" sang the song with "overwhelming success" according to its sheet music.

The song motivated the creation of the [[Pan-African flag]] in 1920 by the members of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Flag for Afro-Americans," ''[[Africa Times and Orient Review]]''; 1 (October 1912):134; Cited in ''RACE FIRST: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1987), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the ''[[Negro World]]'' weekly newspaper, [[Marcus Garvey]] was quoted as saying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garvey|first1=Marcus|title=Honorable Marcus Garvey, Gifted Man of Vision, Sets Out In Unanswerable Terms the Reasons Why Negroes Must Build in Africa|work=Negro World|issue=Vol XXII No. 6|publisher=Universal Negro Improvement Association|date=March 19, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Show me the race or the nation without a flag, and I will show you a race of people without any pride. Aye! In song and mimicry they have said, "Every race has a flag but the coon." How true! Aye! But that was said of us four years ago. They can't say it now....}}

The lyrics to "Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon" include the musical meme [[Four Eleven Forty Four|"four eleven forty four"]].

'''Existential phenomenology''' is [[Martin Heidegger]]'s brand of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/phenomenological-movement/existential-phenomenology "Phenomenological movement: 4. Existential phenomenology].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In contrast with his former mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], Heidegger (in his ''[[Being and Time]]'') put [[ontology]] before [[epistemology]] and thought that phenomenology would have to be based on an observation and analysis of ''[[Dasein]]'' ("being-there"), human being, investigating the fundamental ontology of the ''Lebenswelt'' ([[lifeworld]], Husserl's term) underlying all so-called regional ontologies of the special sciences. In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]], Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of ''Dasein'' existentially (''existenzial''), rather than [[existentiell]]y (''existenziell'') because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with "penetrating fashion".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Development==
Besides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frantz Fanon]],  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Enzo Paci|it}} and [[Samuel Todes]].

==Other disciplines==
Existential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines. For example, [[Leo Steinberg]]'s essay "[[The Philosophical Brothel]]" describes Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in a perspective that is existential-phenomenological. It has also impacted [[architectural theory]], especially in the phenomenological and Heideggerian approaches to space, place, dwelling, technology, etc.&lt;ref&gt;This is evident in the works of [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], as for example is the case with his book: ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), or more recently with the numerous papers of [[Nader El-Bizri]] such as his paper: 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' Volume 60 (2015): 5–30. This is also felt with the practices of architects in the [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] movement&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the general topic}}
{{Wiktionary|guideline}}
A '''guideline''' is a statement by which to determine a course of action. A guideline aims to streamline particular processes according to a set routine or sound practice. By definition, following a guideline is never mandatory. Guidelines are not binding and are not enforced.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs, http://www.va.gov/trm/TRMGlossaryPage.asp  &lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines may be issued by and used by any organization (governmental or private) to make the actions of its employees or divisions more predictable, and presumably of higher quality.

==List of guidelines==
Examples of guidelines are:
* [[Ethical_code#Code_of_practice_.28professional_ethics.29|Code of practice]]
* [[EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators of Scientific Articles]]
* [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]]
* [[Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office]]
* [[The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation]]
* [[Guideline (medical)|Medical guidelines]]
* [[Human interface guidelines]]
* [[Publicly Available Specification]]
* [[Programming_style | Programming style guidelines]]
* [[UNGEGN Toponymic Guidelines]]

[[File:First members of harmonic sequence.svg|thumb|The first ten members of the harmonic sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n=\tfrac 1n&lt;/math&gt;.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''harmonic progression''' (or '''harmonic sequence''') is a progression formed by taking the reciprocals of an [[arithmetic progression]]. It is a [[sequence]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{a} ,\ \frac{1}{a+d}\ , \frac{1}{a+2d}\ , \frac{1}{a+3d}\ , \cdots, \frac{1}{a+kd},&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;minus;a/''d'' is not a [[natural number]] and ''k'' '''is''' a natural number.

Equivalently, a sequence is a harmonic progression when each term is the [[harmonic mean]] of the neighboring terms.

It is not possible for a harmonic progression (other than the trivial case where ''a'' = 1 and ''k'' = 0)  to sum to an [[integer]]. The reason is that, necessarily, at least one denominator of the progression will be divisible by a [[prime number]] that does not divide any other denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=P.|last= Erdős |authorlink=Paul Erdős |title=Egy Kürschák-féle elemi számelméleti tétel általánosítása|trans-title=Generalization of an elementary number-theoretic theorem of Kürschák|language=Hungarian|journal=Mat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hausdorff maximal principle''' is an alternate and earlier formulation of [[Zorn's lemma]] proved by [[Felix Hausdorff]] in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.

The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] over ZF ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the '''Hausdorff maximality theorem''' or the '''Kuratowski lemma''' (Kelley 1955:33).

==Statement==

The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.

An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.

To prove that it follows from the original form, let ''A'' be a [[poset]]. Then &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered subset of ''A'', hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, in particular ''A'' contains a maximal totally ordered subset.

For the converse direction, let ''A'' be a partially ordered set and ''T'' a totally ordered subset of ''A''. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\{S\mid T\subseteq S\subseteq A\mbox{ and S totally ordered}\}&lt;/math&gt;
is partially ordered by set inclusion &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;, therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset ''P''. Then the set &lt;math&gt;M=\bigcup P&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the desired properties.

The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.

== Examples ==
'''EXAMPLE 1.'''    If ''A'' is any collection of sets, the relation "is a proper subset of" is a [[strict partial order]] on ''A''. Suppose that ''A'' is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of ''A'' consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.

'''EXAMPLE 2.''' If (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are two points of the plane ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, define (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

if y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a partial ordering of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal totally ordered sets are horizontal lines in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

They became an example as well as an exponent of how the French-speaking bourgeoisie (from Wallonia but also from Flanders) treated their Flemish fellow-citizens, of whom the language – if not its speakers – was considered inferior by the elite.
Later on, the real perpetrators confessed to the murder, which in 1873 led to a debate in [[Parliament of Belgium|parliament]] that ended in the ''Coremans Act'', one of the first laws to recognize Dutch as an official language in Belgium, allowing the Flemish to use their own language at Flemish courts, though not yet in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
On 23 March 1860, widow Dubois was the victim of an assault and robbery by night in [[Charleroi|Couillet near Charleroi]]. She was discovered in agony only the next day, and died of her injuries a few days later. To the village policeman, she had only been able to utter that her attackers spoke "Flemish". Consequently, the attention was drawn on two Flemings who had been making a living in the region, Jan Coucke, a forty-nine-year-old potato salesman born in [[Zwevegem|Sint-Denijs near Kortrijk]], and Pieter Goethals, a railroad worker originating from [[Aalter|Lotenhulle]] and thirty-four years of age.

Their trial in French at the [[Assize Court]] of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] in [[Mons]] started on 20 August 1860. Although both lived in [[Couillet, Belgium|Couillet]], [[Wallonia]], and spoke French for their work, they were assisted by a Dutch translator, Pierre Van Horenbeek.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/saga-belgica-4-30--coucke-et-goethals-condamnes_t-20080528-00G876.html |title = Coucke et Goethals, condamnés parce qu’ils étaient… coupables |publisher=Le Soir |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate =2011-09-23|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutor Charles-Victor de Bavay obtained their death sentence five days later. They were beheaded on the Grand Market Place of Charleroi a few weeks later.

In 1861, a year after the execution, 14 members of the infamous Black Gang were to appear before the same assize court. The leader of the gang, Leopold Rabet, confessed that French-speaking gang members had killed the widow Dubois. Jean-Baptiste Boucher and Auguste Leclercq confessed to having committed the murder and were sentenced to death. They also confessed that although Coucke and Goethals did not kill the widow, they were their accomplices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;!--
In the ''Journal des Tribunaux'' of 21 November 1889, [[Jules Destrée]] held a plea for a revision of the trial. This was five years before Destrée became elected as Socialist [[Member of Parliament]] for the electoral ''[[arrondissements of Belgium#Electoral|arrondissement]]'' of Charleroi--&gt;&lt;!--NO link to 'Ar. of Ch': no longer an electoral arrondissement! and not to the city--&gt;&lt;!--, and many more years before he elated the Walloon soul and opposed the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish]] by the [[Walloon Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;

--&gt;

On 18 July 2005 at the Belgian federal parliament, [[Filip De Man]] directed a series of questions at the vice-prime minister and minister of Justice ([[Laurette Onkelinx]]), regarding the case Coucke and Goethals. His introduction stated that since 1861 there had been several attempts to officially restore the honour of Coucke and Goethals.  In 2000, [[Johan Vande Lanotte]], [[:nl:Siegfried Bracke|Siegfried Bracke]] and Geert Goedertier had still written (in ''België voor beginners. Wegwijs in het Belgisch labyrint'', p.&amp;nbsp;27, die Keure, Brugge) that Coucke and Goethals were not the murderers of the widow, but were informed on the murder.  In 1948, a study by the Flemish journalist Herman Bossier had concluded that there had not been a [[miscarriage of justice]], as according to the journalist, the declaration by Rabet included errors and two other members of the Black Gang, after their trial, had talked about the Flemish as accomplices; the interpreter would not have been a ''gendarme'' from Luxembourg, but a sworn translator of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin (''Nederlandse afkomst'').  On five occasions Goethals would have confessed and as chief railroad worker he had to know the French language, while Coucke sold vegetables to French-speaking customers and, having had money problems before the murder, thereafter had means of which he could not demonstrate the origin.

The Member of Parliament then asked whether the ''[[wiktionary:dossier|dossier]]'' of the trial case could be looked into by [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s or by civilians, and whether it corroborated the journalist's statements about Rabet, the interpreter, Goethals' confessions, and Coucke's financial situation.  He also wished to know whether the nine death penalties of 17 January 1862 by the same court of which seven had been reduced, were connected to the Black Gang and thus to Boucher, Leclerq, and Rabet.  Would the Minister of Justice in this case be willing to ask the advice of the Attorney General at the [[Appeal Court]] of Mons, and to ask for the revision of the verdict of 1869, or to provide reasons for not asking the latter.

The Minister replied one year later, on 24 July 2006. The confession of guilt by third parties can be considered as a ''new fact'' having taken place after the conviction, offering the possibility to review the case.  The criticism and advises that several authors may have brought forward, do not form a ground for a revision.  According to the Minister, of the mentioned elements, only the statement by Rabet form such a ground in as far it is of a nature that proves the innocence of the convicts and it has been made in circumstances giving credibility to that statement or confession.  The mentioned information however, does not offer the possibility to assess the reality, the circumstances, and the reach of the declarations by Rabet.  The ''dossier'' on the case can be viewed if the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons gives his permission, even in case it is in the National Archives as it is over a hundred years old.

'''Jonathan McIntosh''' is an American producer, writer, artist, and cultural critic. He is the creator of the Pop Culture Detective Agency video series examining intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment. He was also a producer and co-writer on the ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'' YouTube video series.

==Video==
===Remix Work===
McIntosh produced [[video mashup]]s early in his film career. A proponent of [[remix culture]], he spoke on the topic and how media produced in this fashion can be uniquely powerful tools for commenting on political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I+C+i #2 // The Remix as Cultural Ecosystem|url=http://www.cccb.org/en/activities/file/i-c-i-2-the-remix-as-cultural-ecosystem/217907|website=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American academic and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]] cites McIntosh's work as among his favorites in the book [[Remix (book)|Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy]] for its ability to deliver "a message more powerfully than any original alone could."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessig|first1=Lawrence|title=Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7eRPKIvEo9gC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;dq=%22jonathan+mcintosh%22+remix#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20mcintosh%22%20remix&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 July 2017|isbn=9781440634628}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Buffy versus Edward====
In 2012, McIntosh spoke before the [[United States Copyright Office]] to advocate for exemptions to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]—a law designed to criminalize the unauthorized production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services regarding copyrighted works—that was adversely affecting video artists like himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kravets|first1=David|title=Feds Considering Allowing DVD-Encryption Cracking|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/05/dvd-encryption-hacking|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Wired|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2009 video, ''Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed''—a high-profile mashup video and [[Webby Award]] nominee for remixing—was used as an example in the copyright discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nye Griffiths|first1=Daniel|title=Copyright In The Twilight Zone: The Strange Case Of 'Buffy Versus Edward'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/01/15/copyright-in-the-twilight-zone-the-strange-case-of-buffy-versus-edward|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Previous exemptions|final rulemaking]] stated an exemption for: "Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances." It specifically points out ''Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed'' in the rulemaking: &lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the video evidence presented, the Register is able to conclude that diminished quality likely would impair the criticism and comment contained in noncommercial videos.  For example, the Register is able to perceive that Buffy vs Edward and other noncommercial videos would suffer significantly because of blurring and the loss of detail in characters’ expression and sense of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Section 1201 Rulemaking: Fifth Triennial Proceeding to Determine Exemptions to the Prohibition on Circumvention|date=2012|url=https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2012/Section_1201_Rulemaking_2012_Recommendation.pdf|website=Copyright.gov|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tropes vs. Women in Video Games===
From 2013-2015, McIntosh worked on the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games YouTube video series as a producer and co-writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan McIntosh|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7366402/|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=September 2017}} The web series was a highly successful [[Kickstarter]] created by [[Anita Sarkeesian]] that examined gender tropes in video games.

===Pop Culture Detective Agency===
In 2016 McIntosh launched the Pop Culture Detective Agency, a [[Patreon]]-funded web series examining the intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rouner|first1=Jef|title=Feminist Frequency’s Jonathan McIntosh Has New Show About Masculinity|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/feminist-frequency-s-jonathan-mcintosh-has-new-show-about-masculinity-8568260|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Houston Press|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The long-form video essays examine a variety of topics within these themes. One episode explored the concept of [[toxic masculinity]] through an American pop culture lens. Other episodes are devoted to examining specific pieces of pop culture, such as television programs [[Steven Universe]] and [[The Big Bang Theory]], and films including [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] and [[Star Wars]]. Some of the videos produced in the series propose new cultural tropes in which to understand the topics discussed, such as ''Born Sexy Yesterday'', which seeks to explain how fictional characters exhibit men’s fear of experienced women.

==Writing==
In 2014, McIntosh wrote the opinion piece, ''Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIntosh|first1=Jonathan|title=Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male|date=April 23, 2014|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/4/23/5640678/playing-with-privilege-the-invisible-benefits-of-gaming-while-male|website=Polygon|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mullis|first1=Steve|title=Gaming While Male: A 'Privilege' Few Men Recognize|date=April 27, 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/04/27/306853264/gaming-while-male-a-privilege-few-men-recognize|website=NPR|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addressed the [[Gamergate controversy]] that had been receiving increasing media attention and public discourse. In the piece, he sought to address the underlying problems that contributed toward [[sexism in video gaming]] by examining the inherent privileges that male-identified gamers benefit from.  Taking inspiration from the famous ''Daily Effects of White Privilege'' list by [[Peggy McIntosh]], among others, McIntosh listed 25 Daily Effects of Male Game Privilege. These included such privileges as "I will never be asked or expected to speak for all other gamers who share my gender."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2791">The '''law of the case''' is a [[law|legal]] [[term of art]] that is applicable mainly in [[common law]], or Anglo-American, jurisdictions that recognize the related doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]].''  The phrase refers to instances where "rulings made by a trial court and not challenged on appeal become the law of the case." &lt;ref&gt;Hughes v. State  490 A.2d 1034, 1048 (Del.,1985) (citing Haveg Corp. v. Guyer, Del.Supr., 211 A.2d 910, 912 (1965))&lt;/ref&gt; "Unless the trial court's rulings were clearly in error or there has been an important change in circumstances, the court's prior rulings must stand." &lt;ref&gt;Id. citing United States v. Estrada-Lucas, 651 F.2d 1261, 1263 (9th Cir.1980); Smith v. United States, D.C.App., 406 A.2d 1262 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the situation occurs when either a case is on appeal for the second time—''e.g.'' if the reviewing court remanded the matter to the trial court and the party appeals again or if the case was appealed in a higher [[appellate court]]—for example, from an appellate court to the highest court.  

As generally used, "law of the case" states that, if an appellate court has passed on a legal question and remanded the case to the court below for further proceedings, the legal question thus determined by the appellate court will not be differently determined on a subsequent appeal in the same case where the facts remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;''Allen v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co.'', 232 N.W.2d 302, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine provides that an appellate court’s determination on a legal issue is binding on both the trial court on remand and on the appellate court on a subsequent appeal given the same case and substantially the same facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinds v. McNair'', 413 N.E.2d 586, 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "law of the case" doctrine, however, is one of policy only and will be disregarded when compelling circumstances call for a redetermination of a point of law on prior appeal. This is particularly true where an intervening or a contemporaneous change in law has occurred where former decisions have been overruled or new precedent has been established by controlling authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Ryan v. Mike-Ron Corp.'', 259 Cal.App.2d 91, 96 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "law of the case" doctrine precludes reconsideration of a previously decided issue unless one of three "exceptional circumstances" exists: (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Jefferson'', 31 S.W.3d 558, 561 (Tenn. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5240">'''Legal opportunity structure''' or '''legal opportunity''' is a concept found in the study of law and [[social movements]]. It was first used in order to distinguish it from [[political opportunity structure]] or [[political opportunity]], on the basis that law and the courts deserved to be studied in their own right rather than being lumped together with political institutions.&lt;ref name="HilsonChris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hilson | first = Chris | title = New social movements: the role of legal opportunity | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 238–255 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110120246 | date = January 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110120246 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal opportunities are made up of: access to the courts, which may be affected in particular by the law on standing or ''locus standi'', and costs rules; 'legal stock' or the set of available precedents on which to hang a case;&lt;ref name="AndersenEllen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Andersen | first = Ellen Ann | title = Out of the closets &amp; into the courts: legal opportunity structure and gay rights litigation | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780472021574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial receptiveness. Some of these are more obviously structural than others - hence the term legal opportunity is sometimes preferred over legal opportunity structure.

Legal opportunity has been used as an [[independent variable]] to help to explain strategy choice by social movement organisations (SMOs) - e.g. why SMOS adopt litigation rather than protest or political lobbying as a strategy. Other variables or explanatory frameworks it is commonly found alongside include [[framing (social sciences)|framing]],&lt;ref name="VanhalaLisa"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vanhala | first = Lisa | title = Making rights a reality?: disability rights activists and legal mobilization | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781107000872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource mobilization]] and grievance.

'''Moral rationalism''', also called '''ethical rationalism''', is a view in [[meta-ethics]] (specifically the [[epistemology]] of [[ethics]]) according to which moral principles are knowable ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', by reason alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919107782|title=Ethical rationalism and the law|others=Capps, Patrick,, Pattinson, Shaun D.,|isbn=9781849467865|location=Oxford|oclc=919107782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent figures in the [[history of philosophy]] who have defended moral rationalism are [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Perhaps the most prominent figure in the history of philosophy who has rejected moral rationalism is [[David Hume]]. Recent philosophers who have defended moral rationalism include [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Alan Gewirth]], and [[Michael A. Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith]].

Moral rationalism is similar to the rationalist version of [[ethical intuitionism]]; however, they are distinct views. Moral rationalism is neutral on whether basic moral beliefs are known via inference or not. A moral rationalist who believes that some moral beliefs are justified non-inferentially is a [[Ethical intuitionism#Rational intuition versus moral sense|rationalist ethical intuitionist]]. So, rationalist ethical intuitionism implies moral rationalism, but the reverse does not hold.

==Emotions and reason==

There are two main forms of moral rationalism, associated with two major forms of reasoning.  If moral reasoning is based on [[theoretical reason]], and is hence analogous to discovering [[empirical]] or [[scientific]] [[truth]]s about the world, a purely emotionless being could arrive at the truths of reason.  Such a being wouldn't necessarily be motivated to act morally.  Beings who are motivated to act morally can also arrive at moral truths, but needn't rely upon their emotions to do so.

Many moral rationalists believe that moral reasoning is based on [[practical reason]], which involves choices about what to do or intend to do, including how to achieve one's goals and what goals one should have in the first place.  In this view, moral reasoning always involves emotional states and hence be intrinsically motivating.  Immanuel Kant expressed this view when he said that immoral actions do not involve a contradiction in belief, but a contradiction in the will, that is, in one's commitment to a principle which one intends to motivate actions. Christine Korsgaard's elaboration of Kantian reasoning tries to show that if ethics is actually based on practical reasoning, this shows that it can be objective and universal, without having to appeal to questionable metaphysical assumptions.

==Criticisms==
[[Moral sense theory|Moral sense theorists]] (or sentimentalists), such as [[David Hume]], are the key opponents of moral rationalism. In Book 3 of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (EPM), Hume argues (among other things) that reason and emotions (or the "passions" as he often calls them) are quite distinct faculties and that the foundations of morality lie in sentiment, not reason. Hume takes it as a fact about human psychology and morality that moral judgments have an essentially emotional, sentimental, or otherwise non-rational or cognitive character to them. According to Hume, "...morality is determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary" (EPM, Appendix 1, ¶10).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10630">'''Negative consequentialism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[consequentialism]], which is "one of the major theories of [[normative ethics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|2013|page=vii}}: "Consequentialism is one of the major theories of normative ethics."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as "what should I do?" and "what kind of person should I be?" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “Negative consequentialism is the version of consequentialism that focuses on reducing harms. It has this focus because it assumes that there aren’t things of positive intrinsic value, while there are things of negative intrinsic value. Therefore, in deciding on whether to act in a particular way, a negative consequentialist would consider what harms it would cause, eliminate, increase or decrease.”
{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.”
{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight. (In what follows, I use the word 'happiness' to stand in for whatever aspects of life might be thought to have positive value).”
&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific type of consequentialism is [[utilitarianism]], which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|page=19}} Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|Mason|Miller|2000|page=2}}: “Other consequentialist theories take other things to be valuable, for example justice, fairness, and equality.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negative utilitarianism]] is thus a form of negative consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “One form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism.”&lt;/ref&gt; Much more has been written explicitly about [[negative utilitarianism]] than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative [[prioritarianism]] and negative consequentialist [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “According to negative consequentialism such as negative prioritarianism, negative utilitarianism, and negative consequentialist egalitarianism...”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]]'s ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1995|page=46}}: “Moore is indeed a consequentialist.”&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that "consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil"{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=213}} whereas "the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, ''by itself'', appear to be a ''great'' good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good."{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=212}} Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore died in 1958; the same year that both of the terms 'consequentialism' and 'negative utilitarianism' seem to have been coined. According to {{harvnb|Spielthenner|2005|page=231}}, "It seems that the term 'consequentialism' has been coined by E. Anscombe in her influential article 'Modern Moral Philosophy' (1958)." {{harvnb|Smart|1958}} is widely considered to have coined the term 'negative utilitarianism.'&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Moore, [[Ingemar Hedenius]] defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.{{sfn|Petersson|2009}}

Philosophy professor Clark Wolf defends "negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2009|page=360}}: "For a defence of a negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice, see Wolf (1999)." That is, see {{harvnb|Wolf|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] interprets [[Bernard Gert]]'s moral system as a "sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism."{{sfn|Sinnott-Armstrong|2002|p=147}} Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=116}}: "The duty to relieve suffering, I have suggested, arises from the badness of suffering." {{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=117}}: "The duty to relieve suffering is consequentialist in form."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "suffering is more bad than happiness is good,"{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=136}} and that "the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one."{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=178}}

'''Object permanence''' is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be perceived (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied in the field of [[developmental psychology]], the subfield of [[psychology]] that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.

[[Jean Piaget]], the Swiss psychologist who first studied object permanence in infants, argued that it is one of an infant's most important accomplishments, as, without this concept, objects would have no separate, permanent existence. In [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], infants develop this understanding by the end of the "[[sensorimotor stage]]," which lasts from birth to about two years of age.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2008 | title = A topical approach to life-span development | first=John W.|last=Santrock | edition=4 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | place=New York City | isbn=978-0-07-3133768}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget thought that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their [[Motor skill|motor development]], which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects. According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop object permanence.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bremner |first=JG |title=Infancy |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |edition=2 |isbn=0-631-18466-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early research==

Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget conducted experiments that collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied object permanence by observing infants' reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented and then was covered with a blanket or removed from sight. Object permanence is considered to be one of the earliest methods for evaluating [[working memory]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Jean|author2=Peggy MacLean |author3=Michele Shaffer |author4=Kristi Watterberg |title=Early Working Memory in Children Born With Extremely Low Birth Weight: Assessed by Object Permanence|journal=Journal of Child|year=2009|volume=24|issue=4|pages=410–415|doi=10.1177/0883073808324533|url=http://cordproxy.mnpals.net/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.cordproxy.mnpals.net/docview/621922851?accountid=10244}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused.&lt;ref name=Ellis-Christensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis-Christensen|first=Tricia|title=What Is Object Permanence?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-object-permanence.htm|publisher=Conjecture Corporation|accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had  ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration because they knew it existed, but didn't know where it was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

Piaget concluded that some infants are too young to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their parents are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to [[A-not-B error]]s, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently.&lt;ref name=Sophian&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.6.932 |journal=Developmental Psychology |title=Infants' understanding of visible displacements |last1=Sophian |first1=C. |last2=Yengo |first2=L. |volume=21 |year=1985 |pages=932–941 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

In Piaget's formulation, there are six stages of object permanence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3813049|title=The essential Piaget|last=Piaget|first=Jean|date=1977|publisher=Routledge and K. Paul|editor1=Gruber, Howard E.|editor2=Vonèche, J. Jacques.|isbn=0710087780|location=London|oclc=3813049}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

# 0–1 months: '''Reflex Schema Stage''' – Babies learn how the body can move and work. Vision is blurred and attention spans remain short through infancy. They aren't particularly aware of objects to know they have disappeared from sight. However, babies as young as seven minutes old prefer to look at faces. The three primary achievements of this stage are: sucking, visual tracking, and hand closure.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=John E.|title=Review of The construction of reality in the child|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1955|volume=52|issue=6|pages=526–8|doi=10.1037/h0039645}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# 1–4 months: '''Primary Circular Reactions''' – Babies notice objects and start following their movements.  They continue to look where an object was, but for only a few moments. They 'discover' their eyes, arms, hands and feet in the course of acting on objects. This stage is marked by responses to familiar images and sounds (including parent's face) and anticipatory responses to familiar events (such as opening the mouth for a spoon). The infant's actions become less reflexive and intentionality emerges.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; 
# 4–8 months: '''Secondary Circular Reactions''' – Babies will reach for an object that is partially hidden, indicating knowledge that the whole object is still there. If an object is completely hidden however the baby makes no attempt to retrieve it. The infant learns to coordinate vision and comprehension. Actions are intentional but the child tends to repeat similar actions on the same object. Novel behaviors are not yet imitated.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; 
# 8–12 months: '''Coordination of Secondary Circular Reactions''' – This is deemed the most important for the cognitive development of the child. At this stage the child understands causality and is goal directed. The very earliest understanding of object permanence emerges, as the child is now able to retrieve an object when its concealment is observed. This stage is associated with the classic [[A-not-B error]]. After successfully retrieving a hidden object at one location (A), the child fails to retrieve it at a second location (B).&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; 
# 12–18 months: '''Tertiary Circular Reaction''' – The child gains means-end knowledge and is able to solve new problems. The child is now able to retrieve an object when it is hidden several times within his or her view, but cannot locate it when it is outside their perceptual field.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;
# 18–24 months: '''Invention of New Means Through Mental Combination''' – The child fully understands object permanence. They will not fall for A-not-B errors. Also, a baby is able to understand the concept of items that are hidden in containers.  If a toy is hidden in a matchbox then the matchbox put under a pillow and then, without the child seeing, the toy is slipped out of the matchbox and the matchbox then given to the child, the child will look under the pillow upon discovery that it is not in the matchbox. The child is able to develop a mental image, hold it in mind, and manipulate it to solve problems, including object permanence problems that are not based solely on perception. The child can now reason about where the object may be when invisible displacement occurs.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

==Contradicting evidence==

In more recent years, the original Piagetian object permanence account has been challenged by a series of infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, T.G.R. (1974). Development in infancy. San Francisco: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baillargeon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baillargeon|first=R|author2=DeVos, J |title=Object permanence in young infants: further evidence|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=6|pages=1227–46|doi=10.2307/1130803|pmid=1786712}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.

The first study showed infants a toy car that moved down an inclined track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged at the other end, still on the track. The researchers created a "possible event" where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an "impossible event." In this situation, the toy mouse was placed on the tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse.  Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall.&lt;ref name=Baillargeon /&gt;   The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event).&lt;ref name=Baillargeon /&gt; Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may have been surprised by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment.  This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

There are primarily four challenges to Piaget's framework:

# Whether or not infants without disabilities actually demonstrate object permanence earlier than Piaget claimed.&lt;ref name=Zsuzsa&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Káldy |first1=Zsuzsa |last2=Sigala |first2=Natasha |title=The neural mechanisms of object working memory: What is where in the infant brain? |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |year=2004 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=113–121 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.01.002 |url=http://cordproxy.mnpals.net/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.cordproxy.mnpals.net/docview/620420191?accountid=10244}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# There is disagreement about the relative levels of difficulty posed by the use of various types of covers and by different object positions.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lucas |first1=Thomas|last2=Uzgiris |first2=Ina C. |title=Spatial factors in the development of the object concept.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1977|volume=13|issue=5|pages=492–500|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.13.5.492|url=http://cordproxy.mnpals.net/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.cordproxy.mnpals.net/docview/616220376?accountid=10244}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Controversy concerns whether or not perception of object permanence can be achieved or measured without the motor acts that Piaget regarded as essential.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=M. Keith|author2=Andrew N. Meltzoff |title=Object Permanence After a 24-Hr Delay and Leaving the Locale of Disappearance: The Role of Memory, Space, and Identity.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=4|pages=606–620|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.4.606|url=http://cordproxy.mnpals.net/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.cordproxy.mnpals.net/docview/620426719?accountid=10244|pmid=15238047|pmc=1398789}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The nature of inferences that can be made from the A-not-B error has been challenged. Studies that have contributed to this discussion have examined the contribution of memory limitations, difficulty with spatial localization, and difficulty in inhibiting the motor act of reaching to location A on the A-not-B error.&lt;ref name=Baillargeon /&gt;

One criticism of Piaget's theory is that culture and education exert stronger influences on a child's development than Piaget maintained. These factors depend on how much practice their culture provides in developmental processes, such as conversational skills.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

However, many other types of animals have been shown to have the ability for object permanence. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, [[Eurasian jay]]s and food-storing [[magpie]]s.  Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Holly|author2=Cassie D.

==Recent studies==
One of the areas of focus on object permanence has been how physical disabilities ([[blindness]], [[cerebral palsy]] and [[Hearing impairment|deafness]]) and intellectual disabilities ([[Down syndrome]], etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, the results showed that the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.

Some psychologists believe that 'while object permanence alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence along with several other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=J. V.|date=May 1976|title=Utility of the Uzgiris and Hunt seales of sensorimotor development with severely and profoundly retarded children|journal=American Journal of Mental Deficiency|volume=80|issue=6|pages=663–665|issn=0002-9351|pmid=961731}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence is one of the milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with [[language acquisition]], object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Ingram|last2=Lewis|first2=Vicky|last3=Collis|first3=Glyn M.|date=June 2006|title=Imitation and representational development in young children with Down syndrome|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1348/026151005X51257|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=429–450|doi=10.1348/026151005x51257|issn=0261-510X|accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, more recent studies suggest that the idea of object permanence may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bremner | first1 = J.

[[Image:Operant conditioning diagram.png|thumb|400px|Diagram of operant conditioning]]
'''Operant conditioning''' (also called '''instrumental conditioning''') is a learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment.  It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning.

Although operant and [[classical conditioning]] both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior.  For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the candy inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are "discriminative stimuli". Operant behavior is said to be "voluntary": for example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy.

In contrast, [[classical conditioning]] involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. For example, sight of candy may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily "chosen".

The study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. M. "Animal Learning and Behavior Theory" Ch. 5 in Hearst, E. "The First Century of Experimental Psychology"  Hillsdale N. J.,  Earlbaum, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and they are still at the core of behavior analysis.

==Historical note==

===Thorndike's law of effect===
{{Main|Law of effect}}
Operant conditioning, sometimes called ''instrumental learning'', was first extensively studied by [[Edward L. Thorndike]] (1874–1949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorndike|first1=E.L.|year=1901|title=Animal intelligence: An experimental study of the associative processes in animals|url=|journal=Psychological Review Monograph Supplement|volume=2|issue=|pages=1–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained, the cats took a long time to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thorndike generalized this finding in his [[law of effect]], which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences ''strengthen'' behavior and some consequences ''weaken'' behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal [[learning curve]]s through this procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans appear to learn many simple behaviors through the sort of process studied by Thorndike, now called operant conditioning. That is, responses are retained when they lead to a successful outcome and discarded when they do not, or when they produce aversive effects. This usually happens without being planned by any "teacher", but operant conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="parenting"&gt;Miltenberger, R. G., &amp; Crosland, K. A. (2014). Parenting. The wiley blackwell handbook of operant and classical conditioning. (pp. 509–531) Wiley-Blackwell. {{DOI|10.1002/9781118468135.ch20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===B. F. Skinner===
{{Main|B. F. Skinner}} 
[[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) is referred to as the father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His 1938 book "The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis",&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis", 1938 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of [[Ernst Mach]], Skinner rejected Thorndike's reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|year=1950|title=Are theories of learning necessary?|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=57|issue=|pages=193–216|doi=10.1037/h0054367|pmid=15440996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner believed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be used to describe something as complex as human behavior. Operant conditioning, in his opinion, better described human behavior as it examined causes and effects of intentional behavior.

To implement his empirical approach, Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], or "''Skinner Box''", in which subjects such as pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli. Unlike Thorndike's puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, and the rate of such responses became Skinner's primary behavioral measure.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "B. F. Skinner: The role of reinforcement and Punishment", subsection in: Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011, 278–288.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ferster, C. B. &amp; Skinner, B. F.  "Schedules of Reinforcement", 1957 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; A reinforcement schedule may be defined as "any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staddon|first=J. E. R|author2=D. T Cerutti|date=February 2003|title=Operant Conditioning|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=115–144|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|pmc=1473025|accessdate=23 March 2013|pmid=12415075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Mecca Chiesa (2004) Radical Behaviorism: The philosophy and the science&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Skinner's writings are devoted to the application of operant conditioning to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Science and Human Behavior", 1953. New York: MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948 he published ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional account of a peaceful, happy, productive community organized around his conditioning principles.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] published ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Verbal Behavior", 1957. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the principles of operant conditioning to language, a form of human behavior that had previously been analyzed quite differently by linguists and others. Skinner defined new functional relationships such as "mands" and "tacts" to capture some essentials of language, but he introduced no new principles, treating verbal behavior like any other behavior controlled by its consequences, which included the reactions of the speaker's audience.

==Concepts and procedures==

===Origins of operant behavior: operant variability===
Operant behavior is said to be "emitted"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place.  The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A|year=2002|title=Operant variability: Evidence, functions, and theory|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|issue=4|pages=672–705|doi=10.3758/bf03196324|pmid=12613672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifying operant behavior: reinforcement and punishment===
{{Main|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. 
* '''Positive reinforcement''' and '''negative reinforcement''' increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while '''positive punishment''' and '''negative punishment''' reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. 
Another procedure is called "extinction".
* '''Extinction''' occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. 
There are a total of five consequences. 
# '''[[Positive reinforcement]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) is [[reward system|rewarding]] or the behavior is followed by another stimulus that is rewarding, increasing the frequency of that behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data|journal=Physiological Reviews|volume=95|issue=3|pages=853–951|doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014|pmc=4491543|pmid=26109341|quote=Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.|vauthors=Schultz W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a rat in a [[Skinner box]] gets food when it presses a lever, its rate of pressing will go up.  This procedure is usually called simply ''reinforcement''.
# '''[[Negative reinforcement]]''' (a.k.a. escape) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an [[aversive]] stimulus, thereby increasing the original behavior's frequency. In the Skinner Box experiment, the aversive stimulus might be a loud noise continuously inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat presses a lever to turn off the noise.
# '''[[Positive punishment]]''' (also referred to as "punishment by contingent stimulation") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an aversive stimulus. Example: pain from a [[spanking]], which would often result in a decrease in that behavior. ''Positive punishment'' is a confusing term, so the procedure is usually referred to as "punishment".
# '''[[Negative punishment]]''' (penalty) (also called "punishment by contingent withdrawal") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus. Example: taking away a child's toy following an undesired behavior by him/her, which would result in a decrease in the undesirable behavior.
# '''[[extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been reinforced is no longer effective. Example: a rat is first given food many times for pressing a lever, until the experimenter no longer gives out food as a reward. The rat would typically press the lever less often and then stop. The lever pressing would then be said to be "extinguished."

It is important to note that actors (e.g. a rat) are not spoken of as being reinforced, punished, or extinguished; it is the ''actions'' that are reinforced, punished, or extinguished. Reinforcement, punishment, and extinction are not terms whose use is restricted to the laboratory. Naturally-occurring consequences can also reinforce, punish, or extinguish behavior and are not always planned or delivered on purpose.

====Schedules of reinforcement====
Schedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement. The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used&lt;ref&gt;Schacter et al.2011 Psychology 2nd ed. pg.280–284 Reference for entire section Principles version 130317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

* Fixed interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a "break-run" pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.
* Variable interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.
* Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.
* Variable ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.
* Continuous reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated.

====Factors that alter the effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment====
The effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment can be changed. 
# '''Satiation/Deprivation''': The effectiveness of a positive or "appetitive" stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received enough of that stimulus to satisfy his/her appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the effectiveness of a consequence will then increase. A subject with a full stomach wouldn't feel as motivated as a hungry one.&lt;ref name = Miltenberger84&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Immediacy''': An immediate consequence is more effective than a delayed one. If one gives a dog a treat for sitting within five seconds, the dog will learn faster than if the treat is in thirty.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Contingency''': To be most effective, reinforcement should occur consistently after responses and not at other times. Learning may be slower if reinforcement is intermittent, that is, following only some instances of the same response. Responses reinforced intermittently are usually slower to extinguish than are responses that have always been reinforced.&lt;ref name = Miltenberger84/&gt;
# '''Size''': The size, or amount, of a stimulus often affects its potency as a reinforcer. Humans and animals engage in cost-benefit analysis. A smaller amount of food may not, to a rat, seem a worthwhile reward for an effortful lever press. A pile of quarters from a slot machine may keep a gambler pulling the lever longer than a single quarter. Most of these factors serve biological functions.  For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment ([[homeostasis]]). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is an effective reinforcer. When the organism's [[blood sugar]] reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective or even aversive.

====Shaping====
{{main|Shaping (psychology)}}
Shaping is a conditioning method much used in animal training and in teaching nonverbal humans. It depends on operant variability and reinforcement, as described above. The trainer starts by identifying the desired final (or "target") behavior. Next, the trainer chooses a behavior that the animal or person already emits with some probability. The form of this behavior is then gradually changed across successive trials by reinforcing behaviors that approximate the target behavior more and more closely. When the target behavior is finally emitted, it may be strengthened and maintained by the use of a schedule of reinforcement.

====Noncontingent reinforcement====
Noncontingent reinforcement is the delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism's behavior. Noncontingent reinforcement may be used in an attempt to reduce an undesired target behavior by reinforcing multiple alternative responses while extinguishing the target response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=M.|last2=Sigafoos|first2=J.|last3=Bushell|first3=H.|year=1998|title=Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=22|issue=|pages=529–547|doi=10.1177/01454455980224005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent "reinforcement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poling|first1=A.|last2=Normand|first2=M.|year=1999|title=Noncontingent reinforcement: an inappropriate description of time-based schedules that reduce behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=32|issue=|pages=237–238|doi=10.1901/jaba.1999.32-237|pmc=1284187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimulus control of operant behavior===
{{main|Stimulus control}}
Though initially operant behavior is emitted without an identified reference to a particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come under the control of stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called "discriminative stimuli." A so-called "[[three-term contingency]]" is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Example: a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of his/her food bag; a child reaches for candy when s/he sees it on a table.

====Discrimination, generalization &amp; context====
Most behavior is under stimulus control. Several aspects of this may be distinguished: 
*'''Discrimination''' typically occurs when a response is reinforced only in the presence of a specific stimulus. For example, a pigeon might be fed for pecking at a red light and not at a green light; in consequence, it pecks at red and stops pecking at green.  Many complex combinations of stimuli and other conditions have been studied; for example an organism might be reinforced on an interval schedule in the presence of one stimulus and on a ratio schedule in the presence of another. 
*'''Generalization''' is the tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to a previously trained discriminative stimulus. For example, having been trained to peck at "red" a pigeon might also peck at "pink", though usually less strongly.
*'''Context''' refers to stimuli that are continuously present in a situation, like the walls, tables, chairs, etc. in a room, or the interior of an operant conditioning chamber. Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly.  Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another.  This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur elsewhere.

===Behavioral sequences: conditioned reinforcement and chaining===
Most behavior cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one. The scope of operant analysis is expanded through the idea of behavioral chains, which are sequences of responses bound together by the three-term contingencies defined above.  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer". For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise – turn-around – light – press lever – food". Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

===Escape and avoidance===
In escape learning, a behavior terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding one's eyes from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light in one's eyes.  (This is an example of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called "avoidance,"  as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors.  Avoidance behavior raises the so-called "avoidance paradox", for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).

Two kinds of experimental settings are commonly used: discriminated and free-operant avoidance learning.

====Discriminated avoidance learning====
A discriminated avoidance experiment involves a series of trials in which a neutral stimulus such as a light is followed by an aversive stimulus such as a shock. After the neutral stimulus appears an operant response such as a lever press prevents or terminate the aversive stimulus. In early trials, the subject does not make the response until the aversive stimulus has come on, so these early trials are called "escape" trials. As learning progresses, the subject begins to respond during the neutral stimulus and thus prevents the aversive stimulus from occurring. Such trials are called "avoidance trials." This experiment is said to involve classical conditioning because a neutral CS is paired with the aversive US; this idea underlies the two-factor theory of avoidance learning described below.

====Free-operant avoidance learning====
In free-operant avoidance a subject periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays the onset of the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence of a response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays the onset of the next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.

====Two-process theory of avoidance====

This theory was originally proposed in order to explain discriminated avoidance learning, in which an organism learns to avoid an aversive stimulus by escaping from a signal for that stimulus. Two processes are involved: classical conditioning of the signal followed by operant conditioning of the escape response:

a) ''Classical conditioning of fear.'' Initially the organism experiences the pairing of a CS (conditioned stimulus) with an aversive US (unconditioned stimulus). The theory assumes that this pairing creates an association between the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) – "fear." b) ''Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction.'' As a result of the first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. Note that the theory does not say that the organism "avoids" the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism "escapes" an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.
Several experimental findings seem to run counter to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see [[Classical conditioning]]). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"&gt;Pierce &amp; Cheney (2004) Behavior Analysis and Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operant or "one-factor" theory====
Some theorists suggest that avoidance behavior may simply be a special case of operant behavior maintained by its consequences. In this view the idea of "consequences" is expanded to include sensitivity to a pattern of events. Thus, in avoidance, the consequence of a response is a reduction in the rate of aversive stimulation. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that a "missed shock" is detected as a stimulus, and can act as a reinforcer. Cognitive theories of avoidance take this idea a step farther. For example, a rat comes to "expect" shock if it fails to press a lever and to "expect no shock" if it presses it, and avoidance behavior is strengthened if these expectancies are confirmed.&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"/&gt;

===Operant hoarding===
Operant hoarding refers to the observation that rats reinforced in a certain way may allow food pellets to accumulate in a food tray instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of [[extinction]] during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations in which there is a choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay. See [[schedules of reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=M.R.|year=1990|title=Operant hoarding: A new paradigm for the study of self-control|url=|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=53|issue=|pages=247–262|doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.53-247|pmc=1323010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurobiological correlates==
{{Further|Reward system}}
The first scientific studies identifying [[neuron]]s that responded in ways that suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong&lt;ref&gt;[http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/citation/34/3/414 "Activity of pallidal neurons during movement"], M.R. DeLong, ''J. Neurophysiol.'', 34:414–27, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RTR&amp;MRD"&gt;Richardson RT, DeLong MR (1991): Electrophysiological studies of the function of the nucleus basalis in primates. In Napier TC, Kalivas P, Hamin I (eds), ''The Basal Forebrain: Anatomy to Function'' (''Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology'', vol. 295. New York, Plenum, pp. 232–252&lt;/ref&gt; and by R.T. Richardson.&lt;ref name=RTR&amp;MRD/&gt; They showed that [[nucleus basalis]] neurons, which release [[Acetylcholine#Neuromodulatory Effects|acetylcholine]] broadly throughout the [[cerebral cortex]], are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and have been shown to be related to [[neuroplasticity]] in many [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;PNAS 93:11219-24 1996, Science 279:1714–8 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also exists that [[Dopamine#Functions in the brain|dopamine]] is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and aversive learning.&lt;ref&gt;Neuron 63:244–253, 2009, Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, 3: Article 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto [[frontal cortex]] regions. [[Cholinergic]] projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the [[primary visual cortex]]. A study of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Frank, Lauren C. Seeberger, and Randall C. O'Reilly (2004) "By Carrot or by Stick: Cognitive Reinforcement Learning in Parkinsonism," ''Science'' 4, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.

A neurochemical process involving dopamine has been suggested to underlie reinforcement.  When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, [[dopamine]] pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways "releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many [[dendrites]], thus broadcasting a global reinforcement signal to [[postsynaptic neuron]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|year=1998|title=Predictive Reward Signal of Dopamine Neurons|url=|journal=The Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the probability of occurrence for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, the most likely to have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.

==Questions about the law of effect==
A number of observations seem to show that operant behavior can be established without reinforcement in the sense defined above. Most cited is the phenomenon of [[Shaping (psychology)#Autoshaping|autoshaping]]  (sometimes called "sign tracking"), in which a stimulus is repeatedly followed by reinforcement, and in consequence the animal begins to respond to the stimulus. For example, a response key is lighted and then food is presented. When this is repeated a few times a pigeon subject begins to peck the key even though food comes whether the bird pecks or not. Similarly, rats begin to handle small objects, such as a lever, when food is presented nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timberlake|first1=W|year=1983|title=Rats' responses to a moving object related to food or water: A behavior-systems analysis|url=|journal=Animal Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=309–320|doi=10.3758/bf03199781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A.J.|year=1969|title=Animals respond for food in the presence of free food|url=|journal=Science|volume=166|issue=|pages=399–401|doi=10.1126/science.166.3903.399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strikingly, pigeons and rats persist in this behavior even when pecking the key or pressing the lever leads to less food (omission training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D.R.|last2=Williams|first2=H.|year=1969|title=Auto-maintenance in the pigeon: sustained pecking despite contingent non-reinforcement|url=|journal=J.

These observations and others appear to contradict the [[law of effect]], and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement  (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R.A.|last2=Gardner|first2=B.T.|year=1988|title=Feedforward vs feedbackward: An ethological alternative to the law of effect|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=11|issue=|pages=429–447|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00058258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, R. A. &amp; Gardner B.T. (1998) The structure of learning from sign stimuli to sign language. Mahwah NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum|first1=W. M.|year=2012|title=Rethinking reinforcement: Allocation, induction and contingency|url=|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=97|issue=|pages=101–124|doi=10.1901/jeab.2012.97-101|pmc=3266735}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  A more general view is that autoshaping is an instance of [[classical conditioning]]; the autoshaping procedure has, in fact, become one of the most common ways to measure classical conditioning.  In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter's task is to work out how these interact.&lt;ref&gt;Locurto, C. M., Terrace, H. S., &amp; Gibbon, J. (1981) Autoshaping and conditioning theory. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of someone having a positive experience with a drug is easy to see how drug dependence and the law of effect works. The tolerance for a drug goes down as one continues to use it after having a positive experience with a certain amount the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Neil, Carlson; et al. (2007). Psychology The Science Of Behaviour. New Jersey, USA: Pearson Education Canada, Inc.,. p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; It will take more and more to get that same feeling. This is when the controlled substance in an experiment would have to be modified and the experiment would really begin. The law of work for psychologist B. F. Skinner almost half a century later on the principles of operant conditioning, "a learning process by which the effect, or consequence, of a response influences the future rate of production of that response.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter. Psychology, Worth, NY. 6th ed. pp 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Reinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. Following are a few examples.

===Applied behavior analysis===

{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}
[[Applied behavior analysis]] is the discipline initiated by [[B. F. Skinner]] that applies the principles of conditioning to the modification of socially significant human behavior. It uses the basic concepts of conditioning theory, including conditioned stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;), discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;), response (R), and reinforcing stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;rein&lt;/sup&gt; or S&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; for reinforcers, sometimes S&lt;sup&gt;ave&lt;/sup&gt; for aversive stimuli).&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"/&gt; A conditioned stimulus controls behaviors developed through respondent (classical) conditioning, such as emotional reactions. The other three terms combine to form Skinner's "three-term contingency": a discriminative stimulus sets the occasion for responses that lead to reinforcement. Researchers have found the following protocol to be effective when they use the tools of operant conditioning to modify human behavior:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# '''State goal'''  Clarify exactly what changes are to be brought about. For example, "reduce weight by 30 pounds."
# '''Monitor behavior'''  Keep track of behavior so that one can see whether the desired effects are occurring. For example, keep a chart of daily weights.
# '''Reinforce desired behavior'''  For example, congratulate the individual on weight losses.  With humans, a record of behavior may serve as a reinforcement. For example, when a participant sees a pattern of weight loss, this may reinforce continuance in a behavioral weight-loss program. However, individuals may perceive reinforcement which is intended to be positive as negative and vice versa. For example, a record of weight loss may act as negative  reinforcement if it reminds the individual how heavy they actually are. The [[token economy]], [[token economy|is]] an exchange system in which tokens are given as rewards for desired behaviors.  Tokens may later be exchanged for a desired prize or rewards such as power, prestige, goods or services.
# '''Reduce [[incentive]]s to perform undesirable behavior'''  For example, remove candy and fatty snacks from kitchen shelves.

Practitioners of applied behavior analysis (ABA) bring these procedures, and many variations and developments of them, to bear on a variety of socially significant behaviors and issues. In many cases, practitioners use operant techniques to develop constructive, socially acceptable behaviors to replace aberrant behaviors.  The techniques of ABA have been effectively applied in to such things as [[Lovaas model|early intensive behavioral interventions]] for children with an [[autism spectrum disorders|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD)&lt;ref name="As-in-ABA"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dillenburger, K.|author2=Keenan, M.|year=2009|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths|journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193–95|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}&lt;/ref&gt; research on the principles influencing [[criminology|criminal behavior]], HIV prevention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DeVries, J.E.|author2=Burnette, M.M.|author3=Redmon, W.K.|year=1991|title=AIDS prevention: Improving nurses' compliance with glove wearing through performance feedback|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=24|issue=4|pages=705–11|doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-705|pmc=1279627|pmid=1797773}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation of natural resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brothers, K.J.|author2=Krantz, P.J.|author3=McClannahan, L.E.|year=1994|title=Office paper recycling: A function of container proximity|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=27|issue=1|pages=153–60|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-153|pmc=1297784|pmid=16795821}}&lt;/ref&gt; education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dardig, Jill C.|author2=Heward, William L.|author3=Heron, Timothy E.|author4=Nancy A.

===Addiction and dependence===

Positive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence]]. An addictive drug is [[reward system|intrinsically rewarding]]; that is, it functions as [[#Primary reinforcers|a primary positive reinforcer]] of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it [[incentive salience]] (i.e., it is "wanted" or "desired"),&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder|journal=Prog. Brain Res.|volume=223|issue=|pages=63–76|doi=10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.005|pmid=26806771|quote=Abused substances (ranging from alcohol to psychostimulants) are initially ingested at regular occasions according to their positive reinforcing properties. Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&amp;nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).|vauthors=Edwards S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2012|title=From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation|journal=Eur.

The CS even takes on some incentive properties similar to its UCS. An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to ‘consume’ the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). ‘Wanting’ of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).|vauthors=Berridge KC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2015|title=Pleasure systems in the brain|journal=Neuron|volume=86|issue=3|pages=646–664|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018|pmc=4425246|pmid=25950633|quote=An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense ‘wanting’ (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more ‘wanted’ than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more ‘wanted’ more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&amp;nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify ‘wanting’ (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing ‘liking’ tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use&amp;nbsp;– e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use&amp;nbsp;– become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become [[#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of continued use.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is [[self-administration|self-administered]] in order to alleviate or "escape" the symptoms of [[physical dependence]] (e.g., [[tremor]]s and sweating) and/or [[psychological dependence]] (e.g., [[anhedonia]], restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of [[drug withdrawal]].&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;

===Animal training===
{{main|Animal training}}
Animal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are the following: 
(a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); 
(b) the use of secondary reinforcement, (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); 
(c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; 
(d) shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; 
(e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; 
(f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;McGreevy, P &amp; Boakes, R."Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training".(Sydney: "Sydney University Press"., 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Example of animal training from Seaworld related on Operant conditioning 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seaworld.org/en/animal-info/animal-infobooks/animal-training/animal-training-basics|website=Animal training basics|publisher=Seaworld parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal training has effects on positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Schedules of reinforcements may play a big role on the animal training case.

=== Child behaviour – parent management training ===
{{Main|Parent management training}}
Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child).&lt;ref name="Kazdin2010"&gt;Kazdin AE (2010). Problem-solving skills training and parent management training for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. ''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 211–226. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called "successive approximations").&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="PMTO"&gt;Forgatch MS, Patterson GR (2010). Parent management training — Oregon model: An intervention for antisocial behavior in children and adolescents. ''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 159–78. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
{{main|Behavioral economics}}
{{further|Consumer demand tests (animals)}}
Both psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example 
is the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called "the price elasticity of demand." Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other essentials may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;Domjan, M. (2009). The Principles of Learning and Behavior. Wadsworth Publishing Company. 6th Edition. pages 244–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling – variable ratio scheduling===
As stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses.  This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers. The variable ratio payoff from slot machines and other forms of gambling has often been cited as a factor underlying gambling addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleda|first1=Miguel Ángel Pérez|last2=Nieto|first2=José Héctor Lozano|date=2012|title=Impulsivity, Intelligence, and Discriminating Reinforcement Contingencies in a Fixed-Ratio 3 Schedule|url=https://search-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/docview/1439791203?accountid=12378|journal=The Spanish Journal of Psychology|volume=3|issue=15|pages=922–929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nudge theory ===
{{Main|Nudge theory}}
Nudge theory (or nudge) is a concept in [[behavioural science]], [[political theory]] and [[economics]] which argues that indirect suggestions to try to achieve non-forced [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] can [[Social influence|influence]] the motives, incentives and [[decision making]] of groups and individuals, at least as effectively – if not more effectively – than direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.

===Praise===
{{Main|Praise}}
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement is rooted in B.F. Skinner's model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan|title=History of behavior modification: Experimental foundations of contemporary research|date=1978|publisher=University Park Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain|first1=Phillip S.|last2=Lambert|first2=Deborah L.|last3=Kerr|first3=Mary Margaret|last4=Stagg|first4=Vaughan|last5=Lenkner|first5=Donna A.|date=1983|title=Naturalistic assessment of children's compliance to teachers' requests and consequences for compliance|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=16|issue=2|pages=243–249|doi=10.1901/jaba.1983.16-243|pmc=1307879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"/&gt; but also in the study of work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Charles R.|last2=Anderson|first2=D.

In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.&lt;ref name="Brophy, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=Jere|title=On praising effectively|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1981|volume=81|issue=5|jstor=1001606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols.&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsen|first1=Brandi|last2=Fairbanks|first2=Sarah|last3=Briesch|first3=Amy|last4=Myers|first4=Diane|last5=Sugai|first5=George|date=2008|title=Evidence-based Practices in Classroom Management: Considerations for Research to Practice|journal=Education and Treatment of Children|volume=31|issue=1|pages=351–380|doi=10.1353/etc.0.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisz &amp; Kazdin, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisz|first1=John R.|last2=Kazdin|first2=Alan E.|title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents|date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008" /&gt; and parenting training interventions,&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garland|first1=Ann F.|last2=Hawley|first2=Kristin M.|last3=Brookman-Frazee|first3=Lauren|last4=Hurlburt|first4=Michael S.|date=May 2008|title=Identifying Common Elements of Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatments for Children's Disruptive Behavior Problems|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=47|issue=5|pages=505–514|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

Several studies have been done on the effect cognitive-behavioral therapy and operant-behavioral therapy have on different medical conditions. When patients developed cognitive and behavioral techniques that changed their behaviors, attitudes, and emotions; their pain severity decreased. The results of these studies showed an influence of cognitions on pain perception and impact presented explained the general efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) and Operant-Behavioral therapy (OBT).

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes praise, [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: may involve removing one from a negative situation
* [[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement.3B schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist – for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===Traumatic bonding===
{{Main|Traumatic bonding}}
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Traumatic Bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|last = Dutton|first = |date = 1981|journal = Victimology: An International Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Painter|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson2008"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson.

The other source indicated that 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/traumatic-bonding&lt;/ref&gt;
'The necessary conditions for traumatic bonding are that one person must dominate the other and that the level of abuse chronically spikes and then subsides. The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim's options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim's ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency...The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim's capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression. '.

===Military Psychology===
{{Main|Military Psychology}}

Human beings have an innate resistance to killing and are reluctant to act in a direct, aggressive way towards members of their own species, even to save life.  This resistance to killing has caused infantry to be remarkably inefficient throughout the history of military warfare.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Killing: the Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society|last=Grossman|first=Dave|publisher=Little Brown|year=1995|isbn=978-0316040938|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon was not understood until [[S.L.A. Marshall]] (Brigadier General and military historian) undertook interview studies of WWII infantry immediately following combat engagement. Marshall's well-known and controversial book, Men Against Fire, revealed that only 15% of soldiers fired their rifles with the purpose of killing in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Against Fire: the Problem of Battle Command in Future War|last=Marshall|first=S.L.A.|publisher=Infantry Journal|year=1947|isbn=978-0-8061-3280-8|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following acceptance of Marshall's research by the US Army in 1946, the Human Resources Research Office of the US Army began implementing new training protocols which resemble operant conditioning methods.  Subsequent applications of such methods increased the percentage of soldiers able to kill to around 50% in Korea and over 90% in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Revolutions in training included replacing traditional pop-up firing ranges with three-dimensional, man-shaped, pop-up targets which collapsed when hit.  This provided immediate feedback and acted as positive reinforcement for a soldier's behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.killology.com/behavioral-psychology|title=Behavioral Psychology|last=Murray, K.A., Grossman, D., &amp; Kentridge, R.W.|first=|date=21 October 2018|website=https://www.killology.com/behavioral-psychology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other improvements to military training methods have included the timed firing course; more realistic training; high repetitions; praise from superiors; marksmanship rewards; and group recognition. Negative reinforcement includes peer accountability or the requirement to retake courses.  Modern military training conditions [[Midbrain|mid-brain]] response to combat pressure by closely simulating actual combat, using mainly Pavlovian [[Classical conditioning|Classical Conditioning]] and [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] operant Conditioning (both forms of [[Behaviorism]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern marksmanship training is such an excellent example of behaviorism that it has been used for years in the introductory psychology course taught to all cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point as a classic example of operant conditioning. In the 1980s, during a visit to West Point, B.F. Skinner identified modern military marksmanship training as a near-perfect application of operant conditioning.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lt. Col. Dave Grossman states about operant conditioning and US Military training that:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely possible that no one intentionally sat down to use operant conditioning or behavior modification techniques to train soldiers in this area…But from the standpoint of a psychologist who is also a historian and a career soldier, it has become increasingly obvious to me that this is exactly what has been achieved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book, On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, Grossman overviews the main factors influencing individual acts of aggression as:

* [[Stanley Milgram|'''Stanley Milgram's''']] (US Social Psychologist) '''Killing Factors:''' include '''t'''he demands of authority, group absolution, and distance from the victim (including emotional or psychological distancing).
* Ben '''Shalit''' (Israeli military psychologist) '''Factors:''' Shalit's ''Psychology of Conflict and Combat'' considers tactical circumstances such as available strategies, threat to the killer, and payoff for killer in terms of personal gain and enemy loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Conflict and Combat|last=Shalit|first=Ben|publisher=Praeger|year=1998|isbn=978-0275927530|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Predisposition of the killer:''' includes natural predisposition, training, conditioning and recent experiences of the soldier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Psychological distancing includes physical distance, dehumanizing the enemy (including through [[propaganda]]), and the impersonal use of technology such as night vision, drones, and airstrikes.  Modern conditioning techniques have had parallel effects on law enforcement firing rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As part of a trend in the [[video game monetization|monetization of video games]] during the 2010s, some games offered [[loot box]]es as rewards or as items purchasable by real world funds. Boxes contains a random selection of in-game items.

While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries.

One of the many reasons proposed for the dramatic costs associated with healthcare is the practice of defensive medicine.

The physicians changed their practice in response to a negative feedback (fear from lawsuit) in the group that practiced in a state with no restrictions on medical lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Operant Conditioning and the Practice of Defensive Medicine.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In the context of United States law, '''originalism''' is a concept regarding the [[constitutional interpretation|interpretation]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] that asserts that all statements in the constitution must be interpreted based on the original understanding of the authors or the people at the time it was ratified. This concept views the Constitution as stable from the time of enactment, and that the meaning of its contents can be changed only by the steps set out in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five]].&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1435069 B. Boyce, "Originalism and the Fourteenth Amendment", 33 ''Wake Forest L. Rev.'' 909]&lt;/ref&gt; This notion stands in contrast to the concept of the [[living constitution]], which asserts that the Constitution is intended to be interpreted based on the context of the current times, even if such interpretation is different from the original interpretations of the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&amp;context=fss_papers | title=The Holmes Lectures: The Living Constitution | author=Ackerman, Bruce | publisher=Yale University Law School | date=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Two Views of the Constitution: Originalism vs. Non-Originalism | author=Vloet, Katie  | date=September 22, 2015 | publisher=University of Michigan Law | url=https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/ConstitutionDay_092215.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Brest1980"&gt;Brest, Paul. (1980). ''The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding''. Boston University Law Review, '''60''', 204–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Originalism is an umbrella term for interpretative methods that hold to the "fixation thesis", the notion that an utterance's semantic content is fixed at the time it is uttered.&lt;ref name="SemanticOriginalism"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1120244 L. Solum, "Semantic Originalism", ''Illinois Public Law Research Paper '' No. 07-24]&lt;/ref&gt; Originalists seek one of two alternative sources of meaning:
* The ''[[original intent]] theory'', which holds that interpretation of a written constitution is (or should be) consistent with what was meant by those who drafted and ratified it. This is currently a minority view among originalists.
*The ''[[original meaning]] theory'', which is closely related to textualism, is the view that interpretation of a written constitution or law should be based on what [[reasonable person]]s living at the time of its adoption would have understood the [[plain meaning rule|ordinary meaning]] of the text to be. Most originalists, such as [[Antonin Scalia]], are associated with this view.

Such theories share the view that there is an identifiable original intent or original meaning, contemporaneous with the ratification of a constitution or statute, which should govern its subsequent interpretation. The divisions between the theories relate to what exactly that identifiable original intent or original meaning is: the intentions of the authors or the ratifiers, the original meaning of the text, a combination of the two, or the original meaning of the text but not its expected application.

==Strict constructionism==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Bret Boyce described the origins of the term ''originalist'' as follows: The term "originalism" has been most commonly used since the middle 1980s and was apparently coined by [[Paul Brest]] in ''The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding''.&lt;ref name="Boyce"/&gt; It is often asserted that ''originalism'' is synonymous with ''[[strict constructionism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2005/10/i_am_not_a_stri.html The University of Chicago, The Law School] "I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to be."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polazzo.stuysu.org/can_bush_deliver_a_conservative.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219192336/http://polazzo.stuysu.org/can_bush_deliver_a_conservative.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/mentions.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216121611/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/mentions.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklywire.com/ww/04-10-00/boston_feature_1.html|title=News &amp; Opinion: Who Would Bush Appoint to the Supreme Court?

[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] was a firm believer in originalism]]
Both theories are associated with textualist and formalist schools of thought, however there are pronounced differences between them.  Scalia differentiated the two by pointing out that, unlike an originalist, a strict constructionist would not acknowledge that ''he uses a cane'' means ''he walks with a cane'' (because, strictly speaking, this is not what ''he uses a cane'' means).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Smith v. United States'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-8674.ZD.html 508 U.S. 223] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia averred that he was "not a strict constructionist, and no-one ought to be"; he goes further, calling strict constructionism "a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute".&lt;ref&gt;A. Scalia, ''A Matter of Interpretation'', {{ISBN|978-0-691-00400-6}}, Amy Guttman ed. 1997, at p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originalism is a theory of ''interpretation'', not ''construction''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, ''[http://www.bu.edu/rbarnett/Original.htm#IB The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this distinction between "interpretation" and "construction" is controversial and is rejected by many nonoriginalists as artificial. As Scalia said, "the Constitution, or any text, should be interpreted [n]either strictly [n]or sloppily; it should be interpreted reasonably"; once originalism has told a Judge what the provision of the Constitution means, they are bound by that meaning—however the business of Judging is not simply to know what the text means (interpretation), but to take the law's necessarily general provisions and apply them to the specifics of a given case or controversy (construction). In many cases, the meaning might be so specific that no discretion is permissible, but in many cases, it is still before the Judge to say what a reasonable interpretation might be. A judge could, therefore, be both an originalist ''and'' a strict constructionist—but he is not one by virtue of being the other.

==Forms==
Originalism is actually a family of related views. As a movement, originalism can be traced to Robert Bork's "Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems", published in the ''Indiana Law Journal'' in January 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4149&amp;context=fss_papers |title=Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems |author=Robert H. Bork |via=Digitalcommons.law.yale.edu |journal=Indiana Law Journal 1 |volume=47 |issue=1 |date=January 1971 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1980s, when conservative jurists began to take seats on the Supreme Court, that the debate really began in earnest. "Old originalism" focused primarily on "intent", mostly by default. But that line was largely abandoned in the early 1990s; as "new originalism" emerged; most adherents subscribed to "original meaning" originalism, though there are some intentionalists within new originalism.

===Original intent===
{{Main article|Original intent}}
The ''original form of originalism'' is sometimes called intentionalism, or ''original intent'' originalism, and looked for the subjective intent of a law's enactors. One problem with this approach is identifying the relevant "lawmaker" whose intent is sought. For instance, the authors of the U.S. Constitution could be the particular [[Founding Fathers]] that drafted it, such as those on the Committee of Detail. Or, since the Constitution purports to originate from the People, one could look to the various state ratifying conventions. The intentionalist methodology involves studying the writings of its authors, or the records of the [[Philadelphia Convention]], or debates in the state legislatures, for clues as to their intent.

There are two kinds of ''intent analysis'', reflecting two meanings of the word ''intent''. The first, a rule of common law construction during the Founding Era, is ''functional'' intent. The second is ''motivational'' intent. To understand the difference, one can use the metaphor of an architect who designs a Gothic church with [[flying buttresses]]. The functional intent of flying buttresses is to prevent the weight of the roof from spreading the walls and causing a collapse of the building, which can be inferred from examining the design as a whole. The motivational intent might be to create work for his brother-in-law who is a flying buttress subcontractor. Using original intent analysis of the first kind, we can discern that the language of Article III of the [[U.S. Constitution]] was to delegate to Congress the power to allocate original and appellate jurisdictions, and not to remove some jurisdiction, involving a constitutional question, from all courts. That would suggest that the decision was wrong in ''[[Ex Parte McCardle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/ussc/074-506.htm Ex Parte McCardle], 74 U.S. 506 (Wall.) (1868)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems with intentionalism====
However, a number of problems are inherent in intentionalism, and ''[[a fortiori]]'' when that theory is applied to the Constitution.  For example, most of the Founders did not leave detailed discussions of what their intent was in 1787, and while a few did, there is no reason to think that they should be dispositive of what the rest thought.  Moreover, the discussions of the drafters may have been recorded; however they were not available to the ratifiers in each state.  The theory of original intent was challenged in a string of [[law review]] articles in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Powell, "The Original Understanding of Original Intent", 98 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 885 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, original intent was seen as lacking good answers to three important questions: whether a diverse group such as the framers even ''had'' a single intent; if they ''did'', whether it could be determined from two centuries' distance; and whether the framers themselves would have supported original intent.&lt;ref&gt;See also, W. Serwetman, [http://www.ninjalawyer.com/writing/original.html ''Originalism At Work in Lopez: An Examination of the Recent Trend in Commerce Clause Jurisprudence'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, a different strain of originalism, articulated by (among others) Antonin Scalia,&lt;ref&gt;See "A Matter of Interpretation", supra; see also, A. Scalia, ''[http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/lesserevil.asp Originalism: the Lesser Evil]'', 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bork]],&lt;ref&gt;See R. Bork, ''The tempting of America: The political seduction of the law''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Randy Barnett]],&lt;ref&gt;See R. Barnett, ''An Originalism for non-Originalists'', 45 Loy. L. Rev. 611; R. Barnett, [[Restoring the Lost Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; came to the fore. This is dubbed [[Original meaning|original ''meaning'']].

===Original meaning===
{{Main article|Original meaning}}
Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] argued that interpreting what was meant by someone who wrote a law was not trying to "get into his mind" because the issue was "not what this man meant, but what those words would mean in the mouth of a normal speaker of English, using them in the circumstances in which they were used."&lt;ref&gt;O. W. Holmes, ''Collected Legal Papers'', {{ISBN|978-0-8446-1241-6}}, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; This is the essential precept of modern originalism.

The most robust and widely cited form of originalism, ''original meaning'', emphasizes how the text would have been understood by a reasonable person in the historical period during which the constitution was proposed, ratified, and first implemented. For example, economist Thomas Sowell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041110.shtml|title=Thomas Sowell Articles – Political Columnist &amp; Commentator|work=townhall.com|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that phrases like "due process" and "freedom of the press" had a long established meaning in English law, even before they were put into the Constitution of the United States." Applying this form involves studying dictionaries and other writings of the time (for example, Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''; see "Matters rendered moot by originalism", ''infra'') to establish what particular terms meant. See ''Methodology'', infra).

Justice Scalia, one of the most forceful modern advocates for originalism, defined himself as belonging to the latter category:
{{quote|The theory of originalism treats a constitution like a statute, and gives it the meaning that its words were understood to bear at the time they were promulgated. You will sometimes hear it described as the theory of original intent. You will never hear me refer to original intent, because as I say I am first of all a textualist, and secondly an originalist. If you are a textualist, you don't care about the intent, and I don't care if the framers of the Constitution had some secret meaning in mind when they adopted its words. I take the words as they were promulgated to the people of the United States, and what is the fairly understood meaning of those words.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Scalia, [http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/cua10-18-96.asp A Theory of Constitution Interpretation], speech at Catholic University of America, 10/18/96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though there may be no evidence that the Founding Fathers intended the Constitution to be like a statute, this fact does not matter under Scalia's approach. Adherence to original meaning is explicitly divorced from the intent of the Founders; rather, the reasons for adhering to original meaning derive from other justifications, such as the argument that the understanding of the ratifiers (the people of the several States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution) should be controlling, as well as consequentialist arguments about original meaning's positive effect on rule of law.

Perhaps the clearest example illustrating the importance of the difference between original intent and original meaning is the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]]. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though some would argue that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.

====Semantic originalism====
''Semantic-originalism'' is [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s term for the theory that the original meaning of many statutes implies that those statutes prohibit certain acts widely considered not to be prohibited by the statutes at the time of their passages.  This type of originalism contrasts with ''expectations originalism'', which adheres to how the statutes functioned at the times of their passages, without any expectation that they would function in any other particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XYuGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 Restoring the Lost Constitution]'', p. 95 (Princeton U. Press 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Antonin Scalia and other originalists often claim that the death penalty is not "cruel and unusual punishment" because at the time of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]'s passage, it was a punishment believed to be neither cruel nor unusual. Dworkin and the semantic-originalists assert, however, that if advances in moral philosophy (presuming that such advances are possible) reveal that the death penalty is in fact "cruel and unusual", then the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment implies that the death penalty is unconstitutional. All the same, Justice Scalia purported to follow semantic originalism, although he conceded that Dworkin does not believe Scalia was true to that calling.&lt;ref&gt;Scalia, Antonin.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdcWjMktgz0C&amp;pg=PA144 A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law: Federal Courts and the Law]'', p. 144 (Princeton University Press 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework originalism===
Framework Originalism is an approach developed by [[Jack Balkin]], a professor of law at [[Yale Law School]]. Framework Originalism, or Living Originalism, is a blend of primarily two constitutional interpretive methods: originalism and [[Living Constitution]]. Balkin holds that there is no inherent contradiction between these two, aforementioned, interpretive approaches—when properly understood. Framework Originalists view the Constitution as an "initial framework for governance that sets politics in motion." This "framework" must be built-out or filled-out over time, successive generations, by the various legislative and judicial branches. This process is achieved, primarily, through building political institutions, passing legislation, and creating precedents (both judicial and non-judicial).&lt;ref&gt;Balkin, Jack (February 16, 2009). "[https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/ui=2&amp;ik=71e20d8366&amp;view=att&amp;th=14002ff1398f9561&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=f_hjepyml70&amp;safe=1&amp;zw&amp;saduie=AG9B_P8T-RRitBW0sudznuZoXQGm&amp;sadet=1374972385770&amp;sads=zqzsbgJ8uQrxF1pBi6GI2pLjpWk&amp;sadssc=1 Framework Originalism and The Living Constitution], Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper Series" ''Yale Law School''. Retrieved July 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the process of building out the Constitution on top of the framework of the original meaning is living constitutionalism, the change of and progress of law over time to address particular (current) issues. The authority of the judiciary and of the political branches to engage in constitutional construction comes from their "joint responsiveness to public opinion" over long stretches of time, while operating within the basic framework of the original meaning. Balkin claims that through mechanisms of social influence, both judges and the political branches inevitably come to reflect and respond to changing social mores, norms, customs and (public) opinions.

According to Framework originalism, interpreters should adhere to the original meaning of the Constitution, but are not necessarily required to follow the original expected application (although they may use it to create doctrines and decide cases). For example, states should extend the equal protection of the laws to all peoples, in cases where it would not originally or normally be applied to. Contemporary interpreters are not bound by how people in 1868 would have applied these words and meanings to issues such as racial segregation or (sexual) discrimination, largely due to the fact the fourteenth amendment is concerned with such issues (as well as the fact that the fourteenth amendment was not proposed or ratified by the founders). When the Constitution uses or applies principles or standards, like "equal protection" or "unreasonable searches and seizures," further construction is usually required, by either the judiciary, the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, Balkin claims, (pure, unadulterated) originalism is not sufficient to decide a wide range of cases or controversies. Judges, he posits, will have to "engage in considerable constitutional construction as well as the elaboration and application of previous constructions." For example, originalism (in and of itself), is not sufficient enough to constrain judicial behavior. Constraint itself does not just come from doctrine or canons, it also comes from institutional, political, and cultural sources. These constraints include: multi-member or panel courts (where the balance of power lies with moderate judges); the screening of judges through the federal judicial appointment process; social and cultural influences on the judiciary (which keep judges attuned and attentive to popular opinions and the political will of the people); and prevailing professional legal culture and professional conceptions of the role of the judiciary (which produce social norms or mores). These constraints ensure that judges act as impartial arbiters of the law and to try to behave in a principled manner, as it applies to decision making.

==Methodology==
In "The Original Meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause",  Michael B. Rappaport described the methodology associated with the "original meaning" form of originalism as follows:

*"The task is to determine the original meaning of the language … that is, to understand how knowledgeable individuals would have understood this language…when it was drafted and ratified. Interpreters at the time would have examined various factors, including text, purpose, structure, and history."
*"The most important factor is the text of the Clause. The modern interpreter should read the language in accord with the meaning it would have had in the late 1780s. Permissible meanings from that time include the ordinary meanings as well as more technical legal meanings words may have had."
*"If the language has more than one interpretation, then one would look to purpose, structure, and history to help to clarify the ambiguity. Purpose, structure, and history provide evidence for determining which meaning of the language the authors would have intended."
**"The purpose of a Clause involves the objectives or goals that the authors would have sought to accomplish in enacting it. One common and permissible way to discern the purpose is to look to the evident or obvious purpose of a provision. Yet, purpose arguments can be dangerous, because it is easy for interpreters to focus on one purpose to the exclusion of other possible purposes without any strong arguments for doing so."
**"Historical evidence can reveal the values that were widely held by the Framers' generation and that presumably informed their purposes when enacting constitutional provisions. History can also reveal their practices, which when widely accepted would be evidence of their values."
**"The structure of the document can also help to determine the purposes of the Framers. The decision to enact one constitutional clause may reveal the values of the Framers and thereby help us understand the purposes underlying a second constitutional clause."
*"One additional source of evidence about the meaning of constitutional language is early constitutional interpretations by government officials or prominent commentators. …Such interpretations may provide evidence of the original meaning of the provisions, because early interpreters would have had better knowledge of contemporary word meanings, societal values, and interpretive techniques. Of course, early interpreters may also have had political and other incentives to misconstrue the document that should be considered." (Id. at 5–7).

==Discussion==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

===Philosophical underpinnings===
Originalism, in all its various forms, is predicated on a specific view of what the Constitution ''is'', a view articulated by Chief Justice John Marshall in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'':
{{quote|[T]he constitution organizes the government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may either stop here; or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments.

The government of the United States is of the latter description. The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing; if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained?}}

Originalism assumes that ''Marbury'' is correct: the Constitution is the ''operating charter'' granted to government by the people, as per the preamble to the [[United States Constitution]], and its written nature introduces a certain discipline into its interpretation. Originalism further assumes that the need for such a written charter was derived from the perception, on the part of the Framers, of the [[abuses of power]] under the (unwritten) [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], under which the Constitution was essentially whatever Parliament decided it should be. In writing out a Constitution which explicitly granted the government certain authorities, and withheld from it others, and in which power was balanced between multiple agencies (the [[President of the United States of America|Presidency]], two chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] at the national level, and [[State governments of the United States]] with similar branches), the intention of the Framers was to restrain government, originalists argue, and the value of such a document is nullified if that document's meaning is not fixed. As one author stated, "If the constitution can mean anything, then the constitution is reduced to meaninglessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRjZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+the+constitution+can+mean+anything%22&amp;dq=%22if+the+constitution+can+mean+anything%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KhjCTaLfOKfgiAKwiYWrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw|title=The New Guard|publisher=|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function of constitutional jurisprudence===
Dissenting in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', Scalia wrote:
{{quote|Since the Constitution of the United States says nothing about this subject, it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means, including the democratic adoption of provisions in state constitutions. This Court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the Members of this institution are selected.}}

This statement summarizes the role for the court envisioned by originalists, that is, that the Court parses what the general law and constitution says of a particular [[case or controversy]], and when questions arise as to the meaning of a given constitutional provision, that provision should be given the meaning it was understood to mean when ratified. Reviewing Steven D Smith's book ''Law's Quandary'', Scalia applied this formulation to some controversial topics routinely brought before the Court:
{{quote|It troubles Smith, but does not at all trouble me—in fact, it pleases me—that giving the words of the Constitution their normal meaning would "expel from the domain of legal issues … most of the constitutional disputes that capture our attention", such as "Can a macho military educational institution dedicated to what is euphemistically called the 'adversative' method admit only men? Is there a right to abortion? Or to the assistance of a physician in ending one's life?" If we should read English as English, Smith bemoans, "these questions would seemingly all have received the same answer: 'No law on that one.{{'"}}

That is precisely the answer they should have received: The federal Constitution says nothing on these subjects, which are therefore left to be governed by state law.&lt;ref&gt;A. Scalia, ''[http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0511/reviews/scalia.html Law &amp; Language]''; ''First Things'', November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Marbury'', [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] established that the Supreme Court could invalidate laws which violated the Constitution (that is, [[judicial review]]), which helped establish the Supreme Court as having its own distinct sphere of influence within the federal government. However, this power was itself balanced with the requirement that the Court could only invalidate legislation if it was ''unconstitutional''. Originalists argue that the modern court no longer follows this requirement. They argue that—since  ''[[U.S. v. Darby]]'', in which Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone|Stone]] (writing for a unanimous Court) ruled that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] had no legal meaning—the Court has increasingly taken to making rulings&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZS.html Griswold v. Connecticut]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZS.html 381 U.S. 479] (1965); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html Roe v. Wade]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html 410 U.S. 113] (1973); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0487_0654_ZS.html Morrison v. Olson]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0487_0654_ZS.html 487 U.S. 654] (1988); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html Lawrence v. Texas]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html 539 U.S. 558] (2003); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZO.html Roper v. Simmons]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZO.html Docket No. 03—633] (2005); ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]], [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html Docket No. 04-108]'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court has determined not what the Constitution ''says'', but rather, the Court has sought to determine what is "morally correct" at ''this'' point in the nation's history, in terms of "the evolving standards of decency" (and considering "the context of international jurisprudence"), and then justified that determination through a "creative reading" of the text. This latter approach is frequently termed "the [[Living constitution]]"; Scalia inveighed that "the worst thing about the living constitution is that it will destroy the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;See Scalia, [http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/ww3-14-05.asp Constitutional Interpretation], speech at Woodrow Wilson International Center 3/14/05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matters rendered moot by originalism===
Originalists are sharply critical of the use of ''the evolving standards of decency'' (a term which first appeared in ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'') and of reference to the opinions of courts in foreign countries (excepting treaties to which the United States is a signatory, per Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution) in Constitutional interpretation.

In an originalist interpretation, if the meaning of the Constitution is static, then any ex post facto information (such as the opinions of the American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of the meaning of the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. The Constitution is thus fixed and has procedures defining how it can be changed.

The exception to the use of foreign law is the English [[common law]], which originalists regard as setting the philosophical stage for the US Constitution and the American common and civil law. Hence, an originalist might cite [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Commentaries]]'' to establish the meaning of the term ''[[due process]]'' as it would have been understood at the time of ratification.

==Pros and cons==
Arguments for and against Originalism should be read in conjunction with alternative views and rebuttals, presented in footnotes.

===Arguments favoring originalism===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
* If a constitution no longer meets the exigencies of a society's "evolving standard of decency", and the people wish to [[Constitutional amendment|amend]] or replace the document, there is nothing stopping them from doing so in the manner which was envisioned by the drafters: through the amendment process. The [[Living Constitution]] approach would thus only be valuable in the absence of an amendment process.
* Originalism deters judges from unfettered discretion to inject their personal values into constitutional interpretation. Before one can reject originalism, one must find another criterion for determining the meaning of a provision, lest the "opinion of this Court [rest] so obviously upon nothing however the personal views of its members".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=00-8452#section3 Atkins v. Virginia]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=00-8452#section3 536 U.S. 304] (2002) (Scalia, dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia has averred that "there is no other" criterion to constrain judicial interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Scalia, Woodrow Wilson speech, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
* Originalism helps ensure predictability and protects against arbitrary changes in the interpretation of a constitution; to reject originalism implicitly repudiates the theoretical underpinning of another theory of stability in the law, ''[[stare decisis]]''.
* If a constitution as interpreted can truly be changed at the decree of a judge, then "[t]he Constitution… is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please," said [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_18s16.html|title=Thomas Jefferson to Spencer Roane|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the purpose of the constitution would be defeated, and there would be no reason to have one.
* Sometimes the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] is cited as an example by originalism critics to attack originalism. Self-described originalists have been at least as willing as judges of other schools to give the Ninth Amendment no substantive meaning or to treat it as ''surplusage duplicative'' of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]. Bork described it as a Rorshach blot and claimed that the courts had no power to identify or protect the rights supposedly protected by it. Scalia held similarly: "[T]he Constitution's refusal to 'deny or disparage' other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even afarther removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enacted by the people." ''[[Troxel v. Granville]]'' 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (Scalia, J. Dissenting). Scalia's interpretation renders the Ninth Amendment entirely unenforcable and moot, which is clearly contrary to its original intent. However, this is a criticism of specific originalists—and a criticism that they are insufficiently originalist—not a criticism of originalism. The theory of originalism as a whole is entirely compatible with the Ninth Amendment. Alternative theories of originalism have been argued by Randy Barnett that give the Ninth Amendment more practical effect than many other schools of legal thought do.
* Contrary to critics of originalism, originalists do not always agree upon an answer to a constitutional question, nor is there any requirement that they have to. There is room for disagreement as to what original meaning was, and even more as to how that original meaning applies to the situation before the court. But the originalist at least knows what he is looking for: the original meaning of the text. Usually, that is easy to discern and simple to apply. Sometimes there will be disagreement regarding the original meaning; and sometimes there will be disagreement as to how that original meaning applies to new and unforeseen phenomena. How, for example, does the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution guarantee of "the freedom of speech" apply to new technologies that did not exist when the guarantee was codified—to sound trucks,&lt;!-- huh? what is a 'sound truck'? perhaps a better example is needed --&gt; or to government-licensed over-the-air television? In such new fields the Court must follow the trajectory of the First Amendment, so to speak, to determine what it requires, and that enterprise is not entirely cut-and-dried, but requires the exercise of judgment. But the difficulties and uncertainties of determining original meaning and applying it to modern circumstances are negligible compared with the difficulties and uncertainties of the philosophy which says that the constitution changes; that the very act which it once prohibited it now permits, and which it once permitted it now forbids; and that the key to that change is unknown and unknowable. The originalist, if he does not have all the answers, has many of them.&lt;ref name="Scalia"&gt;[http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/scalia97.pdf Common-Law Courts in a Civil-Law System: The Role of United States Federal Courts in Interpreting the Constitution and Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the people come to believe that the constitution is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the Constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the Constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.&lt;ref name="Scalia" /&gt;

===Arguments opposing originalism===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}

* If one is then to look at the interpretation (or, ''meaning''), which inheres at the particular time period, the question becomes: why is that reading the essential one? Or, restated, an essential reading, then, is owing to whom? Is it owing, then, to the meaning derived by the average person at that time? The collective intent of the voters who passed it? Or is it possible that they indeed entrusted the framers with the authority to draft the constitution; i.e., that the intent of the drafters should remain relevant?  Originalism faces [[hermeneutic]] difficulties in understanding the intentions of the Founding Fathers, who lived 200 years ago (original intent), or the context of the time in which they lived (original meaning). Justice Scalia accepted this problem: "It's not always easy to figure out what the provision meant when it was adopted…I do not say [originalism] is perfect. I just say it's better than anything else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041009/NEWS/410090381/1002|title=Scalia talks up 'originalism' in UVM speech : Times Argus Online|publisher=|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legal controversy rarely arises over constitutional text with uncontroversial interpretations. How, then, does one determine the original "meaning" of an originally broad and ambiguous phrase?  Thus, originalists often conceal their choice between levels of generality or possible alternative meanings as required by the original meaning when there is considerable room for disagreement.
* It could be argued (as, for example, Justice [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]] has) that constitutions are meant to endure over time, and in order to do so, their interpretation must therefore be more flexible and responsive to changing circumstances than the amendment process.
* Originalists often argue that, where a constitution is silent, judges should not read rights into it (i.e. a [[textualist]] interpretation).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2017/02/10/neil-gorsuch-is-trumps-best-revenge-for-judicial-activism|title=Neil Gorsuch Is Trump's Best Revenge for Judicial Activism|last=2017|date=February 10, 2017|website=The Daily Signal|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], seen through an originalist lens, can be seen as providing the judiciary with means of protecting {{clarify span|text=rights|explain=but only rights cognizable originally, so that there would be no instance of originalism sanctioning rights derived only from evolution over time.  Thus there should be no inconsistency in originalism as is claimed in the next sentence of the article.  Therefore the logic of this paragraph of the article appears to be erroneous, which very probably means that the line of reasoning exemplified in such paragraph is not seen in reliable sources, which would mean that such paragraph of the article constitutes original analysis, which is prohibited in Wikipedia.|date=March 2017}} which the founders had not thought, for whatever reasons, to explicitly list, such as rights involving abortion, gender and [[sexual orientation]] [[equal protection|equality]], and capital punishment. This presents a particular challenge to the theory of Original Intent, which seems to thus suggest just the opposite of what the text of the Constitution and ''original intent'' of the founders arguably affirm, creating an inconsistency in the practice of at least one branch of Originalism. The subsequent Tenth Amendment, detailing non-enumerated rights as the sole property of the states and the people, is often cited as the clarification for this inconsistency and the reason why the federal courts have no say in affirming or denying said rights per the Ninth Amendment.
* Originalism allows the ''dead hand'' of prior generations to control important contemporary issues to an extraordinary and unnecessary level of detail. While everyone agrees that broad constitutional principles should control, if the question is whether abortion is a fundamental right, why should past centuries-old intentions be controlling? The originalist's distinction between original meaning and original intention here is unclear due to the difficulty of discussing ''meaning'' in terms of specific details that the Constitutional text does not clarify.
* In writing such a broad phrase such as "cruel and unusual", it is considered implausible by some that the framers intended for its very specific meaning at that time to be permanently controlling. The purpose of phrases such as "cruel and unusual," rather, is specifically not to specify which punishments are forbidden, but to create a flexible test that can be applied over future centuries. Stated alternatively, there is no reason to think the framers have a privileged position in making this determination of what is cruel and unusual; while their ban on cruel punishment is binding on us, their understanding of the scope of the concept "cruel" need not be.
* If applied scrupulously, originalism requires the country either to continually reratify the Constitution in order to retain contemporary standards for tests such as "cruel and unusual punishment" or "unreasonable searches and seizures," or to change the language to specifically state that these tests shall be administered according to the standards of the society administering the test. Critics of originalism believe that the first approach is too burdensome, while the second is already inherently implied.

====Arguments against some of the proponents of originalism====

* Critics argue that originalism, as applied by its most prominent proponents, is sometimes pretext (or, at least, the "rules" of originalism are sometimes "bent") to reach desired ends, no less so than the Living Constitution. For example, [[Jack Balkin]] has averred that neither the original understanding nor the original intent of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] is compatible with the result implicitly reached by the originalist justices Thomas and Scalia in their willingness to join Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in [[Bush v. Gore]], {{ussc|531|98|2000}}. Furthermore, while both Scalia and Thomas have objected on originalist grounds to the use of foreign law by the court (see, respectively, ''Thompson v. Oklahoma'', {{ussc-cite|487|815|868|1988}}, and ''Knight v. Florida'', {{ussc|528|990|1999}}), both have allowed it to seep into their opinions at one time or another (see, respectively, ''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Committee'', {{ussc-cite|514|334|381|1995}} and ''Holder v. Hall'', {{ussc-cite|512|874|904|1994}})
* Another example is the centrality of the concept of "person" to the Constitution and the fact that any claim by originalists such as Bork, Scalia, or Thomas that the Constitution does not speak to human rights and gender equality ''[[A fortiori argument|a fortiori]]'' reflects a judicial effort to legislate meaning into the term Person; for example, Scalia's assertion that women's equality is entirely up to the political branches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Adam|title=Justice Scalia Mouths Off on Sex Discrimination|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2020667,00.html|accessdate=December 12, 2012|newspaper=Time|date=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignores the use of the term "person" rather than "man" in the Constitution, and the common meaning of the term at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|year=1989|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506905-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead interprets the Constitution to say that only heterosexual men and male fetuses are "persons" thus reading silence into the Constitution on a matter on which it is not silent for the purpose of narrowing the Constitution's meaning. The device of "originalism" is thus used to replace the original intent, the original meaning, and the text itself with Scalia's subjective view or desires.

'''''Pratītyasamutpāda''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद pratītyasamutpāda}}; {{lang-pi|पटिच्चसमुप्पाद}} ''paṭiccasamuppāda''), commonly translated as '''dependent origination''', or '''dependent arising''', is a key principle in Buddhist teachings,{{refn|group=note|The ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' doctrine, states Mathieu Boisvert, is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism and it may be considered as "the common denominator of all the Buddhist traditions throughout the world, whether Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathieu Boisvert |title=The Five Aggregates: Understanding Theravada Psychology and Soteriology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUTRBtvSUaUC |year=1995|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-257-3 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which states that all ''dharmas'' ("phenomena") arise in dependence upon other ''dharmas'': "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist".

The principle is expressed in the [[Twelve Nidānas|links of dependent origination]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni'') in [[Buddhism]], a linear list of twelve elements from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings which arise depending on the preceding link. Traditionally the list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'', and the resultant ''[[Dukkha|duḥkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}} An alternate Theravada interpretation regards the list as describing the arising of mental formations and the resultant notion of "I" and "mine," which are the source of suffering.&lt;ref name="Payutto"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2009}} Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth.{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

==Etymology and meaning==

===Etymology===
''Pratityasamutpada'' (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) consists of two terms:
* pratitya: "having depended";{{sfn|Hopkins|1983|p=163}} it appears in various [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]], such as hymns 4.5.14, 7.68.6 of the [[Rigveda]] and 19.49.8 of [[Atharvaveda]], in the sense of "confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_७.६८ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ७.६८], Rigveda 7.68.6, Wikisource; Quote: उत त्यद्वां जुरते अश्विना भूच्च्यवानाय '''प्रतीत्यं''' हविर्दे । अधि यद्वर्प इतऊति धत्थः ॥६॥&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mmwp623/&gt; The Sanskrit root of the word is ''prati*'' whose forms appear more extensively in the Vedic literature, and it means "to go towards, go back, come back, to approach" with the connotation of "observe, learn, convince oneself of the truth of anything, be certain of, believe, give credence, recognize". In other contexts, a related term ''pratiti*'' means "going towards, approaching, insight into anything".&lt;ref name=mmwp623&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=623}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* samutpada: "arising",{{sfn|Hopkins|1983|p=163}} "rise, production, origin"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=samutpada+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU spokensanskrit.de, ''samutpada'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Vedic literature, it means "spring up together, arise, come to pass, occur, effect, form, produce, originate".&lt;ref name=mmwp1078&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been translated into English variously as ''dependent origination'', ''dependent arising'', ''interdependent co-arising'', ''conditioned arising'', and ''conditioned genesis''.{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=29, Quote: "''Dependent origination'' has two meanings in Buddhist thought. The first refers to the twelvefold sequence of causation... The second meaning of ''dependent origination'' is a more general one, the notion that everything comes into existence in dependence on something else. It is this second meaning that [[Nagarjuna]] equates with emptiness and the middle way."}}{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|The term ''pratītyasamutpāda'' been translated into English as conditioned arising,{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}} conditioned genesis,{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations  791-809}} dependent arising,{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}{{refn|group=quote|The Dalai Lama explains: "In Sanskrit the word for dependent-arising is ''pratityasamutpada''. The word ''pratitya'' has three different meanings–meeting, relying, and depending–but all three, in terms of their basic import, mean dependence. ''Samutpada'' means arising. Hence, the meaning of ''pratityasamutpada'' is that which arises in dependence upon conditions, in reliance upon conditions, through the force of conditions."{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1992|p=35}}}} dependent co-arising,{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2008}} or dependent origination&lt;ref group=web name=brit1/&gt;}}

The term may also refer to the twelve nidānas, [[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni,'' from ''dvāvaśa'' ("twelve") + ''nidānāni'' (plural of "''nidāna''", "cause, motivation, link").{{refn|group=quote|The Nalanda Translation Committee states: "Pratitya-samutpada is the technical name for the Buddha’s teaching on cause and effect, in which he demonstrated how all situations arise through the coming together of various factors. In the hinayana, it refers in particular to the twelve nidānas, or links in the chain of samsaric becoming."&lt;ref group=web name=nalanda1&gt;Nalanda Translation Committee, [http://nalandatranslation.org/offerings/choosing-the-right-word/dependent-arising-tendrel/ Dependent Arising/Tendrel]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Generally speaking, in the Mahayana tradition, ''pratityasamutpada'' (Sanskrit) is used to refer to the general principle of interdependent causation, whereas in the Theravada tradition, ''paticcasamuppāda'' (Pali) is used to refer to the twelve nidānas.

===Meaning===

====Conditionality====
The ''Pratityasamutpada'' teachings asserts neither direct Newtonian-like causality nor a single causality. Rather, it asserts an indirect conditioned causality and a plural causality.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein |title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3683-7 |pages=512–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "causal link" propositions in Buddhism is very different from the idea of causality that developed in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Debrock |editor=Paul B. Scheurer|others=G. Debrock|title=Newton’s Scientific and Philosophical Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y18yBwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-2809-1 |pages=376 with note 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=153-155}} Instead, the concept of causality in Buddhism is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate phenomena within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of realms of existence for another lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Genjun Sasaki |title=Linguistic Approach to Buddhist Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUBPAzlxJPUC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0038-0 |pages=67–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=151-152}} The ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' principle asserts that the dependent origination is necessary and sufficient condition in both directions. This is expressed in [[Majjhima Nikaya]] as "When this is, that is; This arising, that arises; When this is not, that is not; This ceasing, that ceases."{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}&lt;ref name="Storhoff2010p74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Storhoff|title=American Buddhism as a Way of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUCoZygxHRoC |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3095-9|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontological principle====
According to Peter Harvey, ''Pratityasamutpada'' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle; that is, a theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|Harvey: "This [doctrine] states the principle of conditionality, that all things, mental and physical, arise and exist due to the presence of certain conditions, and cease once their conditions are removed: nothing (except ''Nibbana'') is independent. The doctrine thus complements the teaching that no permanent, independent self can be found."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}}} All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease.{{sfn|Bowker|1997}} The 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus ''Pratityasamutpada'' is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self ([[Brahman]]) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=64, Quote: In the ''Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta'' the Buddha [stresses] that things originate in dependence upon causal conditioning, and this emphasis on causality describes the central feature of Buddhist ontology. All elements of samsara exist in some sense or another relative to their causes and conditions.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Neville |editor=Jeremiah Hackett|others=Jerald Wallulis|title= Philosophy of Religion for a New Century: Essays in Honor of Eugene Thomas Long|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEER8fGxCfMC |year=2004|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-2073-5 |pages=257 }}, Quote: "[Buddhism's ontological hypotheses] that nothing in reality has its own-being and that all phenomena reduce to the relativities of pratitya samutpada. The Buddhist ontological hypothesese deny that there is any ontologically ultimate object such a God, Brahman, the Dao, or any transcendent creative source or principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pratītyasamutpāda ontological principle in Buddhism is applied not only to explain the nature and existence of matter and empirically observed phenomenon, but also to the nature and existence of life.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=141}} In abstract form, according to Peter Harvey, "the doctrine states: 'That being, this comes to be; from the arising of that, this arises; that being absent, this is not; from the cessation of that, this ceases'."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}} There is no 'first cause' from which all beings arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert S. Ellwood |author2=Gregory D. Alles |title=The Encyclopedia of World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pGbdI4L0qsC |year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn= 978-1-4381-1038-7|pages=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workings of the mind====
Against Harvey's ontological interpretation, Eviatar Shulman argues that 
{{quote|dependent-origination addresses the workings of the mind alone. Dependent-origination should be understood to be no more than an inquiry into the nature of the self (or better, the lack of a self). Viewing pratitya-samutpada as a description of the nature of reality in general means investing the words of the earlier teachings with meanings derived from later Buddhist discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, E; Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:297–317 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8,http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Meanings%20of%20Dependent%20Origination_Shulman_JIP_2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shulman grants that there are some ontological implications that may be gleaned from dependent origination, but that at its core it is concerned with "identifying the different processes of mental conditioning and describing their relations".&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, E; Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:297–317 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8,http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Meanings%20of%20Dependent%20Origination_Shulman_JIP_2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Noa Ronkin states that while Buddha suspends all views regarding certain metaphysical questions, he is not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless, instead Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.{{sfn|Ronkin|2009}}

====Epistemological principle====

According to Stephen Laumakis, pratītyasamutpāda is also an [[epistemology|epistemological]] principle; that is, a theory about how we gain correct and incorrect knowledge about being, becoming, existence and reality.&lt;ref name=laumakis2008p113&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

==Twelve Nidanas==
The twelve [[Nidana|nidāna]]s ([[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni'') is a linear list of twelve  elements from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings which are ''pratītyasamutpāda'', arising depending on the previous link. According to Shulman, "the 12 links ''are paticcasamuppada''"; in the suttas, dependent origination refers to nothing else but the process of mental conditioning as described by the twelve ''nidanas''.{{sfn|Shulman|2007|p=307}}

Traditionally the standard-list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'', and the resultant ''[[Dukkha|duḥkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pallis&gt;{{cite book|author=Marco Pallis |title=A Buddhist Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7Laz6jbnIIC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2003|publisher=World Wisdom |isbn=978-0-941532-40-2 |pages=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emamnuelp60&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M.

===Several series===
There are various Nidana lists throughout the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] and collections such as the [[Pali]] Nikayas, the most common of which is a list of [[Twelve Nidānas]] which appears in both Pali texts and [[Mahayana sutras]] such as the [[Salistamba Sutra]]. The 'dependent origination' doctrine is presented in Vinaya Pitaka 1.1–2, in abbreviated form in Samyutta Nikaya 2.1, 2.19 and 2.76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James McDermott |editor=Wendy Doniger|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0 |pages=167 with note 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Williams | first=David M. | title=The Translation and Interpretation of the Twelve Terms in the Paticcasamuppada | journal=Numen | publisher= BRILL Academic | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=1974 | pages=35–63 |  doi=10.2307/3269713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dīgha Nikāya Sutta 1, the Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71 describes six Nidānas:
{{quote|[...] [T]hey experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness and distress.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1996), page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walshe|first=Maurice|title=The Long Discourses of the Buddha: a Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya|year=1996|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-86171-103-1|page=656|edition=3. [Aufl.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71. This is identified as the first reference in the Canon in footnote 88 for Sutta 1, verse 3.71's footnotes.}}}}

Dīgha Nikāya, Sutta 14 describes ten links, and in Sutta 15 nine links are described, but without the six sense{{nbhyph}}bases:&lt;ref&gt;Walshe 1996, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...they experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness and distress.}}

Descriptions of the full sequence of twelve links can be found elsewhere in the Pali canon, for instance in section 12 of the Samyutta Nikaya:&lt;ref name="SN12.2"&gt;Samyutta Nikaya 12.2, [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html ''Paticca-samuppada-vibhanga Sutta: Analysis of Dependent Co-arising'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications ... From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.}}

If it is again asked, 'Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window (if he is confined to a room without the window or with the window closed)?' the answer will be, 'It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window. One can only see through the window.' Similarly, in the case of seeing, there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing. (So the eye does not have the ability to see without the eye-consciousness. The eye-consciousness itself cannot see anything without the organ.) The eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye, yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In reality, seeing comes into being depending on the eye. It is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality (eye) and mentality (eye-consciousness) at every moment of seeing. In addition, there is also a third element of materiality — the visual object. Without the visual object there is nothing to be seen..."&lt;ref name=Sayadaw&gt;Ven.

Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth:{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}}&lt;ref name=emamnuelp60/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris1991p135"/&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=brit1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica.

|[[Faith in Buddhism|Faith]] (''saddhā'')
|An attitude of trust directed at ultimate liberation and as refuge in the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|three jewels]]. The sutta states that "suffering is the supporting condition for faith", thereby linking it with the last nidana in the 12 nidana chain. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: "it is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its transcendence." Faith also comes about through the hearing of the exposition of true Dhamma (teaching). Faith also leads to the practice of [[Buddhist ethics|morality]] (sila).
|-
|Joy (''pāmojja'')
|From confidence in the sources of refuge and contemplation on them, a sense of joy arises
|-
|[[Pīti|Rapture]] (''pīti'')
|Generally, the application of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] is needed for the arising of rapture or bliss, though some rare individuals might experience rapture simply from the joy which arises from faith and a clear conscience arising from moral living. The meditative states called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]] are states of elevated rapture.
|-
|[[Passaddhi|Tranquillity]] (''passaddhi'')
|In the higher states of meditation, rapture gives way to a calm sense of tranquility. 
|-
|[[Sukha|Happiness]] (''sukha'')
|A subtler state than rapture, a pleasant feeling. 
|-
|[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Concentration]] (''samādhi'')
|"The wholesome unification of the mind", totally free from distractions and unsteadiness. 
|-
|''yathābhūta-ñānadassana''
|"Knowledge and vision of things as they really are". With a peaceful and concentrated mind, one is now able to practice the development of insight (''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]] bhavana),'' the first phase of which is insight into the nature of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]]''.'' Only ''pañña,'' the wisdom which penetrates the true nature of phenomena, can destroy the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] which keep beings bound to samsara. This wisdom is not mere conceptual understanding, but a kind of direct experience akin to visual perception which sees the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of all phenomena. In Northern Buddhist traditions and Mahayana works, insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] is further emphasized. 
|-
|Disenchantment (''nibbidā'')
|Noticing the passing away of phenomena, the fact that nothing is stable, reliable or permanent, gives rise to a sense of disenchantment towards them. B. Bodhi: "a conscious act of detachment resulting from a profound noetic discovery. ''Nibbida'' signifies in short, the serene, dignified withdrawal from phenomena which supervenes when the illusion of their permanence, pleasure, and selfhood has been shattered by the light of correct knowledge and vision of things as they are."
|-
|Dispassion (''virāga'')
|The first truly transmundane (''lokuttara'') stage in the progression. B. Bodhi: "Whatever tends to provoke grasping and adherence is immediately abandoned, whatever tends to create new involvement is left behind. The old urges towards outer extension and accumulation give way to a new urge towards relinquishment as the one clearly perceived way to release."
|-
|[[Vimutti|Freedom]] (''vimutti'')
|Having a twofold aspect: the emancipation from ignorance ''(paññavimutti)'' and defilements ''(cetovimutti)'' experienced in life, the other is the emancipation from repeated existence attained when passing away. Equivalent with [[Nibbana]].
|-
|''āsava-khaye-ñāna''
|"Knowledge of destruction of the [[Asava|Asavas]]". This is a stage termed retrospective cognition or "reviewing knowledge" ''(paccavekkhana ñana),'' which reviews and confirms that all defilements have been abandoned. B. Bodhi: "The retrospective cognition of release involves two acts of ascertainment. The first, called the "knowledge of destruction" ''(khaya ñana),'' ascertains that all defilements have been abandoned at the root; the second, the "knowledge of non-arising" ''(anuppade ñana),'' ascertains that no defilement can ever arise again."  
|}

The Upanisa Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya describes the reversed order, in which the causes for enlightenment are given. This application of the principle of dependent arising is referred to in Theravada exegetical literature as "transcendental dependent arising".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], "Transcendental Dependent Arising: A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "In addition to giving a clear, explicit account of the conditional structure of the liberative progression, this sutta has the further advantage of bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection with its familiar samsaric counterpart. By making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character of the principle of conditionality — its ability to support and explain both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from suffering. Thereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence of the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi. Transcendental Dependent Arising. A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The chain in this case is:

Within the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, the twelve nidanas are considered to be the most significant application of the principle of dependent origination.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=141}}

The nikayas themselves do not give a systematic explanation of the nidana series.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 313.&lt;/ref&gt; As an expository device, the commentarial tradition presented the factors as a linear sequence spanning over three lives,&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi 2005, page 314"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 314.&lt;/ref&gt; thus shifting the theme from a single conception (and birth) to a sequence of "incarnations" (roughly speaking). The twelve nidanas were interpreted by [[Buddhaghosa]] (c. fifth century CE) of the Sri Lankan [[Mahavihara]] tradition as encompassing three successive lives, as outlined in his influential [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Olson (Translator)|title=Buddhadhamma: Natural Laws and Values for Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffsumKIixS8C |year=1995|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2631-9|pages=112–115, 171–172 with footnote 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keownprebish269&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S.

====Arising of mental processes====
Yet, the twelve nidanas have also been interpreted within the Theravada tradition as explaining the arising of psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment. There is scriptural support for this as an explanation in the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]], insofar as Vasubandu states that on occasion "the twelve parts are realized in one and the same moment".&lt;ref&gt;Abhidharmakosa, by Vasubandhu. Translated by Leo Pruden, Vol. II, pgs 404-405.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]] notes that in Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the [[Vibhanga]] of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment.&lt;ref name=Payutto2&gt;Ven. Prayudh Payutto, Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Conditionality, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm#C5&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Prayudh Payutto]] there is material in the [[Vibhanga]] which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model.&lt;ref name=Payutto2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (2003), [http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/JACBUD.html ''Buddhadasa. Theravada Buddhism and Modernist Reform in Thailand''], p.90-91&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis is also defended by Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]]'s ''Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination.'' In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sarvāstivāda===
According to Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner, the three-lives model, with its "embryological" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the [[Sarvastivadin]] school (a north Indian branch of the [[Sthavira nikāya]]) as evidenced by the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 4th to 5th century CE).&lt;ref name="Hirakawa page 178"&gt;Hirakawa; Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhidharmakosa]] also outlines three other models of the twelve nidanas, that were used by the Sarvastivada schools together with the three lifetimes model:&lt;ref name="Hirakawa page 178"/&gt;
#Instantaneous – All 12 links are present in the same instant.
#Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas or phenomenal events arising at different times.
#Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in continuous series of moments.

===Yogacara===
[[Asanga]] (4th century CE) groups the twelve nidanas into four groups: 1-3 cause of dharmas; 4-7 dharmas; 8-10 cause of suffering; 11-12 suffering.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=173}}

The ''[[bhavachakra]]'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]; [[Pali language|Pāli]]: ''bhavachakra''; [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ''srid pa'i 'khor lo'') is a symbolic representation of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]] (or cyclic existence). It is found on the outside walls of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help ordinary people understand Buddhist teachings. The Three Fires sit at the very center of the schemata in the [[Bhavacakra]] and drive the whole edifice. In Himalayan iconographic representations of the Bhavacakra such as within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the Three Fires are known as the Three Poisons which are often represented as the [[Gankyil]]. The Gankyil is also often represented as the hub of the [[Dharmacakra]].

[[Tsongkhapa]], following [[Asanga]], explains how the twelve nidanas can be applied to one life of a single person, two lives of a single person, and three lives of a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC|year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=180–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that the Theravada/Sarvāstivāda interpretation is different from the Vajrayana view, because the Vajrayana view places a ''bardo'' or an intermediate state between death and rebirth, which is denied by the Theravadins and Sarvastivadins. This denial necessitated placing the first two nidanas of the "dependent origination" chain into the past life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=186–187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=184–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the twelve nidanas==

===Synthesis of older versions===

====Combination of older lists====
According to Frauwallner, the twelvefold chain is a combination of two lists. Originally, the Buddha explained the appearance of ''dukkha'' from ''tanha'', "thirst," craving. This is explained and described in the second part, from ''tanha'' on fowards. Later on, under influence of concurring systems, the Buddha incorporated ''avijja'', "ignorance," as a cause of suffering into his system. This is described in the first part, which describes the entry of ''vijnana'' into the womb, where the embryo develops.{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=167-168}} Frauwallner notes that "the purely mechanical mixing of both the two parts of the causal chainis remarkable and enigmatical." Noting that "contradictory thoughts stand directly near one another in the oldest Buddhistic ideas" many times, Frauwallner explains this as a "deficiency in systematization, the inability to mix different views and principles into a great unity."{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=168}}

According to Schumann, the twelvefold chain is a later composition by monks, consisting of three shorter lists. These lists may have encompassed ''nidana'' 1-4, 5-8, and 8-12. The progress of this composition can be traced in various steps in the canon.{{sfn|Schumann|1997|p=92}}

Lambert Schmitthausen argues that the twelve-fold list is a synthesis from three previous lists, arguing that the three lifetimes-interpretation is an unintended consequence of this synthesis.{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=305, note 19}}{{refn|group=note|Shulman refers to Schmitthausen (2000), ''Zur Zwolfgliedrigen Formel des Entstehens in Abhangigkeit'', in ''Horin: Vergleichende Studien zur Japanischen Kultur, 7''}}

Roderick S. Bucknell analysed four versions of the twelve nidanas, to explain the existence of various versions of the ''pratitya-samutpada'' sequence. The twevefold version is the "standard version," in which ''vijnana'' refers to sensual consciousness.{{refn|group=note|Bucknell: "''vinnana'': consciousness associated with eye, ear, nose tongue, body, and mind (''mano'')"{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=313}}}} According to Bucknell, the "standard version" of the twelve nidanas developed out of an ancestor version, which in turn was derived from two different versions, in which ''vijnana'' is differently explained.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}} 

&lt;!-- *BRANCHED VERSION* --&gt;
{| class="wikitable floatleft mw-collapsible autocollapse" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:100%;"&gt;
| colspan=2 style="text-align:center;" | '''Branched version'''

|}
In the socalled "branched version", which is not strictly linear, but connects a couple of branches, ''vijnana'' is derived from the coming together of the sense organs and the sense objects, a description which can also be found in other sutras. The three of them constitute ''phassa'' ("contact"). From there on, the list is linear. In the Sutta-nipata version, which is altogether linear, ''vijnana'' is derived from ''avijja'' ("ignorance") and ''[[Saṅkhāra]]'' ("activities" (RSB); also translated as "volitional formations").{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=335}} 

&lt;!-- *LOOPED VERSION* --&gt;

| style="text-align:center;" | ''vedana'' (feeling)
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | etc.
|}
The ''Mahanidana-sutta'' describes a "looped version," which is also further linear, in which ''vijnana'' and ''nama-rupa'' condition each other. According to Bucknell, this "looped version" is derived from the "branched version."{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=315, 333}} According to Bucknell, "some accounts of the looped version state explicitly that the chain of causation goes no further back than the loop.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=316}} The Mahanidana further explains ''vijnana'' as "consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at the moment of conception."{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=317}} Waldron notes that ''vijnana'' here has two aspects, namely "samsaric ''vijnana''" and "cognitive consciousness." "Samsaric ''vijnana''" is "consciousness per se, the basic sentience necessary for all animate life," which descends into the womb at the time of conception. Cognitive consciousness is related to the senses and the sense objects. It is "samsaric ''vijnana''" which forms, in Buddhist thought, the connection between two lifes.{{sfn|Walfron|2004|p=20}} While these two aspects were largely undifferentiated in early Buddhist thought, these two aspects and their relation was explicated in later Buddhist thought, giving rise to the concept of ''[[alaya-vijñana]]''.{{sfn|Walfron|2004|p=20-21}}

While the "branched version" refers directly to the six sense objects, the "looped version" and the standard version  instead name it ''nama-rupa'', which eventually was misinterpreted as "name-and-form" in the traditional sense. This created "new causal series," which made it possible to interpret the beginning of the chain as referring to rebirth, just like the end of the chain. In line with this reinterpretation, ''vijnana'' "became the consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at conception, while ''nama-rupa'' became the mind-body complex that [...] experiences contact (''phassa'') and so on." {{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=339}}{{refn|group=note|Bucknell: "These observations by Watsuji, Yinshun, and Reat indicate that ''nama-rupa'', far from signifying "mind-and-body" or something similar, is a collective term for the six types of sense object."{{sfn|Bucknell|p=325}}}}

Bucknell further notes that the "branched version," in which ''nama-rupa'' refers to the six classes of sense-objects, corresponds with [[Buddhadasa]]s psychological interpretation of the twelve nidanas. The "looped version," in which ''vijanana'' corresponds with "rebirth consciousness," corresponds with defenders of the traditional interpretation, such as [[Nyanatiloka]].{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=327-328, note 46}} According to Bucknell, the linear list, with its distortions and changed meaning for ''nama-rupa'' and ''vinaya'', may have developed when the list came to be recited in reverse order.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=332}}

Alex Wayman has argued that the idea of "dependent origination" may precede the birth of the Buddha, noting that the first four causal links starting with Avidya in the Twelve Nidānas are found in the cosmic development theory of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' and other older Vedic texts.{{sfn|Wayman|1984|p=173 with note 16}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=256}}{{sfn|Wayman|1971}} Jeffrey Hopkins notes that terms synonymous to ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' are ''Apekṣhasamutpāda'' and ''Prāpyasamutpāda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Hopkins|title=Meditation on Emptiness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rp8qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2014|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-705-7|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kalupahana, the concept of causality and causal efficacy where "cause produces an effect because a property or ''svadha'' (energy) is inherent in something", appears extensively in the Indian thought in the Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE, such as the 10th mandala of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Brahmana]]s layer of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

# ''sayam katam'' (''attakatam'', self causation): this theory posits that there is no external agent (God) necessary for a phenomenon, there is ''svadha'' (inner energy) in nature or beings that lead to creative evolution, the cause and the effect are in the essence of the evolute and inseparable (found in the Vedic and particularly [[Upanishad]]ic proto-Hindu schools); 
# ''param katam'' (external causation): posits that something external (God, fate, past karma or purely natural determinism) causes effects (found in materialistic schools like [[Charvaka]], as well as fate-driven schools such as [[Ajivika]]); 
# ''sayam-param katam'' (internal and external causation): combination of the first two theories of causation (found in some [[Jainism]], theistic proto-Hindu schools); 
# ''asayam-aparam katam'' (neither internal nor external causation): this theory denies direct determinism (''ahetu'') and posits fortuitous origination, asserting everything is a manifestation of a combination of chance (found in some proto-Hindu{{clarify|date=January 2018}} schools).

|} 
A similar resemblance has been noted by Jurewicz, who argues that the first four ''nidanas'' resemble the ''Hymn of Creation'' of RigVeda X, 129, in which ''avijja'' (ignorance) leads to ''kamma'' (''desire''), which is the seed of ''vijnana'' ("consciousness").{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135-136}}{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} This consciousness is a "singular consciousness," (Jurewicz) "non-dual consciousness," (Gombrich) "reflexive, cognizing itself" (Gombrich).{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135}} When the created world, ''name and form'', evolves, pure consciousness manifests itself in the world. It mistakenly identifies itself with ''name and form'', losing sight of its real identity.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|=135-136}} The Buddha mimicked this creation story, making clear how the entanglement with the world "drive a human being into deeper and deeper ignorance about himself."{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} According to Jurewicz, the Buddha may have picked the term ''nama-rupa'', because "the division of consciousness into name and form has only the negative value of an act which hinders cognition."{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} 

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist tradition soon lost sight of this connection with the Vedic worldview. It was aware that at this point there is the appearance of an individual person, which the Buddha referred to as the five skandhas,{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135}} denying a self (''atman'') separate from these skandhas.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=255}} The Buddhist tradition equated ''rupa'' with the first ''skandha'', and ''nama'' with the other four. Yet, as Gombrich notes, ''samkhara'', ''vijnana'', and ''vedana'' also appear as separate links in the twelvefold list, so this eqaution can't be correct for this ''nidana''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135-136}} According to Jurewizc, all twelve nidanas show similarities with the Vedic cosmogeny. They may have been invoked for educated listeners, to make the point that suffering arises in dependence on psychological processes without an atman, thereby rejecting the Vedic outlook.{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}

According to Gombrich, following Frauwallner,{{refn|group=note|Frauwallner (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy Vol. 1''}} the twelve-fold list is a combination of two previous lists, the second list beginning with ''tanha'', "thirst," the cause of suffering as described in the second Noble Truth".{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}} The first list consists of the first four ''nidanas'', which parody the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogony, as described by Jurewicz.{{refn|group=note|Jurewicz (2000), ''Playing with fire: the pratityasamutpada from the perspective of Vedic thought''. Journal of the Pali Text Society, XXVI, 77-104.}} According to Gombrich, the two lists were combined, resulting in contradictions in it's negative version.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}}{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "The six senses, and thence, via 'contact' and 'feeling', to thirst." It is quite plausible, however, that someone failed to notice that once the first four links became part of the chain, its negative version meant that in order to abolish ignorance one first had to abolish consciousness!"{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}}}} Gombrich further notes that
{{quote|Jurewicz's interpretation also makes it unnecessary to accept the complicated, indeed contorted, interpretation favoured by Buddhaghosa, that the chain covers three lives of the individual.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=142}}}}

According to Schumann, the Nidanas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings, meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five [[Skandha|skhandhas]] shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} This way it is explainable that nama-rupa en consciousness in the 9-fold are the beginning or start, while in the 12-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when nama-rupa en consciousness are present.
Schumann also proposes that the 12-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrate the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu maintain a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas aside the twelve nidanas.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}

Altogether the various lists combine as follows:

===Sequence of stages prior to birth===
According to Eisel Mazard, the twelve Nidanas are a description of "a sequence of stages prior to birth," as an "orthodox defense against any doctrine of a 'supernal self' or soul of any kind [...] excluding an un-mentioned life-force (jīva) that followers could presumed to be additional to the birth of the body, the arising of consciousness, and the other aspects mentioned in the 12-links formula."&lt;ref name=Mazard /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Mazard: "[T]he 12-links formula is unambiguously an ancient tract that was originally written on the subject of the conception and development of the embryo, as a sequence of stages prior to birth; in examining the primary source text, this is as blatant today as it was over two thousand years ago, despite some very interesting misinterpretations that have arisen in the centuries in-between [...] In the Mahānidāna [sutta]’s brief gloss on the term nāmarūpa [...] we have a very explicit reminder that the subject-matter being described in this sequence of stages is the development of the embryo [...] it is indisputably clear that we are reading about something that may (or may not) enter into (okkamissatha) the mother’s womb (mātukucchismiŋ) [...] [T]he passage is wildly incongruent with attempts of many other interpreters to render the whole doctrine in more abstract terms (variously psychological or metaphysical).&lt;ref name=Mazard&gt;Eisel Mazard, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/01/27/unpopular-facts-about-one-of-buddhist-philosophys-most-popular-doctrines/ ''Unpopular facts about one of buddhist philosophys most popular doctrines'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Mazard, "many later sources have digressed from the basic theme and subject-matter of the original text, knowingly or unknowingly."&lt;ref name=Mazard/&gt;

==Karma==
The notion of karma is integrated into the list of twelve nidanas, and has been extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Billington |title=Understanding Eastern Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=57–58, 73–74 note 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). Both good and bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97342-3|pages=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nagarjuna, the second causal link (''[[sankhara]]'', motivations) and the tenth causal link (''[[bhava]]'', gestation) are two karmas through which sentient beings trigger seven sufferings identified in the Twelve Nidanas, and from this arises the revolving rebirth cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC|year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be liberated from samsara and dukkha, asserts Buddhism, the 'dependent origination' doctrine implies that the karmic activity must cease.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"/&gt; One aspect of this 'causal link breaking' is to destroy the "deeply seated propensities, festering predilections" ([[asavas]]) which are karmic causal flow because these lead to rebirth.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"/&gt;

==Sunyata (emptiness)==

===Madhyamaka===
{{Main|Madhyamaka}}
In the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, to say that an object is "empty" is synonymous with saying that it is dependently originated. [[Nāgārjuna]] equates [[Sunyata|emptiness]] with dependent origination in [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24.18-19;{{sfn|Mabja Tsondru|2011|p=67-71, 447-477}} 
{{quote|Whatever arises dependently&lt;br/&gt;
Is explained as empty.&lt;br/&gt;
Thus dependent attribution&lt;br/&gt;
Is the middle way.

Since there is nothing whatever&lt;br/&gt;
That is not dependently existent,&lt;br/&gt;
For that reason there is nothing&lt;br/&gt;
Whatsoever that is not empty.{{sfn|Geshe Sonam Rinchen|2006|p=21}}}}

In his analysis, [[svabhāva]] is somewhat redefined from the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika]] interpretation to mean: ''inherent existence'' or ''self-characterization.'' Nagarjuna notably rejected the idea of ''dharmas'' containing [[svabhāva]], meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If a ''dharma'' was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See [[Prasaṅgika#N.C4.81g.C4.81rjuna.27s Merely Designated Causality|Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality]]). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty. 

[[Madhyamaka]] is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. In the Tibetan [[Gelug]] school, all dharmas are said to lack any {{'}}''inherent''{{'}} existence, according to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]] in his Ocean of Reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaari.info/notes/03-06-06Tam2.pdf|title=Mula by Jay Garfield|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan Buddhism===
In the [[Dzogchen]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept of dependent origination is considered to be complementary to the concept of emptiness. Specifically, this tradition emphasizes the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness—also known as the relative and absolute aspects of reality:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}
* Appearance (relative truth) refers to the concept that all appearances are dependently originated;
* Emptiness (absolute or ultimate truth) refers to the concept that the "nature" of all phenomena is emptiness—lacking inherent existence.

In [[Mipham Rinpoche]]'s ''Beacon of Certainty'', this relationship is explained using the metaphor of the reflection of the moon in water.{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}  According to this metaphor:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}
* The ''nature'' of all phenomena is like the reflection of the moon in water—completely lacking inherent existence. However,
* The ''appearance'' of the moon in the water is an expression of dependent origination—the appearance is completely dependent upon causes and conditions.

One of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism, [[Padmasambhava]], emphasized his respect for this relationship as follows:
{{quote|Though my View is as spacious as the sky,&lt;br&gt; 
My actions and respect for cause and effect are as fine as grains of flour.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=169}}}}

==Interdependence==

===Hua Yen school===
The [[Huayan school]] taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based in the tradition of the great Madhyamaka scholar [[Nagarjuna]] and, more specifically, on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. Regarded by [[D.T. Suzuki]] as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.

===Thich Nhat Hanh===
[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] states, "''Pratitya samutpada'' is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (''samutpada'') and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: "Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall." In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for the idea that there is no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence, states Rinpoche.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|loc=Kindle Locations 849-863}}

==Comparison with western philosophy==
[[Jay L. Garfield]] states that [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]] uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}

The concept of ''pratītyasamutpāda'' has also been compared to Western [[metaphysics]], the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all.{{sfn|Schilbrack|2002}} Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.{{refn|group=quote|Hoffman states: "Suffice it to emphasize that the doctrine of dependent origination is not a metaphysical doctrine, in the sense that it does not affirm or deny some super-sensible entities or realities; rather, it is a proposition arrived at through an examination and analysis of the world of phenomena ..."{{sfn|Hoffman|1996|p=177}} }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12280">{{dablink|This article is concerned with pullback operations in differential geometry, in particular, the pullback of [[differential form]]s and [[tensor (intrinsic definition)|tensor fields]] on [[smooth manifold]]s. For other uses of the term in [[mathematics]], see [[pullback]].}}

Suppose that ''φ'':''M''→ ''N'' is a [[smooth map]] between smooth manifolds ''M'' and ''N''; then there is an associated [[linear map]] from the space of 1-forms on ''N'' (the [[linear space]] of [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of the [[cotangent bundle]]) to the space of 1-forms on ''M''. This linear map is known as the pullback (by ''φ''), and is frequently denoted by ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.  More generally, any [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor field &amp;ndash; in particular any differential form &amp;ndash; on ''N'' may be pulled back to ''M'' using ''φ''.

When the map ''φ'' is a [[diffeomorphism]], then the pullback, together with the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]], can be used to transform any tensor field from ''N'' to ''M'' or vice versa. In particular, if ''φ'' is a diffeomorphism between open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, viewed as a [[change of coordinates]] (perhaps between different [[manifold|charts]] on a manifold ''M''), then the pullback and pushforward describe the transformation properties of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant]] tensors used in more traditional (coordinate dependent) approaches to the subject.

The idea behind the pullback is essentially the notion of [[pullback|precomposition]] of one function with another. However, by combining this idea in several different contexts, quite elaborate pullback operations can be constructed. This article begins with the simplest operations, then uses them to construct more sophisticated ones. Roughly speaking, the pullback mechanism (using precomposition) turns several constructions in differential geometry into contravariant functors.

==Pullback of smooth functions and smooth maps==

Let φ:''M''→ ''N'' be a smooth map between (smooth) manifolds ''M'' and ''N'', and suppose ''f'':''N''→'''R''' is a smooth function on ''N''. Then the '''pullback''' of ''f'' by φ is the smooth function φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' on ''M'' defined by
(φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''f'')(''x'') = ''f''(φ(''x'')). Similarly, if ''f'' is a smooth function on an [[open set]] ''U'' in ''N'', then the same formula defines a smooth function on the open set ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') in ''M''. (In the language of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]], pullback defines a morphism from the [[sheaf of smooth functions]] on ''N'' to the [[direct image sheaf|direct image]] by φ of the sheaf of smooth functions on ''M''.)

More generally, if ''f'':''N''→''A'' is a smooth map from ''N'' to any other manifold ''A'', then φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''x'')=''f''(φ(''x'')) is a smooth map from ''M'' to ''A''.

==Pullback of bundles and sections==

If ''E'' is a [[vector bundle]] (or indeed any [[fiber bundle]]) over ''N'' and ''φ'':''M''→''N'' is a smooth map, then the '''[[pullback bundle]]''' ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''E'' is a vector bundle (or [[fiber bundle]]) over ''M'' whose [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] over ''x'' in ''M'' is given by (''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''E'')&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''φ''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this situation, precomposition defines a pullback operation on sections of ''E'': if ''s'' is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of ''E'' over ''N'', then the '''[[pullback bundle|pullback section]]''' &lt;math&gt;\varphi^*s=s\circ\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a section of ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''E'' over ''M''.

==Pullback of multilinear forms==

Let Φ:''V''→ ''W'' be a [[linear map]] between vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' (i.e., Φ is an element of ''L''(''V'',''W''), also denoted Hom(''V'',''W'')), and let

:&lt;math&gt;F:W \times W \times \cdots \times W \rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;

be a multilinear form on ''W'' (also known as a [[tensor]] — not to be confused with a tensor field — of rank (0,''s''), where ''s'' is the number of factors of ''W'' in the product). Then the pullback Φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''F'' of ''F'' by Φ is a multilinear form on ''V'' defined by precomposing ''F'' with Φ. More precisely, given vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''V'', Φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''F'' is defined by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;(\Phi^*F)(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_s) = F(\Phi(v_1), \Phi(v_2), \ldots ,\Phi(v_s)),&lt;/math&gt;

which is a multilinear form on ''V''. Hence Φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a (linear) operator from multilinear forms on ''W'' to multilinear forms on ''V''. As a special case, note that if ''F'' is a linear form (or (0,1) -tensor) on ''W'', so that ''F'' is an element of ''W''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[dual space]] of ''W'', then Φ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''F'' is an element of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and so pullback by Φ defines a linear map between dual spaces which acts in the opposite direction to the linear map Φ itself:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi\colon V\rightarrow W, \qquad \Phi^*\colon W^*\rightarrow V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

From a tensorial point of view, it is natural to try to extend the notion of pullback to tensors of arbitrary rank, i.e., to multilinear maps on ''W''
taking values in a [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt; W\otimes W\otimes\cdots\otimes W&lt;/math&gt; of ''r'' copies of ''W''. However, elements of such a tensor product do not pull back naturally: instead there is a pushforward operation from &lt;math&gt; V\otimes V\otimes\cdots\otimes V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; W\otimes W\otimes\cdots\otimes W&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_*(v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots\otimes v_r)=\Phi(v_1)\otimes \Phi(v_2)\otimes\cdots\otimes \Phi(v_r).&lt;/math&gt;

Nevertheless, it follows from this that if Φ is invertible, pullback can be defined using pushforward by the inverse function Φ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Combining these two constructions yields a pushforward operation, along an invertible linear map, for tensors of any rank (''r'',''s'').

==Pullback of cotangent vectors and 1-forms==

Let ''φ'' : ''M'' → ''N'' be a [[smooth map]] between [[smooth manifolds]]. Then the [[pushforward (differential)|differential]] of ''φ'', written ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, ''dφ'', or ''Dφ'', is a [[vector bundle morphism]] (over ''M'') from the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of ''M'' to the [[pullback bundle]] ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''TN''. The [[dual space|transpose]] of ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore a bundle map from ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N'' to ''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M''.

Now suppose that ''α'' is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N'' (a [[differential form|1-form]] on ''N''), and precompose ''α'' with ''φ'' to obtain a [[pullback bundle|pullback section]] of ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N''. Applying the above bundle map (pointwise) to this section yields the '''pullback''' of ''α'' by ''φ'', which is the 1-form ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''α'' on ''M'' defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (\varphi^*\alpha)_x(X) = \alpha_{\varphi(x)}(d\varphi_x(X))&lt;/math&gt;
for ''x'' in ''M'' and ''X'' in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.

==Pullback of (covariant) tensor fields==
The construction of the previous section generalizes immediately to [[tensor|tensor bundle]]s of rank (0,''s'') for any natural number ''s'': a (0,''s'') [[tensor field]] on a manifold ''N'' is a section of the tensor bundle on ''N'' whose fiber at ''y'' in ''N'' is the space of multilinear ''s''-forms
:&lt;math&gt; F\colon T_y N\times\cdots \times T_y N\to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
By taking Φ equal to the (pointwise) differential of a smooth map ''φ'' from ''M'' to ''N'', the pullback of multilinear forms can be combined with the pullback of sections to yield a pullback (0,''s'') tensor field on ''M''. More precisely if ''S'' is a (0,''s'')-tensor field on ''N'', then the '''pullback''' of ''S'' by ''φ'' is the (0,''s'')-tensor field ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' on ''M'' defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (\varphi^*S)_x(X_1,\ldots, X_s) = S_{\varphi(x)}(d\varphi_x(X_1),\ldots d\varphi_x(X_s))&lt;/math&gt;
for ''x'' in ''M'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.

==Pullback of differential forms==
A particular important case of the pullback of covariant tensor fields is the pullback of [[differential form]]s. If ''α'' is a differential ''k''-form, i.e., a section of the [[exterior bundle]] Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''T''*''N'' of (fiberwise) alternating ''k''-forms on ''TN'', then the pullback of ''α'' is the differential ''k''-form on ''M'' defined by the same formula as in the previous section:
:&lt;math&gt; (\varphi^*\alpha)_x(X_1,\ldots, X_k) = \alpha_{\varphi(x)}(d\varphi_x(X_1),\ldots, d\varphi_x(X_k))&lt;/math&gt;
for ''x'' in ''M'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.

The pullback of differential forms has two properties which make it extremely useful.

1. It is compatible with the [[wedge product]] in the sense that for differential forms ''α'' and ''β'' on ''N'', 
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^*(\alpha \wedge \beta)=\varphi^*\alpha \wedge \varphi^*\beta.&lt;/math&gt;
2. It is compatible with the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'': if ''α'' is a differential form on ''N'' then
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^*(d\alpha) = d(\varphi^*\alpha).&lt;/math&gt;

==Pullback by diffeomorphisms==
When the map ''φ'' between manifolds is a [[diffeomorphism]], that is, it has a smooth inverse, then pullback can be defined for the [[vector field]]s as well as for 1-forms, and thus, by extension, for an arbitrary mixed tensor field on the manifold. The linear map
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=d\varphi_x\in \operatorname{GL}(T_xM,T_{\varphi(x)}N)&lt;/math&gt;
can be inverted to give
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi^{-1}=({d\varphi_x})^{-1} \in \operatorname{GL}(T_{\varphi(x)}N, T_xM).&lt;/math&gt;

A general mixed tensor field will then transform using Φ and Φ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; according to the [[tensor product]] decomposition of the tensor bundle into copies of ''TN'' and ''T&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;N''. When ''M'' = ''N'', then the pullback and the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] describe the transformation properties of a [[tensor]] on the manifold ''M''.  In traditional terms, the pullback describes the transformation properties of the covariant indices of a [[tensor]]; by contrast, the transformation of the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] indices is given by a [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]].

==Pullback by automorphisms==

The construction of the previous section has a representation-theoretic interpretation when ''φ'' is a diffeomorphism from a manifold ''M'' to itself. In this case the derivative ''dφ'' is a section of GL(''TM'',''φ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''TM''). This induces a pullback action on sections of any bundle associated to the [[frame bundle]] GL(''M'') of ''M'' by a representation of the [[general linear group]] GL(''m'') (''m'' = dim ''M'').

==Pullback and Lie derivative==

See [[Lie derivative]]. By applying the preceding ideas to the local 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms defined by a vector field on ''M'', and differentiating with respect to the parameter, a notion of Lie derivative on any associated bundle is obtained.

==Pullback of connections (covariant derivatives)==

If &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] (or [[covariant derivative]]) on a vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth map from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a '''pullback connection''' &lt;math&gt;\varphi^*\nabla&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, determined uniquely by the condition that
:&lt;math&gt;(\varphi^*\nabla)_X(\varphi^*s) = \varphi^*(\nabla_{d\varphi(X)} s).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[operant conditioning]], '''punishment''' is any change in a human or animal's surroundings that occurs after a given behavior or response which reduces the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. As with [[reinforcement]], it is the ''behavior'', not the animal, that is punished. Whether a change is or is not punishing is determined by its effect on the rate that the behavior occurs, not by any "hostile" or [[aversives|aversive]] features of the change. For example, a painful stimulus which would act as a punisher for most people may actually reinforce some behaviors of [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] individuals.

==Types==
{{See also|Operant conditioning}}
There are &lt;!-- basic types or models of punishment? --&gt; two types of punishment in operant conditioning:

*'''positive punishment''', '''punishment by application''', or '''type I punishment''', an experimenter punishes a response by presenting an aversive [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] into the animal's surroundings (a brief electric shock, for example).
*'''negative punishment''', '''punishment by removal''', or '''type II punishment''', a valued, appetitive stimulus is removed (as in the removal of a feeding dish). As with reinforcement, it is not usually necessary to speak of positive and negative in regard to punishment.

Punishment is not a mirror effect of reinforcement. In experiments with laboratory animals and studies with children, punishment decreases the likelihood of a previously reinforced response only temporarily, and it can produce other "emotional" behavior (wing-flapping in pigeons, for example) and physiological changes (increased heart rate, for example) that have no clear equivalents in reinforcement.

Punishment is considered by some behavioral psychologists to be a "primary process" – a completely independent phenomenon of learning, distinct from reinforcement. Others see it as a category of [[negative reinforcement]], creating a situation in which any punishment-avoiding behavior (even standing still) is reinforced.

=== Positive ===
Positive punishment occurs when a response produces a stimulus and that response decreases in probability in the future 
in similar circumstances.
* Example: A mother yells at a child when he or she runs into the street. If the child stops running into the street, the yelling ceases. The yelling acts as positive punishment because the mother presents (adds) an unpleasant stimulus in the form of yelling.
* Example: A barefoot person walks onto a hot asphalt surface, creating pain, a positive punishment. When the person leaves the asphalt, the pain subsides.  The pain acts as positive punishment because it is the addition of an unpleasant stimulus that reduces the future likelihood of the person walking barefoot on a hot surface.

=== Negative ===
Negative punishment occurs when a response produces the removal of a stimulus and that response decreases in probability in the future in similar circumstances.
* Example: A teenager comes home after curfew and the parents take away a privilege, such as cell phone usage. If the frequency of the child coming home late decreases, the privilege is gradually restored. The removal of the phone is negative punishment because the parents are taking away a pleasant stimulus (the phone) and motivating the child to return home earlier.
* Example: A child throws a temper tantrum because he wants ice cream.  His mother subsequently ignores him, making it less likely the child will throw a temper tantrum in the future when he wants something. The removal of attention from his mother is a negative punishment because a pleasant stimulus (attention) is taken away.

==Versus reinforcement==
Simply put, reinforcers serve to increase behaviors whereas punishers serve to decrease behaviors; thus, positive reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to attain, and negative reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to be rid of or to end.&lt;ref name="D'Amato"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Amato|first=M. R.|title=Learning Processes: Instrumental Conditioning|year=1969|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=Toronto|editor=Melvin H. Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below illustrates the adding and subtracting of stimuli (pleasant or aversive) in relation to reinforcement vs. punishment.

! [[Aversives|Aversive]] (unpleasant) stimulus
|-
! Adding/Presenting
| Positive Reinforcement
| Positive Punishment
|-
! Removing/Taking Away
| Negative Punishment
| Negative Reinforcement
|-
|}

==Aversives==
''Aversive stimulus'', ''punisher'', and ''punishing stimulus'' are somewhat synonymous. ''Punishment'' may be used for (a) an aversive stimulus or (b) the occurrence of any punishing change or (c) the part of an experiment in which a particular response is punished. However, some things considered aversive (such as [[spanking]]) can become [[reinforcement|reinforcing]]. In addition, some things that are aversive may not be punishing if accompanying changes are reinforcing. A classic example would be mis-behavior that is 'punished' by a teacher but actually increases over time due to the reinforcing effects of attention on the student.

== Primary versus secondary ==
Pain, loud noises, foul tastes, bright lights, and exclusion are all things that would pass the "caveman test" as an aversive stimulus, and are therefore primary punishers.  The sound of someone booing, the wrong-answer buzzer on a game show, and a ticket on your car windshield are all things you have learned to think about as negative, and are considered secondary punishers.

== Effectiveness ==
Contrary to suggestions by Skinner and others that punishment typically has weak or impermanent effects,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Science and Human Behavior" (1953)McMIllan, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  a large body of research has shown that it can have a powerful and lasting effect in suppressing the punished behavior. However, it may also have powerful and lasting side effects.  For example, an aversive stimulus used to punish a particular behavior may also elicit a strong emotional response that may suppress unpunished behavior and become associated with situational stimuli through classical conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B, Wasserman, E. A., &amp; Robbins, S. J. "Psychology of Learning and Behavior" (5th Ed) (2002) Norton, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Such side effects suggest caution and restraint in the use of punishment to modify behavior. (Further reading:  {{cite web|last1=Ayotte|first1=R.|last2=Muster|first2=H.|last3=Morais|first3=F.|last4=PheonixEnder|title=Positive and negative reinforcement and punishment effectiveness|url=https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/510/positive-and-negative-reinforcement-and-punishment-effectiveness|website=Cognitive Sciences Stack Exchange|accessdate=10 May 2017|displayauthors=3}})

==Importance of contingency and contiguity==
One variable affecting punishment is [[Contingency (psychology)|contingency]], which is defined as the dependency of events. A behavior may be dependent on a stimulus or dependent on a response. The purpose of punishment is to reduce a behavior, and the degree to which punishment is effective in reducing a targeted behavior is dependent on the relationship between the behavior and a punishment. For example, if a rat receives an aversive stimulus, such as a shock each time it presses a lever, then it is clear that contingency occurs between lever pressing and shock. In this case, the punisher (shock) is contingent upon the appearance of the behavior (lever pressing). Punishment is most effective when contingency is present between a behavior and a punisher. A second variable affecting punishment is [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], which is the closeness of events in time and/or space. Contiguity is important to reducing behavior because the longer the time interval between an unwanted behavior and a punishing effect, the less effective the punishment will be. One major problem with a time delay between a behavior and a punishment is that other behaviors may present during that time delay. The subject may then associate the punishment given with the unintended behaviors, and thus suppressing those behaviors instead of the targeted behavior. Therefore, immediate punishment is more effective in reducing a targeted behavior than a delayed punishment would be.

==Applied behavior analysis==
{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}
Punishment is sometimes used for treatment programs in [[applied behavior analysis]] in the most extreme cases, to reduce dangerous behaviors such as head banging or biting exhibited most commonly by children or people with special needs or disabilities. Punishment is considered one of the [[ethical challenges to autism treatment]] and is one of the major reasons for discussion of professionalizing behavior analysis. Professionalizing behavior analysis through licensure would create a board to ensure that consumers or families had a place to air disputes. (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]])

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study found that 46% of people with autism spectrum undergoing ABA met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the risk of developing it as a result of ABA is more than 86% higher in people with autism spectrum than in non-obese people. type of therapy. According to the researchers, the risk of PTSD was increased when ABA was used regardless of the age of the patient (adults and children were examined).&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes praise, [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: may involve removing one from a negative situation
* [[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement.3B schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===Traumatic bonding===
{{Main|Traumatic bonding}}
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Traumatic Bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|last = Dutton|first = |date = 1981|journal = Victimology: An International Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Painter|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson2008"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson.

In [[energy conservation|conservation]] and [[energy economics]], the '''rebound effect''' (or '''take-back effect''') is the reduction in expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of [[natural resource|resource]] use, because of behavioral or other systemic responses. These responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken.

While the literature on the rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption, the theory can also be applied to the use of any [[natural resource]] or other input, such as [[Labor (economics)|labor]]. The rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected environmental benefit when holding consumption constant.&lt;ref name=Grubb&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Grubb| given=M.J.| title=Energy efficiency and economic fallacies| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=783–785 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if a 5% improvement in vehicle [[fuel efficiency]] results in only a 2% drop in fuel use, there is a 60% rebound effect (since {{frac|(5-2)|5}} = 60%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wang|first = Zhaohua|last2 = Han|first2 = Bai|last3 = Lu|first3 = Milin|date = 2016|title = Measurement of energy rebound effect in households: Evidence from residential electricity consumption in Beijing, China|url = |journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume = 58|pages = 852–861|doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'missing' 3% might have been consumed by driving faster or further than before.

The existence of the rebound effect is uncontroversial. However, debate continues as to the magnitude and impact of the effect in real world situations.&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/asset/3B43125E-EEBD-4AB3-B06EA914C30F7B3E/| title = The rebound effect: An assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency| author = Steven Sorrell | year = 2007 | publisher= UK Energy Research Centre| accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the magnitude of the rebound effect, there are five different rebound effect (RE) types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Saunders|first = Harry D.|date = 2008|title = Fuel conserving (and using) production functions|url = |journal = Energy Economics|volume = 30|issue = 5|pages = 2184–2235|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2007.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Super conservation (RE &lt; 0): the actual resource savings are higher than expected savings – the rebound effect is negative. This occurs if the increase in efficiency reduces costs.
#Zero rebound (RE = 0): The actual resource savings are equal to expected savings – the rebound effect is zero.
#Partial rebound (0 &lt; RE &lt; 1): The actual resource savings are less than expected savings – the rebound effect is between 0% and 100%. This is sometimes known as 'take-back', and is the most common result of empirical studies on individual markets.
#Full rebound (RE = 1): The actual resource savings are equal to the increase in usage – the rebound effect is at 100%.
#Backfire (RE &gt; 1): The actual resource savings are negative because usage increased beyond potential savings – the rebound effect is higher than 100%. This situation is commonly known as the [[Jevons paradox]].

In order to avoid the rebound effect, [[environmental economics|environmental economists]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed in order to keep the cost of use the same.&lt;ref name=Wackernagel/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Jevons paradox|Khazzoom-Brookes postulate}}

The rebound effect was first described by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]'', where he observed that the invention in Britain of a more efficient steam engine meant that the use of coal became economically viable for many new uses. This ultimately led to increased coal demand and much increased coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular use fell. According to Jevons, "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |at=Chapter VII |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ0.html |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most contemporary authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound effect in the research literature. Although Khazzoom did not use the term, he raised the idea that there is a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product.&lt;ref name=Khazzoom&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Khazzoom| given=Daniel J.| title=Economic implications for mandated efficiency in standards for household appliances.| journal= The Energy Journal |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1980 | pages=21–40 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol1-no4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the [[price elasticity of demand]] for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in [[garden lighting]] after the introduction of energy-saving [[Light Emitting Diode]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher C. M.|last2=Kuester|first2=Theres|last3=Sánchez de Miguel|first3=Alejandro|last4=Baugh|first4=Kimberly|last5=Jechow|first5=Andreas|last6=Hölker|first6=Franz|last7=Bennie|first7=Jonathan|last8=Elvidge|first8=Christopher D.|last9=Gaston|first9=Kevin J.|last10=Guanter|first10=Luis|title=Artificially lit surface of Earth at night increasing in radiance and extent|journal=Science Advances|date=22 November 2017|volume=3|issue=11|pages=e1701528|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1701528|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101195115/http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archivedate=2018-01-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the [[Jevons paradox]]).

Khazzoom's thesis was criticized heavily by Michael Grubb&lt;ref name=Grubb/&gt; and [[Amory Lovins]]&lt;ref name=Lovins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovins|first1=Amory B.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: Another View|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol9-no2-10|JSTOR=41970456}} And: {{cite journal|last1=Henly|first1=John|last2=Ruderman|first2=Henry|last3=Levine|first3=Mark D.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: A Follow-up|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|pages=163–170|JSTOR=41970457}}&lt;/ref&gt; who dismissed any disconnection between energy efficiency improvements in an individual market, and an economy-wide reduction in energy consumption. Developing Khazzoom's idea further, and prompting heated debate in the Energy Policy journal at that time, Len Brookes wrote of the fallacies in the energy-efficiency solution to greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Brookes| given=L.| title=The greenhouse effect: the fallacies in the energy efficient solution| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=199–201 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90145-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis showed that any economically justified improvements in energy efficiency would in fact stimulate economic growth and increase total energy use. For improvements in energy efficiency to contribute to a reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, the improvement must come at a greater economic cost. Commenting in regard to energy efficiency advocates, he concludes that, "the present high profile of the topic seems to owe more to the current tide of green fervor than to sober consideration of the facts, and the validity and cost of solutions."&lt;ref name=Brookes/&gt;

===Khazzoom-Brookes postulate===
In 1992, economist Harry Saunders coined the term "[[Khazzoom-Brookes postulate]]" to describe the idea that energy efficiency gains paradoxically result in increases in energy use (the modern day equivalent of the [[Jevons paradox]]). He modeled energy efficiency gains using a variety of neo-classical growth models, and showed that the postulate is true over a wide range of assumptions. In the conclusion of his paper, Saunders stated that:&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Saunders| given=Harry| title=The Khazzom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth| journal=Energy Journal |volume=13 | year=1992 | pages=131–148 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol13-no4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|In the absence of efficiency gains, energy use will grow in lock step with economic growth (energy intensity will stay fixed) when energy prices are fixed. … Energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption by two means: by making energy appear effectively cheaper than other inputs; and by increasing economic growth, which pulls up energy use. … These results, while by no means proving the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate, call for prudent energy analysts and policy makers to pause a long moment before dismissing it.}}

This work provided a theoretical grounding for empirical studies and played an important role in framing the problem of the rebound effect. It also reinforced an emerging ideological divide between energy economists on the extent of the yet to be named effect.  The two tightly held positions are:
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency enable economic growth that was otherwise impossible without the improvement; as such, energy efficiency improvements will usually back-fire in the long term.
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency may result in a small take-back. However, even in the long term, energy efficiency improvements usually result in large overall energy savings.

Even though many studies have been undertaken in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent studies have demonstrated that direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (to alleviate the impacts of [[climate change]]). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase [[oil]] and [[coal]] consumption, and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, over the long run.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|last2=Roy|first2=Robin|date=2007|title=Technological innovation, energy efficient design and the rebound effect|url=|journal=Technovation|volume=27|issue=4|pages=194–203|doi=10.1016/j.technovation.2006.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of effects==
The full rebound effect can be distinguished into three different economic reactions to technological changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Sorrell|first = Steve|last2 = Dimitropoulos|first2 = John|date = 2008|title = The rebound effect: Microeconomic definitions, limitations and extensions|url = |journal = Ecological Economics|volume = 65|issue = 3|pages = 636–649|doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Direct rebound effect: An increase in consumption of a good is caused by the lower cost of use. This is caused by the [[substitution effect]].
# Indirect rebound effect: The lower cost of a service enables increased household consumption of other goods and services. For example, the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury good. This is caused by the [[income effect]].
# Economy wide effect: The fall in service cost reduces the price of other goods, creates new production possibilities and increases economic growth.
In the example of improved vehicle fuel efficiency, the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper. The indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost savings from increased fuel efficiency. Since consumption of other goods increases, the embodied fuel used in the production of those goods would increase as well. Finally, the economy-wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy, including any effects on economic growth rates.

===Direct and indirect effects===
[[Image:Efficiencyreboundgraph.png|thumb|right|400px|Direct and Indirect Effects]]

For cost reducing resource efficiency, distinguishing between direct and indirect effects is shown in Figure 1 below.  The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and measured in terms of kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis.  An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing.  This shifts the household budget line rightwards.  The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income.  The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2.  The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect.  The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2.  The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; In the manufacturing sector, it has been estimated that there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.

The rebound effect can increase the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=RS20981/&gt; Estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity, heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; Evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating the size of this effect.  Evaluation methods rely on quasi-experimental studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology, while econometric methods utilize [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity estimates]] to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services.

Research has found that in [[developed countries]], the direct rebound effect is usually small to moderate, ranging from roughly 5% to 40% in residential space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name=RS20981&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228115335/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archivedate = 2007-12-28 |last1=Gottron|first1=Frank | title = Energy Efficiency and the Rebound Effect: Does Increasing Efficiency Decrease Demand? | date=2001|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greening|first1=Lorna A. |last2=Greene|first2=David L.|last3=Difiglio|first3=Carmen|title=Energy efficiency and consumption — the rebound effect — a survey|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=389–401|doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/ucei/policy/EPE-014 | title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966-2001 | first1 = Kenneth A. |last1=Small | first2=Kurt |last2= Van Dender | date = 21 September 2005 | publisher= University of California Energy Institute: Policy &amp; Economics | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freire-González | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Empirical evidence of direct rebound effect in Catalonia | url = | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 2309–2314 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2009.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the direct rebound effect can be attributed to consumers who were previously unable to use a service.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=Steve|last2=Dimitropoulos|first2=John|last3=Sommerville|first3=Matt|date=2009|title=Empirical estimates of the direct rebound effect: A review|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1356–1371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rebound effect may be more significant in the context of the undeveloped markets in [[developing economies]].&lt;ref name=Roy2000&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Roy| given=Joyashree| title=The rebound effect: some empirical evidence from India| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=433–438 |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antal|first1=Miklós|last2=van den Bergh|first2=Jeroen C.J.M.|title=Re-spending rebound: A macro-level assessment for OECD countries and emerging economies|journal=Energy Policy|date=2014|volume=68|pages=585–590|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect effects from conservation ===
[[Image:Conservationreboundgraph.png|thumb|400px| Figure2: change in preferences of a household revealing indirect effects from conservation]]

For conservation measures, indirect effects closely approximate the total economy-wide effect.  Conservation measures constitute a change in consumption patterns away from particular targeted goods towards other goods. Figure 2 shows that a change in preference of a household results in a new consumption pattern that has less of the target good (QT to QT`), and more of all other goods (QO to QO`).  The [[resource consumption]] or externalities embodied in this other consumption is the indirect effect.

Although a persuasive view has prevailed that indirect effects with respect to energy and greenhouse emissions should be very small due to energy directly comprising only a small component of household expenditure, this view is gradually being eroded.&lt;ref name=Lovins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schipper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schipper|first1=Lee|last2=Grubb|first2=Michael|title=On the rebound?

===Economy wide effects===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
Even if the direct and indirect rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for the economy as a whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of [[economic growth]]. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to [[stagflation]] ([[recession]] and [[inflation]]) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.

To model the scale of this effect, economists use computational general equilibrium (CGE) models.  While CGE methodology is by no means perfect, results indicate that economy-wide rebound effects are likely to be very high, with estimates above 100% being rather common.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; One simple CGE model has been made available online for use by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D|title=A Calculator for Energy Consumption Changes Arising from New Technologies|journal=The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1515/1538-0653.1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income level variation===

Research has shown that the direct rebound effects for energy services is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Paul|last2=Blundell|first2=Richard|last3=Micklewright|first3=John|title=Modelling Household Energy Expenditures Using Micro-Data|journal=The Economic Journal|date=1989|volume=99|issue=397|page=720|doi=10.2307/2233767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milne|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Boardman|first2=Brenda|title=Making cold homes warmer: the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes.

This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Sung H.|last2=Oreszczyn|first2=Tadj|last3=Ridley|first3=Ian|title=The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the space heating fuel consumption in English dwellings|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=2006|volume=38|issue=10|pages=1171–1181|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2006.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos/&gt; In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.

The size of the rebound effect is likely to be higher in developing countries according to macro-level assessments &lt;ref name=Antal/&gt; and case studies. One case study was undertaken in rural India to evaluate the impact of an alternative energy scheme.&lt;ref name=Roy2000/&gt; Households were given solar powered lighting in an attempt to reduce the use of kerosene for lighting to zero except for seasons with insufficient sunshine.  The scheme was also designed to encourage a future willingness to pay for efficient lighting.  The results were surprising, with high direct rebounds between 50 and 80%, and total direct and indirect rebound above 100%.  Because the new lighting source was essentially zero cost, operating hours for lighting went up from an average of 2 to 6 per day, with new lighting consisting of a combination of both the no-cost solar lamps and also kerosene lamps.  Also, more cooking was undertaken which enabled an increased trade of food with neighboring villages.

===Rebounds with respect to time===

The individual opportunity of cost is an often overlooked cause of the rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result in an increase in demand for a service.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binswanger|first1=Mathias|title=Technological progress and sustainable development: what about the rebound effect?|journal=Ecological Economics|date=2001|volume=36|issue=1|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jalas&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Jalas| given=Mikko| title=A time use perspective on the materials intensity of consumption | journal=Ecological Economics|volume=41 | year=2002 | pages=101–123 | doi =10.1016/s0921-8009(02)00018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms a major part of the total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger/&gt; While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect.  Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates.  For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.

==Suggested solutions==
In order to ensure that efficiency enhancing technological improvements actually reduce fuel use, the [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=Wackernagel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = Mathis | last2 = Rees | first2 = William  | year = 1997 | title = Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: economics from an ecological footprint perspective | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 3–24 | doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved through, for example, the imposition of a [[ecotax|green tax]], a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] program, higher [[fuel tax]]es or the proposed "restore" approach where part of the savings is directed back to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies can also directly address projected yearly consumption of energy rather than device efficiency, especially for systems where the use can be accurately projected, such as street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C.

A '''shibboleth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=GT Shibboleth.ogg|ˈ|ʃ|ɪ|b|əl|ɛ|θ|,_|-|ɪ|θ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editors=Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Shibboleth}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[Convention (norm)|custom]] or tradition, particularly a speech pattern, that distinguishes one group of people (an [[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]]) from others ([[ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 8th ed, (Oxford University Press, 1990), 1117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shibboleth shibboleth], accessed online 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary'', [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shibboleth shibboleth], accessed online 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Shibboleths have been used throughout history in many societies as [[password]]s, simple ways of self-identification, signaling loyalty and affinity, maintaining traditional segregation or keeping out perceived threats.

==Origin==
The term originates from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''shibbólet'' ({{Hebrew|שִׁבֹּלֶת}}), which literally means the part of a plant containing grains, such as an [[Ear (botany)|ear of corn]] or a stalk of [[grain]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Wahrig|Wahrig Deutsches Wörterbuch]], Sixth Edition and {{cite web|work=Meyers Lexikon online |title=Schibboleth |url=http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Schibboleth}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in different contexts, "stream, torrent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[American Heritage Dictionary]], also sometimes rye, Fourth Edition |title=shibboleth |url=http://www.tfd.com/shibboleth}} {{cite web|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary |title=shibboleth |url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/shibboleth}} (this latter meaning is not in use in [[Modern Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Isaiah 27:12.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern use derives from an account in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraimites]], whose dialect used a differently sounding first consonant. The difference concerns the Hebrew letter ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'', which is now pronounced as {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (as in '''''[[voiceless postalveolar fricative|sh]]'''oe'').&lt;ref name="HessBlock2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Hess|author2=Daniel I. Block|author3=Dale W. Manor|title=Joshua, Judges, and Ruth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1gzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT352|date=12 January 2016|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-52759-6|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recorded in the [[Book of Judges]], chapter 12, after the inhabitants of [[Gilead]] inflicted a military defeat upon the invading tribe of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] (around 1370–1070 BCE), the surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the River Jordan back into their home territory and the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them.  To identify and kill these Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word ''shibboleth''. The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like ''sibboleth''.&lt;ref name="HessBlock2016" /&gt;  In the [[King James Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Judges|12:5-6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdote appears thus (with the word already in its current English spelling):
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;&lt;br /&gt;Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern use==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}

In numerous cases of [[Group conflict|conflict between groups]] speaking different languages or dialects, one side used shibboleths in a way similar to the above-mentioned Biblical use, i.e., to discover hiding members of the opposing group. Modern researchers use the term "shibboleth" for all such uses, whether or not the people involved were using it themselves.

In modern [[American English]], a shibboleth also has a wider meaning, referring to any "in-group" word or phrase that can distinguish members of a group from outsiders – even when not used by a hostile other group. It is also sometimes used in a broader sense to mean [[jargon]], the proper use of which identifies speakers as members of a particular group or subculture.

The term shibboleth can also be extended, as in the discipline of [[semiotics]], to describe non-linguistic elements of culture such as diet, fashion and cultural values.

Cultural [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s and shared experience can also be shibboleths of a sort. For example, people about the same age who are from the same nation tend to have [[Collective memory|the same memories]] of popular songs, television shows, and events from their formative years. [[One-hit wonder]]s prove particularly distinctive. Much the same is true of alumni of a particular school, veterans of military service, and other groups. Discussing such memories is a common way of [[Human bonding|bonding]]. [[In-joke]]s can be a similar type of shared-experience shibboleth.

By analogy with the biblical account, in information technology a [[shibboleth (Shibboleth Consortium)|shibboleth]] is a community-wide password that enables a member of that community to access an online resource without revealing her individual identity.  The origin server can vouch for the identity of the individual user without giving the target server any further identifying information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Technically Speaking: Can You Say "Shibboleth"?|last=Dorman|first=David|date=October 2002|volume=33|issue=9|journal=American Libraries|pages=86–7|publisher=American Library Association|jstor=25648483}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the individual user does not know the password that is actually employed – it is generated internally by the origin server – and so cannot betray it to outsiders.

Yet another more pejorative usage involves underlining the fact that the original meaning of a symbol has in effect been lost and that the symbol now serves merely to identify allegiance, being described as "nothing more than a shibboleth".

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-laureate [[economics|economist]] [[Paul Samuelson]] applied the term "shibboleth" in works including ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' to an idea for which "the means becomes the end, and the letter of the law takes precedence over the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Resources, Uncertainty, and General Equilibrium Systems: Essays in Memory of Rafael Lusky |location= New York |publisher=Academic Press |year= 1977 |pages=175–195 |chapter=When it is ethically optimal to allocate money income in stipulated fractional shares |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UKeJEc46R9AC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=samuelson%20shibboleth%20definition&amp;pg=PR5-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |isbn=978-0-12-106150-0 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuelson admitted that "shibboleth" is an imperfect term for this phenomenon, and sometimes used "[[fetish (disambiguation)|fetish]]" as a synonym, though he complained that the latter "has too pejorative a ring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |date=February 1956 |title=Social Indifference Curves |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQQFn8Vk470C&amp;lpg=PA1083&amp;dq=paul%20samuelson%20shibboleth&amp;pg=PA1073#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |accessdate=2011-02-03 |doi=10.2307/1884510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Password for life |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/10/05/art12.asp |first=Anurada |last=Malalasekara |website=Daily News |publisher=Daily News (Sri Lankan State Newspaper) |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Main|List of shibboleths}}
Shibboleths have been used by different subcultures throughout the world at different times.  Regional differences, level of expertise, and computer coding techniques are several forms that shibboleths have taken.

The legend goes that before the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs|Guldensporenslag (Battle of the Golden Spurs)]] in May 1302, the Flemish slaughtered every Frenchman they could find in the city of [[Bruges]], an act known as the ''[[Bruges Matins (history)|Brugse Metten]]''.&lt;ref name="Devries"&gt;Devries, Kelly. ''Infantry Warfare in the Early 14th Century.'' N.p.: Boydell, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They identified Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce the Flemish phrase ''{{lang|nl|schilt ende vriend}}'' (shield and friend), or possibly ''{{lang|nl|'s Gilden vriend}}'' (friend of the Guilds). However, many Medieval Flemish dialects did not contain the cluster ''sch-'' either (even today's [[Kortrijk]] dialect has ''sk-''), and Medieval French rolled the r just as Flemish did.&lt;ref name=liberman&gt;Although the website [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003344.html Language Log: Born on the 11th of July] says that the {{IPA|/sχ/}} cluster in ''schild'' that makes it difficult for French-speakers to pronounce had not yet developed in the 14th century, the phrase "{{lang|fr|scilt en vrient}}" is referenced in primary sources such as the Chronique of [[Gilles Li Muisis]] as distinguishing French from Flemish.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|thumb|right|''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'']]

''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'' ({{audio|Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|example}}) means "Butter, rye bread and green cheese, whoever cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian" was used by the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] during a [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian rebellion]] (1515–1523). Ships whose crew could not pronounce this properly were usually plundered and soldiers who could not were beheaded by Donia himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunseradiel.nl/index.php?simaction=content&amp;pagid=289&amp;mediumid=1|publisher=Gemeente Wûnseradiel|title=Greate Pier fan Wûnseradiel|language=Western Frisian|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch used the name of the seaside town of [[Scheveningen]] as a shibboleth to tell Germans from the Dutch ("Sch" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is analyzed as the letter "[[s]]" and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] "ch", producing the [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|[sx]}}, while in [[German language|German]] it is analyzed as the [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] "[[sch (trigraph)|sch]]," pronounced {{IPAblink|ʃ}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://column.emea.nl/?p=3163 "Zonder ons erbij te betrekken"] Retrieved on 23 december 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corstius, H.

In Sardinia 28 April is celebrated as ''sa dii de s'aciappa'' (the day of pursuit and capture) or [[Sa die de sa Sardigna]] (Sardinia's Day). On that date in 1794 people in Cagliari chased suspected officers of the ruling Piedmontese king and asked them to say ''nara cixidi'' (Sardinian for ‘chickpea’), which the Piedmontese could not pronounce. Some 514 officers were thus identified and sent back to the mainland.

In October 1937 the Spanish word for parsley, ''perejil'', was used as a shibboleth to identify Haitian immigrants living along the border in the Dominican Republic. The president of the Dominican Republic, [[Rafael Trujillo]], ordered the execution of these people. It is alleged that between 20,000 and 30,000 individuals were murdered within a few days in the [[Parsley Massacre]], although more recent scholarship and the lack of evidence such as mass graves puts the actual total as low as 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vega|first=Bernardo|title=La matanza de 1937|url=http://www.lalupa.com.do/2012/10/la-matanza-de-1937/|work=La lupa sin trabas|accessdate=7 January 2014|language=Spanish|date=10 October 2012|quote=Durante los meses de octubre y diciembre de 1937, fuentes haitianas, norteamericanas e inglesas ubicadas en Haití dieron cifras que oscilaron entre 1,000 y 12,168|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001432/http://www.lalupa.com.do/2012/10/la-matanza-de-1937/|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Black July]]  riots of Sri Lanka in 1983 many Tamils were massacred by Sinhalese youths. In many cases these massacres took the form of boarding buses and getting the passengers to pronounce words that had hard BAs at the start of the word (like ''Baldiya'' – bucket) and executing the people who found it difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyndman|first1=Patricia|title=Senior Lecturer in Law, University of New South Wales|url=http://blackjuly.info/quotestext.html|publisher=Lawasia Human Rights Standing Committee Report -Democracy in Peril, June 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Tim|title=INSIDER, OUTSIDER: LANGUAGE TESTS AS WEAPONS IN INTERGROUP CONFLICT|journal=Invited address, Language Assessment Ethics Conference, Pasadena, CA|date=May 17, 2002|url=https://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=0bbf678f-9672-48c0-bb76-79bd9912b45c|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320191328/http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=0bbf678f-9672-48c0-bb76-79bd9912b45c|archivedate=March 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport to life|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/10/05/art12.asp|website=Daily News|publisher=Daily News (Sri Lanka's state broadsheet)|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], some United States soldiers in the Pacific theater used the word ''[[Wiktionary:lollapalooza|lollapalooza]]'' as a shibboleth to [[Countersign (military)|challenge]] unidentified persons, on the premise that Japanese people [[Perception of /r/ and /l/ by the Japanese|often pronounce the letter L as R]] or confuse Rs with Ls; the word is also an American colloquialism that even a foreign person fairly well-versed in American English would probably mispronounce or be unfamiliar with.&lt;ref&gt;US Army &amp; Navy, 1942. [http://www.ep.tc/howtospotajap/howto06.html HOW TO SPOT A JAP Educational Comic Strip], (from US govt's POCKET GUIDE TO CHINA, 1st edition). Retrieved 10-10-2007&lt;/ref&gt; In Oliver Gramling's ''Free Men are Fighting: The Story of World War II'' (1942) the author notes that, in the war, Japanese spies would often approach checkpoints posing as American or [[Filipino people|Filipino]] military personnel. A shibboleth such as "lollapalooza" would be used by the sentry, who, if the first two syllables come back as ''rorra,'' would "open fire without waiting to hear the remainder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gramling|first1=Oliver|title=Free Men are Fighting: The Story of World War II|date=1942|publisher=Farrar and Rinehart, Inc|page=315|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=ljfPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=lollapalooza|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachheads in 1944, hand-to-hand fighting occurred throughout the [[hedgerows]] and thick undergrowth of the Norman countryside. British and American troops were told to use the word "Thunderer" as a countersign through the thick foliage. Given the number of syllables and the leading "th" sound, it was believed that the word would invariably be mispronounced by native German speakers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

During [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, use of the name [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute|Derry or Londonderry]] for the province's second-largest city was often taken as an indication of the speaker's political stance, and as such frequently implied more than simply naming the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4887352.stm |title=Court to rule on city name |work=BBC News |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation of the letter [[H]] is a related shibboleth, with Catholics and Protestants often [[H#Name in English|pronouncing the letter differently]].
 
In Australia and New Zealand, the words "fish and chips" are often used to highlight the difference in each country's short-i vowel sound [ɪ] and asking someone to say the phrase can identify which country they are from. Australian English has a higher forward sound [i], close to the y in happy and city, while New Zealand English has a lower backward sound [ɘ], a slightly higher version of the a in about and comma. Thus, New Zealanders hear Australians say "feesh and cheeps," while Australians hear New Zealanders say "fush and chups."

==Furtive shibboleths==
A "furtive shibboleth" is a type of a shibboleth which identifies individuals as being part of a group not based on their ability to pronounce one or more words, but on their ability to recognize a seemingly-innocuous phrase as a secret message. For example, members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] sometimes refer to themselves as "a friend of Bill W.", which is a reference to AA's founder, [[Bill W.|William Griffith Wilson]]. To the unindoctrinated, this would seem like a casual – if off-topic – remark, but other AA members would understand its meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Similarly, during [[World War II]], a homosexual [[United States Navy|US sailor]] might call himself a "[[friend of Dorothy]]", a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of a stereotypical affinity for [[Judy Garland]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. This code was so effective that even after the higher command learned that the phrase was a way for gay sailors to identify each other, they failed to recognize its origins, and purportedly invested a great deal of time and effort into hunting down this "Dorothy," whom they assumed to be an actual woman who was somehow assisting and organizing homosexual servicemen.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==In art==
Colombian conceptual artist [[Doris Salcedo]] created a work titled ''[[Shibboleth (artwork)|Shibboleth]]'' at [[Tate Modern]], London, in 2007–2008. The piece consisted of a 548-foot-long crack that bisected the floor of the Tate's lobby space.

Salcedo said of the work:
{{quote|It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe. For example, the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Alberge, Dalya |title= Welcome to Tate Modern's floor show – it's 548 foot long and is called Shibboleth |work=The Times |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In fiction==
In an episode of ''[[The West Wing]]'' titled "[[Shibboleth (The West Wing)|Shibboleth]]", [[Josiah Bartlet|President Bartlet]] discusses the meaning of the word at length. His advisors believe it is a catch phrase or cliche, after which Bartlet reminds them of its earlier biblical significance. He later becomes certain that a group of Chinese religious asylum seekers are indeed Christian when their representative uses the word to refer to his faith during a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prime-Time Presidency: The West Wing and U.

SDO is conceptualized as a measure of individual differences in levels of group-based discrimination; that is, it is a measure of an individual's preference for [[hierarchy]] within any [[social system]] and the domination over lower-status groups. It is a predisposition toward anti-[[egalitarianism]] within and between groups. The concept of SDO as a measurable individual difference is a product of [[social dominance theory]].

Individuals who score high in SDO desire to maintain and, in many cases, increase the differences between [[social status]]es of different groups, as well as individual group members. Typically, they are dominant, driven, tough, and seekers of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. People high in SDO also prefer hierarchical group orientations.

==Social dominance theory==

SDO was first proposed by Jim Sidanius and Felicia Pratto as part of their [[social dominance theory]] (SDT).  SDO is the key measurable component of SDT that is specific to it.

SDT begins with the empirical observation that surplus-producing social systems have a threefold group-based hierarchy structure: age-based, gender-based and "arbitrary set-based", which can include race, class, sexual orientation, caste, ethnicity, religious affiliation, etc. Age-based hierarchies invariably give more power to adults and middle-age people than children and younger adults, and gender-based hierarchies invariably grant more power to one [[gender]] over others, but arbitrary-set hierarchies—though quite resilient—are truly arbitrary.

SDT is based on three primary assumptions:{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
#While age- and gender-based hierarchies will tend to exist within all social systems, arbitrary-set systems of social hierarchy will invariably emerge within social systems producing sustainable economic surpluses.
#Most forms of group conflict and oppression (e.g., racism, homophobia, ethnocentrism, sexism, classism, regionalism) can be regarded as different manifestations of the same basic human predisposition to form group-based hierarchies.
#Human social systems are subject to the counterbalancing influences of hierarchy-enhancing (HE) forces, producing and maintaining ever higher levels of group-based social inequality, and hierarchy-attenuating (HA) forces, producing greater levels of group-based social equality.

SDO is the individual attitudinal aspect of SDT.  It is influenced by group status, socialization, and temperament.  In turn, it influences support for HE and HA "legitimating myths", defined as "values, attitudes, beliefs, causal attributions and ideologies" that in turn justify social institutions and practices that either enhance or attenuate group hierarchy.

==Early development==
While the correlation of gender with SDO scores has been empirically measured and confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1997.tb01118.x |title=The gender gap: Differences in political attitudes and social dominance orientation |year=1997 |last1=Pratto |first1=Felicia |last2=Stallworth |first2=Lisa M. |last3=Sidanius |first3=Jim |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=36 |pages=49–68 |pmid=9114484}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of temperament and socialization is less clear. Duckitt has suggested a model of attitude development for SDO, suggesting that unaffectionate socialisation in childhood causes a tough-minded attitude.  According to Duckitt's model, people high in tough-minded personality are predisposed to view the world as a competitive place in which resource competition is [[zero-sum]]. A desire to compete, which fits with social dominance orientation, influences in-group and outside-group attitudes. People high in SDO also believe that hierarchies are present in all aspects of society and are more likely to agree with statements such as "It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom". In turn, SDO predicts stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Scale==

SDO has been measured by a series of scales that have been refined over time, all of which contain a balance of pro- and contra-trait statements or phrases. A 7-point [[Likert scale]] is used for each item; participants rate their agreement or disagreement with the statements from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).  Most of the research was conducted with the SDO-5 (a 14-point scale) and SDO-6. The SDO-7 scale is the most recent scale measuring social dominance orientation, which embeds two sub-dimensions: dominance (SDO-D) and anti-egalitarianism (SDO-E).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Arnold K.|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Kteily|first3=Nour|last4=Sheehy-Skeffington|first4=Jennifer|last5=Pratto|first5=Felicia|last6=Henkel|first6=Kristin E.|last7=Foels|first7=Rob|last8=Stewart|first8=Andrew L.|title=The nature of social dominance orientation: Theorizing and measuring preferences for intergroup inequality using the new SDO₇ scale.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=109|issue=6|pages=1003–1028|doi=10.1037/pspi0000033|pmid=26479362|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the construct==
Rubin and Hewstone (2004)&lt;ref name=Rubin2004&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00400.x |title=Social Identity, System Justification, and Social Dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al |year=2004 |last1=Rubin |first1=Mark |last2=Hewstone |first2=Miles |journal=Political Psychology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=823–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that social dominance research has changed its focus dramatically over the years, and these changes have been reflected in different versions of the social dominance orientation construct. Social dominance orientation was originally defined as "the degree to which individuals desire social dominance and superiority for themselves and their primordial groups over other groups" (p.&amp;nbsp;209).&lt;ref name=Sidanius1993&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sidanius |first1=James |chapter=The psychology of group conflict and the dynamics of oppression: A social dominance perspective |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Io8pP8ihLg4C&amp;pg=PA183 |editor1-last=Iyengar |editor1-first=Shanto |editor2-last=McGuire |editor2-first=William James |year=1993 |title=Explorations in political psychology.

==Group-based and individual dominance==

Robert Altemeyer said that people with a high SDO want more power (agreeing with items such as "''Winning is more important than how you play the game''") and are more [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] (manipulative and amoral, agreeing with items such as "''There really is no such thing as'' 'right and wrong' and  ''It all boils down to what you can get away with''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf |title=The Authoritarians |page=166 |last=Altemeyer |first=Robert |authorlink=Bob Altemeyer |year=2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=20 March 2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These observations are at odds with conceptualisations of SDO as a group-based phenomenon, suggesting that the SDO reflects interpersonal dominance, not only group-based dominance. This is supported by Sidanius and Pratto's own evidence that high-SDO individuals tend to gravitate toward hierarchy-enhancing jobs and institutions, such as law enforcement, that are themselves hierarchically structured vis-a-vis individuals within them.

==Relations with other personality traits==

===Connection with right wing authoritarianism===

SDO correlates weakly with [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] ≈ .18).&lt;ref name=pratto /&gt; Both predict attitudes, such as [[sexist]], [[racist]], and [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] attitudes.&lt;ref name=Sibley2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00531.x |title=Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism: Additive and Interactive Effects |year=2006 |last1=Sibley |first1=Chris G. |last2=Robertson |first2=Andrew |last3=Wilson |first3=Marc S. |journal=Political Psychology |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=755–68 |jstor=3792537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two contribute to different forms of prejudice; SDO correlates to higher prejudice against subordinate and disadvantaged groups, RWA correlates to higher prejudice against threatening groups, while both are associated with increases in prejudice for "dissident" groups.&lt;ref name=crawford2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00990.x |title=Right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation differentially predict biased evaluations of media reports |year=2013 |last1=Crawford |first1=Jarret T. |last2=Jussim |first2=Lee |last3=Cain |first3=Thomas R. |last4=Cohen |first4=Florette |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=43 |pages=163–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.614 |title=Right wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice |year=2007 |last1=Duckitt |first1=John |last2=Sibley |first2=Chris G. |journal=European Journal of Personality |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=113–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Asbrock2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.746 |title=Right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice: A longitudinal test |year=2009 |last1=Asbrock |first1=Frank |last2=Sibley |first2=Chris G. |last3=Duckitt |first3=John |journal=European Journal of Personality |pages=324–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDO and RWA contribute to [[prejudice]] in an additive rather than interactive way (the interaction{{clarify|date=May 2012}} of SDO and RWA accounted, in one study, for an average of less than .001% variance in addition to their linear combination), that is the association between SDO and prejudice is similar regardless of a person's level of RWA, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Sibley2006/&gt; Crawford et al. (2013) found that RWA and SDO differentially predicted interpretations of media reports about socially threatening (for example, gays and lesbians) and disadvantaged groups (for example, African Americans), respectively. Subjects with high SDO, but not RWA, scores reacted positively to articles and authors that opposed [[affirmative action]], and negatively to pro-affirmative-action article content. Moreover, RWA, but not SDO, predicted subjects' evaluations of same-sex relationships, such that high-RWA individuals favored anti-same-sex relationships article content and low-RWA individuals favorably rated pro-same-sex relationships content.&lt;ref name=crawford2013/&gt;

===Correlation with Big Five personality traits===

Studies on the relationship of SDO with the higher order [[Big Five personality traits]] have associated high SDO with lower [[openness to experience]] and lower [[agreeableness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/per.526|last1=Ekehammar|first1=Bo|last2=Akrami|first2=Nazar|last3=Gylje|first3=Magnus|last4=Zakrisson|first4=Ingrid|title=What matters most to prejudice: Big Five personality, Social Dominance Orientation, or Right-Wing Authoritarianism?|journal=European Journal of Personality|volume=18|issue=6|pages=463–482|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meta-analysis|Meta-analytic]] aggregation of these studies indicates that the association with low Agreeableness is more robust than the link to Openness to experience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation|journal = Journal of Individual Differences|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 1614-0001|pages = 117–126|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1027/1614-0001.27.3.117|first = Nazar|last = Akrami|first2 = Bo|last2 = Ekehammar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals low in Agreeableness are more inclined to report being motivated by self-interest and self-indulgence''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Big-Five personality prospectively predicts Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911003825|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2012-01-01|pages = 3–8|volume = 52|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.009|first = Ryan|last = Perry|first2 = Chris G.|last2 = Sibley}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to be more self-centred and are more '[[Psychoticism|tough-minded]]' compared to those who are high on Agreeableness, leading them to perceive the world to be a highly-competitive place, where the way to success is through power and dominance – all of which predict SDO.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Personality and Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Review|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/248|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18641385|pages = 248–279|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308319226|first = Chris G.|last = Sibley|first2 = John|last2 = Duckitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low Openness, by contrast, aligns more strongly with RWA; thinking in clear and straightforward moral codes that dictate how society as a system should function. Being low in Openness prompts the individual to value security, stability and control: fundamental elements of RWA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Facet-level associations ====

In case of SDO all five facets of Agreeableness significantly correlate (negatively), even after controlling for RWA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 'Tough-mindedness' (opposite of tender-mindedness' facet) is the strongest predictor of SDO. After the effect of SDO is controlled for only one facet of agreeableness is predictive of RWA. {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} Facets also distinguish SDO from RWA, with  'Dominators' (individuals high on SDO), but not 'authoritarians' (individuals who score high on RWA), having been found to be lower in dutifulness, morality, sympathy and co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation and personality: an analysis using the IPIP measure|journal = European Journal of Personality|date = 2001-01-01|issn = 1099-0984|pages = 49–56|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/per.389|first = Patrick C. L.|last = Heaven|first2 = Sandra|last2 = Bucci}}&lt;/ref&gt; RWA is also associated with religiosity, conservativism, righteousness, and, to some extent, a conscientious moral code, which distinguishes RWA from SDO.

=== Empathy ===
SDO is inversely related to [[empathy]]. Facets of Agreeableness that are linked to [[altruism]], sympathy and compassion are the
strongest predictors of SDO.&lt;ref name="pratto" /&gt; SDO has been suggested to have a link with callous affect (which is to be found on the [[psychopathy]] sub-scale), the 'polar opposite' of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of "dark personalities" (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy), Big Five personality factors, and ideology in explaining prejudice|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656609000658|journal = Journal of Research in Personality|date = 2009-08-01|pages = 686–690|volume = 43|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2009.02.005|first = Gordon|last = Hodson|first2 = Sarah M.|last2 = Hogg|first3 = Cara C.|last3 = MacInnis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between SDO and ''(lack of)'' empathy has been found to be reciprocal &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = You're Inferior and Not Worth Our Concern: The Interface Between Empathy and Social Dominance Orientation|journal = Journal of Personality|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 1467-6494|pages = 313–323|volume = 81|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/jopy.12008|pmid = 23072294|first = Jim|last = Sidanius|first2 = Nour|last2 = Kteily|first3 = Jennifer|last3 = Sheehy-Skeffington|first4 = Arnold K.|last4 = Ho|first5 = Chris|last5 = Sibley|first6 = Bart|last6 = Duriez}}&lt;/ref&gt; – with equivocal findings. Some studies show that empathy significantly impacts SDO,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structural Modeling of Generalized Prejudice|journal = Journal of Individual Differences|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1614-0001|pages = 10–17|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1027/1614-0001.28.1.10|first = Martin|last = Bäckström|first2 = Fredrik|last2 = Björklund}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other research suggest the opposite effect is more robust; that SDO predicts empathy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The latter showcases how powerful of a predictor SDO may be, not only affecting individual's certain behaviours, but potentially influencing upstream the
proneness to those behaviours. It also suggests, that those scoring high on SDO proactively avoid scenarios that could prompt
them to be more empathetic or tender-minded. This avoidance decreases concern for other's welfare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Empathy indirectly affects generalized [[prejudice]] through its negative relationship with SDO.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It also
has a direct effect on generalized prejudice, as lack of empathy makes one unable to put oneself in the other person's shoes, which predicts prejudice and antidemocratic views.

==Correlation with conservative political views==

Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence that a high social dominance orientation is strongly correlated with [[conservatism|conservative]] political views, and opposition to programs and policies that aim to promote equality (such as [[affirmative action]], laws advocating [[Civil rights|equal rights]] for [[homosexuals]], women in combat, etc.).&lt;ref name=pratto&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741 |title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes |year=1994 |last1=Pratto |first1=Felicia |last2=Sidanius |first2=Jim |last3=Stallworth |first3=Lisa M. |last4=Malle |first4=Bertram F. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=741–63|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate within the psychology community on what the relation is between SDO and racism/sexism. One explanation suggests that opposition to programs that promote equality need not be based on racism or sexism but on a "principled conservatism",&lt;ref name=sidanius96&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |title=Racism, conservatism, Affirmative Action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |year=1996 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=476–90|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.1114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a "concern for [[Equality of opportunity|equity]], [[Color blindness (race)|color-blindness]], and genuine conservative values".

Some principled-conservatism theorists have suggested that racism and conservatism are independent, and only very weakly correlated among the highly educated, who truly understand the concepts of conservative values and attitudes. In an effort to examine the relationship between education, SDO, and racism, Sidanius and his colleagues&lt;ref name=sidanius96 /&gt; asked approximately 4,600 Euro-Americans to complete a survey in which they were asked about their political and social attitudes, and their social dominance orientation was assessed. "These findings contradict much of the case for the principled conservatism hypothesis, which maintains that political values that are largely devoid of racism, especially among highly educated people."  Contrary to what these theorists would predict, correlations among SDO, political conservatism, and racism were strongest among the most educated, and weakest among the least educated. Sidanius and his colleagues hypothesized&lt;ref name=sidanius96 /&gt; this was because the most educated conservatives tend to be more invested in the hierarchical structure of society and in maintaining the inequality of the [[status quo]] in society in order to safeguard their status.

==Culture==
SDO is typically measured as an individual personality construct.  However, cultural forms of SDO have been discovered on the macro level of society.&lt;ref name="Fischer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00884.x |title=Cultural and Institutional Determinants of Social Dominance Orientation: A Cross-Cultural Meta-Analysis of 27 Societies |year=2012 |last1=Fischer |first1=Ronald |last2=Hanke |first2=Katja |last3=Sibley |first3=Chris G. |journal=Political Psychology |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=437–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping can occur at various levels of institutions in society, such as transnational corporations, government agencies, schools and criminal justice systems. The basis of this theory of societal level SDO is rooted in [[evolutionary psychology]], which states that humans have an evolved predisposition to express social dominance that is heightened under certain social conditions (such as group status) and is also mediated by factors such as individual personality and temperament. Democratic societies are lower in SDO measures&lt;ref name="Fischer 2012"/&gt; The more that a society encourages citizens to cooperate with others and feel concern for the welfare of others, the lower the SDO in that culture. High levels of national income and empowerment of women are also associated with low national SDO, whereas more traditional societies with lower income, male domination and more closed institutional systems are associated with a higher SDO. Individuals who are socialized within these traditional societies are more likely to internalize gender hierarchies and are less likely to challenge them.

==Biology and sexual differences==
The biology of SDO is unknown.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Plenty of evidence suggests that men tend to score higher on SDO than women, and this is true across different countries,
cultures, age-groups, classes, religions and educational levels.&lt;ref name="Sidanius1994" /&gt; Researchers argue for an
'invariance' in the difference between men and women's SDO; suggesting that even if all other factors were to be controlled for, the difference between men and women's SDO would still remain – this however in some cases is disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inverse gender gap in Germany: Social dominance orientation among men and women|journal = [[International Journal of Psychology]] |date = 2011-02-01|issn = 1464-066X|pages = 33–45|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00207594.2010.491121|pmid = 22044131|first = Beate|last = Küpper|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Zick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary and biological perspective SDO facilitates men to be successful in their reproductive strategy through
achieving social power and control over other males and becoming desired mating partners for the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Political Psychology of Reproductive Strategies|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/11/1/57|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 11228844|pages = 57–62|volume = 11|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00215|first = Felicia|last = Pratto|first2 = Peter|last2 = Hegarty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are observed to be more socially hierarchical, as indicated by speaking time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2002.tb00814.x |title=Dominance as Expressed and Inferred Through Speaking Time |year=2002 |last1=Mast |first1=Marianne Schmid |journal=Human Communication Research |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=420–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yielding to interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167202281003 |title=Female Dominance Hierarchies: Are They Any Different from Males'? |year=2002 |last1=Mast |first1=M. S. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=28 |pages=29–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting that males tend to have higher SDO scores than females, Sidanius and Pratto speculate that SDO may be influenced by hormones that differ between the sexes, namely [[androgen]]s, primarily [[testosterone]].  Male levels of testosterone are much higher than that of females.

Taking a socio-cultural perspective, it is argued that the gap between women and men in SDO is dependent upon [[Norm (social)|societal norms]] prescribing different expectations for [[gender role]]s of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Gaps in Sociopolitical Attitudes: A Social Psychological Analysis.|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 796–816|volume = 87|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.796|first = Alice H.|last = Eagly|first2 = Amanda B.|last2 = Diekman|first3 = Mary C.|last3 = Johannesen-Schmidt|first4 = Anne M.|last4 = Koenig|pmid=15598107|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are expected to be dominant and assertive, whereas women are supposed to be submissive and tender.

Differences between male and female attributional cognitive complexity is suggested contribute to the gender gap in SDO.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Differences in Social Dominance Orientation: The Role of Cognitive Complexity|journal = Sex Roles|date = 2010-04-15|issn = 0360-0025|pages = 684–692|volume = 62|issue = 9–10|doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9775-5|first = Rob|last = Foels|first2 = Landon D.|last2 = Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have been found to be more attributionally complex compared to men; they use more contextual information and evaluate social information more precisely. It is proposed that lower social status prompts higher cognitive complexity in order to compensate for the lack of control in that social situation by processing it more attentively and evaluating it more in depth. The difference in cognitive complexity between high and low status individuals could contribute to the differences between male and female SDO.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''{{lang|la|Status quo}}''' is a [[list of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] meaning the existing [[state of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]], particularly with regard to social or political issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[:googledefine:status quo|"Status Quo" - Google Definitions]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sociology|sociological]] sense, it generally applies to maintain or change existing social structure and values.&lt;ref name=gloss&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dr. C. Michael Botterweck|title=Glossary for Sociology 100|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/mbotterweck/glossary.html|website=academics.triton.edu|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to policy debate, the status quo refers to how conditions are at the time and how the affirmative team can solve these conditions for example "The countries are now trying to maintain a status quo with regards to their nuclear arsenal which will help them if the situation gets any worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Status quo|url=http://www.theidioms.com/status-quo}}''TheIdioms.com - Online Idioms Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the nominal form of the prepositional [[Latin]] phrase "{{lang|la|in statu quo}}" – literally "in the state in which", which itself is a shortening of the original phrase ''{{lang|la|[[status quo ante bellum|in statu quo res erant ante bellum]]}}'', meaning "in the state in which things were before the war". To maintain the status quo is to keep the things the way they presently are. The related phrase ''{{lang|la|[[status quo ante (disambiguation)|status quo ante]]}}'', literally "the state in which before",&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web|title=Status Quo Definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/status+quo|website=dictionary.reference.com|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; means "the state of affairs that existed previously".&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;

== Political usage ==

[[social movement|Social movements]] are an example of times when the status quo might be challenged. In these instances ''status quo'' refers to the current state of affairs around a particular issue, or perhaps the current culture or social climate of an entire [[society]] or [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.featherpicking.com/The%20Social%20Climate.htm|title=The Social Climate|accessdate=2009-03-11|work=The Optimal Environment: Part Four|publisher=www.featherpicking.com|last=Clark|first=Pamela|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status quo is generally perceived negatively by supporters of the social movement, and people who want to maintain the status quo can be seen as being resistant to progress.&lt;ref name=vocab&gt;{{cite web|title=Status Quo - Dictionary Definition|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/status%20quo|website=vocabulary.com|publisher=vocabulary.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians sometimes refer to a status quo. Often there is a policy of deliberate ambiguity, referring to the status quo rather than formalizing the status. [[Clark Kerr]] is reported to have said: "The status quo is the only [[Problem solving|solution]] that cannot be [[veto]]ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=l-w6CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;ots=eXNtHsw5ex&amp;dq=clark%20kerr%20The%20status%20quo%20is%20the%20only%20solution%20that%20cannot%20be%20vetoe&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q=clark%20kerr%20The%20status%20quo%20is%20the%20only%20solution%20that%20cannot%20be%20vetoe&amp;f=false|title=Momentum: The Responsibility Paradigm and Virtuous Cycles of Change in Colleges and Universities|last=Seymour|first=Daniel|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781475821048|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Big Mo''' ("Big Momentum") is [[behavioral momentum]] that operates on a large scale.  The concept originally applied to sporting events in the 1960s in the United States, as momentum appeared to have an effect on a team's performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science20.com/sports_are_80_percent_mental/the_big_mo_psychological_momentum_in_sports Psychological momentum in sports]. See also Michael Kent, ''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science and Medicine'', Oxford University Press, 3rd edn, 2006; [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/crystal-palace-burnley-0-warnock-takes-big-mo-to-playoffs-821173.html Big Mo in Sports], ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; Successful teams were said to have "The Big Mo" on their side.  This has since extended situations in which momentum is a driving factor, such as during political campaigns, social upheavals, economic cycles, and financial bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-big-mo-how-senator-obama-gained-the-momentum-769179.html The Big Mo: How senator Obama gained the momentum]; See also Paul Kedrosky, The First Disaster of the Internet Age, ''Newsweek'', 27 October 2008. A dictionary definition is available at: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Big+Mo&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern history==
The term was used by [[George H. W. Bush]] during his quest for the Republican nomination to run for President in 1980. After he won the Iowa [[caucus]]es, and was facing further contests, Bush Senior said, "Now they will be after me, howling and yowling at my heels. What we will have is momentum. We will look forward to Big Mo being on our side, as they say in athletics."&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, Michael R. PBS. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/bush.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Bush lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] who went on to become the 40th President of the United States.

==Impact==
Research conducted in 2005, by Christopher Hull at [[Georgetown University]], US, suggested that from 1980 to 2000, "Big Mo" (large scale momentum) had amplified key events in US presidential races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/4/5/p85453_index.html?hpsessid=92842ec13668dd0db90c44e5c128aa9d The Big Mo from 1980 to 2004: Is Technological 'e-mentum' Amplifying Key Events in Presidential Races?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|right|200px|thumb|A [[Newton's cradle]] demonstrates momentum effect.]]
In 2007, three researchers from the London Business School, Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, observed in their paper "108 Years of Momentum Profits" that "momentum appears to have an inordinate and unexplained impact on the behaviour of investment markets that contradicts the efficient market theory". One of the researchers, Dr Paul Marsh said, "We remain puzzled (by these findings) and we are not the only ones; most academics are vaguely embarrassed by this."&lt;ref&gt;Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh &amp; Mike Staunton. Steve Johnson, Ignore Momentum at Your Peril, FT.com, viewed 20 September 2010; Research on the influence of momentum on investment markets, 108 Years of Momentum Profits. Research conducted on behalf of ABN Amro by the London Business School, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the British election in May 2010, James Forsyth, the political editor of ''The Spectator'' magazine, wrote, "The Big Mo is with the [[Tories]]. In a campaign, momentum matters. It is, for good or ill, the [[Prism (optics)|prism]] through which the media report things."&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, James. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/5887083/the-big-mo-is-with-the-tories.thtml The Big Mo is with the Tories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507090657/http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/5887083/the-big-mo-is-with-the-tories.thtml |date=2010-05-07 }}. ''The Spectator'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, an analysis conducted by [[Mark Roeder]], a former executive at the Swiss-based [[UBS Bank]], suggested that Big Mo "played a pivotal role" in the 2008–09 [[global financial crisis]]. Roeder suggested that,
{{quote|recent technological advances, such as computer-driven trading programs, together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets, has magnified the momentum effect. This effect is not limited to the financial markets. It can be felt across other aspects of society, particularly in politics, business, technology and the media where Big Mo now operates on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;The Big Mo: Why Momentum Now Rules Our World, by Mark Roeder.

In January 2011, a report in ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, titled "The Big Mo", said,
{{quote|The momentum effect drives a juggernaut through one of the tenets of finance theory, the efficient-market hypothesis... Even the high priests of efficient-market theory have acknowledged [its impact].   Well-paid fund managers have spent decades trying to find ways to beat the market. But you have to wonder why they bother devoting so much money and effort to researching the fortunes of individual companies when the momentum approach appears to be easy to exploit and has been around for a long time... The momentum effect raises a further important issue. If markets are rational, as the efficient-market hypothesis assumed, then they will allocate capital to its most productive uses. But the momentum effect suggests that an irrationality might be at work; investors could be buying shares (and commodities) just because they have risen in price. That would help explain why bubbles are created and why professional investors ended up allocating capital to dotcom companies with no earnings and business plans written on the back of a cigarette packet. Momentum can carry whole economies off track.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' magazine, special report. 6 January 2011. [http://www.economist.com/node/17851295?story_id=17851295 "The Big Mo. Why Newton Was Wrong"]. See also http://www.economist.com/node/17848665&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theoretical analysis==
The mechanism by which momentum influences human behaviour on a large scale is not known, but a number of theories exist. In 1982, a research team led by John Nevin, [[Professor Emeritus]] of Psychology at the [[University of New Hampshire]], US, together with Charlotte Mandel and Jean Atak, wrote a paper called "The Analysis of Behavioural Momentum", in which they explored why certain behaviours can become persistent over time. The team proposed that people's tendency to continue to behave in a certain way, and resist change, is dependent on the type of reinforcement they receive. The team developed a method for calculating the impact of behavioural momentum, based on the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] formula: Δ''V'' = ''f'' / ''m'', in which Δ''V'' is the change in velocity or, in behavioural terms, response rate; Velocity (''V'') refers to the response rate; mass (''m'') refers to the response strength, and force (''f'') refers to the change in the contingencies for the behaviour (i.e., environment change). The work of Nevin, Mandel and Atak has been influential in the development of social and health-care policies, such as drug rehabilitation programs, where behavioural persistence (momentum) and relapse are critical issues. &lt;ref&gt;Grace, R.C. (1994). Independence of reinforcement delay and magnitude in concurrent chains. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 63, 255–276; Grace, R.C.; Bedell, M.A. &amp; Nevin, J.A. (2002). Preference and resistance to change with constant- and variable-duration terminal links: Independence of reinforcement rate and magnitude. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 77, 233–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial theories about behavioural momentum derive from [[quantum physics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. In her book ''The Field'', author Lyn McTaggart cites experiments that show that in certain group environments that, "each member of the group becomes less highly-tuned to their own separate information and more receptive to that of other group members. In effect, they pick up someone else's information from the 'field' as if it were their own". She says this phenomenon is akin to what sports teams experience when they "enter the zone" and are influenced by momentum.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn McTaggart, ''The Field'', HarperCollins, 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|978-0-06-143518-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In World War II==
The "Big Mo" was also the nickname for the battleship ''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS Missouri]]''. This was the ship where [[Japan]] signed their surrender to the United States.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Son Also Rises''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book on the study of [[social mobility]] by the economist [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]]. It is based on historical estimates of social mobility in various countries made by Clark in collaboration with other researchers, though Clark takes pains to point out from the start the controversial conclusions he draws are his alone.

The book's title, like Clark's [[A Farewell to Alms|previous book]]'s title, is a [[pun]] on the title of an Ernest Hemingway novel - in this case, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''.

== Content ==
The book follows relatively successful and unsuccessful [[extended families]] through the centuries in England, the United States, Sweden, India, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Chile. Clark uses an innovative technique of following families by seeing whether or not rare surnames kept turning up in university enrollment records, registers of physicians, lists of members of parliament, and other similar contemporary historical registers. Clark finds that the persistence of high or low [[social status]] is greater than would be expected from the generally accepted correlations of income between parents and children, conflicting with virtually all measures of social mobility previously developed by other researchers, which Clark claims are flawed. According to Clark, social mobility proceeds at a similar rate in all of the societies and in all the periods of history studied{{Spaced ndash}}with the exceptions of social groups with higher [[endogamy]] (tendency to marry within the same group), who experience higher social persistence and therefore even lower social mobility.

The book attempts to explain the difference between Clark's estimates of social mobility rates and estimates by other researchers by noting that the effects measured by other researchers are based on only a few generations, and argues that Clarke's posited [[latent variable|hidden variable]] of inherited "underlying social competence" is swamped by chance variations in status from generation to generation - variations which Clarke says are smoothed out in his longer-term study. This can be analogised to looking at a graph to understand the trend in the [[Share price|market price of a stock]]{{Spaced ndash}}a graph of a stock price over a one-day period may show large "zigzag" price swings and no apparent order, whereas a longer-term stock price graph, particularly if smoothed, may reveal a long-term trend for the price of the stock to increase or decrease.

From his finding that ethnically homogeneous societies, such as Japan and Korea, had similar rates of social mobility to ethnically diverse societies, such as the United States, Clark infers that [[racism]] may not be a significant factor affecting social mobility. From his finding that families who had many children were able to pass down their high social status just as well as families who had few children, Clark infers that simple [[inheritance]] of wealth cannot explain the persistence of high social status. From the referenced studies on the lack of correlation between the intelligence and adult family income of adopted children and their adoptive parents, Clark infers that family environment cannot explain the transmittal of social status from one generation to the next.

Clark controversially hypothesises that the main reason for the unexpectedly high persistence of social status in families (or, put another way, the unexpectedly low degree of social mobility he finds) is that high-status people are more likely to have [[genes]] that are beneficial to them achieving high status, and are therefore more likely to pass such genes on to their children.

The book also advocates a generous [[welfare state]], on the grounds that people of lower social status are unlikely to be able to advance very far in life, contrary to the widespread [[American Dream]] [[ideology]] of "anyone can make it in America if they work hard enough", and so people's advantages in life come about mostly through accident of birth, not effort.

== Reception ==

=== Scholarly ===
Kourtellos, Marr and Tan note that Clark's main conclusion that social mobility has always been low is supported by several other papers by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Robust Determinants of Intergenerational Mobility in the Land of Opportunity|ssrn = 2504100|date = 1 October 2014|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andros|last = Kourtellos|first2 = Christa|last2 = Marr|first3 = Chih Ming|last3 = Tan|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media reception ===
Clark wrote a February 21, 2014 ''New York Times'' article: "Your Ancestors, Your Fate".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/your-fate-thank-your-ancestors/|title = Your Ancestors, Your Fate|publisher = The New York Times|accessdate = 2015-05-24|date = 21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote an article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', published a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social mobility barely exists.

A '''toast''' is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of '''honor''' or '''goodwill'''. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be "the toast of the evening", for whom someone "proposes a toast" to congratulate and for whom a third person "toasts" in agreement. The ritual forms the basis of the literary and performance genre, of which Mark Twain's "To the Babies" is a well-known example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/onstage/babies.html |title=Toast: The Babies |publisher=Etext.virginia.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toast as described here is rooted in [[Western culture]], but certain cultures outside that [[Cultural area|sphere]] have their own traditions in which consuming a drink is connected with ideas of celebration and honor. While the physical and verbal ritual of the toast may be elaborate and formal, merely raising one's glass towards someone or something and then drinking is essentially a toast as well, the message being one of goodwill towards the person or thing indicated.

==History==
According to various apocryphal stories, the custom of touching glasses evolved from concerns about poisoning. By one account, clinking glasses together would cause each drink to spill over into the others' (though there is no real evidence for such an origin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/food/rituals/clink.asp |title=Why We Clink Wine Glasses |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other stories, the word ''toast'' became associated with the custom in the 17th century, based on a custom of flavoring drinks with spiced [[toast]]. The word originally referred to the lady in whose honor the drink was proposed, her name being seen as figuratively flavoring the drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=toast |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) |publisher=Random House, Inc |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/toast |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=toast |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |year=2001 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=toast&amp;searchmode=term |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--should really cite a more authoritative source directly, but for the lack of anything better these indirect citations ought to do--&gt; The ''International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture'' says toasting "is probably a secular vestige of ancient sacrificial [[libation]]s in which a sacred liquid was offered to the gods: blood or wine in exchange for a wish, a prayer summarized in the words 'long life!' or 'to your health!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztzcZbRaKXsC&amp;dq=International+Handbook+on+Alcohol+and+Culture&amp;pg=PP1#PPA81,M1 |title=International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1995-01-01|accessdate=2012-04-16|isbn=9780313252341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toasts are generally offered at times of celebration or commemoration, including certain holidays, such as [[New Year's Eve]]. Other occasions include retirement celebrations, housewarming parties, births, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, Sandra. Protocol Matters: Cultivating Social Graces in Christian Homes and Schools. [[Canon Press]], 2007 p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed. At a [[wedding reception]], the [[Wedding ceremony participants|father of the bride]], in his role as host, regularly offers the first toast, thanking the guests for attending, offering tasteful remembrances of the bride's childhood, and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together. The [[Wedding ceremony participants|best man]] usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds. A best man's toast takes the form of a short speech (3–5 minutes) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity.&lt;ref name="weddingcongratulations"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.weddingcongratulations.org/congratulations |title=Wedding Congratulations |publisher=Wedding Congratulations |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507095100/http://www.weddingcongratulations.org/congratulations/ |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom, amongst others. The actual "toast" is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy, healthy, loving life together. The [[maid of honor]] may follow suit, appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride. The groom may offer the final toast, thanking the bride's parents for hosting the wedding, the wedding party for their participation, and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids.&lt;ref name="toastchampagne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toastchampagne.co.uk/facts/toasting.php |title=Toasting &amp;#124; |publisher=Toastchampagne.co.uk |date=1911-05-31 |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082717/http://www.toastchampagne.co.uk/facts/toasting.php |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical traditional wedding toasts include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weddings.about.com/od/theweddingparty/a/toastsamples_2.htm |title=More Samples of Wedding Toasts |publisher=Weddings.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|(to the couple)&lt;br&gt;Here's to your coffins&lt;br&gt;May they be made of hundred-year-old oaks&lt;br&gt;Which we shall plant tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;May you both live as long as you want, and never want as long as you live&lt;br&gt;May the best of your yesterdays be the worst of your tomorrows.

(to the bride)&lt;br&gt;May I see you grey&lt;br&gt;And combing your grandchildren's hair.}}

Toasts are also offered on patriotic occasions, as in the case of [[Stephen Decatur]]'s famous "Our country! In our intercourse with foreign nations may we always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong." Equally traditional are satiric verses:
{{quote|Here's to dear old Boston,&lt;br&gt;The home of the bean and the cod,&lt;br&gt;Where Lowells speak only to Cabots,&lt;br&gt;And Cabots speak only to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3585589/Home-of-the-bean-and-the-cod.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Home of the bean and the cod |date=2002-12-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806002501/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3585589/Home-of-the-bean-and-the-cod.html |archivedate=August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Norms and etiquette of toasting==
[[Image:Bride's toast.jpg|right|thumb|A bride offering a toast at a wedding]]
Toasts may be solemn, sentimental, humorous, bawdy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/bawdy_toasts/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222051/http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/bawdy_toasts/index.htm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/toasts_insulting.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222055/http://www.folklore.ms/html/recitations/short_recitations/toasts/toasts_insulting.htm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of announcing one's intention to make a toast and signalling for quiet by rapping on the wineglass, while common, is regarded by some authorities as rude.&lt;ref name="toastchampagne"/&gt; Except in very small and informal gatherings, a toast is offered standing. At a gathering, none should offer a toast to the guest of honor until the host has had the opportunity to do so. In English-speaking countries, guests may signal their approval of the toast by saying "hear hear".&lt;ref name="air force dining"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmarprotocol.com/helpfiles/air_force_dining.asp |title=Air Force Dining |publisher=Jmarprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person honored should neither stand nor drink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Goose45 |url=http://www.intowine.com/wine-toasts2.html |title=A Guide To Toasting |publisher=Into Wine |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the toast should rise to thank the one who has offered the toast and take a drink, perhaps but not necessarily offering a toast in turn. As toasts may occur in long series, experienced attendees often make sure to leave enough wine in the glass to allow participation in numerous toasts.&lt;ref name="hmsrichmond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmsrichmond.org/toast.htm |title=Royal Navy Toast |publisher=Hmsrichmond.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting one's glass down before the toast is complete, or simply holding one's glass without drinking is widely regarded as impolite, suggesting that one does not share the benevolent sentiments expressed in the toast, nor the unity and fellowship implicit in toasting itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkthedj.com/wedding/wedding_traditions_history.php |title=Wedding Tradition History, Customs, Etiquette |publisher=Bkthedj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the non-drinker is counseled not to refuse to allow wine to be poured for a toast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/pct/Test%20Your%20Business%20Etiquette.doc |title=Test Your Business Etiquette |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052513/http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/pct/Test%20Your%20Business%20Etiquette.doc |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverting the glass is especially discouraged.&lt;ref name="Sih98"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://kansascity.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1998/02/02/smallb2.html |first=Melinda |last=Sih |title=Minding manners at dinner serves you well in business |date=1998-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toasting traditionally involves [[alcoholic beverage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web |url=http://www.epicweddingphoto.com/toasting-traditions |title=Can you toast with non-alcoholic drinks? |date=April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Champagne]] (or at least some variety of [[sparkling wine]]) is regarded as especially festive and is widely associated with [[New Year's Eve]] and other celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert J Douglas |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7633/1281 |title=Champagne: the safer choice for celebrations |publisher=BMJ |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people nowadays substitute sparkling fruit juice (often packaged in champagne-style bottles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnatisparklingjuices.com/ |title=Juice - Sparkling Juice - Meier's Wine Cellars Inc - Cincinnati - Ohio |location=39.1953; -84.4006 |publisher=Cincinnatisparklingjuices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302154332/http://www.cincinnatisparklingjuices.com/ |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and many authorities consider it perfectly acceptable to participate in a toast while drinking water.&lt;ref name="Sih98"/&gt; Toasting with an empty glass may be viewed by some as acceptable behavior for the non-drinker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19921230&amp;id=824VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gOoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5496,6944063|title=Eugene Register-Guard - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though feigning to drink from such a glass would likely be seen as ridiculous.  The person giving the toast should never do so with an empty glass, even if the glass contains nothing more than water.

Teetotalers may view the drinking of toasts to be abominable and incompatible with their stand, as witnessed by this narrative from ''The Teetotaler'' (1840):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the anniversary of Cheshunt College, [[Sir Culling Eardley, 3rd Baronet|Sir Culling Eardley Smith]] was in the chair. This gentleman, after dinner, said "he had subscribed to the Teetotal Pledge, which of course was incompatible with the drinking of toasts;" when the Rev. J. Blackburn, (minister of Claremont Chapel, Pentonville,) said "he was not a teetotaler,—''he was not in bondage,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:1 -¶ "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt;—and on that subject he had very recently been preaching."  What could the Rev. Gentleman mean by this, but that he had recently been preaching against Teetotalism?  Let the Rev. Gentleman look at drinking customs and their enormous evils, and ask himself if he has done his duty; or whether he expects to be pronounced "a [[Parable of the talents or minas|good an faithful servant]]", if he continues even from the pulpit to encourage the great damning evil of this nation. Mr. Donaldson said that he was happy to add, that one of the most popular ministers of the day, the Rev. J. Sherman, gave Mr. B. a pretty severe and well-merited reply, by saying, "His brother Blackburn had said, he (Mr. B.) was not in bondage; he must be allowed to say, that he rejoiced that he (Mr. S.) had been enabled to break through the old and stupid custom of washing down sentiments by draughts of intoxicating liquors. ''He had thus become a free man.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] 2:19 - "While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Donaldson concluded with some very severe animadversions upon the infamous conduct of Mr. Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= 1840-07-25 |title= The Teetotaler |volume= I |issue= 5 |page= 38 |location= [[London]] |publisher= United Temperance Association |editor1-first= George W.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a superstition in the [[United States Navy]] that a toast is never to be made with water, since the person so honored will be doomed to a watery grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=chicago_blogger |url=http://thewinehistorian.blogspot.com/2009/11/raditional-us-navy-wine-toast.html |title=The Wine Historian: A Traditional US Navy Wine Toast |publisher=Thewinehistorian.blogspot.com |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[United States Air Force]] [[Dining in|Dining In]], all toasts are traditionally made with wine except for the final toast of the night made in honor of [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]/[[Missing in action|MIAs]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcewives.com/index.php/content/view/1125/342/ |title=MilitaryWives.com Network |publisher=Airforcewives.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; because these honorees did not have the luxury of wine while in captivity, the toast is made with water. Some versions of the protocol prescribe a toast in water for all deceased comrades.&lt;ref name="air force dining"/&gt;

It is or was the custom on the (British) [[Royal Navy]] to drink toasts sitting, because in old-type wooden warships below decks there was not enough [[Vertical clearance|headroom]] to stand upright.

==The German word "prost"==
[[File:Prost oktoberfest.jpg|right|thumb|Toasting at [[Oktoberfest]]]]
=== Prosit/Prost ===
Prosit is a [[Latin]] word from which the German short form "prost" is derived. It is a [[toast]], that is an acclamation made before drinking an alcoholic beverage when drinkers chink glasses. The expression dates back to the beginning of the 18th century when it was used among university students and eventually made its way into every day language. In a ceremonious context and in connection with a short speech, the English word [[toast]] may also be used.

=== Origin of the word ===
The word is, as mentioned above, of Latin origin and it comes from the verb "prodesse" (= "to benefit sth/sb", "to be beneficial"). Consequently, "prosit" is the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] form (3rd person Singular, Present Subjunctive, Active) and therefore an [[optative]]: "To you/ to your health". Like the colloquial "prost", "prosit" was originally used by university students.&lt;ref&gt;Prosit, colloquial prost in DUDEN, German Monolingual Dictionary Online&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage ===
In German, [[synonyms]] like "Wohl bekomm's!", "Zum Wohl!", and many versions from other languages may also be used instead of "prosit". The acclamation itself is also referred to as a "prosit". The verb form is "zuprosten", where the prefix "zu" means that the speech act is targeted at one or several people.

In the [[Swabian dialect]], the word has the further meaning of a [[belch]], called a "Prositle". The acclamation is followed by the clinking of glasses, often linked to other rules like making eye contact. This ritual is commonly attributed to a medieval custom, whereby one could avoid being poisoned by one's drinking companions, as a few drops of each beverage got mixed when clinking glasses. There is every likelihood that this did not work. It was much more effective for one table to share one or more drinking vessels, a procedure which was common for a long time.

In Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, prosit is a blessing used in response to a sneeze, in the same way the English expression "bless you" is used.

In [[Germany]], toasting, not necessarily by words but usually just by touching each other's drinking vessels, is usually a very closely observed part of culture. In private company, no one should drink a sip of alcohol before having toasted all the other people at the table. In doing this, it is very important to look directly into the other drinker's eyes. Not practising this is considered rude and often, humorously, believed to attract all kinds of bad luck (e.g. "seven years of bad luck" and the like).

==Traditional toasts==
In the British Royal Navy, the officers' noon mess typically began with the [[loyal toast]], followed by a toast distinctive for the day of the week:
* Monday: Our ships at sea.
* Tuesday: Our sailors (formerly Our men but changed to include women).&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23013395 | work=BBC News | title='Our wives and sweethearts' Naval toast rewritten | date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wednesday: Ourselves. ("As no-one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare" is often the retort and not part of the toast)
* Thursday: A bloody war or a sickly season (meaning the desire and likelihood of being promoted when many people die: during war or sickness.)
* Friday: A willing foe and sea room. (meaning the payment of prize money after a successful engagement)
* Saturday: Our families (formerly Our wives and sweethearts with the retort of "may they never meet").&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;
* Sunday: Absent friends.

The sequence was also prescribed in at least one publication for the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;US Navy's "Mess Night Manual", Naval School, Civil Engineer Corps Officers, Port Hueneme, California, August 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

A toast might be spontaneous and free-form, a carefully planned original speech, or a recitation of traditional sentiments such as this Irish example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talesoftanglewood.blogspot.com/2008/07/irish-sayings-blessings-toasts.html |title=The Tales of Tanglewood: Irish Sayings, Blessings &amp; Toasts |publisher=Talesoftanglewood.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|May the road rise to meet you.&lt;br&gt;May the wind be always at your back.&lt;br&gt;May the sun shine warm upon your face.&lt;br&gt;And rains fall soft upon your fields.&lt;br&gt;And until we meet again,&lt;br&gt;May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.}}

An informal variation of the last 2 lines is:

{{quote|"And may ye be in Heaven a half-hour&lt;br&gt;afore the devil knows ye're dead!"}}

==Toasts Worldwide==
In various cultures worldwide, toasting is common and to not do so may be a breach of etiquette. The general theme of a toast is "good luck" or "good health". At formal meals in certain countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, the first toast to be proposed is traditionally the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]] ("[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]]"). This may be adapted in other countries to give a loyal toast to the appropriate [[Head of State]].&lt;ref name="hmsrichmond"/&gt;

A '''triskelion''' or '''triskele''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a '''triple spiral''' exhibiting   [[rotational symmetry]].
The spiral design can be based on interlocking [[Archimedean spiral]]s,  or represent three bent human legs.

Both terms are from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Lang|el|"τρισκέλιον"}} (''triskelion'') or {{lang|grc|"τρισκελής"}} (''triskeles''), "three-legged",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriskelh%2Fs τρισκελής],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on [[Perseus Digital Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; from prefix "τρι-" (''tri-''), "three times"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dtri- τρι-], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + "σκέλος" (''skelos''), "leg".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dske%2Flos σκέλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

A triskelion is a traditional symbol of [[Sicily]], where it is called ''trinacria'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelo &amp; Mario Grifasi |url=http://www.grifasi-sicilia.com/trinacria.htm |title=Sicilia: Il Perchè del nome Trinacria |publisher=Grifasi-sicilia.com |date=1999-01-28 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Isle of Man]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |title=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510212828/http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is known in Manx as ''Tree Cassyn Vannin'', and [[Brittany]] where it is known as ''Triskèle''. [[Ingushetia]] also has a (stylised) triskelion in its flag.

The triskelion symbol appears in many early cultures, the first in [[Malta]] (4400–3600 BCE) and in the astronomical calendar at the famous megalithic tomb of [[Newgrange]] in Ireland built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowth.com/newgrange.htm |title=Newgrange Ireland - Megalithic Passage Tomb - World Heritage Site |publisher=Knowth.com |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] vessels, on coinage in [[Lycia]], and on [[stater]]s of [[Pamphylia]] (at [[Aspendos]], 370–333 BCE) and [[Pisidia]]. It appears as a [[heraldic]] emblem on warriors' shields depicted on Greek pottery.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the trislele on [[Achilles]]' round shield on an Attic late 6th century BCE ''[[hydria]]'' at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], illustrated in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford History of the Classical World) vol. I (1988), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triskelion is an ancient symbol of [[Sicily]], with the head of the [[Gorgon]], with snakes as hair, from which radiate three legs bent at the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weddinginsicily.co.uk/wedding_sicily_trinacria.htm|title=Weddings in Sicily Taormina|website=www.weddinginsicily.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of [[Magna Graecia]], the colonial extension of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] beyond the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref name="naples"&gt;Matthews, Jeff (2005) [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm Symbols of Naples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030202145/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the [[triangle|triangular]] form of the island, the ancient ''[[Kingdom of Sicily|Trinacria]]'' (from the Greek ''tri-'' (three) and ἄκρα ''akra'' (end, peak, citadel), which consists of three large capes equidistant{{fact|date=July 2018}} from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were [[Punta del Faro|Pelorus]], [[Capo Passero|Pachynus]], and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Celtic art|Celtic]] symbol of [[triple spiral|three conjoined spirals]] may have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. The triple spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe. Though popularly considered a "Celtic" symbol, it is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Murphy and Richard Moore, ''Island of the Setting Sun: In Search of Ireland's Ancient Astronomers,'' 2nd ed., Dublin: The Liffey Press, 2008, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] monument in [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Newgrange, which was built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"/&gt; predates the Celtic arrival in Ireland, but has long since been incorporated into Celtic culture. The symbol is also found [[petroglyph|carved in rock]] in [[Castro Culture]] settlement in modern-day [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]]. In Ireland before the 5th century, in [[Celtic Christianity]] the triskele took on new meaning, as a symbol of the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and therefore also a symbol of eternity. Its popularity continues today as a decorative symbol of faith for Christians of Celtic descent around the world.

==Asian usage==
Traditional Asian versions of the triskelion include the Japanese [[Mitsudomoe]], the Tibetan Buddhist [[Gankyil]], and the Korean [[Taegeuk#Tricolored Taegeuk|Sam Taegeuk]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
{{clear-left}}

==Modern usage==
A triskelion is featured on the seal of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A triskelion shape is the basis for the [[roundel]] of the [[Irish Air Corps]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Aircraft Encyclopedia'' by Roy Braybrook, {{ISBN|0-671-55337-2}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and the logo for the [[Trisquel]] [[Linux distribution]].

A triskelion shape was used in the design of RCA's "Spider" [[45 rpm adapter]], a popular plastic adapter for vinyl records, which allows larger center-holed 45 rpm records (commonly used on 7" singles and EPs) to spin on players designed for smaller center-holed 33-1/3 rpm records (the standard for 10" and 12" LPs). The design was practical, the three curved arms providing equal spring and thus keeping the hole centred. The iconic design of the Spider has led to its adoption as a popular symbol for record and music enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |title=We Love Life: Music - 45 RPM Adapters |publisher=Welove-music.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202110840/http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |archivedate=2009-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/12/05/twenty-45-adapters.html |title=Boing Boing: Gadgets - Twenty 45 adapters |publisher=Gadgets.boingboing.net|date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most commonly used symbols of the [[BDSM#Symbols|BDSM]] community is a derivation of a triskelion shape within a circle.&lt;ref name=Luminais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luminais|first1=Misty|title=In the Habit of Being Kinky: Practice and Resistance in a BDSM Community, Texas, USA|date=May 2012|publisher=Washington State University|page=121|url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/4093/Luminais_wsu_0251E_10404.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Africa|South African]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[White nationalism|White nationalist]] organization and political party [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] uses a Triskele composed of three sevens as its symbol in place of the [[Swastika|Nazi Swastika]].

The [[Flag of the Isle of Man]] bears 3 legs based on the Triskele.

The crest of the Breton [[association football|football]] club [[En Avant de Guingamp]] combines the [[Flag of Brittany]], the team colours and the triple spiral triskelion.

"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]" is a second-season episode of the American science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek]]''.

In the [[Marvel Universe]], the intelligence agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] uses the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] as its headquarters {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

The Triskele is also used as a prominent symbol in MTV's "[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV Series)]]" which draws heavily from Celtic mythology. A Triskele was used by some younger betas to keep from shifting &amp; maintain calm. This happens by the beta repeating "Alpha, Beta, Omega" or "The Sun, The Moon, The Truth" over and over again until the beta is calm.

In [[Merlin (2008 TV series)]] it was used as symbol of druids.

==Reconstructionists and neopagans==
The triskele, usually consisting of spirals, but also the "horned triskelion", is used by some [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|polytheistic reconstructionist]] and [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups. As a Celtic symbol, it is used primarily by groups with a Celtic cultural orientation and, less frequently, can also be found in use by various eclectic or syncretic traditions such as [[Neopaganism]]. The spiral triskele is one of the primary symbols of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, [[Kensington Books|Kensington]] Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. p. 132: [Among Celtic Reconstructionists] "...''An Thríbhís Mhòr'' (the great triple spiral) came into common use to refer to the three realms." Also p. 134: [On CRs] "Using Celtic symbols such as triskeles and [[triple spiral|spirals]]"&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic Reconstructionists use the symbol to represent a variety of triplicities in their cosmology and theology; it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god [[Manannán mac Lir]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"/&gt;

==Occurrence in nature==
The endocytic protein, [[clathrin]], is triskelion-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ediacaran fossil [[Tribrachidium]] is also triskelion shaped.

[[File:Unità di misura - Palazzo della Ragione - Padova.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Units of measurement, [[Palazzo della Ragione]], [[Padua]]]]

A '''unit of measurement''' is a definite [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a [[quantity]], defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{VIM3rd|term=measurement unit|pages=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement.

For example, a [[length]] is a [[physical quantity]]. The [[metre]] is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10&amp;nbsp;metres (or 10&amp;nbsp;m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called "metre".
Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.

The definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of [[System of measurement|systems of units]] used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the modern form of the [[metric system]].

In trade, '''weights and measures''' is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).

[[Metrology]] is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement.

In [[physics]] and metrology, units are standards for [[measurement]] of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. [[Reproducibility]] of experimental results is central to the [[scientific method]]. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.

[[Science]], [[medicine]], and [[engineering]] often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in [[problem solving]] (see, for example, [[dimensional analysis]]).

In the [[social sciences]], there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in [[psychometrics]] and the [[theory of conjoint measurement]].

==History==
{{main|History of measurement}}

A unit of measurement is a standardised [[quantity]] of a physical property, used as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials.

The earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] in [[Iran|Persia]] as well.

Weights and measures are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (Leviticus 19:35–36). It is a commandment to be honest and have fair  measures.

In the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of [[John, King of England|King John]], put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 "There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn—namely, the London quart;—and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths—namely, two ells below the selvage..."

As of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by 17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently, the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and the US Customary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Yunus A. Çengel &amp; Michael A.

==Systems of units==
{{main|System of measurement}}

===Traditional systems===

Historically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person.

===Metric systems===
[[Metric system]]s of units have [[History of the metric system|evolved since the adoption of the original metric system]] in [[France]] in 1791. The current international standard metric system is the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of modern systems is [[standardization]]. Each unit has a universally recognized size.
[[File:Tabella conversione metrica 1860 MG 7771.jpg|thumb|An example of [[metrication]] in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex. one "libbra" = 339.54 grams)]]

Both the [[imperial units]] and [[US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and the former [[British Empire]]. US customary units are still the main system of measurement used in the [[United States]] despite Congress having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866.&lt;ref&gt;

}} as amended by Public Law 110–69 dated 9 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some steps towards US [[metrication]] have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and imperial units to derive exactly from SI units. Since the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959 the US and imperial inch is now defined as exactly {{val|0.0254|ul=m}}, and the US and imperial avoirdupois pound is now defined as exactly {{val|453.59237|ul=g}}.&lt;ref&gt;

===Natural systems===
While the above systems of units are based on arbitrary unit values, formalised as standards, some unit values occur naturally in science. Systems of units based on these are called [[natural units]]. Similar to natural units, [[atomic units]] (au) are a convenient [[system of units]] of measurement used in [[atomic physics]].

Also a great number of [[List of unusual units of measurement|unusual and non-standard units]] may be encountered. These may include the [[solar mass]] ({{val|2|e=30|u=kg}}), the [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (the energy released by detonating one million tons of [[trinitrotoluene]], TNT) and the [[electronvolt]].

===Legal control of weights and measures===
{{Main|Weights and Measures Act|Trading standards}}
To reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national [[statutes]] have standard definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence "statute measure"), and these are verified by legal officers.

===Informal comparison to familiar concepts===
{{mainarticle|List of unusual units of measurement}}
In informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualise than a value in a formal unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give rise to loosely defined "systems" of units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=David |title=Mind your language: Wales, Belgium and other units of measurement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/17/mind-your-language-david-marsh |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=17 May 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Size of Wales |url=https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/06/11/size-of-wales |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=The Economist |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base and derived units==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Measurement]] --&gt;
Different systems of units are based on different choices of a set of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s.
The most widely used system of units is the International System of Units, or [[SI]]. There are seven [[SI base unit]]s. All [[SI derived unit|other SI units]] can be derived from these base units.

For most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a reference used to make sense of the value given.

But not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the ''base units''. Other units are ''derived units''. Derived units are a matter of convenience, as they can be expressed in terms of basic units. Which units are considered base units is a matter of choice.

The base units of SI are actually not the smallest set possible. Smaller sets have been defined. For example, there are unit sets in which the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]] have the same unit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is based on physical laws that show that electric and magnetic field are actually different manifestations of the same phenomenon.

==Calculations with units of measurement==

===Units as dimensions===
Any value of a [[physical quantity]] is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity ''Z'' is expressed as the product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = n \times [Z] = n [Z].&lt;/math&gt; For example, let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be "2 candlesticks", then &lt;math&gt;Z = 2 [Z] = 2 &lt;/math&gt; candlestick.

The multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as [[quantity calculus]]. In formulas the unit [Z] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical [[dimension]]: see [[dimensional analysis]] for more on this treatment.

Units can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units can always be multiplied or divided, as [[George Gamow]] used to explain. Let &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; be "2 candlesticks" and &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; "3 cabdrivers", then

:"2 candlesticks" times "3 cabdrivers" &lt;math&gt;= 6[Z_1][Z_2] = 6 &lt;/math&gt; candlestick &lt;math&gt; \times &lt;/math&gt; cabdriver.

A distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature.

There are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units:

* Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is metres per second (m/s). See [[dimensional analysis]]. A unit can be multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Put simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See [[Exponentiation]].)
* Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit for [[surface tension]] can be referred to as either N/m (newtons per metre) or kg/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (kilograms per second squared). Whether these designations are equivalent is disputed amongst metrologists.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = On quantity calculus and units of measurement | first = W.H. | last = Emerson | year = 2008 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 45 | pages = 134–138 |bibcode = 2008Metro..45..134E |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/002 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Watt-hour]] --&gt;
[[Conversion of units]] involves comparison of different standard physical values, either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a combination of other physical quantities.

Starting with:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = n_i \times [Z]_i&lt;/math&gt;

just replace the original unit &lt;math&gt;[Z]_i&lt;/math&gt; with its meaning in terms of the desired unit &lt;math&gt;[Z]_j&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. if &lt;math&gt;[Z]_i = c_{ij} \times [Z]_j&lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt;Z = n_i \times (c_{ij} \times [Z]_j) = (n_i \times c_{ij}) \times [Z]_j&lt;/math&gt;

Now &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are both numerical values, so just calculate their product.

Or, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply ''Z'' by unity, the product is still ''Z'':

:&lt;math&gt;Z = n_i \times [Z]_i \times ( c_{ij} \times [Z]_j/[Z]_i )&lt;/math&gt;

For example, you have an expression for a physical value ''Z'' involving the unit ''feet per second'' (&lt;math&gt;[Z]_i&lt;/math&gt;) and you want it in terms of the unit ''miles per hour'' (&lt;math&gt;[Z]_j&lt;/math&gt;):

{{ordered list
|1= Find facts relating the original unit to the desired unit:

:1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds

|2= Next use the above equations to construct a fraction that has a value of unity and that contains units such that, when it is multiplied with the original physical value, will cancel the original units:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1\,\mathrm{mi}}{5280\,\mathrm{ft}}\quad \mathrm{and}\quad 1 = \frac{3600\,\mathrm{s}}{1\,\mathrm{h}}&lt;/math&gt;

|3= Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the fraction, called a ''[[conversion factor]]'', to obtain the same physical value expressed in terms of a different unit. Note: since valid conversion factors are [[dimensionless]] and have a numerical value of [[one]], multiplying any physical quantity by such a conversion factor (which is 1) does not change that physical quantity.

:&lt;math&gt; 52.8\,\frac{\mathrm{ft}}{\mathrm{s}} =
 52.8\,\frac{\mathrm{ft}}{\mathrm{s}}
 \frac{1\,\mathrm{mi}}{5280\,\mathrm{ft}}
 \frac{3600\,\mathrm{s}}{1\,\mathrm{h}} =
 \frac {52.8 \times 3600}{5280}\,\mathrm{mi/h}
 = 36\,\mathrm{mi/h}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Or as an example using the metric system, you have a value of fuel economy in the unit ''litres per 100 kilometres'' and you want it in terms of the unit ''microlitres per metre'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{\frac{9\,\rm{L}}{100\,\rm{km}}} =
 \mathrm{\frac{9\,\rm{L}}{100\,\rm{km}}}

 \mathrm{\frac{1000000\,\rm{\mu L}}{1\,\rm{L}}}
 \mathrm{\frac{1\,\rm{km}}{1000\,\rm{m}}} =
 \frac {9 \times 1000000}{100 \times 1000}\,\mathrm{\mu L/m} =
 90\,\mathrm{\mu L/m}&lt;/math&gt;

==Real-world implications==
One example of the importance of agreed units is the failure of the [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], which was accidentally destroyed on a mission to Mars in September 1999 instead of entering orbit due to miscommunications about the value of forces: different computer programs used different units of measurement ([[Newton (unit)|newton]] versus [[pound force]]). Considerable amounts of effort, time, and money were wasted.&lt;ref name=mixups&gt;

A '''violent crime''' or '''crime of violence''' is a [[crime]] in which an offender or perpetrator uses or threatens to use force upon a victim. This entails both crimes in which the [[violence|violent]] act is the objective, such as murder or rape, as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end. Violent crimes may, or may not, be committed with weapons. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may vary from homicide to harassment. Typically, violent criminals includes [[aircraft hijacking|aircraft hijackers]], [[bank robbers]], [[Robbery|muggers]], [[burglars]], [[terrorists]], [[carjackers]], [[rapists]], [[kidnappers]], [[torture]]rs, [[active shooter]]s, [[murderers]], [[gangsters]], [[drug cartels]], and others.

==Violent crime by country==

The comparison of violent [[crime statistics]] between countries is usually problematic, due to the way different countries classify crime.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segessenmann, Tanya [http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2002/intl-comparisons-crime/section-2.html Section 2 - International Comparisons of Recorded Violent Crime Rates for 2000], Research &amp; Evaluation Unit, Ministry of Justice, Wellington, New Zealand. 11 June 2002 Retrieved 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Compiling-and-comparing-International-Crime-Statistics.html |title=Compiling and Comparing International Crime Statistics |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Crime_statistics |title=Crime statistics - Statistics Explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valid comparisons require that similar [[crime|offence]]s between jurisdictions be compared. Often this is not possible, because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may include: [[homicide]], [[murder]], [[assault]], [[manslaughter]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], [[negligence]], [[endangerment]], [[kidnapping]] (abduction), [[extortion]], and [[harassment]]. Different countries also have different systems of recording and reporting crimes.

===Australia===
The first annual national survey of crime victimization in Australia, the Crime Victimisation Survey, was conducted in 2008-09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4530.0main+features100022012-13 |title=Crime Victimisation, Australia, 2012-13 |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2014-02-11 |website=abs.gov.au |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal crimes included in the survey are: 
*Physical assault
*Threatened assault (including face-to-face and non face-to-face)
*Robbery (including attempted)
*Sexual assault (including attempted)

In 2009, the Australian Standard Offence Classification (ASOC), which had no single category for violent crime, was replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC). The ANZSOC also has no single category for violent crime, but the first 6 of its divisions involve offenses committed against a person: 
#Homicide and related offences;
#Acts intended to cause injury;

Canada conducts an annual measure of crime incidences called the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3302 |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-07-24 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCR "Violent ''Criminal Code''" violations include: homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, assault, robbery, criminal harassment, uttering threats, and other violent violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/legal50a-eng.htm |title=Crimes, by type of violation, and by province and territory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-07-25 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada also collects information on crime victimization every five years via its General Social Survey on Victimisation (GSS).

===Europe===
Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, England, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece and Sweden count minor violence like slapping another person as assault.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010&gt;[http://www.europeansourcebook.org/ob285_full.pdf European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics – 2010], fourth edition, p30.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the case of Ilias Kasidiaris in 2012. Kasidaris, then spokesperson for Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party, slapped a left-wing female opponent in the face during a live televised debate. He was subsequently wanted by Greek prosecutors for assault and faced an arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18352258 Greek far-right Golden Dawn MP wanted for assault].

France does not count minor violence like slapping somebody as assault.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010/&gt;

The United Kingdom includes all [[violence]] against the person, [[sexual offence]]s, as violent crime.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Today violent crimes are considered the most heinous whereas historically, according to Simon Dedo, crimes against property were equally important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dedo |first=Simon |title=When Theft Was Worse Than Murder |url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/when-theft-was-worse-than-murder |date=2014-04-24 |work=Nautilus |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of violent crime in the UK are recorded by the [[British Crime Survey]]. For the 2010/2011 report on crime in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Office |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb1011 |title=British Crime Survey |publisher=Homeoffice.gov.uk |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the statistics show that violent crime continues a general downward trend observed over the last few decades as shown in the graph. "The 2010/11 BCS showed overall violence was down 47 per cent on the level seen at its peak in 1995; representing nearly two million fewer violent offences per year." In 2010/11, 31 people per 1000 interviewed reported being a victim of violent crime in the 12 preceding months. Regarding murder, "increasing levels of homicide (at around 2% to 3% per year) [have been observed] from the 1960s through to the end of the twentieth century". Recently the murder rate has declined, "a fall of 19 per cent in homicides since 2001/02", as measured by The Homicide Index.

There are two main crime databases maintained by the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ): the Bureau of Justice Statistics' [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's [[Uniform Crime Report]] (UCR). Non-fatal violence is reported in the NCVS, which measures [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], [[robbery]], and [[Aggravated assault|aggravated]] and simple [[assault]] reported by households surveyed by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name=BJSNCVS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245 |title=Bureau of Justice Statistics: National Crime Victimization Survey |website=bjs.gov |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCR tracks similar non-fatal violence, plus [[murder]] and non-negligent [[manslaughter]] recorded by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=FBIUCR-Violent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/violent-crime/violent-crime |title=FBI: Violent Crime |website=fbi.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant methodological and definitional differences between the NCVS and UCR:
*The NCVS includes estimates of both reported and unreported crimes, while the UCR collects data on crimes recorded by the police.
*The UCR includes homicide, arson, and commercial crimes, while the NCVS does not.
*The UCR excludes simple assault (attacks or attempted attacks without a weapon resulting in either no injury or minor injury) and sexual assault, which are in the NCVS.
*The NCVS data are estimates from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households, but the UCR data are based on the actual counts of offenses reported by law enforcement.
*The NCVS excludes crimes against children under 12 years, persons in institutions, and, possibly, highly mobile populations and the homeless; however, victimizations against these persons may be included in the UCR.
Since they use different methodologies and measure overlapping, but not identical, crimes, the data are complementary and not necessarily congruent.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf |title=Criminal Victimization, 2012 |last1=Truman |first1=Jennifer |last2=Langton |first2=Lynn |last3= |first3= |date=October 2013 |website=bjs.gov |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

In October 2013, the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS) reported that violent crime (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault) rates for U.S. residents aged 12 and older increased in 2012 for the second consecutive year. The overall rate rose from 22.6 victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2011 to 26.1 in 2012. Most of the increase was in simple assaults.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012/&gt;{{rp|1}} From 1993 to 2012, overall violent victimization declined by two-thirds, from a rate of 79.8 per 1,000 to 26.1 per 1,000.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In 2011, the UCR violent crime rate had dropped to 386.3 cases per 100,000 persons, compared to 729.6 per 100,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Statista2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/ |title=Reported violent crime rate in the United States from 1990 to 2012 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 2013 |website=statista.com |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-15 }} Using FBI data.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. homicide data is also available in the [[National Vital Statistics System]] (NVSS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11510">'''The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding''' The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) is a leading Regional Peacebuilding organisation founded in 1998 in response to civil wars that plagued West Africa in the 1990s. Over the years, WANEP has succeeded in establishing strong national networks in every Member State of ECOWAS with over 550 member organisations across West Africa. WANEP places special focus on collaborative approaches to conflict prevention, and peacebuilding, working with diverse actors from civil society, governments, intergovernmental bodies, women groups and other partners in a bid to establish a platform for dialogue, experience sharing and learning, thereby complementing efforts at ensuring sustainable peace and development in West Africa and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wanep.org West Africa Network for Peacebuilding(WANEP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
WANEP was founded by two distinguished Africans; Samuel Gbaydee Doe and Emmanuel Habuka Bombande. Sam Gbadyee Doe is a peacebuilding and development professional from Liberia. He began his academic career from the University of Liberia where he studied Economics with the intention of being a banker and later proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University for his MA in conflict transformation and Bradford University in the U.K. for a PhD. It was at EMU that the dream for the establishment of WANEP began when his paths crossed with John Paul Lederach and Emmanuel Bombande.

Mr. Emmanuel Habuka Bombande is a Ghanaian National Peacebuilding Practitioner with proven expertise in conflict transformation, peacebuilding, and development. After his social science degree from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology-Kumasi Ghana, Mr. Bombande proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University, USA for a master's degree in Conflict Transformation. It was there he met Sam Doe leading to the birth of WANEP.

The story of WANEP cannot be completely told without mentioning the invaluable contributions of Professor John Paul Lederach especially during the formation and nurturing stages of the institution which he described as …”Beginning of a new era of peace, healing, reconciliation and hope in West Africa.” He was instrumental to bringing together and mentoring the two co-founders of WANEP.

Based on Sam Doe's background in working with trauma during the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], and in establishing youth dialogue organizations and Bombande’s efforts with [[Hizkias Assefa]] at the Nairobi Peace Initiative&lt;ref name=NPI&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.npi-africa.org/aboutus}}&lt;/ref&gt; in resolving the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in northern Ghana, WANEP focused on both lessening existing conflicts and preventing future outbreaks. By directing efforts toward grassroots efforts the organization helped local leaders and citizens resolve conflicts without outside intervention.

==Leadership==
[[Samuel Gbaydee Doe]] served as the executive director of WANEP from its formation in 1998 until 2004. In 2004, then director of programs, [[Emmanuel Bombande]] was appointed executive director. In 2015,Dr. Chukwuemeka Eze, formerly the Program Director
took over from Bombande as the Executive Director while Levinia Addae-Mensah is the Deputy Executive Director/Program Director.

==Programs and Organizations==
WANEP has a niche in training CSOs, government and other practitioners in peacebuilding and conflict prevention.  This niche has worked well in supporting peace and averting conflict in many situations.  WANEP implements programs to equip the youth, business owners, women, traditional leaders and state agencies with requisite skills in conflict prevention and supports them to find local solutions or interventions to their unique conflict situations.WANEP emphasizes ownership and bottom-up approach to peacebuilding practice which enables the National Networks to carry out interventions that reflect the peculiarities of human security issues in their various countries. The national networks represent the WANEP brand and work in member states while the Regional Secretariat engages at the strategic level with ECOWAS, AU, UN and other intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations.

====Strategic Focus===
WANEP's key area of focus includes but not limited to the following;
 	Early Warning and Response (WARN)
 	Nonviolence and Peace Education (NAPE) 
 	Capacity-Building &amp; Development
 	Engendering Women in Peacebuilding Programs (WIPNET) 
 	Dialogue and Mediation
 	Civil Society Coordination and Democratic Governance
 	Gender
 	Research and Publication

==Key Impact/Achievements==
Under the WIPNET program, WANEP facilitated the Liberian Women Mass action for Peace initiated by Liberian Women in 2003. The women peace activism’s intervention in Liberia under the WIPNET program, led to the eventual ceasefire in the Liberian war. The outcome of the Liberian peace process and the role of WIPNET have been acknowledged all over the world and led to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Her Excellency Ellen Johnson and Lemay Gbowe (WANEP Liberia former Coordinator for the WIPNET program). The mass action for peace is credited with urging [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]’s government and the Liberians for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) into a ceasefire and leading to the end of the conflict. WANEP also facilitated the creation of ‘Peace Hut’ in Liberia to facilitate the reconciliation process and provide environment for victims to meet and reconcile with offenders. This concept was replicated in Cote d'Ivoire.

President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] has cited WIPNET as being one of the key factors supporting women’s prominent role in peace building in Liberia.&lt;ref name=reliefweb&gt;{{cite web|title=President Sirleaf Discusses Liberian Women’s Involvement in Peacemaking and Peacebuilding |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/president-sirleaf-discusses-liberian-women%E2%80%99s-involvement-peacemaking-and |date=27 September 2012|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, WANEP signed an MOU with the African Union Commission to provide support to the Commission’s Peace and Security Department in the implementation of the AU Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) including the gender mainstreaming of the architecture.

The work of WANEP in establishing an early warning system has been instrumental in helping to resolve multiple conflicts in early stages.  In 2014 this effort was officially recognized by [[Cote d’Ivoire]]’s permanent representative to the [[United Nations]] [[Youssoufou Bamba]] in his official remarks at the Informal interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: "Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect,", September 8, 2014.

WANEP experience in peacebuilding has been sought for replication in East and Central Africa. The unique structure of WANEP contributed to WANEP’s choice as the Civil Society implementing partner for the operationalization of ECOWAS Early Warning Mechanism (ECOWARN).

&lt;blockquote&gt;A cet égard, permettez-moi de relever le travail remarquable que fait la section ivoirienne de la West Africa Network for Peacebuilding, la WANEP-CI, qui a mis en place une système indépendant d'alerte précoce, notamment par la diffusion de rapports mensuels de la collection d'informations, relatives à la sécurité humaine, et qui vise bien entendu, à soutenir les actions de prévention des conflits, et de promotion de la paix en Côte d'ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Youssoufou | last = Bamba | title = Declaration Son Excellence Monsieur Youssoufou Bamba Ambassadeur Representant Permanent de la Republique de Cote d'Ivoire Aupres des Nations Unies |contribution= Statement by Cote d'Ivoire | contribution-url = http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/cote-divoire-french.pdf | series = UN General Assembly Informal Interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: "Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect," 2014 | year = 2014 | pages = 3 | place = New York | publisher = United Nations | url = http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2013 WANEP was also recognized for their work with ECOWAS to promote peace education in selected secondary schools across the region. &lt;blockquote&gt;[These studies] will impart new ways of thinking and new way of viewing conflict thereby leading to building new structures and cultural practices in the society that deepens peaceful coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Peace education must be well-pursued-WANEP |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=286528 |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ECOWAS/WANEP relationship was the first example of civil society and intergovernmental partnership not only in West Africa but Africa generally. The partnership has been highlighted as the best practice of building alliances with CSOs in conflict prevention and is a referral point 
&lt;www.wanep.org/resource page&gt;

==Affiliations==
The organization works with several regional partners including the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the African Union’s Economic, Social, and Cultural Council [[ECOSOCC]], and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]](ECOSOC). WANEP is also a member of the Peace and Security cluster of ECOSOCC representing West Africa, and is the West Africa Regional Representative of the [[Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict]] (GPPAC)and the Focal Point for Africa CSOs on the AU-EU Joint Strategy (JAES).&lt;ref name=wanep&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.wanep.org/wanep/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=11|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic Partnerships==

In 2002, WANEP entered into a historic partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the implementation of a regional early warning and response system referred to as ECOWARN. In 2004, WANEP and ECOWAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which has consistently been renewed. this inter-governmental structure acts as a regional early warning and response system. WANEP and ECOWAS partnership enables typically non-governmental organizations a path to Track 1 diplomacy efforts early on in conflicts.

Inspired by its desire to contribute and commit to the sustenance of peace during elections, WANEP in collaboration with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is implementing a five-year project (2015 to 2019) tagged, “Mitigating Election Violence in West Africa through National Early Warning Systems (NEWS)” in target countries of West Africa namely, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Ghana and Sierra Leone. Through this project, WANEP set up and operationalized an Election Situation Room (ESR) during elections in those countries. WANEP also partnered with other key stakeholders to run ESR in countries such as Benin, The Gambia and Nigeria.

WANEP is working in partnership with the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) in Accra, Ghana to run the West Africa Peacebuilding Institute (WAPI)

'''William Harris''' (1867–1931) was an early [[Western Australian]] leader for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=" Harris, William (1867 - 1931) Biographical Entry "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090213b.htm|title= Biographical Entry |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1867 - Born in Western Australia, he received a rudimentary education as a private pupil at the Swan Native and Half-Caste Mission, before educating himself to a considerable extent.

1904 – While working at the ports and on stations in the Ashburton and Gascoyne districts of Western Australia, Harris witnessed the brutish and cruel practices used to oppress, disenfranchise and subjugate the local Aboriginal people. After ''The Times'' (London) and the Australia press published an account of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people in the Nor’-West of the State, Harris entered public debate about the issue with a letter to the press accusing the Colonial Secretary, [[Walter Kingsmill]] of willful hypocrisy and misrepresentation. Kingsmill had vehemently denied there was any evidence of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people. Harris also criticized the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, Henry Charles [[Prinsep]] for turning Aboriginal people off their land.

At the time the State Registrar-General, Malcolm A.C. Fraser had Harris in mind for a temporary position with the State Government to compile the vocabulary and descriptions of Aboriginal customs from different portions of the State together for posterity. Within weeks of the publication of Harris’s letter Malcolm Fraser appointed journalist Mrs [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queen of Deception|last = Lomas|first = Brian|publisher = Amazon|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517053857|location = |pages = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1906 – While prospecting in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, Harris observed extensive starvation  and disease among the local Aboriginal population. Harris was so concerned by what he witnessed that he traveled to Perth and on February 8, 1906, Harris and the Goldfields MP, [[Patrick Lynch (Australian politician)|Patrick Lynch]] M.L.A. met with the State Premier, Mr C.H. [[Rason Ministry|Rason]]. Harris explained that the Aboriginal people living on the eastern goldfields were in desperate need of food and medicine and handed Premier Rason a letter signed by the local Justices of the Peace lending their support. Harris also had a meeting with the Chief Protector of Aborigines, Mr Prinsep in an effort to persuade the Aborigines Department to supply rations, clothes and medicine to those starving and diseased.

1921 - When Mrs Daisy Bates began making national headlines with sensational stories accusing the Aboriginal people of cannibalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = ABORIGINALS STILL CANNIBALS|last = Bates|first = Daisy|date = 13 May 1921|work = Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, NSW)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris was one of very few who contested her allegations. In her rejoinder to a published letter by Harris disputing her views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Proposed Aboriginal Reserve|last = Harris|first = William|date = 4 September 1921|work = Sunday Times (Perth WA)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote, ‘the only good half-caste is a dead one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Aboriginal Reserves|last = Bates|first = Daisy|date = 2 October 1921|work = Sunday Times, Perth WA.|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris reproached her comment as “a stigma on a small class of people whose position in the community was an unenviable one”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = TREATMENT OF HALF-CASTES, Mrs Daisy Bates Reproached.|last = Harris|first = William|date = 8 January 1922|work = Sunday Times, Perth WA.|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1926 – Alarmed at the persecution inflicted upon Aboriginal people by the West Australian Aborigines Department and its officials, he voiced the intention to form the Native Union of Western Australia. Harris was particularly concerned about conditions at Mogumber ([[Moore River Native Settlement]]) after the Chief Protector of Aborigines [[A. O. Neville]] changed the settlements purpose from an Aboriginal farming community to an internment camp.

1928 – In March 1928 William Harris headed the first Aboriginal deputation to meet with a West Australian Premier [[Philip Collier]]. Wilfred Morrison, Edward Jacobs, Arthur Kickett, William Bodney, William Harris, his brother Edward and his nephew Norman Harris met with the Premier  for an hour and half.[http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/federation/popup/400.htm] They asked the Premier to repeal the Aborigines Act 1905 and give Aboriginal people the same rights at the white community. Describing the conditions at Mogumber as intolerable, they implored him to close it down. Because Aboriginal people were prohibited from entering central Perth, throughout the meeting they referred to Perth as ‘white city’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = NATIVES' WORST ENEMY|last = |first = |date = 9 March 1928|work = The Daily News (Perth, WA).|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris also told Premier Collier that Mrs Daisy Bates and Chief Protector Neville were the worst enemies of the Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queen of Deception|last = Lomas|first = Brian|publisher = Amazon|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517053857|location = |pages = 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1930 - William Harris moved to the town of [[Geraldton]] where he died on 13 July 1931 and is buried in the Aboriginal cemetery at Utacarra, Geraldton.

The Aborigines Act 1905, continued to govern the lives of all Aboriginal people in Western Australia until it was repealed by the Native Welfare Act 1963. Mogumber (Moore River Native Settlement) continued as a segregation facility until 1974.
