'''Abstract object theory''' is a branch of [[metaphysics]] regarding [[Abstract and concrete|abstract objects]]. Originally devised by metaphysicist [[Edward Zalta]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html|title= The Theory of Abstract Objects|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= February 10, 1999|work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory was an expansion of [[mathematical Platonism]].

''Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics'' (1983) is the title of a publication by Edward Zalta that outlines abstract object theory.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N. [https://books.google.com/books?id=voCSP6k3FCcC ''Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics'']. D. Reidel Publishing Company. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Zalta's account, there are two modes of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]]: some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) "exemplify" properties, while others ([[abstract object]]s like numbers, and what others would call "non-existent objects", like the round square, and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely "encode" them.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects,'' 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the objects that exemplify properties are discovered through traditional empirical means, a simple set of axioms allows us to know about objects that encode properties.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects,'' 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  For every set of properties, there is exactly one object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for a formalized [[ontology]].

'''Syed Abul A'la Maududi Chishti''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ابو الاعلی مودودی}}}} – alternative spellings of last name '''Maudoodi''', '''Mawdudi''', also known as '''Abul Ala Maududi'''; {{Birth date|df=yes|1903|9|25}} – {{Death date|df=yes|1979|9|22}}) was a [[Pakistani]] [[Muslim philosopher]], [[jurist]], journalist and [[imam]].&lt;ref name = "Zebiri"&gt;Zebiri, Kate.

==Early life==

===Background===
Maududi was born in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] [[India]], then part of the princely state enclave of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], until it returned to India in 1948.

He was the youngest of three sons of&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jamaat.org/beta/site/page/3 |title=Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi |website=Official website of the Jamaat-e-Islami |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418092730/http://jamaat.org/beta/site/page/3 |archive-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maulana Ahmad Hasan, a lawyer by profession. Although his father was only middle-class, he was the descendant of the [[Chishti]] line of saints; in fact his last name was derived from the first member of the Chishti Silsilah, i.e. [[Maudood Chishti|Khawajah Syed Qutb ul-Din Maudood Chishti]] (d. 527 AH).&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 100-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's mother was related to Islamic modernist thinker [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]].&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he himself states, his paternal family originally moved from Chicht, in modern-day [[Afghanistan]], during the days of [[Sikandar Lodi]] (d. 1517), initially settling in the state of [[Haryana]] before moving to [[Delhi]] later on, and on his mother's side, his ancestor Mirza Tulak, a soldier of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] origin, moved into India from [[Transoxiana]] around the times of [[emperor Aurangzeb]] (d. 1707),&lt;ref&gt;[[Omar Khalidi]], "Maulānā Mawdūdī and Hyderabad" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 41, No. 1 (Spring 2002), pp. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; while his maternal grandfather, Mirza Qurban Ali Baig Khan Salik (1816-1881), was a well-known writer and poet in [[Delhi]], a friend of the famous Urdu poet [[Ghalib]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vali Nasr]], ''Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1996), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Childhood ===
At an early age, until he was nine, Maududi was given home education, he "received religious nurture at the hands of his father and from a variety of teachers employed by him."&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 100-1"/&gt; As his father wanted him to become a [[maulvi]], this education consisted of learning [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Islamic law]] and [[hadith]].&lt;ref name="Islamic Political Thought 2013 p. 333"&gt;Irfan Ahmed in ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought'' (collective), [[Princeton University Press]] (2013), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied books of [[mantiq]] (logic).&lt;ref&gt;Roy Jackson, ''Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic state'', [[Routledge]] (2010), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vali Nasr]], ''Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1996), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] child, he translated [[Qasim Amin]]'s ''al-Marah al-jadidah'' ("The New Woman"), a modernist and feminist work, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into [[Urdu]] at the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Jackson, ''Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic state'', [[Routledge]] (2010), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vali Nasr]], ''Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1996), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of translation, years later, he also worked on some 3,500 pages from ''Asfar'', a work of Persian mystical thinker [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Suheyl Umar, "... hikmat i mara ba madrasah keh burd? The Influence of Shiraz School on the Indian Scholars", October 2004 – Volume: 45 – Number: 4, [http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/oct04/06.htm#_edn26 note 26]&lt;/ref&gt; His thought would influence Mawdudi, as "Sadra's notions of rejuvenation of the temporal order, and the necessity of the reign of Islamic law (the shari'ah) for the spiritual ascension of man, found an echo in Mawdudi's works."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vali Nasr]], ''Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1996), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
When he was 11, Maududi was admitted to eighth class directly in Madrasa Fawqaniyya Mashriqiyya (Oriental High School), [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], founded by [[Shibli Nomani]], a modernist Islamic scholar trying to synthesize traditional Islamic scholarship with modern knowledge, and which awakened Maududi's long-lasting interest in philosophy (particularly from [[Thomas Walker Arnold|Thomas Arnold]], who also taught the same subject to [[Muhammad Iqbal]]) as well as [[natural sciences]], like [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. He then moved to a more traditionalist [[Darul Uloom]] in Hyderabad. Meanwhile, his father shifted to [[Bhopal]] – there Maududi befriended [[Niaz Fatehpuri]], another modernist – where he suffered a severe paralysis attack and died leaving no property or money, forcing his son to abort his education. In 1919, by the time he was 16, and still a modernist in mindset, he moved to [[Delhi]] and read books by his distant relative, the reformist [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]]. He also learned [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] in order to study, intensively, [[Western philosophy]], [[sociology]] and [[European history|history]] for full five years : he eventually came up to the conclusion that "[[Muslim scholars|ulama’]] in the past did not endeavor to discover the causes of Europe's rise, and he offered a long list of philosophers whose scholarship had made Europe a world power : [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Auguste Compte|Comte]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot|Turgot]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Malthus]], [[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Goethe]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], among others. Comparing their contribution to that of Muslims, he concluded that the latter's did not reach even 1 percent."&lt;ref name="Islamic Political Thought 2013 p. 333"/&gt;

===Journalism===
Even if he began to get seriously involved in journalism from the early 1920s onwards, being appointed editor of the leading weekly Urdu newspaper ''Taj'' of [[Jabalpur]] in 1920 at the age of 17,&lt;ref&gt;[[Khurshid Hasan Khurshid|Khurshid Ahmad]] &amp; [[Zafar Ishaq Ansari]], ''Mawlānā Mawdūdī: An Introduction to His Life and Thought'', Islamic Foundation (1979), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; he also resumed his studies as an autodidact in 1921, notably through the influence of some members of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]], by studying the [[Dars-e-Nizami]] and subjects such as [[Islamic literature|adab]] (literature), [[mantiq]] (logiq), and [[kalam]] (theology and philosophy.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Vali Nasr]], ''Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1996), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Mawdudi got ijazahs (certificates and diplomas in traditional Islamic learning) but never called himself an [['alim]] in the formal sense because he found the Islamic scholars to be regressive, even though some [[Deobandi]] influence on him would remain:&lt;ref&gt;Roy Jackson, ''Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic state'', [[Routledge]] (2010), pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not have the prerogative to belong to the class of Ulema. I am a man of the middle cadre, who has imbibed something from both the systems of education, the new and the old; and has gathered my knowledge by traversing both paths. By virtue of my inner light, I conclude that neither the old school nor the new is totally in the right. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1924 to 1927 Maududi was the editor of ''al-Jamiah'', the newspaper of the Jamiyat-i Ulama (an organization of Islamic clergy), a position of "extreme importance and influence."

Always interested in independence from the British, Maududi lost faith in the [[Indian National Congress#Pre-independence|Congress Party]] and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly [[Hindu]] identity. He began to turn more towards Islam,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 20"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that Democracy could be a viable option for Muslims only if the majority of Indians were Muslim.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 20"/&gt;

Maududi spent some time in Delhi as a young man but went back to Hyderabad in 1928.&lt;ref name="Nasr-23"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political writings===
[[File:Birth place of Abul Ala maududi(Manzoor pura )Aurangabad India.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of Abul Ala Maududi (Cheli pura currently Manzoor pura) Aurangabad India]]
It was from 1933 to 1941 that Maududi's "most important and influential" works were published, according to scholar Seyyed [[Vali Reza Nasr|Vali Nasr]]. Nasr describes his role at the time as a "ideologue" rather than a journalist he was earlier, or the political activist he became after founding his party.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 40"/&gt;

In 1932 he joined another journal (''Tarjuman al-Quran'') and from 1932 to 1937 he began to develop his political ideas,&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 100-1"/&gt; and turn towards the cause of [[Islamic revival]]ism and Islam as an ideology,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 27"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to what he called "traditional and hereditary religion".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 29"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Hyderabad helped support the journal buying 300 subscriptions which it donated to libraries around India.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maududi was alarmed by the decline of Muslim ruled Hyderabad, the increasing secularism and lack of [[Purdah]] among Muslim women in Delhi.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1937 he became in conflict with [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]] and its support for a [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralistic]] Indian society where the Jamiat hoped Muslims could "thrive ... without sacrificing their identity or interests."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Madrasa e Furqania Aurangbad(Currently Zilah parishad )India.jpg|thumb|Madrasa e Furqania Aurangbad (currently Zilah parishad office) India]]
In that year he also married Mahmudah Begum, a woman from an old Muslim family with "considerable financial resources". The family provide financial help and allowed him to devote himself to research and political action, but his wife had "liberated", modern ways, and at first rode a bicycle and did not observe purdah. She was given greater latitude by Maududi than were other Muslims.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 34"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
At this time he also began work on establishing an organization for ''[[Dawah|Da'wah]]'' (propagation and preaching of Islam) that would be an alternative to both the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]].&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 35"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time he decided to leave Hyderabad for Northwest India, closer to the Muslim political center of gravity in India. In 1938, after meeting the famous Muslim poet [[Muhammad Iqbal]], Maududi moved to a piece of land in the village of Pathankot in the [[Punjab]] to oversee a ''[[Waqf]]'' (Islamic foundation) called ''Daru'l-Islam''.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hope was to make it a "nerve center" of Islamic revival in India, an ideal religious community, providing leaders and the foundation for a genuine religious movement. He wrote to various Muslim luminaries invited them to join him there.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 37"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community, like Jamaat-i-Islami later, was composed of ''rukn'' (members), a ''shura`'' (a consultative council), and a ''sadr'' (head).&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 38"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a dispute with the person who donated the land for the community over Maududi's anti-nationalist politics, Maududi quit the waqf and in 1939 moved the ''Daru'l-Islam'' with its membership from Pathankot to [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 38"/&gt;

In Lahore he was hired by Islamiyah College but was sacked after less than a year for his openly political lectures.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 40"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding the Jamaat-i-Islami===
{{Main article|Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan}}
[[File:House maududi2.jpg|thumb|Main entrance of the House of Syed Abul A'la Maududi 4-A, Zaildar Park, Ichhra, Lahore]]

In August 1941, Maududi founded Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) in [[British Raj|British India]] as a religious political movement to promote Islamic values and practices.His Mission was supported by eminent scholars such as Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi, Mualana Muhammad Manzoor Naumani, Maulana Abul Hassan Ali Nudvi and Maulana [[ Naeem Siddiqui]]. Maududi proposed forming a Muslim state based on Islamic law and in which Islam would guide all areas of life. This state would not be [[theocracy]], Maududi held, but a "theodemocracy", because its rule would be based on the entire Muslim community, not the ''[[ulema]]'' (Islamic scholars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ullah |first=Haroon K. |title=Vying for Allah's Vote: Understanding Islamic Parties, Political Violence, and Extremism in Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luiVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 |date=2014 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Georgetown University Press |pages=78–79 |isbn=978-1-62616-015-6 |quote="Syde Abul A'ala Maududi founded Jamaat-e-Islami in August 1941 ...

(Maududi specifically rejected the term 'theocracy' to describe his ideal state, arguing that the truly Islamic state would be ruled not by the ''ulema'' but by the entire Muslim community.) ... Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami as a vehicle for developing and establishing such a state."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Maududi opposed the creation of a separate Muslim state in the subcontinent. As JI [[Emir|Ameer]] (leader) he opposed the leaders of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] who sought an independent Muslim-majority state. He believed that &lt;blockquote&gt;An Islamic state is a Muslim state, but a Muslim state may not be an Islamic state unless and until the Constitution of the state is based on the Qur'an and Sunnah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In particular he opposed the Pakistani state allowing conventional banking and giving too many rights to minorities and Muslims sects such as the [[Ahmadiyya in Pakistan|Ahmadiyya]] he considered heretical.&lt;ref name="SVRN1994: 108"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Vanguard of the Revolution|1994|pp=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After founding of Pakistan===
With the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the JI was split to follow the political boundaries of new countries carved out of British India. The organisation headed by Maududi became known as ''Jamaat-i-Islami'' [[Pakistan]], and the remnant of JI in India as the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]]. Later JI parties were the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]], and autonomous groups in [[Indian Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=globalsec/&gt;

With the founding of Pakistan, Maududi's career underwent a "fundamental change", being drawn more and more into politics, and spending less time on ideological and scholarly pursuits.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his Jamaat-i Islami party never developed a mass following, it and Maududi did develop significant political influence. It played a "prominent part" in the agitation which brought down President [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] in 1969 and in the overthrow of Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-332-3"/&gt;
Maududi and the JI were especially influential in the early years of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia ul-Haq]]'s rule.

His political activity, particularly in support of the creation of an Islamic state clashed with the government, (dominated for many years by a secular political class), and resulted in several arrests and periods of incarceration. The first was in 1948 when he and several other JI leaders were jailed after Maududi objected to the government's clandestine sponsorship of [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|jihad in Kashmir]] while professing to observe a ceasefire with India.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 43"/&gt; and again in 1956-7,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 96"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; the compromises involved in electoral politics led to a split in the party over what some members felt were a lowering of JI's moral standards. In 1951, the JI shura passed a resolution in support of the party withdrawing from politics,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Maududi argued for continued involvement. Maududi prevailed at an open party meeting in 1951, and several senior JI leaders resigned in protest, further strengthened Maududi's position and beginning the growth of a "cult of personality" around him."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 43"/&gt; In 1957 Maududi again overruled the vote of the shura to withdraw from electoral politics.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 96"/&gt;

In 1953, he and the JI participated in a campaign against the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan. Anti-Ahmadi groups argued that the Ahmadiyya did not embrace Muhammad as the last prophet. Maududi as well as the traditionalist [[ulama]] of Pakistan wanted Ahmadi designated as non-Muslims, Ahmadis such as [[Muhammad Zafarullah Khan]] sacked from all high level government positions, and intermarriage between Ahmadis and other Muslims prohibited.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-330-1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ruthven |first1=Malise |date=2000|title=Islam in the World |edition=2nd |publisher=Penguin |pages=330–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign generated [[Lahore riots of 1953|riots in Lahore]], leading to the deaths of at least 200 Ahmadis, and selective declaration of [[martial law]].&lt;ref name=globalsec/&gt;

Maududi was arrested by the military deployment headed by Lieutenant General [[Azam Khan (general)|Azam Khan]] and sentenced to death for his part in the agitation.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-332-3"/&gt; However, the anti-Ahmadi campaign enjoyed much popular support,&lt;ref name="adams-110-popular"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adams, Charles J.|editor1-last=Esposito|editor1-first=John L.|title=Voices of Resurgent Islam|date=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=110|chapter=Maududi and the Islamic State|quote=... the agitation demanded that the Ahmadiyah be declared a minority and that Chawdhri Zafrullah Khan, prominent Ahmadi, be removed from his post as Foreign minister. Virtually all the religious parties supported these demands as did the majority of the general public.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and strong public pressure ultimately convinced the government to release him after two years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-332-3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=Islam in the World|date=2000|publisher=Penguin|pages=332–3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=famous&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famousmuslims.com/Maududi.htm|title=Abul Ala Maududi- famousmuslims.com|work=famousmuslims.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vali Nasr]], Maududi's unapologetic and impassive stance after being sentenced, ignoring advise to ask for clemency, had an "immense" affect on his supporters.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 139"/&gt; It was seen as a "victory of Islam over un-Islam", proof of his leadership and staunch faith.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 139"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign shifted the focus of national politics towards Islamicity.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 44"/&gt; The [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|1956 Constitution]] was adopted after [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956#Islamic provisions|accommodating]] many of the demands of the JI. Maududi endorsed the constitution and claimed it a victory for Islam.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However following a coup by General Ayub Khan, the constitution was shelved and Maududi and his party were politically repressed, Maududi being imprisoned in 1964 and again in 1967. The JI joined an opposition alliance with secular parties, compromising with doctrine to support a woman candidate ([[Fatima Jinnah]]) for president against Khan in 1965.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 44"/&gt; In the December 1970 general election, Maududi toured the country as a "leader in waiting"&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 45"/&gt; and JI spent considerable energy and resources fielding 151 candidates. Despite this, the party won only four seats in the national assembly and four in the provincial assemblies.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 45"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss led Maududi to withdraw from political activism in 1971 and return to scholarship.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 128"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 he resigned as JI's Ameer (leader) for reasons of health.&lt;ref name=globalsec/&gt; However it was shortly thereafter that Islamism gathered steam in Pakistan in the form of the ''Nizam-i-Mustafa'' (Order of the Prophet) movement, an alliance of conservative political groups united against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto which the JI gave shape to and which bolstered its standing.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-332-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 46"/&gt;

In 1977, Maududi "returned to the center stage". When Bhutto attempted to defuse tensions on 16 April 1977, he came to Maududi's house for consultations.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 46"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; When General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] overthrew Bhutto and came to power in 1977, he "accorded Mawdudi the status of a senior statesman, sought his advice, and allowed his words to adorn the front pages of the newspapers. Maududi proved receptive to Zia's overtures and supported his decision to execute Bhutto."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 46"/&gt;
Despite some doctrinal difference (Maududi wanted ''sharia'' by education rather than by state fiat&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=98,&amp;nbsp;104}}: "When General Zia ul-Haq enacted his Hudud Ordinances of 1979, this caused difficulties in the Jama'at's alliance with the general's government and led to costly doctrinal compromises by the party." [p. 98] "... Maududi again underlined the importance of education in Islam as a prerequisite for the Islamization of society ... This idea was in direct opposition to the "Islamzation first" approach of General Zia ul-Haq." [p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;), Maududi enthusiastically supported Zia and his program of Islamization or "[[Zia ul-Haq's Islamization|Sharization]]".&lt;ref name="Ruthven-332-3"/&gt;

==Beliefs and ideology==
{{Islamism sidebar|Key ideologues}}
Maududi poured his energy into books, pamphlets and more than 1000 speeches and press statements, laying the ground work for making Pakistan an Islamic state, but also dealing with a variety of issues of interest in Pakistan and the Muslim world.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 99"/&gt;
He sought to be a ''Mujaddid'', "renewing" (''tajdid'') the religion. This role had great responsibility as he believed a ''Mujaddid'' "on the whole, has to undertake and perform the same kind of work as is accomplished by a Prophet."&lt;ref name="shortreviv-36"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=S.A.A.|title=A Short History of the Revivalist Movement in Islam|date=1963|location=Lahore|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier mujaddids had renewed religion he wanted also "to propagate true Islam, the absence of which accounted for the failure of earlier efforts at tajdid."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 138-true"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=138}}: "He argued that his intent was not only to revive Islam but to propagate true Islam, the absence of which accounted for the failure of earlier efforts at ''tajdid''."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="shortreviv-109"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=S.A.A.|title=A Short History of the Revivalist Movement in Islam |date=1963 |location=Lahore |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jama'at-i Islami ke untis sal'' (Lahore: Shu'bah'bah-i Nashr'u Isha'at-i Jama'at-i Islami, 1970), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

According to at least one biographer ([[Vali Nasr]]), Maududi and the JI moved away from some of their more controversial doctrinal ideas (e.g. criticism of [[Sufism]] or the [[Ulama]]) and closer to orthodox Islam over the course of his career, in order to "expand"the "base of support" of Jama'at-e Islami.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 124"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qur'an===
Maududi believed that the [[Quran]] was not just religious literature to be "recited, pondered, or investigated for hidden truths" according to Vali Nasr, but a "socio-religious institution",&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 61"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; a work to be accepted "at face value" and obeyed.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 62"/&gt; By implementing its prescriptions the ills of societies would solved.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; It pitted truth and bravery against ignorance, falsehood and evil.&lt;ref name="Nasr-51-binary"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=51}}: "The erection of communal boundaries and the search for identity in Mawdudi's works increasingly cast the world in terms of good and evil, converting history into an arena for an apocalyptic battle between the two."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Qur'an is ... a Book which contains a message, an invitation, which generates a movement. The moment it began to be sent down, it impelled a quiet and pious man to ... raise his voice against falsehood, and pitted him in a grim struggle against the lords of disbelief, evil and iniquity.... it drew every pure and noble soul, and gathered them under the banner of truth. In every part of the country, it made all the mischievous and the corrupt to rise and wage war against the bearers of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;1979, Tafhimul Qur'an, Vol. I, Lahore, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''tafsir'' (Quranic interpretation) ''Tafhimu'l-Qur'an'', he introduced the four interrelated concepts he believed essential to understanding the Quran: ''ilah'' (divinity), ''rabb'' (lord), ''`ibadah'' (worship, meaning not the cherishing or praising of God but acting out absolute obedience to Him&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 64"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and ''din'' (religion).&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 61"/&gt;

===Islam===
Maududi saw Muslims not simply as those who followed the religion of [[Islam]], but as (almost) everything, because obedience to divine law is what defines a Muslim: "Everything in the universe is 'Muslim' for it obeys Allah by submission to His laws."&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 112"/&gt; The laws of the physical universe – that the heaven is above earth, that night follows day, etc. – were as much a part of ''sharia'' as banning consumption of alcohol and interest on debts. Thus it followed that stars, planets, oceans, rocks, atoms, etc. should actually be considered "Muslims" since they obey their creator's laws.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 112"/&gt; Rather than Muslims being a minority among humans, one religious group among many, it is non-Muslims who are a small minority among everything in the universe. Of all creatures only humans (and [[jinn]]) are endowed with free will, and only non-Muslim humans (and jinn) choose to use that will to disobey the laws of their creator.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 112"/&gt;

But in rejecting Islam (Maududi believed) the non-Muslim struggled against truth:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His very tongue which, on account of his ignorance advocates the denial of God or professes multiple deities, is in its very nature 'Muslim'.... The man who denies God is called [[Kafir]] (concealer) because he conceals by his disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul. His whole body functions in obedience to that instinct.... Reality becomes estranged from him and he in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A. Maududi's 'Towards Understanding Islam' |url=http://www.geocities.com/alummah2000/MeaningOfIslam.html |work=Message of Islam to Humankind (Explaining Islam) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010406002608/http://www.geocities.com/alummah2000/MeaningOfIslam.html |archivedate=6 April 2001 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since a Muslim is one who obeys divine law, simply having made a ''[[shahada]]'' (declaration of belief in the oneness of God and the acceptance of Muhammad as God's prophet) or being born into a Muslim family does not make you a Muslim.&lt;ref name="Nasr-64-Muslim"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=64–65}}: "a Islam, we wrote, was not a birthright, nor a simple proclamation of the ''shahadah'', but the testimony to an individual's absolute obedience to God – Islam found meaning only in the context of works."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="funda-21"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Seyed Abu'l A'la |title=Fundamentals of Islam|date=1978|page=21|edition=reprint|quote=A Muslim is ''not a Muslim'' by ''appellation'' or ''birth'', but by virtue of abiding by holy law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nor is seeking "knowledge of God" part of the religion of Islam.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Muslim is a "slave of God", and "absolute obedience to God" is a "fundamental right" of God. The Muslim does "not have the right to choose a way of life for himself or assume whatever duties he likes."&lt;ref name="Nasr-58-slave"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=58}}: "He wrote: 'You must remember that you are a born slave of God. He has created you for His servitude only'.... He viewed absolute obedience to God as a fundamental right of God.... 'Man ... does not have the right to choose a way of life for himself or assume whatever duties he likes.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Maududi believed that Islam covered all aspects of life. &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam is not a 'religion' in the sense this term is commonly understood. It is a system encompassing all fields of living. Islam means politics, economics, legislation, science, humanism, health, psychology and sociology. It is a system which makes no discrimination on the basis of race, color, language or other external categories. Its appeal is to all mankind. It wants to reach the heart of every human being."&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Abul Ala Mawdudi, ''Towards Understanding the Quran'', Chapter 7, Lahore, Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of all these aspects of Islam, Maududi was primarily interested in culture&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 49-50" /&gt;—preserving Islamic dress, language and customs,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 50"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; from (what he believed were) the dangers of [[First-wave feminism|women's emancipation]], [[secularism]], [[nationalism]], etc.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 49-50" /&gt;
It was also important to separate the realm of Islam from non-Islam—to form "boundaries" around Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=63}}: "This redefinition of Islam began with erecting impregnable boundaries around the religion, a necessary first step in constructing an Islamic ideology.... The lines of demarcation that defined Islam were perforce steadfast: there was either Islam, as it was understood and defined by Mawdudi, or there was un-Islam."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Towards Understanding Islam'' pp. 4, 11–12, 18–19,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Let Us Be Muslims'', pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;
It would also be proven scientifically (Maududi believed) that Islam would "eventually ... emerge as the World-Religion to cure Man of all his maladies."&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Maududi, ''A Short History of the Revivalist Movement in Islam'', reprint (Lahore: Islamic Publications, 1963), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasr-56"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=56}}: "[he would] scientifically prove that Islam is eventually to emerge as the World-Religion to cure Man of all his maladies."&lt;/ref&gt;

But what many Muslims, including many ''Ulama'', considered Islam, Maududi did not.
Maudid complained that "not more than 0.001%" of Muslim knew what Islam actually was.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 64"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Mawdudi, ''Tahrik-i axadi Hind awr Musalman'' (Lahore, 1973), 2:140&lt;/ref&gt;
Maududi not only idealized the first years of Muslim society (Muhammad and the "[[Rashidun|rightly guided]]" Caliphs&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 60"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but considered what came after to be un-Islamic or ''jahiliya''—with the exception of brief religious revivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=136}}: "He regarded Islamic history from the end of the rightly guided caliphs onward as essentially a period of decline and of ''jahiliyah''. Except for periodic surges of orthodoxy in the guise of revivalist movements, Muslim life had been defiled by syncretic concessions to heathen tendencies ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim philosophy, literature, arts, mysticism were syncretic and impure, diverting attention from the divine.&lt;ref name="Nasr-59"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=59}}: "Although traditional divines idealized the early history of Islam, they did not view what followed that era to be "un-Islamic", ...Maududi did not view Islamic history as the history of Islam but as the history of un-Islam or ''jahiliyah''. Islamic history as the product of human choice, was corruptible and corrupted."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hadith====
Maududi had a unique perspective on the transmission of [[hadith]]—the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], that form part of the basis of Islamic law. Rather than basing judgement of the quality of a hadith on the number and reliability of the chain of transmission (known as ''isnad'', Hadith where passed on orally before being written down) and the judgments of "generations of ''muhaddithin''" (hadith scholars), Maududi believed in his intuition, and that "with extensive study and practice one can develop a power and can intuitively sense the wishes and desires of the Holy Prophet.... Thus ... on seeing a Hadith, I can tell whether the Holy Prophet could or could not have said it."&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, S.A.A., ''Tafhimat'' (Lahore, 1965) 1:202, quoted in {{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
According to Irfan Ahmad, while Maududi opposed all Western influence in Islam, he saw "women's visibility" in the bazaar, colleges, theatres, restaurants "as the greatest threat to morality. Art, literature, music, film, dance, use of makeup by women: all were shrieking signs of immorality". 
&lt;ref name="Irfan-Ahmad-2013-322"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irfan Ahmad|authorlink1=Cracks in the `Mightiest Fortress'|editor1-last=Osella,|editor1-first=Filippo|editor2-last=Osella|editor2-first=Caroline |title=Islamic Reform in South Asia|date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V6CBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=maududi+dance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4eKt6IDaAhXM8YMKHaeHCBMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=maududi%20dance&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Maududi preached that the duty of women is to manage the household, bring up children and provide them and her husband with "the greatest possible comfort and contentment".&lt;ref name="TUI-women"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Abul A'la |title=Towards_Understanding_Islam|url=http://www.teachislam.com/dmdocuments/Maulana_Maududi_Towards_Understanding_Islam_(Translated_by_Khurram_Murad).pdf|accessdate=7 December 2014|quote=To the woman it assigns the duty of managing the household, training and bringing up children in the best possible way, and providing her husband and children with the greatest possible comfort and contentment. The duty of the children is to respect and obey their parents, and, when they are grown up, to serve them and provide for their needs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Maududi supported the complete veiling and segregation of women as practiced in most of Muslim India of his time. Women, he believed, should remain in their homes except when absolutely necessary. The only room for argument he saw in the matter of veiling/[[hijab]] was "whether the hands and the face" of women "were to be covered or left uncovered."&lt;ref name="Ruthven-329"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=Islam in the World|date=2000|publisher=Penguin|page=329|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Purdah and the Status of Woman in Islam'', (Lahore, 1979), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; On this question Maududi came down on the side of the complete covering of women's faces whenever they left their homes.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-329"/&gt;

Concerning the separation of the genders, he preached that men should avoid looking at women other than their wives, mothers, sisters, etc. (''[[mahram]]''), much less trying to make their acquaintance.&lt;ref name="Mawdudi-under-112"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mawdudi |first=Abul A'la |title=Towards Understanding Islam|others=Khurshid Ahmad, translator|date=November 1979|publisher=Islamic Publications|page=112|quote=Outside the pale of the nearest relations between whom marriage is forbidden men and women have been asked not to mix freely with each other and if they do have to have contact with each other they should do so with purdah. When women have to go out of their homes, they should ... be properly veiled. They should also cover their faces and hands as a normal course. Only in genuine necessity can they unveil, and they must recover as soon as possible.... men have been asked to keep down their eyes and not to look at women.... To try to see them is wrong and to try to seek their acquaintance is worse.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed birth control and family planning as a "rebellion against the laws of nature",&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Birth Control'', (Lahore, 1978), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and a reflection of loss of faith in God—who is the planner of human population&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Islam and Birth Control'' (Urdu), 1962. pp. 104–130, 150–53&lt;/ref&gt;—and unnecessary because population growth leads to economic development.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-329"/&gt; [[Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui]] writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;As to the argument that family planning enables better nourishment and education of children, Mawdudi refers to the beneficial effects of adversity and want on human character.&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi, Mohammad Nejatullah, ''Muslim Economic Thinking: A Survey Of Contemporary Literature'', The Islamic Foundation, Leicester, 2007, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Islam and Birth Control'' (Urdu), 1962. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maududi opposed allowing women to be either a head of state or a legislator, since "according to Islam, active politics and administration are not the field of activity of the womenfolk."&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 308"/&gt; They would be allowed to elect their own all-woman legislature which the men's legislature should consult on all matters concerning women's welfare. Their legislature would also have "the full right to criticize matters relating to the general welfare of the country," though not to vote on them.&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 308"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Maududi saw music and dancing as social evils. In describing the wickedness that comes of ignoring Islamic law he included not only leaving the poor to "starvation and destitution" while wallowing in luxury, liquor and drugs, but having "a regular need" for music,  satisfied with "musicians, dancing girls, drum-beaters and manufacturers of musical instruments".&lt;ref name="EPoM-1941"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Maududi |first1=Maulana |title= Maulana Maududi: Economic System Of Islam |date=1941 |publisher= Australian Islamic Library |url= https://archive.org/details/MaulanaMaududiEconomicSystemOfIslam |accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
His 1941 lecture "The economic problem of man and its Islamic solution" is "generally considered to be "one of the founding document of modern Islamic economics.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 103-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMEPITK2004:84-6"&gt;[[Abul A'la Maududi#IMEPITK2004|Kuran, ''Islam and Mammon'', 2004]]: pp. 84-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:57&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Maududi has been called the leader of the "vanguard of contemporary Islamic orthodoxy" in "''[[riba]]'' and finance."&lt;ref name="FKIBP2015:2"&gt;[[Islamic economics in Pakistan#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and credited with laying "down the foundations for development" of Islamic economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapra|first=M.U.|date=2004|title=Mawlana Mawdudi's contribution to Islamic economics|url=|journal=Muslim World|volume=94|pages=173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Maududi believed Islam "does not concern itself with the modes of production and circulation of wealth",&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:1"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and was primarily interested in cultural issues rather than socioeconomic ones.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 44"/&gt; 
Maududi dismissed the need for a "new science of economics, embodied in voluminous books, with high-sounding terminology and large organisation",&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:8-9"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; or other "experts and specialists" which he believed to be "one of the many calamities of modern age".&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:10"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.10&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major fallacies of economics was that it regarded "as foolish and morally reprehensible" spending "all that one earns, and everyone is told that he should save something out of his income and have his savings deposited in the bank or purchase an insurance policy or invest it in stocks and shares of joint-stock companies." In fact, the practice of saving and not spending some income is "ruinous for humanity".&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:24"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

But since Islam was a complete system, it included (a shariah-based) economic program, comparable and (of course) superior to other economic systems.
Capitalism was a "satanic economic system" starting with the fact that it called for the postponement of some consumption in favor of investment.  This led to [[overproduction]] and a downward spiral of lower wages, protectionism, trade wars and desperate attempts to export surplus production and capital through imperialist invasions of other countries,&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:21-3"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.21-3&lt;/ref&gt; finally ending in "the destruction of the whole society as every learned economist knows".&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:166"/&gt; 

On the other hand, [[socialism]] — by putting control of the means and distribution of production in the hands of the government — concentrates power to such an extent it inevitably leads to enslavement of the masses.&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:25-8"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.25-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Socialists sought to end economic exploitation and poverty by structural changes and putting an end to private ownership of production and property. But in fact poverty and exploitation is caused not by the profit motive but by the lack of "virtue and public welfare" among the wealthy, which in turn comes from a lack of adherence to ''sharia'' law.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-329-30"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=Islam in the World|date=2000|publisher=Penguin|pages=329–30|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an Islamic society, greed, selfishness and dishonesty would be replaced by virtue, eliminating the need for the state to make any significant intervention in the economy.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 104"/&gt;

According to Maududi, this system would strike a "golden mean" between the two extremes of ''laisse faire'' capitalism and a regimented socialist/communist society,&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:5"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.5&lt;/ref&gt;   embodying all of the virtues and none of the vices of the two inferior systems.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 103"/&gt; It would not be some kind of [[mixed economy]]/[[Social democracy|social democratic]] compromise, because by following Islamic law and banning alcohol, pork, adultery, music, dancing, interest on loans, gambling, speculation, fraud, and "other similar things",&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:30"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.30&lt;/ref&gt; it would be distinct and superior to all other systems.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 103"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the economy (like the government, and other parts of society) could be Islamized, an Islamic revolution-through-education would have to take place to develop this virtue and create support for total ''sharia'' law.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 104"/&gt; This put Maududi at a political disadvantage with [[populist]] and [[socialist]] programs because his solution was "neither immediate nor tangible".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 105-6"/&gt;

==== Banning interest ====
Of all the elements of Islamic laws dealing with property and money (payment of [[zakat]] and other [[Islamic taxes]], etc.), Maududi emphasised the elimination of interest on loans ([[riba]]. (According to one scholar, because in British India [[Hindu]]s dominated the money lending trade.)&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maududi opposed any and all interest on loans as unIslamic ''riba''. He taught that there 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is hardly a country of the world in which moneylenders and banks are not sucking the blood of poor labouring classes, farmers and low income groups ...  A major portion of the earning of a working man is expropriated by the moneylenders, leaving the poor man with hardly enough money to feed himself and his family.&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:192"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; While the Quran forbid many sins, it saved its "severest terms" of punishment — according to Maududi — for use of interest.{{#tag:ref|" ... The Holy Quran forbids many other sins also and warnings of condign [sic] punishment for them have also been given, but in no other case have such severest terms been used as in the prohibition of usury"&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:166"/&gt;
|group=Note}} 

He believed there was no such thing as a low "reasonable rate of interest"&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:178-9"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: pp. 178–9&lt;/ref&gt; and that even "the smallest and apparently harmless form"&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:166"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.166&lt;/ref&gt; of interest was intolerable in Islam as rates would inevitably increased over time when the "capitalists" (moneylenders) squeezed the entrepreneurs (borrowers) eliminating any entrepreneurial profit.&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:181"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p.181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:63&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; To replace interest-based finance he proposed "|direct equity investment" ([[Profit and loss sharing]]), which he asserted would favor "societally profitable" ventures such as low-income housing that conventional finance ignores in favour of commercially profitable ones.&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:188"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the charging of interest he proposed penal punishment with the death penalty for repeat offenders.&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:199"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:65&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics (Feisal Khan) complain that Maududi had no training as an economist and his description of interest-based finance resembles that of the dynamic between South Asian peasant and village moneylender rather than between modern conventional bank and borrower, and further that Maududi gives no explanation why direct equity finance would lead to any more investment in what is good for society but not commercially profitable than interest-based lending has.&lt;ref name=FKIBP2015:64&gt;[[#FKIBP2015|Khan, ''Islamic Banking in Pakistan'', 2015]]: p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socialism and populism====
Unlike Islamists like Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], Maududi had a visceral antipathy to [[socialism]],&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 105-6"/&gt; which he spent much time denouncing as "godless" as well as being unnecessary and redundant in the face of the Islamic state.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 105-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A staunch defender of the rights of property he warned workers and peasants that "You must never take the exaggerated view of your rights which the protagonists of class war present before you."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 105-6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From the text of lecture at a Labour Committee convention in 1957; reprinted in Mawdudi, ''Economic System of Islam'', (1984) p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;
He also did not believe in intervention in the economy to provide universal employment.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam does not make it binding on society to provide employment for each and every one of its citizens, since this responsibility cannot be accepted without thorough nationalisation of the country's resources.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, Sayyid Abul-A'la, ''Capitalism, Socialism and Islam'', (Lahore, 1977), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maududi held to this position despite his florid denunciations of how the rich were "sucking the blood"&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:192"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; and enslaving&lt;ref name="SAAMESI1997:23"&gt;[[#SAAMESI1997|Maududi, ''Economic System of Islam'', n.d.]]: p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; the poor, the popularity of populism among many Pakistanis,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 105-6"/&gt; and despite the poverty and vast gap between rich and poor in Pakistan (which is often described an "[[Feudalism in Pakistan|feudal]]" (''jagirdari'') in its large landholdings and rural poverty). Maududi openly opposed land reform proposals for [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] by Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] in the 1950s, going so far as to justify feudalism by pointing to Islam's protection of property rights.&lt;ref name="Nasr-74"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later softened his views, extolling economic justice and equity (but not egalitarianism),&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 132"/&gt; but cautioned the government against tampering with "lawful ''Jagirdari''",&lt;ref name="Nasr-74"/&gt; and continuing to emphasise the sanctity of private property.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 132"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Modernism===
Maududi believed that Islam supported modernization but not [[Westernization]].&lt;ref name="Nasr-53"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=53}}: "[Islam] says "yes" to modernization but "no" to blind Westernisation."&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic Modernists]] that Islam contained nothing contrary to reason, and that it was superior in rational terms to all other religious systems. He disagreed with their practice of examining the Quran and the Sunnah using reason as the standard, instead of starting from the proposition that "true reason is Islamic" and accepting the Book and the Sunnah, rather than reason, as the final authority.
&lt;ref name="Mortimer-Faith-204-moder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mortimer|first=Edward |title=Faith and Power : the Politics of Islam|date=1982|publisher=Vintage Books
|page=204
|quote=He agreed with them in holding that Islam required the exercise of reason by the community to understand God's decrees, in believing, therefore, that Islam contains nothing contrary to reason, and in being convinced that Islam as revealed in the Book and the Sunna is superior in purely rational terms to all other systems. But he thought they had gone wrong in allowing themselves to judge the Book and the Sunna by the standard of reason. They had busied themselves trying to demonstrate that "Islam is truly reasonable" instead of starting, as he did, from the proposition that "true reason is Islamic". Therefore they were not sincerely accepting the Book and the Sunna as the final authority, because implicitly they were setting up human reason as a higher authority (the old error of the Mu'tazilites). In Maududi's view, once one has become a Muslim, reason no longer has any function of judgement. From then on its legitimate task is simply to spell out the implications of Islam's clear commands, the rationality of which requires no demonstration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also took a narrow view of ''[[ijtihad]]'', limiting the authority to use it to those with thorough grounding in Islamic sciences, faith in the ''sharia'', and then only to serve the needs of his vision of an Islamic state.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 107"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, one scholar, [[Maryam Jameelah]], has noted the extensive use of modern, non-traditionally Islamic ideas and "Western idioms and concepts" in Maududi's thought.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam was a "revolutionary ideology" and a "dynamic movement", the ''Jama'at-e-Islami'', was a "party", the ''Shari'ah'' a complete "code" in Islam's "total scheme of life." His enthusiasm for [Western idioms and concepts] was infectious among those who admired him, encouraging them to implement in Pakistan all his "manifestos", "programmes" and "schemes'", to usher in a true Islamic "renaissance".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 50"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJIQ1987&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jameelah|first1=Maryam|title=an Appraisal of Some Aspects of Maulana Sayyid Ala Maudoodi's Life and Thought|journal=Islamic Quarterly|date=1987|volume=31|issue=2|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mughal Empire===
Abul A'la Maududi, condemned [[Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]]'s belief in an individual's "personal religious equilibrium" (controversially known as the [[Din-e Ilahi]], or "Religion of God") as a form of [[apostasy]]. (Contemporary scholars such as [[S. M. Ikram]] argue that Akbar's true intentions were to create an ''iradat'' or ''muridi'' (discipleship) and not a new religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_12.html |chapter=XII. Religion at Akbar's Court|title= Muslim Civilization in India |first=S. M. |last=[[S. M. Ikram|Ikram]] |editor=Ainslie T. Embree|location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=1964 |quote=(Page of Prof. Emerita Frances W. Pritchett, Columbia University)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secularism===
Maududi did not see [[secularism]] as a way for the state/government to dampen tensions and divisions in multi-religious societies by remaining religiously neutral and avoid choosing sides. Rather, he believed, it removed religion from society (he translated secularism into Urdu as ''la din'', literally "religionless"&lt;ref name="Adams-"&gt;Adams, Charles J., "Mawdudi and the Islamic State," in John L. Esposito, ed., ''Voices of Resurgent Islam'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;). Since (he believed) all morality came from religion, this would necessarily mean "the exclusion of all morality, ethics, or human decency from the controlling mechanisms of society."&lt;ref name="Adams-113"&gt;Adams, Charles J., "Mawdudi and the Islamic State," in John L. Esposito, ed., ''Voices of Resurgent Islam'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; It was to avoid the "restraints of morality and divine guidance", and not out of pragmatism or some higher motive, that some espoused secularism.&lt;ref name="adams-114-sec"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adams, Charles J.|editor1-last=Esposito|editor1-first=John L.|title=Voices of Resurgent Islam|date=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=113–4|chapter=Maududi and the Islamic State|quote=[Maududi believed that] when religion is relegated to the personal realm, men inevitably give way to their bestial impulses and perpetrate evil upon one another. In fact it is precisely because they wish to escape the restraints of morality and the divine guidance that men espouse secularism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
Maududi believed "modern science was a 'body' that could accommodate any 'spirit'—philosophy or value system—just as radio could broadcast Islamic or Western messages with equal facility."&lt;ref name="Nasr-53-science"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=53}}: "modern science was a 'body' that could accommodate any 'spirit' – philosophy or value system – just as radio could broadcast Islami or Western messages with equal facility."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
Maududi strongly opposed the concept of [[nationalism]], believing it to be ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' (polytheism),&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 54"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Nationalism in India'', 1947, pp 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; and "a Western concept which divided the Muslim world and thus prolonged the supremacy of Western imperialist powers".&lt;ref name="atimes-grare"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DJ26Df02.html Political Islam in the Indian Subcontinent] by Frederic Grare |BOOK REVIEW |Anatomy of Islamism |South Asia |Asia Times&lt;/ref&gt; After Pakistan was formed, Maududi and the JI forbade Pakistanis to take an oath of allegiance to the state until it became Islamic, arguing that a Muslim could in clear conscience render allegiance only to God.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, ''Vanguard of the Islamic Revolution'', 1994, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ulama===
Maududi also criticized traditionalist clergy or [[ulama]] for their "moribund" scholastic style, "servile" political attitudes, and "ignorance" of the modern world".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 115"/&gt; He believed traditional scholars were unable to distinguish the fundamentals of Islam from the details of its application, built up in elaborate structures of medieval [[Madhhab|legal schools]] of [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence). To rid Islam of these obscure laws Muslims should return to the Quran and Sunna, ignoring judgments made after the reign of the first four "rightfully guided" caliphs (''[[Rashidun|al-Khulafāʾu ar-Rāshidūn]]'') of Islam.&lt;ref name="Mortimer-Faith-203-moder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mortimer|first=Edward |title=Faith and Power : the Politics of Islam|date=1982|publisher=Vintage Books
|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maududi also believed there would be little need for the traditional roll of ulama as "leaders, judges, and guardians of the community", in a "reformed and rationalized Islamic order" where those trained in modern as well as traditional subjects would practice ijtihad and where Muslims were educated properly in Arabic, the Quran, Hadith, etc.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 115"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time Maududi became more orthodox in his attitudes,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 109"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; including toward the ulama, and at times allied himself and his party with them after the formation of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 116-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism and popular Islam===
Like other contemporary [[Islamic revival#Contemporary revivalism|revivalists]], Maududi was critical of [[Sufism]] and its historical influence in the early days.&lt;ref name=nasr122&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=122}}: "... he held Sufism accountable for causing the decline of Islam throughout history, referring to it as ''chuniya begum'' (lady opium). He believed that Sufism had misled Mughal rulers like Emperor Akbar and his son Dara Shukuh into gravitating toward syncretic experiments."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abdul Hamid |first1=Ahmad Fauzi |date=2013 |chapter=4.

But he also went on record denying any antagonism toward Sufism by himself or the Jama'at.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This happened in 1951, (source: ''Tarjumanu'l-Qur'an'', September 1951, pp. 55–6, and November 1951, pp. 34–36)&lt;/ref&gt; (According to at least one biographer, this change in position was a result of the importance of Sufism in Pakistan not only among the Muslim masses but the ulama as well.&lt;ref name="nasr122-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism |1996|p=122}}: "... Sufism was of great importance to the major ulama groups in Pakistan, the [[Deobandi]]s and the [[Barelvi]]s, and they found Mawdudi's attacks on Sufism just as contentious as his exegeses on juridical and theological matters.. In [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sind]], Sufism played an important role in the popular culture of the masses and eventually in their politics."&lt;/ref&gt;)
At that time, Maududi distinguished between the Sufism of Shaikhs like `Alau'ddin Shah (which he approved of) and the shrines, festivals, and rituals of popular Sufism (which he did not).&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 123"/&gt;
He also "redefined" Sufism, describing it not in the traditional sense as the form and spirit of an "esoteric dimension" of Islam, but as the way to measure "concentration" and "morals" in religion, saying: "For example, when we say our prayers, ''[[Fiqh]]'' will judge us only by fulfillment of the outward requirements such as ablution, facing toward the [[Ka'ba]] ... while ''Tasawwuf'' (Sufism) will judge our prayers by our concentration ... the effect of our prayers on our morals and manners."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 123"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, S.A.A., ''Towards Understanding Islam'', (Indianapolis, 1977), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1960s onward, "redefinition" of Islam "increasingly gave way to outright recognition of Sufism," and after Maududi's death the JI amir [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan#Qazi Hussain Ahmad (1987–2008)|Qazi Hussain Ahmad]] went so far as to visit the Sufi [[Data Durbar Complex|Data Durbar shrine]] in Lahore in 1987 as part of a tour to generate mass support for JI.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 124"/&gt;

===Sharia===
Maududi believed that [[sharia]] was not just a crucial command that helped define what it meant to be a Muslim, but something without which a Muslim society could not be Islamic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That if an Islamic society consciously resolves not to accept the sharia, and decides to enact its own constitution and laws or borrow them from any other source in disregard of the sharia, such a society breaks its contract with God and forfeits its right to be called 'Islamic.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, S. Abul A'la, ''Islamic Law and Its Introduction,'' Islamic Publications, LTD, 1955, pp. 13–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many unbelievers agreed that God was the creator, what made them unbelievers was their failure to submit to his will, i.e. to God's law. Obedience to God's law or will was "the historical controversy that Islam has awakened" throughout the world. It brought not only heavenly reward, but earthly blessing. Failure to obey, or "rebellion" against it, brought not only eternal punishment, but evil and misery here on earth.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 112"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of sharia, was to be found not only in the Quran but also in the [[Sunnah]] (the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]), since the Quran proclaimed "Whoever obeys the messenger [i.e. Muhammad] obeys Allah."{{cite quran|4|80}}&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 116"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharia was perhaps most famous for calling for the abolition of interest-bearing banks, [[Hudud#Punishments|hadd penalties]] such as flogging and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, fornication, adultery and other crimes.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-330-1"/&gt; Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of [[International human rights law|international human rights]] but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 98"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, S. Abul A'la, ''Human Rights in Islam'', Islamic Foundation, 1976, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, S. Abul A'la, ''Islamic Law and Its Introduction,'' Islamic Publications, LTD, 1955, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 98"/&gt;

But in fact ''sharia'' was much more than these laws. It recognizes no division between religion and other aspects of life, in Maududi's view,&lt;ref&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 165"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was no area of human activity or concern which the ''sharia'' did not address with specific divine guidance.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Family relationships, social and economic affairs, administration, rights and duties of citizens, judicial system, laws of war and peace and international relations. In short it embraces all the various departments of life ... The ''sharia'' is a complete scheme of life and an all-embracing social order where nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Mawdudi, ''Islamic Law'', p. 57 quoted in Adams p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PTI-4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Sayyid Abdul al'al|title=Political Theory of Islam|date=1960|publisher=Islamic Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=4|edition=1993|quote=... And Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) ... revealed the final code of human guidance, in all its completeness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A "very large part" of sharia required "the coercive power and authority of the state" for its enforcement.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, while a state based on Islam has a legislature which the ruler must consult, its function "is really that of law-finding, not of law-making."&lt;ref&gt;Mawdudi, ''Islamic Law'', p. 77 quoted in Adams p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Maududi states ("somewhat astonishingly" according to one scholar&lt;ref name="adams-126-independent"/&gt;) "there is yet another vast range of human affairs about which ''sharia'' is totally silent" and which an Islamic state may write "independent" legislation.&lt;ref name="adams-126-independent"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adams, Charles J.|editor1-last=Esposito|editor1-first=John L.|title=Voices of Resurgent Islam|date=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=126|chapter=Maududi and the Islamic State|quote= ... The fourth and final mode of 'legislation' Maududi characterizes somewhat astonishingly as the 'province of independent legislation'. The 'independence' of the legislature in this sphere derives from the fact that '... there is yet another vast range of human affairs about which ''Shariah'' is totally silent.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar [[Vali Nasr]], Maududi believed that the ''sharia'' needed to be "streamlined, reinterpreted, and expanded" to "address questions of governance to the extent required for a state to function." For example, ''sharia'' needed to "make clear the relation between the various branches of government".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 97"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Revolution===
Though the phrase "Islamic Revolution" is commonly associated with the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; (or General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]]'s Islamisation&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 78"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Maududi coined and popularized it in the 1940s. The process Maududi envisioned—changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or ''da'wah''&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 77"/&gt;—was very different than what happened in Iran, or under Zia ul-Haq. Maududi talked of Islam being "a revolutionary ideology and a revolutionary practice which aims at destroying the social order of the world totally and rebuilding it from scratch",&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''The Process of Islamic Revolution''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arjomand |first=Said Amir |date=2000 |chapter=Iran's Islamic Revolution in Comparative Perspective |editor-last=Haghighat |editor-first=Sadegh |title=Six Theories about the Islamic Revolution's Victory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wRQGoASwlEC&amp;pg=PA122 |publisher=Alhoda UK |page=122 |isbn=978-964-472-229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerman-500"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerman |first=Eran |date=October 1981 |title=Mawdudi's Concept of Islam |journal=Middle Eastern Studies|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=17 |issue=4 |page=500 |doi=10.1080/00263208108700487 |jstor=4282856}}&lt;/ref&gt; but opposed sudden change, violent or unconstitutional action, and was uninterested in grassroots organizing or socio-economic changes.

His "revolution" would be achieved "step-by-step"&lt;ref&gt;''Short Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference, Jamaat-e-Islami, East Pakistan'', (Dacca, 1958), p 8; enclosed with U.S. Consulate, Dacca, Dispatch no.247, 3 April 1958, 790D.00/4-358, United States National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 70"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "patience",&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 71"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; since "the more sudden a change, the more short-lived it is."&lt;ref&gt;Mawdudi, Sayyid Abu'l-A'la, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', (Karachi, 1955), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
He warned against the emotionalism of "demonstrations or agitations, ... flag waving, slogans ... impassioned speeches ... or the like",&lt;ref&gt;''Rudad-i Jama'at-i Islami'', 1:49–50 [proceedings of various Jama'at congresses between 1941 and 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that "societies are built, structured, and controlled from the top down by conscious manipulation of those in power,"&lt;ref name=DES&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Donald E.|title=South Asian Politics and Religion|date=1966|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=388–9|chapter=The Ideology of Mawlana Mawdud}}&lt;/ref&gt; not by grassroots movements. The revolution would be carried out by training a cadre of pious and dedicated men who would lead and then protect the Islamic revolutionary process.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 77"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this far-reaching program of cultural change, his party "invested heavily" in producing and disseminating publications.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 78"/&gt;

Maududi was committed to non-violent legal politics "even if the current methods of struggle takes a century to bear fruit."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 76"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he outlined a new Jama'at policy declaring that "transformation of the political order through unconstitutional means" was against ''sharia'' law.&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Mawdudi, ''Tahrik-i Islami ka a`indah la`ihah-i `amal'', Lahore, 1986, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Even when he and his party were repressed by the [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] or [[Pakistan Peoples Party|People's Party]] (in 1972) governments, Maududi kept his party from clandestine activity.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 73"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until he retired as emir of JI that JI and Jam'iat-e Tulabah "became more routinely involved in violence."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 132"/&gt;

The objective of the revolution was to be justice (''`adl'') and benevolence (''ihsan''), but the injustice and wrong to be overcome that he focused on was immorality (''fahsha`'') and forbidden behavior (''munkarat'').&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 76"/&gt; Maududi was interested in ethical changes, rather than socio-economic changes of the sort that drive most historical revolutions and revolutionary movements. He did not support these (for example, opposing land reform in the 1950s as an encroachment on property rights&lt;ref name="Nasr-74"/&gt;) and believed the problems they addressed would be solved by the Islamic state established by the revolution.

All this left at least one commentator, ([[Vali Nasr]]), to wonder if Maudidi had any actual interest in "revolution" (or "ideology"), or saw them simply as [[buzzword]]s necessary to indicate commitment to "progress, justice, and political idealism" in the anti-colonialist political milieu of 20th century South Asia.&lt;ref name="Nasr-71-rev"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=71}}: "In Mawdudi's conception, revolution and its corollary, ideology, had no class reference. They simply permitted Mawdudi to equip the Jama'at with a repertoire of terms that allowed the party to stand its ground in debates over what constituted progress, justice, and political idealism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic state===
{{further information|Islamic state}}
The modern conceptualization of the "[[Islamic state]]" is also attributed to Maududi.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|loc=Ch. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term was coined and popularized in his book, ''The Islamic Law and Constitution'' (1941),&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: v"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p. v&lt;/ref&gt; and in subsequent writings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

Maududi's Islamic state is both ideological and all-embracing,&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 119"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on "[[Islamic Democracy]],"&lt;ref&gt;Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, "Political Theory of Islam," in Khurshid Ahmad, ed., Islam: Its Meaning and Message (London: Islamic Council of Europe, 1976), pp. 159–61.&lt;/ref&gt; and will eventually "rule the earth".&lt;ref name="PTI-35"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Sayyid Abdul al'al|title=Political Theory of Islam|date=1960|publisher=Islamic Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=35|edition=1993|quote=the power to rule over the earth has been promised to ''the whole community of believers''. [italics original]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he described it as a "God-worshipping democratic Caliphate, founded on the guidance vouchsafed to us through Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Abu'l-A'la Mawdudi, ''The Message of Jam'at-i-Islami'', (Lahore, 1955), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 88"&gt;(Nasr speaking) {{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately though, Islam was more important and the state would be judged by its adherence to ''din'' (religion and the Islamic system) and not democracy.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 93"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Islamic state of Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]], it would not establish and enforce Islamisation, but ''follow'' the Islamisation of society. As Maududi became involved in politics, this vision was "relegated to a distant utopia".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 87,95"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=87,&amp;nbsp;95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three principles underlying it: ''[[tawhid]]'' (oneness of God), ''risala'' (prophethood) and ''[[khilafa]]'' (caliphate).&lt;ref&gt;Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, Islamic Way of Life (Delhi: Markazi Maktaba Islami, 1967), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito and Piscatory, "Democratization and Islam," pp. 436–7, 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, The Islamic Threat, pp. 125–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voll and Esposito, ''Islam and Democracy'', pp. 23–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The "sphere of activity" covered by the [[Islamic state]] would be "co-extensive with human life ... In such a state no one can regard any field of his affairs as personal and private."&lt;ref name="law-154"&gt;Mawdudi, ''Islamic Law'', p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic state recognizes the sovereignty of God, which meant God was the source of all law.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 115"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic state acts as the [[vicegerent]] or agent of God on earth{{cite quran|24|55}}&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 116"/&gt; and enforces Islamic law, which as mentioned above is both all-embracing and "totally silent" on a "vast range of human affairs".&lt;ref name="adams-126-independent"/&gt; While the government follows the ''sharia'' law, when it comes to a question about which no explicit injunction is to be found in the ''sharia'', the matter is "settled by consensus among the Muslims."&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 148"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 117"/&gt;

The state can be called a [[caliphate]], but the "caliph" would not be the traditional descendant of the [[Quraysh tribe]]&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 94"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; but (Maududi believed) the entire Muslim community, a "popular vicegerency".&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 116"/&gt; (Although there would also be an individual leader chosen by the Muslim community.) Thus the state would be not a "theocracy", but a "theodemocracy".&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 117"/&gt;
Maududi believed that the sovereignty of God (''hakimiya'') and the sovereignty of the people are mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, "Political Theory of Islam," in John J. Donahue and John L. Esposito, eds., ''Islam in Transition: Muslim Perspective'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sovereignty of human beings is simply the domination of man by man, the source of most human misery and calamity.&lt;ref name="adams-102-elite"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adams, Charles J.|editor1-last=Esposito|editor1-first=John L.|title=Voices of Resurgent Islam|date=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115|chapter=Maududi and the Islamic State|quote=Maududi traces the root cause of most human misery and calamity to the tendency of men to dominate over other men, either by claiming themselves to be ''rabbs'' or ''ilahs'' or by investing idols, objects, political parties, ideologies, etc., with the qualities of ''rabb'' or ''ilah'', and then manipulating the credulity of other men for their own purposes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Governance based on sovereignty other than that of God's does not just lead to inferior governance and "injustice and maladministration", but "evil."&lt;ref name=1stmaudud&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Maulana|title=First Principles of the Islamic State|date=1960|publisher=Islamic Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=21|quote=no creature has the right to impose his will or words on other creatures and ... this is a right exclusively reserved for God himself ... if we invest some human agency with superhuman mantle of sovereignty ... injustice and maladministration of the most contagious type [invariably results] .... Evil is inherent in the nature of such a system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, while Maududi used the term democracy to describe his state,&lt;ref name="1stmaudud-26"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Maulana|title=First Principles of the Islamic State|date=1960|publisher=Islamic Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=26|quote=... what we Muslims call democracy is a system wherein the people enjoy only the right of Khilafat or vicegerency of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=renamed_from_101_on_20150111234030&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maududi|first1=Abul Ala|title=Essential Features of the Islamic Political System|url=http://www.islam101.com/politics/politicalsystem.htm|website=Islam 101|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in part to appeal to Westernized Muslim intellectuals),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=86}}: "Because Maududi was compelled to directly address the question of the nature of authority in the Islamic state if he was to win Westernized intellectuals over, he used democracy to deal with their concerns."&lt;/ref&gt; his "[[Islamic democracy]]" was to be the antithesis of [[secular]] Western democracy which transfers ''[[hakimiya]]'' (God's sovereignty) to the people,&lt;ref&gt;Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, Political Theory of Islam (Lahore: Islamic Publications, 1976), pp. 13, 15–7, 38, 75–82.&lt;/ref&gt; who may pass laws without regard for God's commands.

The Islamic state would conduct its affairs by mutual consultation (''shura'') among all Muslims.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 117"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The means of consultation should suit the conditions of the particular time and place but must be free and impartial. While the government follows the ''sharia'' law,  when it comes to a question about which no explicit injunction is to be found in the ''sharia'', the matter is "settled by consensus among the Muslims."&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 117"/&gt; Maududi favored giving the state exclusive right to the power of declaring ''[[jihad]]'' and ''[[ijtihad]]'' (establishing an Islamic law through "independent reasoning"), traditionally the domain of the ''ulama''.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 90"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rights
While no aspect of life was to be considered "personal and private"&lt;ref name="law-154"/&gt; and the danger of foreign influence and conspiracies was ever present, (nationalism, for example, was "a Western concept which divided the Muslim world and thus prolonged the supremacy of Western imperialist powers"&lt;ref name="atimes-grare"/&gt;), there would also be personal freedom and no suspicion of government.
Maududi's time spent in jail as a political prisoner led him to have a personal interest in individual rights, due process of law, and freedom of political expression.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 87"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Maududi stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This espionage on the life of the individual cannot be justified on moral grounds by the government saying that it is necessary to know the secrets of the dangerous persons.... This is exactly what Islam has called as the root cause of mischief in politics. The injunction of the Prophet is: "When the ruler begins to search for the causes of dissatisfaction amongst his people, he spoils them" (Abu Dawud).&lt;ref&gt;Maududi,''Human Rights in Islam'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the basic human right in Islamic law was to demand an Islamic order and to live in it. Not included were any rights to differ with its rulers and defy its authority.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 92"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Islamic Constitution
According to Maududi, Islam had an "[[Uncodified constitution|unwritten constitution]]" that needed "to be transformed into a written one".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''First Principles'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution would not be the ''sharia'' (or the Quran, as Saudi Arabia's constitution is alleged to be) but a religious document based on "conventions" of the "[[Rashidun|rightly guided caliphs]]", and the "canonized verdicts of recognized jurists" (i.e. the ''sharia'') as well as the Quran and hadith.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 97"/&gt;

;Model of government
In expanding on what the government of an Islamic state should look like in his book ''The Islamic Law and Constitution'', Maududi took as his model the government of Muhammad and the first four caliphs (''[[Rashidun|al-Khulafāʾu ar-Rāshidūn]]''). The head of state should be the supreme head of legislature, executive and judiciary alike, but under him these three organs should function "separately and independently of one another." This head of state should be elected and must enjoy the country's confidence, but he is not limited to terms in office.&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 211"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p.211&lt;/ref&gt; No one is allowed to nominate him for the office, nor to engage in electioneering or run for office, according to another source.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 90"/&gt;
Because "more than one correct position" could not exist, "pluralism", i.e. competition between political views/parties, would not be allowed,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 90"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jasarat&gt;cited in ''Jasarat'', 28 October 1978, pp. 1, 9, Muhammad Mujeed characterized Mawdudi's program as naive: see Mujeeb, Muhammad, ''The Indian Muslims'', (London, 1967), p.403&lt;/ref&gt; and there would be only one party.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 99"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Maududi believed the state had no need to govern in the Western sense of the term, since the government and citizenry would abide by the same "infallible and inviolable divine law", power would not corrupt and no one would feel oppressed. Power and resources would be distributed fairly. There would be no grievances, no mass mobilizations, demands for political participation, or any other of the turmoil of non-Islamic governance.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 85-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the prophet had told early Muslims "My community will never agree on an error", there was no need for establishing concrete procedures and mechanisms for popular consultation.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 91"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Bernard, "Idjma" in ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the state would be defined by its ideology—not by boundaries or ethnicity—its ''raison d'etre'' and protector would be ideology, the purity of which must be protected against any efforts to subvert it.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 100"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally it must be controlled and run exclusively by Muslims,&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not just any Muslims but only "those who believe in the ideology on which it is based and in the Divine Law which it is assigned to administer".&lt;ref name="law-155"&gt;Mawdudi, ''Islamic Law'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PTI-31"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Sayyid Abdul al'al|title=Political Theory of Islam|date=1960|publisher=Islamic Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=31|edition=1993|quote=It is clear from a careful consideration of the Qura'an and the Sunnah that the state in Islam is based on an ideology ... the community that runs the Islam State ... those who do not accept it are not entitled to have any hand in shaping the fundamental policy of the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's legislature "should consist of a body of such learned men who have the ability and the capacity to interpret Quranic injunctions and who in giving decisions, would not take liberties with the spirit or the letter of the ''sharia''".
Their legislation would be based on the practice of ''[[ijtihad]]''&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 95"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a source of Islamic law, relying on careful analogical reasoning, using both the Qu'ran and Hadith, to find a solution to a legal problem), making it more a legal organ than a political one.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 95"/&gt;
They must also be "persons who enjoy the confidence of the masses". They may be chosen by "the modern system of elections", or by some other method which is appropriate to "the circumstances and needs of modern times."&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 211"/&gt; Since upright character is essential for office holders and desire for office represents greed and ambition, anyone actively seeking an office of leadership would be automatically disqualified.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims or women may not be a head of state but could vote for separate legislators.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 237,308"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=237,&amp;nbsp;308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Maududi envisioned a legislature only as a consultative body, but later proposed using a referendum to deal with possible conflicts between the head of state and the legislature, with the loser of the referendum resigning.&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 211-32"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p.211-32&lt;/ref&gt; Another later rule was allowing the formation of parties and factions during elections of representatives but not within the legislature.&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 211"/&gt;

In the judiciary, Maududi originally proposed the inquisitional system where judges implement law without discussion or interference by lawyers, which he saw as un-Islamic. After his party was "rescued" from government repression by the Pakistani judiciary he changed his mind, supporting autonomy of the judiciary and accepting the adversarial system and right of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=97}}: "In the beginning, Mawdudi had rejected both the adversarial system and the tole of lawyers as immoral and un-Islamic, arguing that Islam accepted only an inquisitional system in which the judge was the final authority ... without discussion or the interference of lawyers ... Then in 1948, 1953, and again in 1963, when the Pakistan government tried to crush the Jama'at, it had been the judiciary that rescued the party. Mawdudui and the Jama'at consequently favored the autonomy of the Pakistani judiciary and accepted the adversarial system and the right to appeal as beneficial ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Failure" of Western democracy====

Secular Western representative democracy—despite its free elections and civil rights—is a failure (Maududi believed) for two reasons. Because secular society has "divorced" politics and religion (Maududi believed), its leaders have "ceased to attach much or any importance to morality and ethics" and so ignore their constituents' interests and the common good. Furthermore, without Islam "the common people are incapable of perceiving their own true interests". An example being the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition law]] in the United States, where despite the fact that "it had been rationally and logically established that drinking is injurious to health, produces deleterious disorder in human society" (Maududi states), the law banning alcohol consumption was repealed by the [[American Congress]].
&lt;ref name=Mawdudi-pol-theor-23-5
&gt;{{cite book |last=Mawdudi |first=Abul A'la |title=Political Theory of Islam |others=Khurshid Ahmad, translator |date=1960 |edition=8th, 1993 |publisher=Islamic Publications |quote=The people delegate their sovereignty to their elected representative [who] make and enforce laws. [Because of the] divorce ... between politics and religion ... society ... have ceased to attach much or any importance to morality and ethics ... these representatives ... soon set themselves up as an independent authority and assume the position of overlords ... They often make laws not in the best interest of the people  ... but to further their own sectional and class interests ... This is the situation which besets people in England, America and in all those countries which claim to be the haven of secular democracy.&lt;br /&gt; [Second reason is] it has been established by experience that the great mass of the common people are incapable of perceiving their own true interests [and] quite often ... reject the pleas of reason simply because it conflicts with [their] passion and desire.

They delegated their own desires and passions as their ''ilah''s (gods) at whose call they all went in for the repeal of [prohibition]. |pages=23–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Muslims===

Maududi believed that copying cultural practices of non-Muslims was forbidden in Islam, having
&lt;blockquote&gt;very disastrous consequences upon a nation; it destroys its inner vitality, blurs its vision, befogs its critical faculties, breeds inferiority complexes, and gradually but assuredly saps all the springs of [[culture]] and sounds its death-knell. That is why the [[Muhammad|Holy Prophet]] has positively and forcefully forbidden the Muslims to assume the culture and mode of life of the non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi, ''Towards Understanding Islam'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was appalled at (what he saw as) the &lt;blockquote&gt;satanic flood of female liberty and licence which threatens to destroy human civilisation in the West.&lt;ref name="PTI-27"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Sayyid Abdul al'al|title=Political Theory of Islam|date=1960|publisher=Islamic Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=27|edition=1993|quote=[Under Islamic law] There would remain neither that tyranny of cruelty and oppression, nor that satanic flood of female liberty and licence which threatens to destroy human civilisation in the West.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maududi strongly opposed the small [[Ahmadiyya in Pakistan|Ahmadiyya]] sect, a Muslim sect which Maududi and many other Muslims do not consider as Muslim. He preached against Ahmadiyya in his pamphlet ''The Qadiani Question'' and the book ''The Finality of Prophethood''.&lt;ref name="Valentine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q78O1mjX2tMC&amp;dq=Islam+and+the+Ahmadiyya+Jama'at+By+Simon+Ross+Valentine&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2go2q2ktts&amp;sig=OiDPLVvy0CGCheSlYcUw9gw1d8g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TIseS9LyFoKGNtGgkKwK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAwQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=finality&amp;f=false|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaʻat|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Under the Islamic state
The rights of non-Muslims are limited under Islamic state as laid out in Maududi's writings. Although non-Muslim "faith, ideology, rituals of worship or social customs" would not be interfered with, non-Muslims would have to accept Muslim rule.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Islamic 'jihad' does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which, in the view of Islam, is evil. Furthermore, Islamic 'jihad' also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an Islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Sayeed Abdul A'la Maududi, ''Jihad in Islam,'' Islamic Publications (Pvt.) Ltd, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-Muslims would be eligible for "all kinds of employment", but must be "rigorously excluded from influencing policy decisions"&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Charles J., "Mawdudi and the Islamic State," in John L. Esposito, ed., ''Voices of Resurgent Islam'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn-IS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iqbal|first1=Anwar|title=Fighting the IS: Holes in the game plan|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1131724|website=Dawn.com|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so not hold "key posts" in government and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 237"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: p.237&lt;/ref&gt;
They would not have the right to vote in presidential elections or in elections of Muslim representatives. This is to ensure that "the basic policy of this ideological state remains in conformity with the fundamentals of Islam." An Islamic Republic may however allow non-Muslims to elect their own representatives to parliament, voting as separate electorates (as in the [[Religion in Iran#Reserved Parliament seats|Islamic Republic of Iran]]).&lt;ref name="ILaC1977: 236,282"&gt;[[#ILaC1977|Maududi, ''Islamic Law and Constitution'', 1977]]: pp.236, 282, 288–97&lt;/ref&gt; While some might see this as discrimination, Islam has been the most just, the most tolerant and the most generous of all political systems in its treatment of minorities, according to Maududi.&lt;ref name="CJA1983: 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State|1983|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims would also have to pay a traditional special tax known as [[jizya]]. Under Maududi's Islamic state, this tax would be applicable to all able-bodied non-Muslim men—elderly, children and women being exempt—in return from their exemption from military service, (which all adult Muslim men would be subject to).&lt;ref name="ILC-292"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Sayyid Abul A'La|title=The Islamic Law &amp; Constitution|publisher=Islamic Books.|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HNl6NexdpPYC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=jizya+maududi#v=onepage&amp;q=jizya%20maududi&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 January 2015|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who serve in the military are exempted. Non-Muslims would also be barred from holding certain high level offices in the Islamic state.&lt;ref name="Ruthven-330-1"/&gt; [[Jizya]] is thus seen as a tax paid in return for protection from foreign invasion,&lt;ref&gt;Abul A'la Mawdudi, ''The Meaning of the Qur'an'', (Islamic Publications Ltd., Lahore (1993 edition), vol 2, pp. 183 &amp; 186 (last paragraph)).&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a symbol of Islamic sovereignty.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Jews and the Christians ... should be forced to pay Jizya in order to put an end to their independence and supremacy so that they should not remain rulers and sovereigns in the land. These powers should be wrested from them by the followers of the true Faith, who should assume the sovereignty and lead others towards the Right Way.&lt;ref&gt;Abul A'la Mawdudi, ''The Meaning of the Qur'an'', vol 2, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jihad===
Maududi's first work to come to public attention was ''Al Jihad fil-Islam'' ("Jihad in Islam"), which was serialized in a newspaper in 1927, when he was only twenty-four.&lt;ref name="TUI-intro"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maududi|first1=Abul A'la|title=Towards Understanding Islam |url=http://www.teachislam.com/dmdocuments/Maulana_Maududi_Towards_Understanding_Islam_(Translated_by_Khurram_Murad).pdf |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he maintained that because Islam is all-encompassing, the Islamic state was for all the world and should not be limited to just the "homeland of Islam". ''[[Jihad]]'' should be used to eliminate un-Islamic rule and establish the worldwide Islamic state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of Islam, regardless of the country or the nation which rules it. The purpose of Islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme, regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard-bearer of
Islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological Islamic State. Islam requires the earth—not just a portion, but the whole planet.... because the entire mankind should benefit from the ideology and welfare programme [of Islam] ... Towards this end, Islam wishes to press into service all forces which can bring about a revolution and a composite term for the use of all these forces is '[[Jihad]]'.... the objective of the Islamic 'jihād' is to eliminate the rule of an un-Islamic system and establish in its stead an Islamic system of state rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muhammadanism.org/Terrorism/jihah_in_islam/jihad_in_islam.pdf Sayeed Abdul A'la Maududi, ''Jihad in Islam''], pp. 6, 7, 22&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maududi taught that the destruction of the lives and property of others was lamentable (part of the great sacrifice of jihad), but that Muslims must follow the Islamic principle that it is better to "suffer a lesser loss to save ourselves from a greater loss". Though in jihad "thousands" of lives may be lost, this cannot compare "to the calamity that may befall mankind as a result of the victory of evil over good and of aggressive atheism over the religion of God."
&lt;ref name=Mawdudi-under-105
&gt;{{cite book|last=Mawdudi|first=Abul A'la |title=Towards Understanding Islam|others=Khurshid Ahmad, translator|date=November 1979|publisher=Islamic Publications
|page=105
|quote=The greatest sacrifice for God is made in Jihad, for in it a man sacrifices not only his own life and property in His cause but destroys those of others also. But, as already stated, one of the Islamic principles is that we should suffer a lesser loss to save ourselves from a greater loss. How can the loss of some lives – even if the number runs into thousands – be compared to the calamity that may befall mankind as a result of the victory of evil over good and of aggressive atheism over the religion of God. That would be a far greater loss and calamity, for as a result of it not only would the religion of God be under dire threat, the world would also become the abode of evil and perversion, and life would be disrupted both from within and without.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explained that [[jihad]] was not only combat for God but any effort that helped those waging combat (''qitaal''), including non-violent work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the jihad in the way of Allah, active combat is not always the role on the battlefield, nor can everyone fight in the front line. Just for one single battle preparations have often to be made for decades on end and the plans deeply laid, and while only some thousands fight in the front line there are behind them millions engaged in various tasks which, though small themselves, contribute directly to the supreme effort.&lt;ref name="Permanent Jihad"&gt;Vol 2. No1. of ''The Faithful Struggle'' in the section entitled "Permanent Jihad."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time he took a more conservative line on jihad than other revivalist thinkers (such as Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] and [[Sayyid Qutb]]). In general, he argued that jihad should not denote "a crazed faith ... blood-shot eyes, shouting ''Allahu akbar'', decapitating an unbeliever wherever they see one, cutting off heads while invoking ''La ilaha illa-llah'' [there is no god but God]". During a cease-fire with India (in 1948), he opposed the waging of jihad in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]], stating that Jihad could be proclaimed only by Muslim governments, not by religious leaders.&lt;ref name="Nasr-74"/&gt;

==Mystique, personality, personal life==
As Jama'at amir, he remained in close contact with JI members, conducting informal discussions everyday in his house between Asar and Maghrib salat prayers,&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 129"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; although according to some, in later years discussion was replaced by answers to members questions with any rebuttals ignored.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 130"/&gt;

For his votaries in Jama'at, Maududi was not only a "revered scholar, politician, and thinker, but a hallowed ''[[Mujaddid]]''."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 140"/&gt;
Adding to his mystic was his survival of assassination attempts, while the Jama'at's enemies ([[Liaquat Ali Khan]], Ghulam Muhammad, [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], "fell from grace" or were killed.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 138"/&gt;

He had a powerful command of ''[[Urdu]]'' language which he insisted on using, in order to "free Muslims minds from the influence of English."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 131"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In private he has been described as "strict but not rigid", taciturn, poised, composed, uncompromising and unyielding.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 128"/&gt; His biographers have talked of his ''karanat'' (special gifts) and ''haybah'' (great presence)."&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 138"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His public speaking style has been described as having "great authority". Maududi would make his argument step-by-step with Islamic edicts, rather than attempting to excite his audience with oratory.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 130"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not publicize the fact, Maududi was a practitioner of traditional medicine or ''unani tibb''.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 128"/&gt;

===Family and health===
Maududi has been described as close to his wife, but not able to spend much time with his six sons and three daughters due to his commitments to religious [[dawah]] and political action. Only one of his offspring, ever joined the JI. And only his second daughter Asma, showed "any scholarly promise".&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 127"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maududi suffered from a kidney ailment most of his life. He was often bedridden in 1945 and 1946, and in 1969 was forced to travel to England for treatment.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 127"/&gt;

===Late life===
In April 1979, Maududi's long-time kidney ailment worsened and by then he also had heart problems. He went to the United States for treatment and was hospitalized in [[Buffalo, New York]], where his second son worked as a physician. Following a few surgical operations, he died on 22 September 1979, at the age of 75. His funeral was held in Buffalo, but he was buried in an unmarked grave at his residence in [[Ichhra]], [[Lahore]] after a very large funeral procession through the city.&lt;ref name=famous/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Grave maududi.jpg|thumb|Grave of Abul Ala Maududi]]
In Pakistan, (where the JI claims to be the oldest religious party&lt;ref name=globalsec&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm Jamaat-e-Islami], [http://www.globalsecurity.org/ GlobalSecurity.org]. Retrieved 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) it is "hard to exaggerate the importance" of that country's "current drift" toward Maududi's "version of Islam", according to scholar Eran Lerman.&lt;ref name=Lerman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerman |first=Eran |date=October 1981 |title=Maududi's Concept of Islam |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=492–509 |doi=10.1080/00263208108700487 |jstor=4282856 |quote=it is hard to exaggerate the importance of its [Pakistan's] current drift toward's Maududi's version of Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His background as a journalist, thinker, scholar and political leader has been compared to Indian independence leader [[Abul Kalam Azad]] by admiring biographers.&lt;ref name="SVRN1996: 134"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr, Mawdudi and Islamic Revivalism|1996|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his party are thought to have been the most important factors in Pakistan working to generate support for an [[Islamic state]].&lt;ref name="Adams-99-most"/&gt; They are thought to have helped inspire General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] to introduce "[[Zia ul-Haq's Islamization|Sharization]]" to Pakistan,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;
(''Sharia'' laws decreed by Zia included bans on interest on loans ([[riba]]), deduction by the government of 2.5% annual [[Zakat]] tax from bank accounts, introduction of Islamic punishments such as stoning and amputation with the 1979 [[Hudood Ordinances]]. One policy of Zia's that was originally proposed by Maududi, and not found in classic Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), was the introduction of separate electorates for non-Muslims (Hindus and Christians) in 1985.&lt;ref name="OBJ-31"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Owen Bennett |date=2002 |title=Pakistan: Eye of the Storm |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8iYEgPYG_EC&amp;pg=PA31 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=31 |isbn=0-300-10147-3 |quote="In 1985 Pakistan's previous military ruler, General Zia ul Haq, had introduced separate electorates for Pakistan's minorities. Under the measure, Muslims voted for Muslims, Christians for Christians and Hindus for Hindus."}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In return Maududi's party was greatly strengthened by Zia with 10,000s of members and sympathizers given jobs in the judiciary and civil service early in Zia's rule.&lt;ref name="jones-16"/&gt;

Outside of South Asia, Muslim Brotherhood founder [[Hassan al-Banna]] and jihadist [[Sayyid Qutb]] read him, according to historian Philip Jenkins. Qutb "borrowed and expanded" Maududi's concept of Islam being modern, Muslims having fallen into pre-[[Islamic]] ignorance (''Jahiliyya''), and of the need for an Islamist revolutionary vanguard movement. His ideas influenced [[Abdullah Azzam]], the Palestinian [[Islamism|Islamist]] jurist and renewer of [[jihad]] in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The South Asian diaspora, including "significant numbers" in Britain, were "hugely influenced" by Maududi's work. Maududi even had a major impact on Shia [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran]], where Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] is reputed to have met Maududi as early as 1963 and later translated his works into [[Persian language|Persian]]. "To the present day, Iran's revolutionary rhetoric often draws on his themes."&lt;ref name="republic1"&gt;tnr.com ''The New Republic'' "The roots of jihad in India" by Philip Jenkins, 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to Youssef M. Choueiri, "all the major contemporary radicalist" Islamist movements (the Tunisian [[Ennahda Movement|Islamic Tendency]], the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization, and the [[Muslim Brotherhood of Syria]]), "derive their ideological and political programmes" from the writings of Maududi and [[Sayyid Qutb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Choueiri |first=Youssef M. |date=2010 |title=Islamic Fundamentalism 3rd Edition: The Story of Islamist Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=epzUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |edition=3rd |publisher=A&amp;C Black |page=100 |isbn=978-0-8264-9800-7 |quote=... all the major contemporary radicalist movements, particularly the Tunisian Islamic Tendency, led by Rashid Ghannushi, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization and the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, derive their ideological and political programmes from the writings of al Mawdudi and Sayyid Qutb.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">'''Authority bias''' is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an [[authority]] figure (unrelated to its content) and be more [[social influence|influenced]] by that opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |authorlink=Stanley Milgram |date=July 1963 |title=Behavioral Study of obedience |journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Milgram experiment]] in 1961 was the classic experiment that established its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis RM |title=Middle Way Philosophy: Omnibus Edition |year=2015 |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xG9rCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Ellis+RM+Middle+Way+Philosophy%3A+Omnibus+Edition&amp;q=authority#v=onepage&amp;q=milgram&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans usually have deep-seated duty to authority, and tend to [[compliance (psychology)|comply]] when requested by an authority figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stanley |last=Milgram |authorlink=Stanley Milgram |title=Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any society, a diverse and widely accepted system of authority allows the development of sophisticated structures for the production of resources, trade, expansion and [[social control]]. Since the opposite is [[anarchy]], we are all trained from birth to believe that [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to authority is right. Notions of submission and [[loyalty]] to legitimate rule of others are accorded values in schools, the law, the military and in political systems. The strength of the bias to obey a legitimate authority figure comes from systemic [[socialization]] practices designed to instill in people the perception that such obedience constitutes correct behavior. Different societies vary the terms of this dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last1=Hinnosaar| first1=Marit| last2=Hinnosaar| first2=Toomas| title=Authority Bias| date=August 31, 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/2108445/Authority_Bias}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we grow up, we learn that it benefits us to obey the dictates of genuine authority figures because such individuals usually possess higher degrees of knowledge, wisdom and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. We tend to do what our doctor advises. Consequently, [[deference]] to authority can occur in a mindless fashion as a kind of [[decision-making]] short cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Huczynski| first=Andrzej| title=Influencing within organizations| publisher=[[Routledge]]| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bano Qudsia''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بانو قدسیہ}}}}&amp;lrm;; 28 November 1928 – 4 February 2017), also known as '''Bano Aapa''',&lt;ref name="Longer"/&gt; was a [[Pakistan]]i novelist, playwright and [[spiritualist]]. She wrote literature in [[Urdu]], producing novels, dramas and [[short story|short stories]]. Qudsia is best known for her novel ''[[Raja Gidh]].''&lt;ref name="Raja Gidh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rspk.paksociety.com/novels/bano-qudsia/raja-gidh/|title=Bano Qudsia's 'Raja Gidh' inspires audience|work=RSPK Pak Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qudsia also wrote for television and stage in both Urdu and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] languages.

==Personal life==

Bano Qudsia was born on 28 November 1928 in [[Firozpur]], British India, as Qudsia Chattha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/168287-Famous-writer-Bano-Qudsia-turns-88 |title=Famous writer Bano Qudsia turns 88 |work=The News |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a Bachelor of Agriculture and her brother Pervaiz Chattah was a painter. She migrated to Lahore with her family after the [[partition of India]] and had begun writing short stories while studying in class 5.&lt;ref name="Celebrated"/&gt; She graduated from the [[Kinnaird College for Women University|Kinnaird College]] in Lahore and then joined the [[Government College University (Lahore)]] (GCU) to do her masters in Urdu literature which she completed in 1951.&lt;ref name="Giant"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shahzad|first1=Muhammad|title=Literary giant Bano Qudsia dies at 88|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1317428/literary-giant-bano-qudsia-dies-88/|accessdate=16 June 2018|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=5 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qudsia married writer [[Ashfaq Ahmed]] whom she had met at the [[Government College University (Lahore)]].&lt;ref name="Celebrated"/&gt; They had three sons Aneeque, Anees and Aseer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=82cxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Bano+Qudsia++Sitara-i-Imtiaz&amp;dq=Bano+Qudsia++Sitara-i-Imtiaz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBoOSelfvRAhWLq48KHSrUBLcQ6AEISDAJ |title=Impact International, Volume 34, Issue 4 – Volume 35, Issue 4 |pp= |publisher=News &amp; Media |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had been considered inseparable in their social lives.&lt;ref name="Siamese"/&gt;

==Literary work==
Qudsia's novel ''[[Raja Gidh]]'' (The King Vulture) is considered a modern Urdu classic.&lt;ref name="Longer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parekh|first1=Rauf|title=Literary notes : May they live longer — oldest living authors of Urdu|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1195089|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=18 July 2015|ref=Her novel Raja Gidh is considered a modern Urdu classic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her more prominent writings are ''Aatish-i-zer-i-paa'', ''[[Aik Din]],''Asay Pasay'', ''Chahar Chaman'', ''Chhotaa Sheher Baray Log'', ''Footpath ki Ghaas'', ''Haasil Ghaat'' and ''Hawa Kay Naam''.&lt;ref name="Celebrated"/&gt; The most well known plays she wrote include ''Tamasil'', ''Hawa ke Naam'', ''Seharay and Khaleej''.&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt;

Her critically acclaimed play ''Aadhi Baat'' was about a retired headmaster.  The play examined the headmaster's day-to-day life problems and had [[Qavi Khan]] acting as the lead character.   The play's director was [[Agha Nasir]] and it was produced by [[Tauqeer Nasir]].  ''Aadhi Baat'' was performed in May 2010 in Islamabad at a three-day event which was organized by the [[Pakistan National Council of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="Aadhi Baat"/&gt; Ashfaq Ahmed's autobiography ''Baba Saheba'' was incomplete at the time of his death in September 2004. Qudsia completed the biography and the second part of it was published as ''Rah-i-Rawaan''. The contrast in the narrative styles of the couple is evident in these two books; while the first half is considered "provoking, lucid and utterly spellbinding" by critics, the second half takes the feeling of sorrow. Qudsia credits Ahmed for transforming her after their marriage and eventually allowing her to devote to her writing.&lt;ref name="Siamese"&gt;{{cite news|title=In life, in literature: the Siamese twins |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/619767 |accessdate=6 February 2017 |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qudsia's novel ''Raah-e-Rawaan - راہ ِرواں'' was published in 2011. It is an analytical look at Ashfaq Ahmed's philosophical thinking and how it may relate to certain aspects of life itself.  Qudsia had the highest regards for her husband and she has placed Ashfaq Ahmed on a very high pedestal. However she does not even claim to understand the man she lived with for more than five decades. So, an attempt at writing the biography of Ashfaq Ahmed took her beyond that ‘one person’— and she started to write about his ancestry, the family including his grandfather, father, uncles, brothers, sisters and their children so as to fully understand the enigma that was Ashfaq Ahmed.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sangemeel.com/BookReview.aspx?ProductID=9693523156&lt;/ref&gt;

Qudsia’s  novel ''[Haasil Ghaat]'' was published in 2005 and was noted for its diction but also criticized then for usages of English slangs than her usual traditional Urdu narrative. The language however became popular amongst other writers in future.&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt;

Bano Qudsia also wrote a book about [[Qudrat Ullah Shahab]] titled "Mard-e-Abresham" "مردِابریشم". The book mainly portrays Shahab's life and how it was connected with [[Ashfaq Ahmed]] and his family both on social and spiritual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelibrarypk.com/mard-e-abresham-by-bano-qudsia-free-download/|title=Mard e Abresham By Bano Qudsia Free Pdf - The Library PK|date=2017-08-24|work=The Library PK|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bano Qudsia died on 4 February 2017 at the [[Ittefaq Hospital]] in [[Lahore]] at the age of 88. Her son Aseer Ahmed informed that she died around the time for [[Maghrib prayer]]s (after sunset).&lt;ref name="Celebrated"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahmed|first1=Shoaib|title=Celebrated writer Bano Qudsia is no more|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1312818/celebrated-writer-bano-qudsia-is-no-more|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at Lahore on 5 February and prayer services were held at [[Model Town, Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/05-Feb-2017/funeral-prayers-of-bano-qudsia-will-be-offered-in-model-town |title=Bano Qudsia laid to rest in Lahore |work=Radio Pakistan |date=5 February 2017 |accessdate=16 June 2018 |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206184705/http://www.radio.gov.pk/05-Feb-2017/funeral-prayers-of-bano-qudsia-will-be-offered-in-model-town |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brainwave entrainment''', also referred to as '''brainwave synchronization'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fredricks | first=R. | title=Healing and Wholeness: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Mental Health | publisher=All Things Well Publications/AuthorHouse | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4343-8336-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAr791hnIc4C&amp;pg=PA120 | accessdate=April 5, 2017 | page=120}} and&lt;/ref&gt; and '''neural entrainment''', refers to the hypothesized capacity of the brain to naturally synchronize its brainwave frequencies with the rhythm of periodic external stimuli, most commonly auditory, visual, or tactile.

It is widely accepted that patterns of neural firing, measured in Hz, correspond with states of alertness such as focused attention, deep sleep, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Neurotherapy: Application of Techniques for Treatment|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j6-NfhUbLfQC&amp;pg=PA177|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2013-10-18|isbn = 9780123972910|first = David S.|last = Cantor|first2 = James R.|last2 = Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is hypothesized that listening to these beats of certain frequencies one can induce a desired state of consciousness that corresponds with specific neural activity.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

==Neural oscillation and electroencephalography (EEG)==
{{main|Neural oscillation}}
[[Neural oscillation]]s are rhythmic or repetitive electrochemical activity in the [[brain]] and [[central nervous system]]. Such [[oscillation]]s can be characterized by their [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. [[Nervous tissue|Neural tissue]] can generate oscillatory activity driven by mechanisms within individual [[neuron]]s, as well as by interactions between them. They may also adjust [[frequency]] to [[Synchronization|synchronize]] with the [[Audio frequency|periodic vibration]] of external [[Sound|acoustic]] or [[visual perception|visual]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].&lt;ref&gt;Niedermeyer E. and da Silva F.L., Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of [[neuron]]s generate [[electric current]]s; and the [[Synchronization|synchronous]] action of [[neural ensemble]]s in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of [[neuron]]s, produce macroscopic [[Neural oscillation|oscillations]].  These phenomena can be monitored and graphically documented by an [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG). The [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] representations of those [[Neural oscillation|oscillations]] are typically denoted by the term 'brainwaves' in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = da Silva FL | year = 1991 | title = Neural mechanisms underlying brain waves: from neural membranes to networks | url = | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 79 | issue = 2| pages = 81–93 | pmid = 1713832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooper R, Winter A, Crow H, Walter WG | year = 1965 | title = Comparison of subcortical, cortical, and scalp activity using chronically indwelling electrodes in man | url = | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 217–230 | doi=10.1016/0013-4694(65)90088-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of recording [[Neural oscillation|neural electrical activity]] within the [[brain]] from [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] readings taken from the [[scalp]] originated with the experiments of [[Richard Caton]] in 1875, whose findings were developed into [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) by [[Hans Berger]] in the late 1920s.

==Neural oscillation and cognitive functions==
The functional role of neural oscillations is still not fully understood;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Llinas|first1=R. R. |title=Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective |journal=Front Cell Neurosci |volume=8 |page=320 |year=2014 |pmid=25408634 |pmc=4219458 |doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00320}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they have been shown to correlate with emotional responses, motor control, and a number of cognitive functions including information transfer, perception, and memory.&lt;ref name = "Fries 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fries P | title = A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence | journal = TICS | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 474–480 | year = 2005 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.011| pmid = 16150631 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fell J, Axmacher N | title = The role of phase synchronization in memory processes | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 12 | pages = 105–118 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2979 | pmid = 21248789 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schnitzler 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrn1650 | vauthors = Schnitzler A, Gross J | title = Normal and pathological oscillatory communication in the brain | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | pages = 285&amp;ndash;296 | year = 2005 | pmid=15803160 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, neural oscillations, in particular [[Theta rhythm|theta]] activity, are extensively linked to memory function, and [[Coupling (physics)|coupling]] between theta and [[gamma wave|gamma]] activity is considered to be vital for memory functions, including [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Buszaki G | title = Rhythms of the brain | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhus|first1=E|author2=Curran T|title=Functional role of gamma and theta oscillations in episodic memory|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=June 2010|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1023–1035|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.12.014|pmid=20060015|pmc=2856712}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature08860 | vauthors = Rutishauser U, Ross IB, Mamelak AN, Schuman EM | title = Human memory strength is predicted by theta-frequency phase-locking of single neurons | year = 2010 | journal = Nature | volume=464 | issue = 7290 | pages = 903–907 | pmid = 20336071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrainment==

===Meaning and origin of the term 'entrainment'===
Entrainment is a term originally derived from [[Complex systems | complex systems theory]], and denotes the way that two or more independent, autonomous [[Oscillation|oscillators]] with differing rhythms or [[Frequency|frequencies]], when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on [[Couple (mechanics)|coupling force]], such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.
Examples include the [[Injection locking#Entrainment|mechanical entrainment]] or cyclic [[synchronization]] of two electric clothes dryers placed in close proximity, and the biological entrainment evident in the synchronized illumination of [[Firefly|fireflies]].&lt;ref name="Néda, Z. 2000, pp849"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Néda Z, Ravasz E, Brechet Y, Vicsek T, Barabsi AL | year = 2000 | title = Self-organizing process: The sound of many hands clapping | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6772| pages = 849–850 | doi=10.1038/35002660| pmid = 10706271 | arxiv = cond-mat/0003001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrainment is a concept first identified by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Physics|physicist]] [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1665 who discovered the phenomenon during an experiment with [[pendulum]] clocks: He set them each in motion and found that when he returned the next day, the sway of their pendulums had all [[Synchronization|synchronized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantaleone J | year = 2002 | title = Synchronization of Metronomes | url = | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 70 | issue = 10| pages = 992–1000 | doi=10.1119/1.1501118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such entrainment occurs because small amounts of [[energy]] are transferred between the two systems when they are out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]] in such a way as to produce [[negative feedback]]. As they assume a more stable [[Phase (waves)|phase]] relationship, the amount of [[energy]] gradually reduces to zero, with systems of greater [[frequency]] slowing down, and the other speeding up.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M., Schatz, M. F., Rockwood, H., and Wiesenfeld, K., Huygens's clocks. Proceedings: Mathematics, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 2002, pp563-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the term 'entrainment' has been used to describe a shared tendency of many physical and [[Biology|biological]] systems to [[Synchronization|synchronize]] their periodicity and [[rhythm]] through interaction. This tendency has been identified as specifically pertinent to the study of [[sound]] and [[music]] generally, and [[Acoustics|acoustic]] rhythms specifically. The most ubiquitous and familiar examples of neuromotor [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment to acoustic stimuli]] is observable in spontaneous foot or finger tapping to the rhythmic beat of a [[song]].

===Brainwave entrainment===

Brainwaves, or [[neural oscillation]]s, share the fundamental constituents with [[Sound|acoustic]] and [[Light|optical]] [[wave]]s, including [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and periodicity. Consequently, Huygens' discovery precipitated inquiry{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} into whether or not the [[Synchronization|synchronous]] [[Electric current|electrical activity]] of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[neural ensemble]]s might not only alter in response to external [[Acoustics|acoustic]] or [[Visual perception|optical]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] but also entrain or [[Synchronization|synchronize]] their frequency to that of a specific stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Will, U., and Berg, E., "Brainwave synchronization and entrainment to periodic stimuli" ''Neuroscience Letters'', Vol. 424, 2007, pp 55–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cade, G. M. and Coxhead, F., The awakened mind, biofeedback and the development of higher states of awareness. New York, NY: Delacorte Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neher, A., "Auditory driving observed with scalp electrodes in normal subjects. ''Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology'', Vol. 13, 1961, pp 449–451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakharova, N. N., and Avdeev, V. M., "Functional changes in the central nervous system during music perception. ''Zhurnal vysshei nervnoi deiatelnosti imeni IP Pavlova'' Vol. 32, No. 5, 1981, pp 915-924.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brainwave entrainment is a colloquialism for such 'neural entrainment', which is a term used to denote the way in which the aggregate frequency of [[oscillation]]s produced by the synchronous electrical activity in ensembles of cortical [[neuron]]s can adjust to synchronize with the periodic vibration of an external stimuli, such as a sustained acoustic frequency perceived as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], a regularly repeating pattern of intermittent sounds, perceived as [[rhythm]], or of a regularly rhythmically intermittent flashing light.

Meanwhile, the therapeutic benefits of listening to [[sound]] and [[music]] is a well-established principle upon which the practice of receptive [[music therapy]] is founded. The term 'receptive music therapy' denotes a process by which patients or participants listen to [[music]] with specific intent to therapeutically benefit; and is a term used by therapists to distinguish it from 'active music therapy' by which patients or participants engage in producing [[Human voice|vocal]] or [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruscia, K., Defining music therapy.

The [[Frequency following response]] (FFR), also referred to as Frequency Following Potential (FFP), is a specific response to hearing sound and music,  by which [[neural oscillation]]s adjust their frequency to match the rhythm of [[Auditory system|auditory]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. The use of sound with intent to influence cortical brainwave frequency is called auditory driving,&lt;ref&gt;Burkard, R., Don, M., and Eggermont, J.

'''Burton Spencer Dreben''' (September 27, 1927 &amp;ndash; July 11, 1999) was an [[American philosopher]] specializing in [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref name="NYTimesObit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Honan, William|title=Obituary: Burton S. Dreben, 71, Negotiator in Tense Situation at Harvard|date=17 July 1999|newspaper=NY Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/17/us/burton-s-dreben-71-negotiator-in-tense-situations-at-harvard.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Harvard graduate who taught at his alma mater for most of his career, he published little but was a teacher and a critic of the work of his colleagues (Floyd &amp; Shieh 2001).

==The logician==
Dreben was a rare combination of expert [[logician]], and careful historian of ideas and interpreter of historical texts. In the 1950s, he found a copy of [[Jacques Herbrand]]'s Ph.D. thesis, submitted to the [[University of Paris]] in 1929 and thought lost. (Herbrand died in 1931 before either marrying or starting his career.) Dreben found a number of significant errors in the thesis, as well as evidence of haste and carelessness in its preparation. In particular, in Herbrand's proof a crucial [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] was fatally flawed, but Dreben found another way of proving the essential conclusions of the thesis. Dreben's introduction to the translation of Herbrand's thesis in {{harvtxt|van Heijenoort|1967}} includes a concise description of his work on Herbrand's writings.

In the 1970s, Dreben and [[Warren Goldfarb]] wrote a book on the [[Decidability (logic)|decision problem]].

==Philosophical thought==
From 1978 onwards, Dreben gave a series of lectures at Harvard which had as their primary topics the works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[W.V. Quine]]. Dreben took from Wittgenstein the lesson that philosophers always went wrong when they tried to provide general accounts of reality, [[epistemology]], or [[metaphysics]]. He was in agreement with Wittgenstein's later view that philosophical problems mostly arise when language goes on holiday. Dreben took the [[history of philosophy]] as itself a proof of Wittgenstein's thesis that much philosophizing is nonsense; Dreben attempted to show how the history of philosophy is a history of people [[talking past each other|talking past one another]].

Dreben interpreted Quine as attempting to show that philosophy does not provide the foundations of science. According to Dreben's interpretation of Quine, philosophy at its best merely answers a number of general questions from within science itself. However, Dreben saw even in Quine a tendency to generalize most successfully resisted by the later Wittgenstein, whose unflagging alertness to specifics Dreben took as a model.

==Career==
[[Harvard University]] awarded Dreben an A.B. and an A.M. in 1949 and 1955, respectively. He taught at the University of Chicago, 1955–56, at Harvard 1956-90, and at [[Boston University]] for the remainder of his life. He was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellow]] at Oxford 1950-51, a member of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]] 1952-55, a Guggenheim Fellow from 1957–58, and a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] from 1963.

At Harvard, he was Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1973-75, a special assistant to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with oversight over the academic tenure process, Chair of the Society of Fellows 1976-90, and Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.

At the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], he was twice a treasurer, and an editor of its journal.

Dreben was a highly influential teacher of philosophy. The ''Harvard Crimson'' described him as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A mathematical logician by training, his writings set new standards of clarity for the historical study of 20th-century philosophy. His lectures at Harvard and later at Boston University, where he taught from 1991 until his death, were famous for their wit, bravado, and intellectual excitement, attracting students and faculty alike and shaping several generations of philosophers. His mastery of the texts of 20th-century analytic philosophy was unmatched."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dreben became known for his close reading and detailed comments on the draft writings of his Harvard colleagues [[W.V. Quine]], [[John Rawls]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Stanley Cavell]], [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles Parsons]], and [[Warren Goldfarb]]. Quine often thanked Dreben in print for his advice and corrections and dedicated ''Pursuit of Truth'' to Dreben.&lt;ref&gt;W.V. Quine. ''Pursuit of Truth''. Rev. ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992. First ed. (1992). Rawls reminisces about Dreben as editor in (Floyd &amp; Shieh 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Dreben also had a significant influence on many students and junior faculty at Harvard, including [[Warren Goldfarb]], [[Thomas Ricketts (philosopher)|Thomas Ricketts]], [[James F. Conant]], [[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]], [[Gary Ebbs]], [[David H. Helman]], and others.

In his later years, Dreben was a guest lecturer in Scandinavia, Israel, and Europe, giving seminars on the nature and significance of 20th-century philosophy.

During the student revolt of the late 1960s, Dreben helped mediate the conflicts and disputes between Harvard students and administration.&lt;ref name=NYTimesObit/&gt; Among his students was [[Harry R. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13718|name=Burton S. Dreben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Dreben was first married to Massachusetts Judge Raya Spiegel Dreben, with whom he had two children. He later married the philosopher [[Juliet Floyd]].

[[File:Balázs Béla.jpg|thumb|right|Béla Balázs c. 1910s]]

'''Béla Balázs''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈbɒlaːʒ|lang}}; 4 August 1884, [[Szeged]] – 17 May 1949, [[Budapest]]), born '''Herbert Bauer''', was a Hungarian-[[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] [[film criticism|film critic]], [[aesthetics|aesthete]], writer and poet. He was a proponent of [[formalist film theory]].

==Career==
Balázs was the son of German-born parents, adopting his ''nom de plume'' in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium.

Balázs was a moving force in the [[Sonntagskreis]] or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, [[Arnold Hauser]], [[György Lukács]] and [[Karl Mannheim|Károly (Karl) Mannheim]]. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.&lt;ref name=gluck&gt;Mary Gluck (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TUdmFkDoIGUC&amp;pg=PA15 ''Georg Lukács and His Generation, 1900–1918'']. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674348664}}. pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

He is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' which he originally wrote for his roommate [[Zoltán Kodály]], who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, [[Béla Bartók]]. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet ''[[The Wooden Prince]]''.

The collapse of the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] under [[Béla Kun]] in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union.

In Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, ''Der Sichtbare Mensch'' (''The Visible Man'') (1924), helped found the German "film as a language" theory, which also exerted an influence on [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for [[G. W. Pabst]]'s film of ''[[The Threepenny Opera (1931 film)|Die Dreigroschenoper]]'' (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.

Later, he co-wrote (with [[Carl Mayer]]) and helped [[Leni Riefenstahl]] direct the film ''[[Das Blaue Licht]]'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011309/http://www.walter-riml.at/walter-riml.at/-_1931_The_blue_light_-.html 1931 „the blue light“]. walter-riml.at&lt;/ref&gt; Riefenstahl later removed Balázs's and Mayer's names from the credits because they were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/LitWiss/MedienWiss/Forsch/Telaviv/Riefenstahl-englisch.html Hanno Loewy: "Balazs' and Leni Riefenstahl's The blue Light. A martyr's story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040430052226/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/LitWiss/MedienWiss/Forsch/Telaviv/Riefenstahl-englisch.html |date=30 April 2004 }}. Uni-konstanz.de. Retrieved on 24 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his best known films is ''[[Somewhere in Europe (film)|Somewhere in Europe]]'' (''It Happened in Europe'', 1947), directed by [[Géza von Radványi]].

His last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in [[Hungary]], the [[Kossuth Prize]]. Also in 1949, he finished ''Theory of the Film'', published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in  [[cinematography]].

'''Chân Không''' (born 1938)&lt;ref name="plum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sister Chan Khong|url=http://plumvillage.org/about/sister-chan-khong/|publisher=[[Plum Village]]|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[expatriate]] [[Vietnam]]ese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[nun]], [[Peace movement|peace]] [[activism|activist]], and has worked closely with [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] in the creation of [[Plum Village]] and helping conduct spiritual [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]s internationally.&lt;ref name="plum"/&gt; She wrote her autobiography, ''Learning True Love: How I Learned &amp; Practiced Social Change in Vietnam'' in 1993.&lt;ref name="plum"/&gt;

== Biography ==

Chân Không was born '''Cao Ngoc Phuong'''&lt;ref name="storhoff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Storhoff|first=Gary|title=American Buddhism as a Way of Life|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|year=2010|page=122|isbn=9781438430959}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938 in [[Ben Tre]], Vietnam in the center of the [[Mekong Delta]]. As the eighth of nine children in a middle-class family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Storhoff|first=Gary|title=American Buddhism as a Way of Life|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|year=2010|page=107|isbn=9781438430959}}&lt;/ref&gt; her father taught her and her siblings the value of work and humility. She quotes her father as saying: "...never bargain with a poor farmer because for you a few dong may not be much, but for him it is enough to support his children."&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chân Không|year=2005|title=Learning True Love: How I Learned Social Change in Vietnam|publisher=Parallax Pres|page=4|isbn=0-938077-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 she enrolled in the University of [[Saigon]] to study [[biology]]. She was also involved in political action, becoming the student leader at the University, spending much of her time helping the poor and sick in the slums of the city.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iamhome"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning True Love, Order of Interbeing website excerpt from book|url=http://www.iamhome.org/order_interbeing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105022920/http://www.iamhome.org/order_interbeing.htm|publisher=Unified Buddhist Church|archivedate=January 5, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She first met Thích Nhất Hạnh in 1959 and considered him her spiritual teacher. In 1963 she left for [[Paris]] to finish her degree in biology which was awarded in 1964. She returned to Vietnam later that year and joined Thích Nhất Hạnh in founding the Van Hanh University and the School for Youth and Social Service (SYSS). She was central in many of the activities of the SYSS which organized medical, educational and agricultural facilities in rural Vietnam during the war.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Path of Peace: The Life and Teachings of Sister Chan Khong|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/path-of-peace-the-life-and-teachings-of-sister-chan-khong-may-2012/|publisher=[[Shambhala Sun]]|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage the SYSS involved over 10,000 young peace workers who rebuilt many villages ravaged by the fighting. When Thích Nhất Hạnh returned to the [[United States]], Chân Không ran the day-to-day operations.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iamhome"/&gt;
[[File:Chan Khong cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chân Không&lt;br&gt;(Sister True Emptiness)]]
On February 5, 1966 Chân Không was [[ordination|ordained]] as one of the first six members of the [[Order of Interbeing]], sometimes called the "Six Cedars". Following her ordination, she was given the name Sister Chân Không, True Emptiness.&lt;ref name="storhoff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Queen|first=Christopher S.|title=Engaged Buddhism in the West|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2012|isbn=9780861718412}}&lt;/ref&gt; In explaining the meaning of the name, she says: "In Buddhism, the word 'emptiness' is a translation of the [[Sanskrit]] [[sunyata]]. It means 'empty of a separate self.' It is not a negative or despairing term. It is a celebration of interconnectedness, of interbeing. It means nothing can exist by itself alone, that everything is inextricably interconnected with everything else. I know that I must always work to remember that I am empty of a separate self and full of the many wonders of this universe, including the generosity of my grandparents and parents, the many friends and teachers who have helped and supported me along the path, and you dear readers, without whom this book could not exist. We inter-are, and therefore we are empty of an identity that is separate from our interconnectedness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning True Love and Understanding Buddhism|url=http://www.forusa.org/interfaith/buddhism.html|publisher=Fellowship of Reconciliation|accessdate=April 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804133318/http://www.forusa.org/interfaith/buddhism.html|archivedate=August 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order of Interbeing was to be composed of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. The first six ordainees were free to choose whether they preferred to live and practice as formal monastics or as laypersons. The first three women chose to live celibate lives like nuns, although they didn't shave their heads, while the three men chose to marry and practice as lay Buddhists. Among the three women was [[Nhat Chi Mai]], who [[self-immolation|immolated]] herself for peace just a year later.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iamhome"/&gt;

From 1969 to 1972 she worked with Thích Nhất Hạnh in Paris organizing the Buddhist Peace Delegation which campaigned for peace in Vietnam. Since then she has worked with Thích Nhất Hạnh establishing first the Sweet Potato community near Paris, then [[Plum Village]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] in 1982. She accompanies and assists Thích Nhất Hạnh when he travels. In addition, she has continued to organize relief work for those in need in Vietnam, coordinating relief food parcels for poor children and medicine for the sick, and helps organize activities at Plum Village.

Sister Chân Không ordained as a nun by Thích Nhất Hạnh in 1988 on Vultures Peak, in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/about/timeline-of-community/|title=Timeline of Community|publisher=[[Order of Interbeing]]|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the three-month return to Vietnam (January to early April, 2005), Thích Nhất Hạnh spoke to thousands of people throughout the country - bureaucrats, politicians, intellectuals, street vendors, taxi drivers, artists. In addition to Thich Thích Nhất Hạnh's [[Dharma]]  talks, Sister Chân Không also taught and conducted additional [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] practices. She led the crowds in singing Plum Village songs, [[chant]]ing, and leading "total [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]]" sessions. Other times, it was her simple application of Vietnamese heritage to modern ways of life that appealed to the people they met. During [[Tết]] (Vietnamese new year) celebrations in February, she performed an "oracle reading" for hundreds of Buddhist followers.&lt;ref name="btv"&gt;{{cite web|title=No trace left behind|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=9,1195,0,0,1,0|publisher=The Buddhist Channel|date=May 19, 2005|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, for the first time in history major Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian leaders, as well as Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders (including Chân Không, representing [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]), met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belardelli|first=Guilia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/02/pope-francis-and-other-re_n_6256640.html|title=Pope Francis And Other Religious Leaders Sign Declaration Against Modern Slavery|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2015|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">'''Cleonides''' ({{lang-el|Κλεονείδης}}) is the author of a Greek treatise on music theory titled Εἰσαγωγὴ ἁρμονική ''Eisagōgē harmonikē'' (Introduction to Harmonics). The date of the treatise, based on internal evidence, can be established only to the broad period between the 3rd century BCE and the 4th century CE; however, treatises titled ''eisagōgē'' generally began to appear only in the 1st century BCE, which seems the most likely period for Cleonides' work.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;Jon Solomon, "Cleonides [Kleoneidēs]", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of the ''Eisagōgē'' in some manuscripts to [[Euclid]] or [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] is incompatible with the Aristoxenian approach adopted in the treatise. A few manuscripts name a "Zosimus" as the author.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

[[File:Samarth Ramdas swami.JPEG|thumb|Samarth Ramdas]]
'''''Dāsbodh''''', loosely meaning "advice to the disciple" in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], is a 17th-century [[Advaita Vedanta]] spiritual text. It was orally narrated by the saint [[Samarth Ramdas]] to his disciple, [[Kalyan Swami]]. The ''Dāsbodh'' provides readers with spiritual guidance on matters such as devotion and acquiring knowledge. Besides this, it also helps in answering queries related to day-to-day life and how to find solutions to it.

==Background==
The ''Dāsbodh'' was written in 1654 by [[Samarth Ramdas]] Swāmi (1608-1681), a [[satguru]], a [[Hindu]] poet from [[Maharashtra]], in the local [[Marathi language]]. It is a comprehensive volume in verse form providing instructions on the religious life, presented in the format of a conversation between a Guru and disciple. The narration is believed to have taken place in a cave called Shivatharghal in the Raigad district of Maharashtra.
{{Hinduism}}

==Style==
''Dāsbodh'' is written in the verse form known as ''owi'' (''ōvyā'') in Marathi. The volume comprises 7751 ''owi'' and is divided into 20 chapters, each chapter consisting of ten sub-chapters. Each of these sub-chapters varies in the number of stanzas, but averages around 30-40 stanzas (ovi) per sub-chapter, with some being considerably longer.

==Contents==
''Dāsbodh'' prescribes the path of devotion to God or "Bhakti mārg", and the path of Knowledge or "Jñana Marg" for [[moksha|liberation]]. Through knowledge, Ramdas clears away all doubts and gives the understanding of one's "True Self". Ramdas also reveals the true meaning and significance of "Discrimination" and "Detachment".

It deals with diverse aspects of human life such as politics, conducting business dealings and taking care of one's body and family life. One of the key messages given by Saint Ramdas is to not be lazy, as he always encouraged aspirants to earn the livelihood in a virtuous manner. The person who is ready to work will always be fortunate. Common man normally does not want to work and expects everything from God without an effort.

In ''Dasbodh'', Samartha Ramdas presents the essence of many Vedic texts. ''Dasbodh'' is a manual for life, in the highest sense, and is somewhat unusual among spiritual literature in that it not only expounds the classic themes of discrimination between the true and the untrue and the detachment commonly found in Vedic literature, but also provides a detailed instruction on how to function and excel in society from a place of deep spiritual understanding.

Contained within the chapters of ''Dasbodh'', Ramdas outlines the path of liberation through Devotion and Knowledge. Through knowledge, Ramdas clears away all doubts and gives the understanding of one's "True Self." Ramdas also reveals the true meaning and significance of "Discrimination" and "Detachment." Entire volumes could be written in trying to describe all that is contained within the text. It draws upon ancient Vedic texts including, but not limited to; The [[Vedas]], the Shashtras, the [[Upanishads]], the Avadhut Gita, the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', the Rama Gita, the [[Yogavasishtha]], the [[Guru Gita]], and the [[Brahma Sutras]], to name a few. Mainly what is presented in ''Dasbodh'' is the voice of direct experience itself.

''Dasbodha'' is an epic written by Shree Samarth. Whatever he wanted to tell the world he has conveyed through ''Dasbodha'' in a candid manner. As per the tradition in his times he wrote it in the Owi form. The contents of the book are simple, straightforward and easy to understand. It is so simple that sometimes it seems to be a prose. ''Dasbodha'' is divided in 20 main parts called as Dashak each of which contains 10 sub parts which are called as Samasas. The total Owis number 7751. Each Owi is made up of 4 lines. After being blessed by Lord Ram he wrote the Old ''Dasbodha''. One finds the freshness, fearlessness and candidness of a person blessed with the ultimate knowledge just recently in it. After a while he started with the continuation of the work and completed up to the 7th Dashak to which he added the Dashak he had written earlier, called the Dashak of knowledge. Then throughout his life he continued writing for the Dasbodha which amounted to another 12 Dashaks. These were added to the earlier 8 ones and the final volume of the Dasbodha as we know it now was prepared just 2 months prior to the time when Shree Samarth left his mortal body. At the end of the book he has unassumingly asked the readers to study, ponder over, introspect and not just only read the whole ''Dasbodha''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28769">'''Free migration''' or '''open immigration''' is the position that people should be able to migrate to whatever country they choose.

== Argument for free migration ==
{{Expand section||date=September 2016}}
Although the two are not the same issue, free migration is similar in spirit to the concept of [[free trade]], and both are advocated by [[free market]] economists on the grounds that [[economics]] is not a [[zero-sum game]] and that free markets are, in their opinion, the best way to create a fairer and balanced economic system, thereby increasing the overall economic benefits to all concerned parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemens|first=Michael|date=2011|title=Economics and Immigration: Trillion Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume= 25|issue= 3|pages=83–106|doi=10.1257/jep.25.3.83|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Khadria The movement of people and goods is linked], Binod Khadria, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding noteworthy differences among these political ideologies, many [[Libertarianism|libertarians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Libertarianism - What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Brennan|first=Jason|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=42, 50, 119, 125|quote=Libertarians also support free immigration. [...] They believe everyone has the right to take employment in any other country, regardless of citizenship. They hold that, except in special circumstances, governments may not forbid citizens from leaving a country, nor may governments forbid foreigners from entering. (Page 42)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] advocate open immigration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf Immigration Control: What about the workers?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707041531/http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf |date=2007-07-07 }}, Paul Marks, Free Life No. 19, Page 12, November, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; as do [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2008-spring/immigration-individual-rights/|title = Immigration and Individual Rights|date = Spring 2008|accessdate = May 14, 2015|website = [[The Objective Standard]]|publisher = |last = Biddle|first = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[free market]] economists believe that competition is the essence of a healthy economic system, and that any short-term negative impact on individual economic factors that is caused by free migration is more than justified by the prospects of long-term growth for the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/defense-free-migration/ In Defense of Free Migration], Richard M. Ebeling, The Future of Freedom Foundation, June 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights perspective ===
From a [[Human rights|human-rights]] perspective, free migration may be seen to complement Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]:
# Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
# Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=PecoudMigration Antoine Pécoud and Paul de Guchteneire (Eds): ''MIGRATION WITHOUT BORDERS, Essays on the Free Movement of People ''(Berghahn Books, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against free migration ==
Arguments against free immigration are usually economical, cultural or security-related. Some arguments are [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] or what some critics claim to be "[[xenophobia|xenophobic]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Krikorian Borders are the line between 'us' and 'them'], Mark Krikorian, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or ones similar to arguments against [[free trade]], favouring [[protectionism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Free migration of war/political refugees ==
War-related chaos can lead to the breakdown of borders and allow for ''de facto'' free immigration. The natural attempts to flee strife, or escape a conquering enemy, can quickly lead to millions of [[refugees]]. Even where border controls are in place they can be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people. Once settled into [[refugee camp]]s, these reluctant [[immigrants]] may take decades to be either repatriated back or naturalized into their new country. This has been the situation with the [[Palestinian refugees#Jordan|Palestinians in Jordan]].

During the [[Cold War]], a migration paradox arose in which some of the [[communist state]]s forbade emigration, while the "[[Free World]]" would freely accept the [[defector]]s. This policy persists for [[Cuba]]ns&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration-usa.com/cuban_refugee.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], who are both allowed particular forms of free immigration to the [[United States]] based on their automatic refugee status.

== Spiritual perspectives on migration ==
Through numerous situations and encounters, immigration can be a test of mental fortitude rather than physical ability. In [[Buddhism]], a [[bodhisattva]] is considered to be a guide to awakening and to the Pure Lands. "The Buddha declares that we are all bodhisattvas destined to attain full Awakening. It seems that each of us, then, is engaged in 'spiritual immigration'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in This World|last=Thompson|first=John|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|year=2015|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=31–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha asserts that everyone is a bodhisattva, or a 'spiritual immigrant', who must attain various virtues which ultimately leads to ''[[prajnaparamita]]'', or 'transcendent wisdom'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The existence of Buddhas and [[Mahasattva]]s{{mdash}}'great beings' who have achieved a high level on the path to awakening{{mdash}}have created various branches of belief like [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which is a form of 'spiritual immigration'. "Buddhism is a type of immigration from the world of suffering to nirvana....We are all immigrants who, paradoxically, are seeking to and the land in which we already dwell".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In terms of 'spiritual immigration', the path of the bodhisattva is a change of mental capacity rather than cosmic location.

According to Buddhist teaching, the purpose of a 'spiritual immigration' is to help guide the individual onto their future path.  The Pure Land is the state of untainted mind: reaching this land of purity requires persistent effort and practice. Along the journey, individuals learn to envision their future as a land of opportunity. The intention of the pure land is to assure that the individual achieves their personal goals in life{{mdash}}the betterment of oneself in order to reach nirvana. Alongside these goals, practitioners also learn about the relationship of 'self' and 'others', resulting in the renewal of all beings. The concept of the pure lands enforces the idea of 'spiritual immigration' as a form of mental encouragement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Migration is a spiritual journey that establishes a point of communication between the human and divine. Religious figures migrate from one place to another as immigrants: "In Christianity, God migrated to this world in the form of human Jesus; the Hindu God [[Krishna]] descended to earth to become a charioteer, a human being ([[Bhagavad Gita]] 1:20-47); and the Buddha 'becomes Awakened' when he became a wanderer and a stranger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in This World: Multi-religious Reflections on Immigration|last=Hussam S. , and Jorgenson, Allen G. , and Hwang, Alexander Y..|first=|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|year=2015|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=111–128|chapter=The Islamic Doctrine of Hijra (Migration)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents believe that religious figures have travelled from an unpurified state to a purified state: Buddha traveled from his privileged life to a life of poverty to gain divinity and knowledge; therefore divine figures like [[Gautama Buddha|Gautam Buddha]] viewed migration as purification. The Qur’an states that "they could migrate from their oppressed positions to another land of God".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The doctrine of ''[[Hejira|Hijrah]]'' suggest that freedom of movement is a human right as well as a duty to God. [[Globalization]] affects religious perspectives on migration which seek to prevent the "destruction to the sanctity of human life and dignity".  Religious figures like Buddha and Jesus practised "a theology of migration".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} According to adherents, immigrants should have the same rights as legal residents because world religions believe everyone is divine. It is also mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur’an]] that "strangers are entitled to the equal distribution of wealth".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;!-- please give Sura and Ayat --&gt; Despite the acquisition of wealth in verse 8:41, the Qur’an states that "know that one-fifth of your battle gains belongs to the God and the messenger, to close relatives and orphans or to the needy and travellers (strangers).”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to Collier and Strain, the Roman Catholic Church has been helping migrants for decades.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious and Ethical Perspectives on Global Migration|last=Elizabeth W. Collier, and Charles R. Strain|first=|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lexington|pages=|chapter=7: Migration in The Light of Scripture and Catholic Social Teaching}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian faith receives a sense of justice for migrants from Abrahamic faith traditions. Catholics follow these guidelines to help immigrants: "for all persons on the move". The reasons to help those on the move were established in 1952 when leaders of the Roman Catholic Church published written material that reinforced the teachings of the church. One of the quotes from the Bible used to justify hospitality is "when an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God" (Leviticus 19:33).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Strangers or those on the move should be treated equally, no less than anyone else. The modern nation state should open its borders because people may be migrating due to unfavorable circumstances. The Catholic Church believes everyone has a right to migrate to support their families; this idea of free migration allows "the human person [to precede] the state".”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some circumstances, the Church provides assistance to migrants and refugees. Some Catholic organizations offer educational activities on the legal process of immigration to the United States. Other types of aid include spiritual companionship, ESL classes for those who want to learn to speak better English, basic hygiene, and food. The Roman Catholic Church believes that helping those in need enables the growth of the human spirit.

Before the [[Columbian exchange]], there was an open border policy in the Americas that gave Native Americans access to travel freely and have open trade with other cultures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was widespread trade among many [[First Nations]] that created free movement and travel for many foreigners. At the time, there was little border control which allowed migrants to travel to various areas to settle. Immigration policy shifted towards control and nationalism after 1492. In the 20th century, immigration policy solidified borders in America, but many Native Americans advocated free movement and hospitality towards strangers. Native Americans historically have welcomed strangers with hospitality, sometimes making them relatives through an informal adoption system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Migration in America can be understood through the religious and cultural perspectives of Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Native American Hospitality and Generosity". Strangers in This World: Multireligious Reflections on Immigration.|last=Woodley, Randy|first=|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Native American groups have shown hospitality towards strangers, and guests are given gifts from the host, which are known as 'give-aways'. Hospitality to visitors and other members of one's community is a value of many Native Americans groups, and they consider their belongings and other possessions as blessings. The concept of borders and walls (both artificial and real) were not practised in [[pre-Columbian]] times when Native Americans inhabited present day Canada, Central Amaerica, Mexico, and the U.S. Instead, hospitality and gift giving were the traditions that were honored and shared among visitors and other people.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Law and ethics ==
{{sources|section|date=April 2018}}
Many nation states have agreed and disagreed on the topic of open borders and free migration, with some countries allowing people to travel freely from country to country and state to state without the risk of deportation or punishment. The consensus within the open borders debate is to “establish a view of migration that reflects the liberal commitment to the equal moral worth of all people which applies to a truly global view of migration.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MORAL CONSENSUS IN THE OPEN BORDERS DEBATE|last=Askren|first=Wayne|publisher=University of Utah Graduate School. Proquest.|year=2012|isbn=|location=Sal Lake City|pages=37–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various ideas have been applied to a global view of migration, such as the ideas of other journalists such as Johnathan Wolff and Avnir De-Shalit to migration. Wolff and De-Shalit’s state that the use of law and ethics is a positive factor in the debate over free migration.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The debate of free migration does not apply to a specific country but extends beyond, and continues on to a broader spectrum for introducing a freedom of movement amongst all people, for all countries. However, this concept is especially significant to the places that experience the most migration-including both host and receiving countries or states. Free migration is not limited to a certain time period, but has been more relevant and controversial in recent years, especially in the United States. In the U.S., it has become a more controversial topic since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].

Free migration is a concept to consider when comparing basic [[human rights]] and migration. "Constraining movement in most cases is therefore, unjustified and immoral".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The topic of free migration is not a matter to be only exclusively debated amongst national governments of varying nations, but a worldwide discussion for all people of all nations on the debate of open borders and free migration. In that case, nations and people from all over the world can learn from each other where everyone is involved in the attempt to come to a just conclusion and solution to the problems surrounding both immigration and free migration alike. Free Migration has been slowly restricted throughout recent history due to the inevitable progression of society, causing more independent societies to create tighter laws, policies, and regulations concerning immigration. With nations closing themselves off and shutting their borders from non-residents, it is difficult for free migration to become secure, as well as having members of society prioritize an institutional issue such as this.

Immigration officers and agents must maintain a code of conduct based on policy to provide equal treatment to any and all immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bader|first=Veit|date=2012|title=Moral, Ethical, and Realist Dilemmas of Transnational Governance of Migration|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=56 | issue = 9 |pages=1165–1182|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764212443819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers must put their political views behind them and revert to policy law; leaving behind their personal moral conflicts and ethics to abide by law and policy. Political philosophers focus on free movement as a human right and aid for those in poverty or serious global inequality. Although there is not a necessary definition for something considered to be morally, ethically, or legally accepted in a society, everyone has an individual connection to what may be considered good for society and what may be considered bad for society. The United States government has placed many strict laws on immigration that it proposes will produce a better immigration system. Other countries, through United Nations consensus, allow a minimum two year system for refugee relocation, with other countries such as Canada and Switzerland operating within a four year system.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Economic considerations ==
According to John Kennan’s (2012) data simulations (collected in multiple countries to simulate the effects of open borders), there would be large economic gains between Mexico and the United States of America through the implementation of open borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennan|first=John|date=2013|title=Open borders|url=|journal=Review of Economic Dynamics 16|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison|volume=16|pages=1–13|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal economic reasoning advocates for open borders to prevent economic inequality between countries where country A is more efficient than country B due to restrictions on immigration creating production efficiency gaps between the two countries. Labor share data estimates that there would be more economic gains through free migration between countries. These gains are expressed through the economic and labor growth in the country along with economic gain for foreign and resident workers in that country. Economic simulations show that migration lowers the [[Real wages|real wage]] for both countries receiving and sending immigrants; however, the effect of this decrease is based on the goods and services consumed by an individual. According to Kennan “these gains are associated with a relatively small reduction in the real wage in developed countries, and even this effect disappears as the capital–labor ratio adjusts over time.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, the number of workers in both receiving and sending countries would double by the current population of workers.

== Alleged discrimination ==
According to Mirko Bagaric and John Morss (2005), nations discriminate against immigrants through certain immigration policies like the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Naturalization Act]] (INA), the body of law governing current immigration policy, which provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirko Bagaric and Dr John Morss|first=|date=2005|title=State Sovereignty and Migration Control: The Ultimate Act of Discrimination|url=|journal=J. Migration &amp; Refugee Issues|volume=25|pages=25–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nations such as: North/South America, Europe and Australia use their power to regulate migration control by selecting individuals and placing them where they may not be able to succeed. “Nation states have the right to determine which people are permitted to enter within their geographical borders.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This causes people to choose places they did not want to go, making them displaced persons. Over the past decade, there have been 12-18 million displaced persons. Countries usually put restrictions on migrants because they could be a security risk. “The most persuasive argument in favour of strict immigration controls is expressed by the view that ‘we made it and own it and don’t want it ruined by others.’”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Some nations discriminate against immigrants wanting to come in because many citizens have a preconceived notion that the ones coming in are criminals who want to abuse government funding. “Unless we radically loosen migration controls we must accept that we are endorsing a racist policy.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Multiple nations spend billions of dollars every year on border security. Many nations do not realize how much immigrants can benefit their nation. They perform tasks that most individuals may not want to do, such as low paying jobs that involve hard labor. Ultimately, immigrants can benefit every nation, if they were given the chance to prove themselves and really show who they are. Free migration means migrants can choose whatever country they wish to go to. If strict migration laws and border security shut people out, then they do not have a chance for a new life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2706">'''Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit''' is  translated as '[[Divine grace|Grace]] does not destroy [[nature]], but perfects it', or 'grace does not destroy nature but fulfills it'. This Phrase is the word of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1224–1274). He observes, grace does not destroy nature, but fulfills its potential ([[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], I, I, 8 ad 2).&lt;ref&gt;Consecrated Phrases: A Latin Theological Dictionary; Latin Expressions Commonly Found in Theological Writings Third Editio, James T. Bretzke (Collegeville:Liturgy Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://latin.topword.net/? Latin quotes by Saint Thomas Aquinas]&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, natural reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will ministers to charity." Thomas maintains that the truth of human nature finds total fulfilment through sanctifying grace, since this is "perfectio naturae rationalis creatae" (Quodlib., 4, 6).[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/2003/september/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20030929_congresso-tomista.html] He stated that grace does not contradict nature. God's creation cannot be totally corrupted by human sin; grace heals the incomplete natural notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhar Suter, "Grace", The Encyclopedia of Protestantism, vol 2,  Eds., Hans J. Hillerbrand (London: Routledge, 2004), 831&lt;/ref&gt;
Aquinas divides grace into two basic kinds(ST I-II, III). One is gratia gratum faciens. It commonly is translated as sanctifying grace. This is the grace that sanctifies an individual, granting the person a participation in the divine nature and ordering him to God as to one’s supernatural end. It is this grace that receives the much greater part of the attention in the treatise on grace. The other kind of grace is gratia gratis data, commonly translated as gratuitous grace. The phrase is not altogether happy; after all, the first kind of grace is also gratuitously, in the sense of freely, given by God. This gratuitous grace, in the technical sense, is given bot for the sanctification of the recipient, but to allow the recipient to help others to God(I-II. III, 1c).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=PmHImeFCzOYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Gratia+non+tollit+naturam,+sed+perficit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oSO-kwBbsE&amp;sig=HerHnZKNUswFxHFrNZLfb9BUoWQ&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8zv6Nr9bXAhWFpJQKHdjUAc4Q6AEIXDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Gratia%20non%20tollit%20naturam%2C%20sed%20perficit&amp;f=false The Westminster Handbook to Thomas Aquinas,  Joseph Peter Wawrykow, Westminster John Knox Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian Henderson Angus''' (born 18 April 1949) is an interdisciplinary philosopher and social critic who writes on [[continental philosophy]], [[Canadian studies]], [[communication theory]], [[social movements]], [[ecology|ecological thought]], and the university.

== Education ==
Angus holds BA and MA degrees in philosophy from the [[University of Waterloo]] and a PhD in social and political thought from [[York University]] (1980). He has taught at the [[University of New Hampshire]], [[Trent University]] and [[University of Massachusetts]] at Amherst (1986-1992) and is currently a professor in the Department of Humanities at [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia, Canada.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Work ==

=== Continental philosophy ===
Angus' early intellectual formation began with a dual engagement with 20th-century [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], particularly the work of [[Edmund Husserl]], and the [[Frankfurt school]] of critical theory around the problems of technology and modern capitalism. Focusing on the notion of "[[instrumental rationality|instrumental reason]]" as a legitimating principle of technology, his first book ''Technique and Enlightenment'' (1984) argues for a form of technological assessment that is both ethical and acknowledges its role within the larger problematic of the construction of human identity.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Casey, "I.A. Angus, "Technique and enlightenment: Limits of instrumental reason" (Book Review)," Husserl Studies, Vol. 3 (3) (January 1986):245-246.&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent work branched into a wider conception of the problem of [[modernity]] in critical engagement with [[discourse]] theory, [[post-structuralism]], and [[rhetoric]]al theory. In ''Primal Scenes of Communication'' (2000) "the complex linguistic model Angus has created regards the immanent link of identity creation involved in communication theories, but ... his concerns deal with this struggle for, and the shaping of, our faculties of attention."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Madarasz, "Delivering our Attention: Ian Angus’ Primal Scenes of Communication," Symposium: Journal of the Canadian Society for Hermeneutics and Postmodern Thought, Vol. V, no. 2 (Fall 2001): 256-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian social philosophy ===
Angus' commitment to Canadian social and political thought was a consequence of his estimation in the 1970s that the left wing of Canadian [[nationalism]] contained the possibility for a transformation of Canadian society in a more [[egalitarian]] direction. In his most influential book in the area of [[Canadian Studies]], ''A Border Within'' (1997), he works toward thinking English Canadian identity in relation to internal diversity and [[environmentalism|environmental]]-local embeddedness. He does so by exploring the question: "What are the possibilities for an English-Canadian national identity in an age of corporate globalization- a phenomenon that appears to undermine national identities around the world?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ronald |last=Glasberg |title=Review of A Border Within: National Identity, Cultural Plurality and Wilderness |journal=History of Intellectual Culture |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2001 |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/hic/issues/vol1/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angus rejects the tendency to wholly situate identity as simply constructed locally or universally, but instead maintains that it is in the very acknowledgement of [[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness, both environmental and ethnic, that an English Canadian identity could be rethought.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dunk, "National Culture, Political Economy and Socio-Cultural Anthropology in English Canada," Anthropologica, Vol.42, No. 2 (2000): 131-145.&lt;/ref&gt;
His subsequent book ''Identity and Justice'' (2008) traces political thought and cultural politics insofar as they are integrated into philosophy. "It is not a book about Canadian philosophy, but rather a philosophical book that self-consciously situates itself in a particular place, in order to talk about this place."&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Nicholson, "Review of Identity and Justice by Ian Angus," Modern Horizons June 20, (2012), http://www.modernhorizonsjournal.ca/June%202012.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Angus published a collection of essays on Canada under the title ''The Undiscovered Country: Essays in Canadian Intellectual Culture'' through [[Athabasca University]] Press in which he collected together his critiques of Canadian thinkers and emphasized that a philosophy which does not criticize [[empire]] becomes [[ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120223 |title=Athabasca University Press – The Undiscovered Country: Essays in Canadian Intellectual Culture |publisher=Aupress.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Love the Questions: University Education and Enlightenment'' ===
Angus' work on the university draws on years of [[activism]] and public deliberation on the issues surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Guglietti. "The University and a New Definition of Enlightenment," Topia 28 (2012): 306.&lt;/ref&gt; He applies philosophical critique on an institutional level. This allows him to examine the transformation of knowledge as it relates to the external pressures of [[Computer network|network]] [[capitalism]] and [[technoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;A selection from Chapter 6, "The Transformation of Knowledge," was printed in Truthout Magazine under the title, "Does the University Have a Future in Network Society?" (http://archive.truthout.org/does-university-have-a-future-network-society58477&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary university can be defined by "three separate questions focusing on teaching, research and application, and technological change."&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hanke. "Ian Angus in Conversation with Bob Hanke," Canadian Journal of Media Studies Vol. 7 June (2010): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Victoria Guglietti's review explains that "the transmission of knowledge...undermines enlightenment because it discourages any enquiry into the nature and limits of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Maria Guglietti. "The University and a New Definition of Enlightenment," Topia 28 (2012): 307.&lt;/ref&gt; This amounts to the university losing its "critical and self reflexive role"&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bourke. "Review of Ian Angus. Love the Questions: University Education and Enlightenment," Canadian Journal of Sociology On-Line Vol. 35 No. 3 (2010): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; because its main purpose is to feed the specific needs of the larger system. This corporate arrangement of the university produces an anxiety as it relates to self-knowledge because of the explicit integration of education into the [[commodity]] form. Angus concludes with a realistic but hopeful analysis of the possibilities for the construction of new forms of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] within the university. Though his work is primarily on the Canadian university, it has been widely praised for its applicability to the situation in the UK and US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8 April 2010 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/411128.article |title=Love the Questions: University Education and Enlightenment &amp;#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10853">'''J. L. Schellenberg''' (born 1959) is a Canadian philosopher best known for his work in [[philosophy of religion]]. He has a DPhil in [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of Oxford]], and is Professor of Philosophy at [[Mount Saint Vincent University]] and Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Graduate Studies at [[Dalhousie University]].&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg CV, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schellenberg’s early development of an [[argument from divine hiddenness]] for [[atheism]] has been influential.&lt;ref&gt;Howard-Snyder 2013, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent series of books he has arrived at a form of [[religion]] called ‘skeptical religion’ which he regards as being compatible with atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg 2013a, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[Cambridge University Press]] journal ''[[Religious Studies]]'' published a special issue devoted to critical discussion of Schellenberg’s philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin LePoidevin]], ed. ''Religious Studies'' 49(2), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==
=== Divine hiddenness ===

Schellenberg’s first book, ''Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason'' ([[Cornell University Press]], 1993), developed the argument from divine hiddenness (or hiddenness argument) against the existence of [[God]]. Discussion of Schellenberg’s argument continues today, in academic journals, anthologies, and other books, as well as online.&lt;ref&gt;Howard-Snyder and Moser, eds., 2002; Cuneo 2013; Murray and Taylor 2007, pp. 376-377;  Dumsday 2010, 423-424; http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/john_schellenberg/&lt;/ref&gt;

Schellenberg’s most recent statement of the hiddenness argument may be summarized as follows. A God (construed as a perfect personal being) could not be less than perfectly loving, and a perfectly loving God would always be open to a meaningful conscious [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with finite [[persons]] who are capable of participating in such a relationship and don’t resist it. This implies that if there is a God, every finite person who fits that description is able to exercise his or her capacity and be part of such a relationship. But this can’t be the case unless everyone who fits that description believes that God exists (for to have a conscious relationship with someone you have to [[belief|believe]] they exist). It follows that if there is a God, there is no one who fits that description and fails to believe that God exists, i.e., there are no ‘nonresistant nonbelievers.’ But there are. Therefore, there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg, "Recent notes," Session 2, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have argued that even a loving God might have reasons to be hidden generated by such things as the requirements of human [[free will|freedom]], human unreadiness for relationship with God, or the religious value of [[doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne 1998, p. 209; McKim 2001, p. 101; Poston and Dougherty 2007, 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Schellenberg has replied that philosophers have no reason to assume that the persons God would create would be human persons existing in a world like ours, and that there are various ways in which the same good states of affairs to which critics appeal would be capable of being experienced in the context of a relationship with God.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg2007-p202-203,2010p515-516"&gt;Schellenberg 2007a, 202-203; Schellenberg 2010, pp. 515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeptical religion ===

Schellenberg’s work after 1993 includes a trilogy on philosophy of religion (also published by Cornell: 2005, 2007, 2009). This project aims to address the most fundamental issues in that field and to set an agenda for [[future]] inquiry.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg2007-p202-203,2010p515-516" /&gt;

The first volume, ''Prolegomena to a Philosophy of Religion'', examines basic concepts in philosophy of religion such as ‘religion’, ‘belief’, ‘[[faith]]’ and ‘[[skepticism]]’ (or ‘[[doubt]]’) and proposes what Schellenberg regards as ways of revamping the discipline, including a new understanding of faith without belief.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg 2005, x-xi, pp. 127-166.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The second volume, ''The Wisdom to Doubt: A Justification of Religious Skepticism'', offers various different arguments for religious skepticism that are intended to prepare the reader for the third book – ''The Will to Imagine: A Justification of Skeptical Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg 2007b, p. 311; Schellenberg 2009, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third book, Schellenberg argues for a religious orientation grounded not in belief, but in the sort of imaginative faith detailed in the first volume. Instead of focusing on [[theism]], or any other specific idea from today’s religions, this sort of religion, which Schellenberg calls ‘skeptical religion,’ is focused on a proposition to which he gives the name ‘ultimism.’ Ultimism, as he defines it, is more general than other religious ‘isms’ – it is the [[proposition]] that ''something'' is [[Absolute (philosophy)|ultimate]] in the nature of things, ultimately [[value (ethics)|valuable]], and the source of our ultimate good, but the details of that something it leaves open.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg 2005, pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schellenberg suggests that arguments criticized as unable to support traditional belief in God can be adapted to support skeptical religion. In his view, skeptical religion therefore offers a solution to the problem of faith and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg 2009, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

A central feature of Schellenberg’s trilogy is his suggestion that if we alter our perspective on [[time]] – looking into the ''deep future'' as well as the [[deep past]] – we will see that we may be at a very early stage in our development as a [[species]] (given that it is possible that the [[Earth]] will remain [[habitable]] for another billion years). With this vast stretch of time before us, he asks, why would we think that our best ideas – even ideas about religion – are behind us?&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg 2007b, pp. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage in our development, Schellenberg argues, religion of a different sort from what we have seen before is called for.

Critics have argued that if Schellenberg is skeptical or doubting about ultimism on the basis of future possibilities, then he should also be skeptical about theism instead of being an atheist, and that the idea of skeptical religion might be hard to put into practice.&lt;ref&gt;McCreary 2010, Morriston 2013, 217-218; Dole 2013, 240-245.&lt;/ref&gt; Schellenberg has said that there is a danger here of "crying over unspilt milk" since we have hardly begun to think about skeptical religion.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg, 2013b, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also suggested reasons for distinguishing between theism (which he says may be disbelieved) and ultimism (which he says should only be doubted) on the basis of the former’s detailed content.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg, 2013b, 280-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The science and religion debate ===

Schellenberg’s ''Evolutionary Religion'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2013) aims to be a more widely accessible account of his arguments in the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg, ‘Extract,’ pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to place these arguments into an [[evolutionary]] framework and maintains that skeptical religion provides a new way of responding to the [[science]] and religion debate.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg, ‘Extract,’ p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Dean Strauss''' (born July 3, 1929; died March 19, 2014) is an American theologian who was professor of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] at [[Lincoln Christian College and Seminary|Lincoln Christian Seminary]] from 1967-1994. He has been described by many as the [[Einstein]] of the [[Restoration Movement]].

==Life==
He was born on July 3, 1929 to Earnest and Cleo Strauss in the small town of [[Herrin, Illinois]].  His father was a [[World War I]] veteran who worked as a coal miner and bookkeeper for Peabody Coal Company.  His mother worked as a nurse and decorations designer for a department store.  His father was a heavy gambler, but a very intelligent man.  Dr. Strauss seems to have inherited his father's intelligence and his mother's creativity, combining them into a mind to be reckoned with.  His family moved to [[Catlin, Illinois]] when James was in the second grade, where he spent the rest of his childhood and youth.  He lived a rather normal childhood, playing baseball with boys in the neighborhood and listening to [[The Shadow]] and [[The Lone Ranger]] at night on the radio with his family.  He displayed a sharp mind even while in high school, graduating as [[salutatorian]] in his class and voted "most likely to succeed" by his fellow students.

James Strauss died on March 19th, 2014.

Dr. Strauss's father was a [[Disciples of Christ]] member and his mother a Baptist, but neither attended church during James' childhood.  One day James was invited to the Catlin Church of Christ by a consumer at the grocery store he worked at as a youth.  James went, was converted, and brought his parents.  Upon his conversion, James' father quit gambling, and, as a consequence, their family grew closer.  James was mentored by the elders at that church, who taught him Biblical study methods and Greek.  

When James graduated from high school, he went to [[Cincinnati Christian College]] to study under [[R. C. Foster]] and [[Grayson Ensign]]. Proceeding on from there, he attended [[Christian Theological Seminary]] and studied under [[Walter Sykes]]. By the time he finished his time as a student, he had collected over 500 hours of graduate credit because his mentor died unexpectedly right before he was about to graduate with his 1st doctorate and the program that he was a part of collapsed, so he had to start over.  He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Master's degree|M.A.]] from Butler University, a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] from Christian Theological Seminary, and a [[Th.M.]] from the [[Chicago Graduate School of Theology]]. He fulfilled his Ph.D candidacy requirements at Indiana University, but due to a change over in the faculty from one year to the next he did not finish the degree. He does have a D.Min. from Eden Theological Seminary, Webster Groves, MO.

Dr. Strauss became Associate Professor of [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] at [[Lincoln Christian College and Seminary|Lincoln Christian Seminary]] in 1967 after working for many years as a pastor.  The position had opened up because the professor previously occupying the related position had been released because of the unorthodox views that he held.  The student body at the time protested this move, as the released professor was popular among the students.  Only later, however, did they realize what they had received in return.  Strauss went on to very nearly ''be'' the seminary, as he taught most of the classes offered in a range of programs.  One year the Seminary catalog listed him as teaching forty-seven courses.  There is a [[cassette tape]] recording from 1977 of Dr. Strauss listing and briefly describing the classes he would be offering one year, which took over an hour to finish.  Most of his [[syllabi]] were approximately 100 pages in length, single-spaced, nonetheless.  He taught classes on [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], [[Descartes]], [[Hegel]], [[linguistics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and the mind, [[philosophy of science]], [[Biblical exegesis]], [[preaching]], [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]], [[astrophysics]] in relation to Christianity, [[apologetics]], [[archaeology]], the [[nature of man]], [[creative imagination]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], classical philosophy, history of philosophy, classical theology, [[evolution]], theology of sin, theology of promise, etc.  Upon his retirement in 1994, he was given the honorary title of Professor [[Emeritus]] of [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]]. Dr. Strauss is a prolific writer, and has written tens of thousands of pages between his books and essays on topics related to the ones listed above.

'''Jill Marsden''' (born 1964) is a scholar of the work of German philosopher [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]]. Marsden, from [[Nottingham]], took her BA, MA and PhD from the [[University of Essex]]. Her [[doctoral thesis]] explored Nietzsche's Doctrine of Eternal Return. 

In 2002, Marsden's first book, ''After Nietzsche: Notes Towards a Philosophy of Ecstasy'', was published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. The text explores the imaginative possibilities for philosophy created by Nietzsche's sustained reflection on the phenomenon of "ecstasy". From ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) to his experimental "physiology of art", Nietzsche examines the aesthetic, erotic and sacred dimensions of rapture, hinting at how an ecstatic philosophy is realized in his elusive doctrine of Eternal Return. Marsden's book pursues the implications of this legacy for contemporary continental thought via analyses of such voyages in ecstasy as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[Daniel Paul Schreber|Schreber]] and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]].

Marsden is a senior lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Bolton]]. She is at work on her second volume, set to explore 'the art of [[wiktionary:Brevity|brevity]]'. Outside of her work on Nietzsche, Marsden's research interests include [[aesthetics]], [[feminism]] and [[literature]], on which themes she has published articles in, among others, the ''Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology'' and ''Women's Philosophy Review''.

[[Image:John Heydon Occultist.jpg|thumb|Portrait, (engraved by [[Thomas Cross (engraver)|Thomas Cross]])]]

'''John Heydon''' (10 September 1629 – c. 1667) was an English [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] [[occult]] philosopher, [[Rosicrucian]], [[astrologer]] and attorney.

==Life==
Rosicrucian sources, including Heydon's own ''English Physician's Guide'' and Frederick Talbot's ''The Wise Man's Crown'', give a florid biography for Heydon, in which he is descended from a King of Hungary. However, he was actually born in "Green Arbour" (near the [[Old Bailey]]), London, the son of Francis Heydon (of [[Sidmouth]] in Devonshire) and Mary (née Chandler, of [[Worcestershire]]); he was baptised at [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate|St. Sepulchre's Church]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Heydon, John (fl.1667)|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one sibling, a sister, Anne, two years his junior.

According to his own account, he was educated at [[Tardebigge]], Worcestershire, among his mother's friends. He studied [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] with a tutor and was apprenticed to the study of law; however, his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] and, as a young man, he was said to have served in the [[Cavalier|royalist]] army. In 1651 he went abroad, travelling to Italy, Spain, Egypt, Arabia, and Persia.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="waite"&gt;Waite, A. E. ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/rhr/index.htm The Real History of the Rosicrucians]'' (London: George Redway, 1887) p. 315 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to England, he trained in law, and was articled as a clerk in 1652. In 1655, he was living in [[Clifford's Inn]], practising as an attorney and also casting [[horoscopes]]. Heydon married the widow of [[Nicholas Culpeper]] in 1656, and is thought to have fathered a daughter. After 1658, he lived in "[[Spitalfields]], near [[Bishopsgate]], next to the "Red Lion".&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

He attracted attention in royalist and occultist circles for predicting the future, including the death of [[Oliver Cromwell]], then Protector. Their royalist connections caused both Francis and John Heydon to be imprisoned in the final years of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] era. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 resolved Heydon's incarceration – though he was imprisoned briefly later in 1663 for dealing in suspect (treasonous) literature, and in 1664 for debt.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1665, Heydon published "''Psonthonphanchia, or a Quintuple Rosiecrucian Scourge for the due Correction of that Pseudo-chymist and Scurrilous Emperick, Geo. Thomson''", a fierce response to a pamphlet issued by physician [[George Thomson (physician)|George Thomson]] criticising the conduct of those members of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] who left the city during the [[Great Plague of London]] of 1665–66.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|wstitle=Thomson, George (fl.1648-1679)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1667, Heydon was imprisoned, again, in the [[Tower of London]] for his part in the treasonous plots of his patron, the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]. He was accused of "treasonable practices in sowing sedition in the navy and engaging persons in a conspiracy to seize the [[Tower of London|Tower]]". He claimed however, that he was innocent and was the victim of someone paid to inform against him.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Heydon was accused of plagiarising Sir [[Thomas Browne]], [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]], and other writers; his ''Physician's Guide'' of 1662 largely derives from Sir [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]].''&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; He was referred to as "an ignoramus and a cheate" by [[Elias Ashmole]]; Frances Yates termed him a "strange character...an [[Astrology|astrologer]], [[Geomancy|geomancer]], [[Alchemy|alchemist]], of a most extreme type.";&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Frances A. ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment''. London, Routledge, 2002 edition; p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[A. E. Waite]] considered that all that was of value in his mysticism was derived from anterior writers.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="waite" /&gt;

The precise date of Heydon's death is unknown. Care should be taken not to confuse him with [[Sir John Heydon]] (1588–1653), a royalist military officer and mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Heydon, John (d.1653)|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heydon published a remarkable volume of work in the last twelve years of his life. A complete list can be found in the "Dictionary of National Biography" (1885–1900) entry (see "references" below), but includes:

'''Gio' Niccolo' Muscat''' (1735-''c.''1800) was a Maltese doctor of law, and a major philosopher. His area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, vol. II, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Muscat was born into a very poor family on March 8, 1735.&lt;ref&gt;All biographical information, unless expressly indicated, is taken from Frans Chiappara, ‘Gio. Nicolò Muscat’, ''Hospitaller Malta'', ed. by V. Mallia-Milanes, Mireva Publications, Malta, 1993, pp. 605-658.&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have lost his parents at a very young age, for it was his aunt who raised him. Despite her poverty, this aunt worked hard to pay for the young Muscat's formal education. Unfortunately, it is however as yet unknown where he undertook his initial studies. His aunt also paid for his university studies. Again, all that is known is that he studied law but it is not certain where. It might have been at the [[Collegium Melitense]] of the [[Jesuits]] in Valletta.

===Professional career===
After finishing his law degree and became a lawyer, Muscat was lucky enough to encounter the good favours of one of the legal scribes (called ''uditore'') of the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]], who took him under his wing. This helped Muscat build up a stead clientele which brought him some stable income. At this time he was most likely still in his early twenties.

===Marriage===
Considering his firm social improvement and advancement, it might be expected that Muscat would be particularly susceptible to social mores and customs. However, this was not so. When it came to tying the knot, Muscat chose to flouted convention completely. In fact, at the age of twenty-eight, in 1763, he married a widow with three children who was much older than him. Her name was Maria Salamone.

===Early writings===
Muscat's earliest extant writings date back to when he was twenty-three years old. A long poetic work in Italian, called '''''Sonnetto''''' (Sonnet),&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''op. cit.'', vol. II, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; which he composed in 1758 was dedicated to Giammaria Azopardi Castelletti, Adriano Montana and Giuseppe Agius. The first was the Vicar General, and the others Assessors, to the [[Bishop]] of [[Malta]] Bartolomeo Rull. The work had never been published, and is extant in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, MS. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; This document is evidence that Muscat did not harbour ‘dangerous’ doctrines (as came out afterwards) since always. During this period of his life he seems to have been quite convinced of the traditional political structures of his time and, particularly, with the supreme power exerted by the [[pope]].

Another early writing, this time from 1771, when Muscat had thirty-six years of age, is called '''''Replica delli Creditori''''' (A Creditors’ Response).&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''op. cit.'', vol. II, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; This too is in Italian. It was published in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], at the printing press of Baron Giacomo Epir, and contains 87 pages. The work was written in response to a publication issued by a certain Giacobbe Berard, who had responded to yet another book. Muscat's book, in fact, reproduced the same title of Berard's work. The subject of all three publications concerned a particular legal case of localised importance. Nevertheless, in his book Muscat touches upon a theme pertaining to political philosophy which he would go on to develop in other writings, namely the legal independence of a local government from outside interference (including the [[pope]], his [[bishop]]s or the [[Inquisition]].

===Philosophical bearing===
This was no transitory feeling which Muscat had expressed so boldly. His was a position emanating from the study of [[Illuminist]] writings. Indeed, here, as elsewhere, Muscat did not go as far as rejecting religion or calling forth the establishment of a republic. That would have been not only impractical in a society such as that of [[Malta]] but also probably did not tally with Muscat's own beliefs. In general, he seems to have believed in the political system adhered to by the [[Knights Hospitallers]], albeit perhaps with a stronger dose of some egalitarian rights, and did not seem to have harbour any thoughts of overturning their government. As regards religion, he certainly seems to have been a deeply religious person, and his sole intensely felt objections seem to have been directed towards ecclesiastical and clerical authoritarianism and impertinence.

Nevertheless, Muscat certainly believed in the separation of Church and State, and, in later years, he also succeeded in gaining the ear of the [[Grand Masters]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] whom he served. Indeed, the [[Knights Hospitallers]] were a sort of religious order, and in this regard ultimately subject to the [[pope]]. Nevertheless, in matters pertaining to sovereign government, they could claim autonomy (just like other jurisdictions in [[Italy]] and elsewhere enjoyed).

===Attorney General===
In [[Malta]]’s current political context such a philosophy could have been explosive. However, for some time Muscat had no opportunity to put it into practice. That time came when the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], appointed him as his ''avvocato del principato'' (which more or less corresponds to the office of an [[Attorney General]]). This was at the beginning of [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]]’s reign, around 1775.

The potential menace did not escape the local [[inquisitor]], Giovanni Filippo Gallarati Scotti, who said about Muscat: ‘Since some time ago, the ministers of this secular government, and especially the principality’s attorney general, seem to have changed their way of thinking. [...] The new spirit, which began to take hold of this man’s mind with the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]]’s approval, has come out with various decisions which are offensive to the liberty of the Church’.

The ‘offensive decisions’ which Scotti referred to were the attempts made by Muscat to curb the effective authority of the [[pope]] over the jurisdiction and deliberations of the local government. Certainly, he must have had Muscat's ''Replica'' in mind. All of this of course could not please the local [[inquisitor]] or the [[bishop]].

===Corroborative works===
[[File:Muscat, John Nicholas - La Giurisprudenza.jpg|thumb|Muscat's ''La Giurisprudenza Vindicata'' (1779)]]
The [[inquisitor]] saw to it that his convictions became known to his authorities in [[Rome]] and to the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]]. He was not of course prepared to sit pretty while such an affront was levelled against the authority of the Church.

On the other hand, however, neither Muscat was ready to sit pretty. In fact, in the years which followed he intensified his assault by penning down other noteworthy works. The first seems to have appeared in 1779, called '''''La Giurisprudenza Vindicata''''' (A Reprisal for Jurisprudence).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 19-page booklet written in old Italian, and published at the printing press of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] under the direction of Giovanni Mallia. Its subtitle is simply ''Apologia'' (A Defence). The work is an unbroken discourse in twenty paragraphs dedicated to the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]]. Muscat's writing is elaborate and sometimes difficult to follow. Nevertheless, his message is clear enough. Muscat takes on his adversaries by insisting that they are calumnious and misrepresented his intentions. Of course, they hadn't. In fact, Muscat goes on to confirm and further substantiate the claims he had upheld in favour of the sovereignty and independence of [[Malta]]’s government in all decisions within his jurisdiction. While retracting not a single point of his philosophy, Muscat provides a long presentation on the origin of [[Roman law]], and even presents the philosophical basis of his position.

Four years after this work, in 1783, Muscat goes on to publish '''''Apologia a Favore dell’Inclita Nazione Maltese''''' (A Defence in Favour of the Renowned Maltese Nation).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The very words ‘Maltese nation’ must have sent shivers down the spines of both the local [[inquisitor]] and the [[bishop]]. These were definitely words with feared and hated illuminist overtones. Muscat's book, written in old Italian, has 124 pages, and (as if to add insult to injury) was published in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], at the printing press of the Lazzarini family.&lt;ref&gt;About this printing press, see http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lazzarini_res-88a8c43e-87ee-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario_Biografico%29/ (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; The above-mentioned title continues with the words ''‘... Suoi Tribunali, Segnatura, e Legisti’'' (... its Tribunals, its Secretariat of State, and its Law Consulates). The work is divided in three parts, each containing a number of chapters. Muscat composed it in response to a book, called ''Ragionamenti'' (Reasonings), by Giandonato Rogadeo, who sustained that the jurisdiction of Malta's government was limited by the supreme authority of the [[pope]] and by his institutions. With frank and candid language, and also with conviction and philosophical clarity, Muscat leaves no doubt on which side of the fence he stands.

===Imposing works===
If this was not enough to make both the local [[inquisitor]] and the [[bishop]] to go wild with anxiety, the year after the appearance of Muscat's ''Apologia'' a publication of great consequence was issued by the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]], [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], in which Muscat's hand surely had a part. This was in 1784, and the publication was the '''''Diritto Municipale di Malta''''' (Malta's Domestic Law).

Usually called simply the ''Codice De Rohan'', this book was basically a revision of the entire corpus of laws and legal customs of [[Malta]]. For its time it was a masterpiece of jurisprudence. However, in it the Catholic Church not only was she not given the absolute authority she expected to have but reasons were brought forward to retract some of the authority she still retained.

A second publication, issued two years later, in 1786, under the title '''''Bando e Prammatica da Valere in Perpetuo''''' (A Law and Procedure to Stand in Perpetuity), was even more explicit than the ''Diritto Municipale''. It acknowledged that the prince had the right to sanction or abolish the execution of any legal instrument issued by a foreign authority, including the [[pope]], the congregations of the [[Holy See]], and the [[Inquisition]].

[[Inquisitor]] Scotti identified Muscat as the one responsible for such pernicious doctrines. According to him, Muscat was one of ‘those modern philosophers of Malta’ ''‘cui il nome pur solo, e l’ombra della Chiesa, e delle Ecclesiastiche preprogative e invidioso e odiosissimo’'' (for whom the very name and the shadow of the Church, and of ecclesiastical prerogatives, is detestable and hateful).

===Collision with the Church===
To defend himself from such accusations, in 1788 Muscat published a tract entitled '''''Memoria''''' (A Memo).&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''op. cit.'', vol. II, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did little to dissipate the opposition which had been building up against him. This was exacerbated a year later, in 1789, when [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] demanded the suspension of the notorious [[papal bull]] ''[[In Cœna Domini]]'', and Muscat ''personally'' went to stop [[Bishop]] Vincenzo Labini from publicly reading the bull. Of course, though such a slur was not heeded by the [[bishop]], the incident certainly did not improve things.

Muscat was determined to put into practice his philosophy. A little after the confrontation with the [[bishop]], he informed the [[inquisitor]] that henceforth he would not submit any case before the [[pope]], even those related to the faith, without first tendering them to the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] for his approval. This sent the [[inquisitor]] up the wall.

===First removal from office===
Muscat was unrelenting in his attack. A few years after clashing with the [[inquisitor]], in 1791, he became involved in another incident which tipped the scales. Muscat maintained that the Church could exert its jurisdiction ''solely'' in matters pertaining to the [[sacraments]], the faith, morals, and ecclesiastical discipline.

This seemed to go over the top. [[Pope Pius VI]] threatened [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] that, if Muscat was not immediately removed from [[Attorney General]], the [[Holy See]] will ''disband'' the order of [[Knights Hospitallers]]!

Though this was no light warning, Muscat defended himself most vigorously. He avowed to have been, was, and always will be, a true and faithful son of the Church. Of course, neither his faith nor his faithfulness was the point of the issue. Nevertheless, the [[inquisitor]] did not flinch from twisting the knife in the wound. He reminded the [[pope]] that, some time back, Muscat himself had declared that ‘This is no longer the century of the Church!’, and ‘If it were in my power I would leave the [[bishop]] with only the [[crosier]] and the [[mitre]]!’ The [[inquisitor]] went as far as to inform the [[pope]] that (as he had it from his spies), on receiving the news of his requested removal from office, Muscat stated: ‘Puh, as if this would make me lose my appetite!’

Muscat was removed from office in January 1792, and sent to live outside the walls of the capital city, [[Valletta]].

===Reinstatement and second removal===
Despite his removal from office, [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] did not appoint anyone in his stead as [[Attorney General]]. He waited for the racket to settle down. Then, just three months after, in April 1792, he reinstated Muscat in his former offices.

True to form, Muscat's former impertinence resumed. Just two months later, in June 1792, the [[pope]] was compelled again to demand the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] to remove him straight away from all government responsibilities. There was no choice in the matter for [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]]. This time around, he was also constrained in sending Muscat abroad.

Before leaving [[Malta]], Muscat gathered all his dependencies and encouraged them not to fear acting as he had. He hoped to return in fifty days. However, he told them, even if this were not to be so, he confessed that he was proud to have pulled off ‘a glorious confrontation with the [[pope]]’.

Accorded full honours by the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]], Muscat left [[Malta]] in July 1792.

===Back to Malta===
Muscat went to [[Naples]], [[Italy]], and then to [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. He returned to [[Malta]] in October 1792. Though he became once more part of government, [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] warned him to be prudent and stay out of the limelight. However, Muscat does not seem to have been a man to shy away from bothering the Church.

At one point, he denied the [[bishop]] the right to judge a case of [[divorce]] since he claimed that marriage was a social contract recognised only by the civil authority. This irked the [[bishop]] immensely. Later, defending his responsibility in resisting and curtailing the interference of [[Rome]] in the affairs of state, he publicly announced the ‘at long last the [[pope]] will have to relinquish all [the power] he has’. Muscat even went as far as to defend the Maltese from being arraigned before the ecclesiastical courts.

Embarrassing the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] without end, [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] resolved to give up trying to protect his subject any more.  Encouraged by this turn of events, the new local [[inquisitor]], Giulio Carpegna, decided to act quickly. Lest Muscat could be able to backtrack the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]], he wanted him definitely removed.

===Second reinstatement and final removal===
In the meantime, in July 1793, Muscat wrote the [[pope]] a '''''Memorandum''''' with the intention of restoring him to his former offices. He avowed his faithfulness to the [[pope]] and his resolution to defend the jurisdictional rights of the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Malta]]. ‘Every interference in the matters of the Church,’ he declared, ‘now seem absolutely dangerous because I see that they bring me between the Devil and the deep sea.’

The ruse seemed to have worked. For in September 1793, the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] reinstated Muscat to all his former offices. To the great consternation of the [[inquisitor]], the [[pope]] had actually given his blessing for such a restoration of Muscat's fortunes. The [[pope]], however, had approved ‘on the condition that Muscat does not meddle with ecclesiastical affairs’.

The official reinstatement was carried out with great pomp and ceremony. Muscat himself declared that his enemies – all except ''‘la briga papalina’'' (the papist gang), meaning the [[Inquisition]] - were now no more.

Nonetheless, [[Inquisitor]] Carpegna was enemy more than Muscat thought. Just one month after the ostentatious reinstatement, he succeeded, around October 1793, in removing Muscat. This time for good. Despite being mercifully forestalled the humiliation of being deposed once more, Muscat was forced to retire against a pension.

===Triumph with Napoleon===
This time the [[inquisitor]] made sure that neither [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] nor his successor, [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], would change their mind. In the meantime, Muscat was simply waiting in the wings to reclaim his honour.

A good moment came when, five years later, in July 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] brought to an end the 268-year era of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in [[Malta]], together with that of the local [[Inquisition]]. Muscat was actually part of the delegation aboard [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]’s ship, ''l’Orient'', to negotiate the [[Knights Hospitallers]]’ capitulation.

During the next two months, during the French tenure of [[Malta]], Muscat was appointed President of the Civil Courts. However, when the revolt against the Napoleonic forces began, in September 1798, he was forced to barricade himself within the walls of [[Valletta]] together with the French government.

===Defeat and exile===
Muscat remained blockaded until November 1798. On being constrained to leave the city, the British [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] took him prisoner and incarcerated him on the island of [[Gozo]]. He remained there at least for two years, until around 1800. He was sixty-five years of age.

On his release, Muscat exiled himself and left [[Malta]] for [[Sardinia]], off the [[Italian peninsula]]. Nothing is yet known of his whereabouts after that.

He probably died at [[Sardinia]].

==Appreciation==
Gio' Nicolo' Muscat can certainly be described as a most outstanding and stupendous philosopher. He dared challenge the hegemony of the [[Catholic Church]] in an age when it was right across-the-board. What's more, he did this with philosophical acumen and perspicuity. His personality and contribution is all the more intriguing because he hailed from the lower classes of society, and not only made it to the top but also attempted to affect some real change by applying his philosophical knowledge to good effect.

Muscat's persona and endeavour came to light in 1993 by the splendid work done by historian Frans Chiappara. However, much more research work is needed to uncover the lacking documentary evidence which could substantiate the still unknown aspects of Muscat's interesting life, especially those (but not only) related to his last years away from [[Malta]].

Also, the thorough study of the ''Diritto Municipale di Malta'' and the ''Bando e Prammatica'' is still to be made in order to establish the as yet unacknowledged contributions which Muscat made to these important 18th century documents.

Finally, it is a pity that Muscat's philosophy has still to be analysed holistically and critically. Undoubtedly, his vision and enterprise are worth discovering in their entirety, not only for their historical value but furthermore for their relevance today.

'''José Cipriano de la Luz y Caballero''' (July 11, 1800 – June 22, 1862) was a [[Cuba]]n scholar, acclaimed by [[José Martí]] as "the father ... the silent layer of foundations" in Cuban intellectual life of the 19th Century (see "Un magno artículo de Martí", in ''Aforismos de Luz y Caballero'' Havana, 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;139). Interest in Luz's work was revived around the time of the [[Cuban Revolution]], and new editions of his work published, as he was regarded as a source of intellectual autonomy for the country.

Luz took his degree in philosophy in 1817 at the Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Gerónimo in [[Havana]], and took a degree in law at the [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary|Seminario de San Carlos]]. From 1837 to 1841, he travelled extensively in North America and Europe, coming into contact with a number of important intellectuals of the time, including [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Georges Cuvier|Georges Cuvier]], the German philosopher [[Karl Krause]], and the German naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]].  Krause paid a public tribute to Luz's scientific and philosophical views. With Humboldt, Luz arranged to establish a magnetic observatory in Cuba in correspondence with like institutions in Germany.

Caballero is perhaps best known for his often quoted characterization of Humboldt, who travelled in Cuba in the early 19th century, as the "second discoverer" of the island, after [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]: “Colón dio a Europa un Nuevo Mundo; Humboldt se lo hizo conocer en lo físico, en lo material, en lo intellectual y lo moral” ("Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects").

On his return to Cuba in 1831, Luz devoted all his time and energies to the cause of education, assuming the direction of a college from 1834 until 1839. In 1848 he founded the "El Salvador" school.

Among his works are a translation of [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]]'s ''Travels in Egypt and Syria'', with notes and additions (Paris, 1829); Siegling's ''Public Prisons and their Reforms'', from the German (1837); and numerous memoirs and pamphlets on educational, scientific, and philosophical subjects. There are several biographies of La Luz, one being that in Spanish by José Ignacio Rodriguez (New York, 1874).

Sor '''Juana Inés de la Cruz''', [[Hieronymites|O.S.H.]] (English: Sister Joan Agnes of the Cross; 12 November 1648 – 17 April 1695), &lt;!-- Some sources indicate a birth date in 1648, but consensus seems to be 1651. Please don't change. --&gt;was a self-taught scholar and student of scientific thought, [[philosopher]], [[composer]], and [[poet]] of the [[Baroque]] school, and [[Hieronymite]] [[nun]] of [[New Spain]]. She was known as a nun who demonstrated the courage to challenge opinions and speak out for her beliefs.  Her outspoken opinion granted her lifelong names such as, "The Tenth Muse", "The Phoenix of America", or the "Mexican Phoenix".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Murray, Stuart (2009). The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago: [[Skyhorse Publishing]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8389-0991-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sor Juana lived during [[Mexico|Mexico's]] colonial period, making her a contributor both to early Mexican literature as well as to the broader literature of the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. Beginning her studies [[Child prodigy|at a young age]], Sor Juana was fluent in [[Latin]]&lt;ref name="mexonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sor Juana Ines de La Cruz, famous women of Mexico|url=http://www.mexonline.com/history-sorjuana.htm|website=Mexonline.com|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also wrote in [[Nahuatl]],&lt;ref&gt;TOWNSEND, C.

==Life==
[[File:Panoaya.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Hacienda Panoaya]], in [[Amecameca]], Mexico is where Sor Juana lived between 1651 and 1656.]]
She was born '''Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana''' in [[Tepetlixpa|San Miguel Nepantla]] (now called Nepantla de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in her honor) near [[Mexico City]]. She was the [[illegitimate child]] of a Spanish Captain, Pedro Manuel de Asbaje, and a [[Criollo people|Criolla]] woman, Isabel Ramírez. Her father, according to all accounts, was absent from her life. She was baptized 2 December 1651 and described on the baptismal rolls as "a daughter of the Church". She was raised in [[Amecameca]], where her maternal grandfather owned an ''[[Hacienda]]''.

As a child, Juana often hid in the ''[[Hacienda]]'' chapel to read her grandfather's books from the adjoining library, something forbidden to girls. She learned how to read and write Latin at the age of three. By age five, she reportedly could do accounts. At age eight, she composed a poem on the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name="Appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Cruz, Juana Inés de la|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By adolescence, Juana had mastered Greek logic, and at age thirteen she was teaching [[Latin]] to young children. She also learned the [[Aztec]] language of [[Nahuatl]] and wrote some short poems in that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1032|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|website=poets.org|publisher=Academy of American Poets|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Retrato de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (Fray Miguel Herrera).jpg|thumb|250px|Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz by Friar Miguel de Herrera (1700-1789),]]
In 1664, at the age of 16, Juana was sent to live in [[Mexico City]]. She asked her mother's permission to disguise herself as a male student so that she could enter the university there. Not being allowed to do this, she continued her studies privately. She was a lady-in-waiting at the colonial viceroy's court,&lt;ref name="Murray 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-8389-0991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she came under the tutelage of the Vicereine [[Leonor Carreto]], wife of the [[Viceroy]] of New Spain [[Antonio Sebastián de Toledo]]. The viceroy (whom ''[[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]]'' names as the Marquis de Mancera), wishing to test the learning and intelligence of this 17-year-old, invited several theologians, jurists, philosophers, and poets to a meeting, during which she had to answer many questions unprepared and explain several difficult points on various scientific and literary subjects. The manner in which she acquitted herself astonished all present and greatly increased her reputation. Her literary accomplishments garnered her fame throughout [[New Spain]]. She was much admired in the viceregal court, and she received several proposals of marriage, which she declined.&lt;ref name="Appletons" /&gt;

=== As a nun ===
[[File:Sor Juana.JPG|thumb|left|Monument of Sor Juana in [[Chapultepec]].]]
In 1667, she entered the [[Monastery]] of St. Joseph, a community of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite nuns]], as a [[postulant]]. She chose not to enter that order, which had strict rules. Later, in 1669, she entered the monastery of the [[Hieronymites|Hieronymite nuns]], which had more relaxed rules. She chose to become a nun so that she could study as she wished since she wanted "to have no fixed occupation which might curtail my freedom to study."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/sor-juana-inés-de-la-cruz-38178|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Biography|date=|website=Biography.com|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the convent and perhaps earlier, Sor Juana became friends with fellow savant, Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]], who visited her in the convent's locutorio.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Baroque Times in Old Mexico: Seventeenth-Century Persons, Places, and Practices|last=Leonard|first=Irving A.|date=1960|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472061105|edition=12th|pages=191–192|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stayed cloistered in the Convent of Santa Paula of the Hieronymite in Mexico City from 1669 until her death, and there she studied, wrote, and collected a large library of books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Viceroy and Vicereine of New Spain became her patrons; they supported her and had her writings published in Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She addressed some of her poems to paintings of her friend and patron [[María Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga]], daughter of Vespasiano Gonzaga, Duca di Guastala, Luzara e Rechiolo and Inés María Manrique, 9th Countess de Paredes, which she also addressed as Lísida.

One noted critic of her writing was the bishop of Puebla, [[Manuel Fernández de Santa Cruz]], who in November of 1690 published Sor Juana's critique of a 40-year-old sermon by [[Father António Vieira]], a Portuguese Jesuit preacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1072584/Manuel-Fernandez-de-Santa-Cruz|title=Manuel Fernandez de Santa Cruz, bishop of Puebla|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to publishing that without her permission, under the pseudonym of Sor Filotea, he told her to focus on religious instead of secular studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He published his criticisms to use them to his advantage against the Priest and while he agreed with her criticisms, he believed that as a woman, she should devote herself to prayer and give up her writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=Library : an illustrated history.|date=2012|publisher=W W Norton|location=New York|isbn=1-61608-453-7|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. Pintura.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Convento de Santa Paula (Sevilla)]]]]
In response to critics of her writing, Juana wrote a letter, ''[[Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz]]'' (''Reply to Sister Philotea''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XVII/sorjuana/sorjuana1.htm|website=www.ensayistas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she defended women's right to education: "Oh, how much harm would be avoided in our country" if women were able to teach women in order to avoid the danger of male teachers in intimate setting with young female students. She said that such hazards "would be eliminated if there were older women of learning, as Saint Paul desires, and instructions were passed down from one group to another, as in the case with needlework and other traditional activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She famously remarked by quoting an Aragonese poet and echoing St. Teresa of Ávila: "One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Mexican poet and scholar|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sor-Juana-Ines-de-la-Cruz#ref959|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas]], [[Archbishop of Mexico]] joined other high-ranking officials in condemning Sor Juana's "waywardness."

By 1693, she seemingly ceased to write, rather than risking official [[censure]]. However, there is no undisputed evidence of her renouncing devotion to letters{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, but there are documents showing her agreeing to undergo [[penance]].

Her name is affixed to such a document in 1694, but given her deep natural lyricism, the tone of the supposed handwritten penitentials is in rhetorical and autocratic Church formulae {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}; one is signed "''Yo, la Peor de Todas''" ("''I, the worst of all women"''). She is said to have sold all her books,&lt;ref name="Appletons"/&gt; then an extensive library of over 4,000 volumes, and her musical and scientific instruments as well. Other sources report that her defiance toward the church led to all of her books and instruments being confiscated although the bishop himself agreed with the contents of her letters.&lt;ref name="Murray 2009"/&gt;

Only a few of her writings have survived, which are known as the ''Complete Works''. According to [[Octavio Paz]], her writings were saved by the vicereine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sor Juana, Or, The Traps of Faith|last=Paz|first=Octavio|date=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674821064|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died after ministering to other nuns stricken during a [[plague (disease)|plague]], on 17 April 1695. Sigüenza y Góngora delivered the eulogy at her funeral.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Works==

=== ''The Dream'' ===
[[File:Claustro de Sor Juana.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The former [[Convent]] of [[St Jerome]] in [[Mexico City]].]]

''The Dream'', a long philosophical and descriptive ''silva'' (a poetic form combining verses of 7 and 11 syllables), "deals with the shadow of night beneath which a person&lt;ref&gt;In the final verse we come to know it is Sor Juana herself because she uses the first person, feminine.&lt;/ref&gt; falls asleep in the midst of quietness and silence, where night and day animals participate, either dozing or sleeping, all urged to silence and rest by Harpocrates. The person's body ceases its ordinary operations,&lt;ref&gt;Sor Juana is inspired by Fray Luis de Granada's ''Introducción al Símbolo de la Fe'', where an extended verbal description of physiological functions is the closest match to what is found in the poem.&lt;/ref&gt; which are described in physiological and symbolical terms, ending with the activity of the imagination as an image-reflecting apparatus: the Pharos. From this moment, her soul, in a dream, sees itself free at the summit of her own intellect; in other words, at the ''apex'' of an own pyramid-like mount, which aims at God and is luminous.&lt;ref&gt;It must be understood that this light of intellect is Grace given by God. [https://poemascortosweb.com/ poemas cortos] &lt;/ref&gt;

There, perched like an eagle, she contemplates the whole creation,&lt;ref&gt;This pinnacle of contemplation is clearly preceded by Saint Augustine (''Confessions'', X, VIII, 12), who also inspired Petrarch's letter about the contemplation of the world created by God from the summit of a mountain (in his letter ''Familiares'', IV, 1)&lt;/ref&gt; but fails to comprehend such a sight in a single concept. Dazzled, the soul's intellect faces its own shipwreck, caused mainly by trying to understand the overwhelming abundance of the universe, until reason undertakes that enterprise, beginning with each individual creation, and processing them one by one, helped by the Aristotelic method of ten categories.&lt;ref name="ru.ffyl.unam.mx"&gt;Olivares Zorrilla, Rocío. "The Eye of Imagination. Emblems in the Baroque Poem The Dream, by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz", [http://ru.ffyl.unam.mx:8080/handle/10391/1405 ''Emblematica. An Interdisciplinary Journal for Emblem Studies'', volume 18 (2010): 111-61: 115-17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul cannot get beyond questioning herself about the traits and causes of a fountain and a flower, intimating perhaps that his method constitutes a useless effort, since it must take into account all the details, accidents, and mysteries of each being. By that time, the body has consumed all its nourishment, and it starts to move and wake up, soul and body are reunited. The poem ends with the Sun overcoming Night in a straightforward battle between luminous and dark armies, and with the poet's awakening."&lt;ref name="ru.ffyl.unam.mx"/&gt;

'''Dramas'''

In addition to the two comedies outlined here (''Pawns of a House'' [Los empeños de una casa] and ''Love is More a Labyrinth'' [Amor es mas laberinto]), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: ''The Second Celestina'' (La Segunda Celestina).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Kirk Rappaport|first=Pamela|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=978-0826410436|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s, [[Guillermo Schmidhuber]] found a release of the comedy that contained a different ending than the otherwise known ending.  He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana.  Some [[Literary criticism|literary critics]], such as [[Octavio Paz]],&lt;ref&gt;Paz, Octavio. «¿Azar o justicia», ''La segunda Celestina'', ed. Guillermo Schmidhuber. México: Vuelta, 1990, págs. 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgina Sabat-Rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Sabat-Rivers, “Los problemas de La segunda Celestina” (Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica 40 (1992), pp. 493-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]]&lt;ref&gt;Buenos Aires: Biblioteca de textos universitarios, 1995, págs. 76-105&lt;/ref&gt;) have accepted Sor Juana as the co-author, but others, such as [[Antonio Alatorre]]&lt;ref&gt;Alatorre, Antonio. «''La Segunda Celestina'' de Agustín de Salazar y Torres: ejercicio de crítica». ''Vuelta'', 46 (diciembre de 1990), págs. 46-52.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jose Pascual Buxo, have refuted it.

'''Comedies'''

In the scholarly article, “Humor in Spain’s American Colonies: The Case of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz,” author Julie Greer Johnson describes how Sor Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. While literary dramas “became secularized and levity was added to otherwise austere moral themes,” women often emerged as comic characters, frequently exemplifying negative behavior. Although “such misconduct was regarded as serious, presenting the commission of folly within a humorous context was thought to make the lesson to women more palatable.” Humor “reinforced male authority and attempted to control female sexuality,” but Sor Juana was undaunted and ultimately turned this attitude to her advantage. By recognizing the power of laughter, she “endeavored to appropriate it on behalf of colonial women,” deducing that humor “has the capacity to defuse contention or even silence opposition,” and “the potential to provoke an imaginative framework in which reality may be restructured without provoking disapproval.” Through her use of humor, she “could call attention to the inequality of male-female images of femininity imposed upon them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Julie Greer|title=Humor in Spain’s American Colonies: The Case of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|journal=Studies in American Humor|date=2000|volume=7|pages=35-47|publisher=Studies in American Humor, 2000|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pawns of a House'''''

The work was first performed on [[October 4]], 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes’ first son’s birth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;García Valdés, pág. 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop [[Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas]]’ entrance to the capital, even though this theory is not considered reliable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This [[comedy]] of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late [[New Spanish Baroque|baroque Spanish-American]] literature.  One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los empeños de una casa|last=de la Cruz|first=Sor Juana Inés|publisher=Imprénta Clásica|year=1921|isbn=9781931010177|location=Madrid, España|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the [[archetype]] perfectly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is often considered the peak of Sor Juana’s work and even the peak of all [[Mexican literature|New-Hispanic literature]].  ''Pawns of a House'' is considered a rare work in colonial Spanish-American theater due to the management of intrigue, representation of the complicated system of marital relationships, and the changes in urban life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Love is More a Labyrinth'''''

The work premiered on February 11, 1689, during the celebration of the inauguration of the viceroyalty [[Gaspar de la Cerda, 8th Count of Galve|Gaspar de la Cerda y Mendoza]]. However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Chávez, pág. 140-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot takes on the well-known theme in [[Greek mythology]] of [[Theseus]]: a hero from [[Crete]] Island.  He fights against the [[Minotaur]] and awakens the love of [[Ariadne]] and Fedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hacia una lectura contemporanea de Amor es mas laberinto|last=Palacios Sanchez|first=Refugio Amada|publisher=Universidad Veracruzana|year=1997|isbn=978-9688344460|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sor Juana conceived Theseus as the archetype of the baroque hero, a model also used by her fellow countryman [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón|Juan Ruis de Alarcon]].  Theseus’ triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Sor Juana and Music'''''

Besides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect because, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.
In the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Pamela |title=De la música un cuaderno pedís': Musical Notation in Sor Juana's Works. |journal=Bulletin of Hispanic Studies |date=December 2006 |volume=83 |issue=6 |page=497-507}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Propiedad es de natura&lt;br&gt;
que entre Dios y el hombre media,&lt;br&gt;
y del cielo el be cuadrado&lt;br&gt;
junto al be bemol de la tierra.&lt;br&gt;
(Villancico 220)

On the other, Sarah Finley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Finley |first1=Sarah |title=Embodied Sound and Female Voice in Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’s Canon: romance 8 and El divino Narciso |journal=Revista de Estudios Hispánicos |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=1 |page=191-216 |doi=10.1353/rvs.2016.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.

== Academic literature on her==
[[File:Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (Juan de Miranda).jpg|right|thumb|220px|Sor Juana, by [[Juan de Miranda]] (''circa'' 1680).]]

There is a vast amount of scholarly literature on Sor Juana in Spanish, English, French, and German.

Her works have appeared in translation. An early translation of Sor Juana's work into English was ''Ten Sonnets from Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz [sic], 1651-1695: Mexico's Tenth Muse'', published in [[Taxco]], Guerrero, in 1943. The translator was Elizabeth Prall Anderson who settled in Taxco. One musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive at [[Metropolital Cathedral of Guatemala|Guatemala Cathedral]]. This is a [http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/f/f3/Cru-mad.pdf 4-part villancico, ''Madre, la de los primores''].

An important translation to English of a work by Juana Inés de la Cruz for a wide readership is published as ''Poems, Protest, and a Dream'' in a 1997 [[Penguin Classics]] paperback, which includes her response to authorities censuring her.

Arguably the most important book devoted to Sor Juana, written by [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Octavio Paz]] in Spanish and translated to English in 1989 as ''[[Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith]]'' (translated by [[Margaret Sayers Peden]]). This work examines and contemplates Sor Juana's poetry and life in the context of the history of [[New Spain]], particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Paz describes how he had been drawn to her work by the enigmas of Sor Juana's personality and life paths. "Why did she become a nun? How could she renounce her lifelong passion for writing and learning?"&lt;ref&gt;Paz p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;However, it wasn't only the enigmas that attracted Paz to research on the nun's life and works. Octavio Paz's book on Sor Juana is perhaps his most personal search. It is unavoidable to see the coincidences between these two writers, separated by more than 3 centuries, and who are the product of a Mexico that has yet to resolve its own historical identity. Sor Juana, who possessed an admirable genius, was trapped within a context that did not understand, nor accept her completely. On the other hand, we have an Octavio Paz who also felt a fractured connection with his own country. A country he constantly tried to comprehend through his writings.

[[File:Fama y obras póstumas del Fénix de México.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The first part of Sor Juana's complete works, Madrid, 1689.]]
In his book, Paz makes a thorough analysis of Sor Juana's poetry and traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar of her era, [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Paz analyses Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, "First Dream" ("Primero Sueño") as largely a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of [[Hermeticism|hermetic symbols]], albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Walt Whitman]].

An equally valuable feminist analysis and interpretation of Sor Juana’s life and work is found in ''The Answer/La Respuesta by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'' by Electa Arenal, a Sor Juana scholar who is recognized among [[feminists]] who changed America, and Amanda Powell, a poet and translator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arenal|first1=Electa|last2=Powell|first2=Amanda|title=The Answer/LaRespuesta by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|date=June 1, 2009|publisher=The Feminist Press|location=New York|isbn=9781558615984|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original publication, released in 1994 by [[The Feminist Press]], was re-released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by [[The Feminist Press]]. The bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana’s response to church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography. ''The Answer'' applies a valuable gender lens to Sor Juana’s writings and life.

[[Tarsicio Herrera Zapién]], a classical scholar, has devoted much of his career to the study of Sor Juana's works. Some of his publications (in Spanish) include ''Buena fe y humanismo en Sor Juana: diálogos y ensayos: las obras latinas: los sorjuanistas recientes'' (1984); ''[[Ramón López Velarde|López Velarde]] y sor Juana, feministas opuestos: y cuatro ensayos sobre Horacio y Virgilio en México'' (1984); ''Poemas mexicanos universales: de Sor Juana a López Velarde'' (1989) and ''Tres siglos y cien vidas de Sor Juana'' (1995).

Furthermore, Dr. Theresa Yugar who has written her Master's and Doctoral theses on Sor Juana, wrote ''Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text'', a book in which she discusses the life of Sor Juana through a feminist lense and analyzes Sor Juana's ''La Respuesta'' and ''El Sueño''. Dr. Yugar argues Sor Juana is the first feminist of the Americas and even one of the first ecofeminists. She claims that Sor Juana was ahead of her time and was able to intelligently critique the oppressive, patriarchal structures of the church.

==Historical memory and influence==
[[File:Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Statue of Sor Juana Inés in [[Madrid]], [[España]].]]
Sor Juana was a famous and controversial figure in the seventeenth century. In the modern era, she has been honored in Mexico as well as being the part of a political controversy in the late twentieth century.  During renovations at the cloister in the 1970s, bones were found that are believed to be those of Sor Juana. Also found at the same time was a medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Sor Juana. The medallion was kept by Margarita López Portillo, the sister of President [[José López Portillo]] (1976-1982).  During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita López Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for "safekeeping". She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' a month later. Whether or not the medallion is Sor Juana's, the incident sparked discussions about Sor Juana and abuse of official power in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/15/world/mexico-city-journal-the-poet-s-medallion-a-case-of-finders-keepers.html|title=Mexico City Journal;The Poet's Medallion: A Case of Finders Keepers?|last=Depalma|first=Anthony|date=1995-12-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Kaibara}}
{{nihongo|'''Kaibara Ekken'''|貝原 益軒||December 17, 1630 – October 5, 1714}} or '''Ekiken''', also known as '''Atsunobu''' (篤信) was a  [[Japan]]ese [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]] [[philosopher]] and [[botanist]].

Kaibara was born into a family of advisors to the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Fukuoka Domain]] in [[Chikuzen Province]] (modern-day [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]).  He accompanied his father to [[Edo]] in 1648, and was sent in 1649 to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] to  study Western science.  At his father's urging, he continued his studies in Nagasaki as a [[rōnin]] from 1650 through 1656.  He then re-entered service to [[Kuroda]], which led to his continuing studies in Kyoto.  After his father's death in 1665, he returned to Fukuoka.&lt;ref name="y49"&gt;Yonemoto, Marcia. (2003). ''Mapping Early Modern Japan: Space, Place, and Culture in the Tokugawa Period (1603–1868).'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaibara's two most significant contributions to Japanese culture were the study of nature based on a blend of Western natural science and Neo-Confucianism, and the translation of the complex writings of Neo-Confucianism into vernacular Japanese. His synthesis of Confucian ideas and Western science influence the formation of [[Shinto]], especially [[State Shinto]], and reflect similar concerns to the [[Kokugaku]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jason Ā. |last=Josephson|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxzuzIszO60C|pages=115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yamato Honzo.jpg|thumb|right|"Yamato honzō". Book of botany written by Kaibara Ekken in 1709. Exhibit in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo, Japan.]]
Kaibara's science was confined to [[Botany]] and [[Materia medica]] and focused on the "natural law".  Kaibara became as famous in Japan as people such as [[Charles Darwin]] when it came to science. He advanced the study of botany in Japan when he wrote ''Yamato honzō,''(Medicinal herbs of Japan) which was a seminal study of Japanese [[plants]]. The 19th-century German Japanologist [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] called him the "Aristotle of Japan".&lt;ref name="y49" /&gt;

Kaibara was known for his manuals of behavior, such as changing his Confucian ethical system based on the teachings of [[Zhu Xi]] (also known as [[Chu Hsi]]) into an easy "self-help" manuals. As an educator and philosopher, it appears that Kaibara's main goal in life was to further the process of weaving Neo-Confucianism into Japanese culture.  In this context, he is best known for such books as ''Precepts for Children'' and ''Greater Learning for Women'' (''Onna daigaku''); but modern scholarship argues that it was actually prepared by other hands.  Although the genesis of the work remains unchallenged, the oldest extant copy (1733) ends with the lines "as related by our teacher Ekiken Kaibara" and the publisher's colophon states that the text was written from lectures of our teacher Kaibara."&lt;ref&gt;Ko, Dorothy ''et al.''

{{LGBT sidebar|history}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''social movements''' are [[social movements]] that advocate for LGBT+ people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Earlier movements focused on self-help and self-acceptance, such as the homophile movement of the 1950s. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT+ people and their interests, numerous [[List of LGBT rights organizations|LGBT rights organizations]] are active worldwide. The earliest organizations to support LGBT+ rights were formed in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A commonly stated goal among these movements is [[social equality]] for LGBT people, but there is still denial of full LGBT+ rights.&lt;ref&gt;hoades, M. (2011). Disrupting discourses digitally for LGBT+ rights. Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education, 29, 47-64. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1038962171&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also focused on building LGBT+ communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from [[biphobia]], [[homophobia]], and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yedGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22sexual%2Boppression%22%2B%22it+lies+at+the+roots+of+the+oppression+of+LGBT+people+as+well%22|title=Actors to Gyms|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015|isbn=978-0-684-31262-0|author1=Stein|first1=Marc|date=2004-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a struggle for LGBT rights today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/10758216.2015.1041840|title=Nationalism and the Struggle for LGBTQ Rights in Serbia, 1991–2014|journal=Problems of Post-Communism|volume=62|issue=5|first1=John A. |last1=Gould |first2=Edward |last2=Moe |pages=273–286 |date=30 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of [[activism|political activism]] and cultural activity, including [[lobbying]], [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[social group]]s, [[media (communication)|media]], [[art]], and [[academic research|research]].

Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: "For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]], [[homophobia]], and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual [[nuclear family]] ([[heteronormativity]]). Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new [[rights]], benefits, and protections from harm."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Mary (2002). ''Identities and Politics: Toward a Historical Understanding of the Lesbian and Gay Movement''. Social Science History 26:3 (fall 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres.

As with other social movements, there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kitchen|first1= Julian|last2= Bellini|first2= Christine|title= Addressing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Issues in Teacher Education: Teacher Candidates' Perceptions. |journal=Alberta Journal of Educational Research|volume= 58|number=3 |pages=444–460|date=November 2012|issn=1923-1857|url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/ajer/article/view/55632}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together.  Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, C., and J. Gallagher (1996) Perfect Enemies: The Religious Right, the Gay Movement, and the Politics of the 1990s. New York: Crown.&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=RG |title=Sexuality, health, and human rights. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=June 2007 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=972–3 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113365 |pmid=17463362|pmc=1874191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201| year=2016 | last1=Roffee | first1=James A. | last2=Waling | first2=Andrea }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of [[identity politics]] that sees gay, bisexual, and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a [[minority group]] or groups, and this is very common among LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cdp/17/2/163/|title=Measuring Multiple Minority Stress|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–174|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150307132821/http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cdp/17/2/163/|archive-date=2015-03-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=|doi=10.1037/a0023244|pmid=21604840|pmc=4059824|year=2011|last1=Balsam|first1=Kimberly F.|last2=Molina|first2=Yamile|last3=Beadnell|first3=Blair|last4=Simoni|first4=Jane|last5=Walters|first5=Karina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those using this approach aspire to [[liberalism|liberal]] political goals of freedom and [[equal opportunity]], and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;One example of this approach is: [[Andrew Sullivan|Sullivan, Andrew]] (1997). ''Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con''. New York: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing that [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian, and bisexual people into heterosexuals ("[[conversion therapy]]") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in [[religious beliefs]] that perceive gay, lesbian, and bisexual activity as immoral.

However, others within LGBT movements have criticised identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the [[queer]] movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] those categories, which are seen to "reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the nonheterosexual as inferior."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the [[Napoleonic Code]] made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws. However, in [[Protestant]] countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century.

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of LGBT history}}

=== Enlightenment era ===
In [[Enlightenment era|eighteenth]]- and [[History of Europe#19th century|nineteenth-century Europe]], same-sex sexual behaviour and [[cross-dressing]] were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under [[sodomy]] and [[sumptuary law]]s. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theater]] were always performed by males, usually [[prepubescent]] [[boy]]s).

[[Thomas Cannon]] wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd'' (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Closeted writing and lesbian and gay literature: classical, early modern, eighteenth-century | first=David M. | last=Robinson | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7546-5550-3 | page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the argument: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however constructed, and consequently impelling, Nature?"

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]], an early advocate for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.]]
Social reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for [[buggery]] was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]], in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]], ''Offences Against One's Self'', c1785  ([http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html full text online]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.

The emerging currents of [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] thought which had inspired Bentham also informed the [[French Revolution]], and when the newly formed [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant "sodomite-citizens" in Paris petitioned the [[Assemblée nationale]], the governing body of the [[French Revolution]], for freedom and recognition.&lt;ref name="blasius"&gt;Blasius, Mark and Phelan, Shane (eds.), 1997. "We Are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics", New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]], who was one of the authors of the [[Napoleonic Code]]. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] also decriminalized homosexuality.&lt;ref name="vwdiou"&gt;[http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/poland_S.pdf Poland]. ''The Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, the [https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/lim/lim-16-12-1830.htm new Penal Code] of the [[Brazilian Empire]] did not repeat the [http://www.ci.uc.pt/ihti/proj/filipinas/l5p1162.htm title XIII of the fifth book of the "Ordenações Philipinas"], which made [[sodomy]] a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in [[London]] for sodomy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?
And harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?&lt;ref name="blasius" /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three years later in Switzerland, Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of ''Eros: Die Männerliebe der Griechen'' (English: "Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks"), another defence of same-sex love.&lt;ref name="blasius" /&gt;

=== LGBT movement emergence ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
[[File:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (from Kennedy).jpg|thumb|[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], German gay rights activist of the 1860s]]
&lt;!-- It seems that the information regarding Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and Karl Maria Kertbeny was removed without any adequate replacement. --&gt;
In many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late [[Victorian era]]. In 1885, the [[Labouchere Amendment]] was included in the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act]], which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.

From the 1870s, [[social reform]]ers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A secret British society called the "[[Order of Chaeronea]]" campaigned for the legalisation of homosexuality, and counted playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, Neil (2003), "The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography". (London: Century) {{ISBN|0-7126-6986-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was founded by [[George Cecil Ives]], one of the earliest gay rights{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the "Cause". Ives met [[Oscar Wilde]] at the [[Authors' Club]] in London in 1892. Oscar Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his moustache, and once kissed him passionately in the [[Travellers' Club]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 1893, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the [[Order of Chaeronea]]. Members included [[Charles Kains Jackson]], [[Samuel Elsworth Cottam]], [[Montague Summers]], and [[John Gambril Nicholson]].

[[John Addington Symonds]] was a [[poet]] and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what would later be called "[[gay history]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Katz|title=Love Stories|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits the medical writer [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock]] for introducing "homosexual" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, "Sex and Philology," p. 132, pointing to the phrase [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJETAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22homosexual%20relations%22%20inauthor%3Asymonds "homosexual relations"] (here as it appears in the later 1908 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as ''Eudiades'', which has been called "the most famous of his homoerotic poems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Aldrich|title=The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art, and Homosexual Fantasy|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature. By the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form the earliest known self-conscious homosexual autobiography.

Another friend of Ives was the English [[socialism|socialist]] poet [[Edward Carpenter]]. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offence. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. Scottish [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[John Henry Mackay]] also wrote in defense of same-sex love and [[androgyny]].

English [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called ''Sexual Inversion'' it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a [[pathology]] or a [[crime]] and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Konträre Geschlechtsgefühle''. Leipzig, 1896. See {{cite book|last=White|first=Chris|title=Nineteenth-Century Writings on Homosexuality|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal [[taboo]]s on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].

These early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as '[[free love]]'; a critique of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]] and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist [[Emma Goldman]], also spoke in defence of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.

An early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. In 1897 he formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] campaign publicly against the notorious law "[[Paragraph 175]]", which made sex between men illegal. [[Adolf Brand]] later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the "[[Third gender|intermediate sex]]", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use "[[outing]]" as a political strategy, claiming that German [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Bernhard von Bülow]] engaged in homosexual activity.

[[File:Lesbiche - 1928 - D- Die freundin 1928.jpg|thumb|May 14, 1928 issue of German lesbian periodical ''Die Freundin'' (''The Girlfriend'').]]

The 1901 book ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex'') by Aimée Duc was as much a political [[treatise]] as a novel, criticising pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breger | first1 = Claudia | year = 2005 | title = Feminine Masculinities: Scientific and Literary Representations of "Female Inversion" at the Turn of the Twentieth Century | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Sexuality | volume = 14 | issue = 1/2| pages = 76–106 | doi=10.1353/sex.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Rüling]], delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female [[Uranian]] activist. Rüling, who also saw "men, women, and homosexuals" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader [[Helene Stöcker]] became a prominent figure in the movement. [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] published LGBT literature and magazines in [[Berlin]] (e.g., ''Die Freundin'').

Hirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be [[History of Gays during the Holocaust|drastically reversed]] with the rise of [[Nazism]], and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal [[Der Kreis]] was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.

USSR's Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalised homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Healey2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Healey|title=Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_Et9nlFT2YC|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=15 October 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32233-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time – which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women's rights – including legalising abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialise housework. During Stalin's era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures – re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.

In 1928, English writer [[Radclyffe Hall]] published a novel titled ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''. Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1981), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that [[same-sex attraction]] was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, p. XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Rictor, (2005), "[http://rictornorton.co.uk/suppress.htm The Suppression of Lesbian and Gay History]"&lt;/ref&gt; A better documented group is [[Henry Gerber]]'s [[Society for Human Rights]] formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.&lt;ref name="when"&gt;Bullough, Vern, "[http://hnn.us/articles/11316.html When Did the Gay Rights Movement Begin?]", 18 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homophile movement (1945–1969) ===
{{Main|Homophile}}
[[File:The Ladder, October 1957.jpg|thumb|Cover of U.S. lesbian publication ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'' from October 1957. The motif of masks and unmasking was prevalent in the [[homophile]] era, prefiguring the political strategy of [[coming out]] and giving the [[Mattachine Society]] its name.]]

Immediately following [[World War II]], a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the [[Western world]], in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term ''homophile'' to ''homosexual'', emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, [[Arcadie (French homophile organization)|France]], Britain and elsewhere. [[ONE, Inc.]], the first public homosexual organization in the U.S,&lt;ref name="before"&gt;Percy, William A. &amp; William Edward Glover, 2005, [http://williamapercy.com/pub-Comments-PercyGlover.htm Before Stonewall], November 5, 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621122142/http://williamapercy.com/pub-Comments-PercyGlover.htm |date=June 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man [[Reed Erickson]]. A U.S. transgender rights journal, ''Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress'', also published two issues in 1952.

The homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]]. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite.&lt;ref name="matzner"&gt;Matzner, 2004, "[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/stonewall_riots.html Stonewall Riots] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116051051/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/stonewall_riots.html |date=January 16, 2006 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S,&lt;ref&gt;Percy, 2005, "[http://williamapercy.com/BeforeStonewallReview.htm Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827185054/http://williamapercy.com/BeforeStonewallReview.htm |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media. A 1962 gay march held in front of [[Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, [[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Gene Compton's Cafeteria.]]

The [[Wolfenden Report]] was published in Britain on 4 September 1957 after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including [[Lord Montagu]]. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence". All but James Adair were in favour of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses' evidence at that time, found that "homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects." The report added, "The law's function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others … It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour."

The report eventually led to the introduction of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|Sexual Offences Bill 1967]] supported by [[labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Roy Jenkins]], then the Labour [[Home Secretary]]. When passed, The [[Sexual Offences Act]] decriminalised homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age ''in private'' in [[England]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/02/tories-out-in-force-gay-pride "From Section 28 to a Home Office float – Tories come out in force at gay march"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk)]] founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.&lt;ref name="binetusa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|title=TIMELINE: THE BISEXUAL HEALTH MOVEMENT IN THE US|publisher=BiNetUSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967.&lt;ref name="binetusa" /&gt; Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time.&lt;ref name="binetusa" /&gt;

=== Gay Liberation movement (1969–1974) ===
{{Main|Gay Liberation}}
{{See also|1970s in LGBT rights}}

The American Psychiatric Association removed "homosexuality" from the diagnostics manual of mental illness in 1973.

[[File:Barbara Gittings 1965.jpg|thumb|Gay equality activist [[Barbara Gittings]] picketing [[Independence Hall]] in 1965.]]
The [[new social movements]] of the sixties, such as the [[Black Power]] and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and [[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation]] throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical,&lt;ref name="matzner" /&gt; and the [[Gay Liberation]] movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, when a group of gay men, lesbians, and drag queens at a bar in [[New York City|New York]] resisted a police raid.&lt;ref name="when" /&gt;

Immediately after Stonewall, such groups as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) and the [[Gay Activists' Alliance]] (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word ''[[gay]]'' represented a new unapologetic defiance—as an antonym for ''straight'' ("respectable sexual behaviour"), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexualities and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Altman|Altman, D.]] (1971). ''Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation''. New York: Outerbridge &amp; Dienstfrey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam, B. D. (1987). ''The rise of a gay and lesbian movement''. Boston: Twayne Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gay Lib writer [[Toby Marotta]], "their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist".&lt;ref&gt;Marotta, Toby, ''The Politics of Homosexuality'', Boston, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "Out, loud and proud," they engaged in colourful [[street theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, John &amp; Bull, Chris, 1996, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/perfectenemies.htm Perfect Enemies]&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF's "A Gay Manifesto" set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement, and influential intellectual [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] published "The Politics of Being Queer" (1969). Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The [[Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire]] was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the [[Mouvement Homophile de France]].

The [[Gay liberation|Gay Liberation]] movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, did not welcome transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=68, 77, 110|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF allowed but was not inclusive toward transgender people from its creation, and the GAA specifically excluded transgender people from its agenda, mission and activism. Transgender communities formed their own organizations, including STAR ([[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries]]), [[Queens Liberation Front|Queen's Liberation Front]] (QLF), and the Transsexual Activist Organization. [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Marsha P. Johnson]] founded STAR in 1970 to provide transgender street kids with a free &amp; safe place to live, food, clothing, and an education. QLF was founded by [[Lee Brewster]] and Bunny Eisenhower to combat the erasure of drag and transgender visibility in the first LGBT pride march, demonstrating how quickly and fully the gay liberation movement excluded transgender activists despite their key role in the Stonewall Riots and previous LGBTQ activism. TAO, founded by Angela K. Douglas in 1970, was the first international [[grassroots]] transgender community organization, and is known for publishing the ''Moonshadow'' and ''Mirage'' newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=110–112|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual activist [[Brenda Howard]] is known as the "Mother of Pride" for her work in coordinating the first [[pride parade|LGBT pride march]]; the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day|Christopher Street Liberation Day March]] eventually occurred in New York on June 27, 1970.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=111|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around [[pride parade|Pride Day]]  which became the genesis of the annual [[Gay pride|LGBT Pride celebrations]] that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 |title=Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement|publisher=WNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ |title=The Gay Pride Issue|date=Jun 18, 2007 |last=Belonsky|first=Andrew|work=Queerty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Howard along with bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk)]] and [[L. Craig Schoonmaker]] are credited with popularizing the word "Pride" to describe these festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Dynes, Wayne R. [http://homolexis.com/glossary/index.php/Pride_(trope) Pride (trope), Homolexis]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712215328/http://homolexis.com/glossary/index.php/Pride_%28trope%29 |date=July 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As bisexual activist [[Tom Limoncelli]] put it, "The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named [[Brenda Howard]] thought it should be.'"

One of the values of the movement was [[gay pride]]. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, Craig Rodwell, proprietor of the [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.

In the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the [[London School of Economics]] on 13 October 1970. [[Bob Mellors]] and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.&lt;ref name=outrage-p2&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Alternative to Sexual Shame: Impact of the new militancy among homosexual groups|publisher=The Times|author=Victoria Brittain|date=28 August 1971|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out.&lt;ref name=DANGO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dango.bham.ac.uk/record_details.asp?id=2896&amp;recordType=ngo |title=Gay Liberation Front (GLF) |publisher=Database of Archives of Non-Government Organisations |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruption of the opening of the 1971 [[Nationwide Festival of Light|Festival of Light]] was the best organised of [[UK Gay Liberation Front 1971 Festival of Light action|GLF action]]. The Festival of Light, whose leading figures included [[Mary Whitehouse]], met at [[Westminster Central Hall|Methodist Central Hall]]. Groups of GLF members in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] invaded and spontaneously kissed each other; others released [[mouse|mice]], sounded horns, and unveiled banners, and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|title=Uproar at Central Hall as demonstrators threaten to halt Festival of Light|date=10 September 1971|page=14|first=Basil|last=Gingell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 the gay liberation movement in Germany, Austria and Switzerland started with [[Rosa von Praunheim]]s movie [[It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives]].

Easter 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union (students union) building at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="gaybrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaybirminghamremembered.co.uk/topics/GLF%20National%20Conference|title=Gay Birmingham Remembered – The Gay Birmingham History Project|publisher=[[Birmingham LGBT Community Trust]]|accessdate=3 October 2012|quote=Birmingham hosted the Gay Liberation Front annual conference in 1972, at the chaplaincy at Birmingham University Guild of Students.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement's splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the [[London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard]], ''[[Gay News]]'', and [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Icebreakers]]. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local "Gayline", which is still active today and has received funding from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', which refused to advertise Gayline's services at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay News'' (1978) No. 135; ''Peace News'' (13 January 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 activists protested the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in their [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], and in 1974 it was replaced with a category of "sexual orientation disturbance" then "ego-dystonic homosexuality," which was also deleted, although "gender identity disorder" (a term used for [[Gender dysphoria]]) remains.

In 1972, [[Sweden]] became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by [[legislation]] to surgically change their sex and provide free [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]]. Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same-sex partners to be at age 15, making it equal to heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name=RFSU&gt;{{cite web|author=''Hanna Jedvik'' |url=http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |title=Lagen om könsbyte ska utredas |publisher=''RFSU'' |accessdate=24 June 2007 |date=5 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012000954/http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |archivedate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the anarchist Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more [[reformism|reformist]] and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a [[minority group]] and used the language of civil rights—in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1999). ''Gay and lesbian movements in the United States: Dilemmas of identity, diversity, and political strategy''. in B. D. Adam, J. Duyvendak, &amp; A. Krouwel (Eds.), "The global emergence of gay and lesbian politics" (pp. 30–90).

Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one's sexual orientation does not reflect on one's gender; that is, "you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man," and the same is true if you are a woman.&lt;ref&gt;David Valentine, "'I Know What I Am': The Category 'Transgender' in the Construction of Contemporary U.S. American Conceptions of Gender and Sexuality" (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 2000), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch "bar dykes" and flamboyant "street queens" were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Beth Elliot]] were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.

In 1974, [[Maureen Colquhoun]] came out as the first Lesbian [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the UK.

In 1975, the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon [[Quentin Crisp]]'s life, [[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]] was transmitted by [[Thames Television]] for the British Television channel [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]. The British journal [[Gay Left]] also began publication.&lt;ref name="Knitting Circle"&gt;[http://knittingcircle.org.uk/gayleftcollective.html The Knitting Circle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114112010/http://knittingcircle.org.uk/gayleftcollective.html |date=2007-01-14 }} – 'Gay Left Collective'&lt;/ref&gt; After [[British Home Stores]] sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead, a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest.

In 1977, [[Harvey Milk]] was elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] becoming the first openly gay man in the United States elected to public office.  Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor [[Dan White]] in 1978.

In 1977, a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson, [[Anita Bryant]], began a campaign "Save Our Children," in Dade County, Florida (greater Miami), which proved to be a major set-back in the Gay Liberation movement. Essentially, she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual.

In 1979, a number of people in [[Sweden]] called in sick with a case of ''being homosexual,'' in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness.  This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quistbergh.se/view/514 |language=Swedish |title=Jag känner mig lite homosexuell idag |trans-title=I feel a little gay today |accessdate=12 December 2009 |year=2001 |first=Frederick Quist |last=Bergh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lesbian feminism]], which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]]. (1980). ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. Signs, 5, 631–660.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Gay Liberation, this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed "[[lesbian separatism]]," influenced by writings such as [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 book ''Lesbian Nation''. Organizers at the time focused on this issue. [[Diane Felix]], also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community. These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Heather. "Music's the life for Chili D." Bay Area Reporter. BAR Media Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the [[lesbian sex wars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html Lesbian Sex Wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321044928/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html |date=2006-03-21 }}, article by Elise Chenier from GLBTQ encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; clashing in particular over views on [[sadomasochism]], [[prostitution]] and [[Transsexualism|transsexuality]]. The term "gay" came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.

In Canada, the coming into effect of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, M.  (2005). ''Getting Gay Rights Straight''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Segal]], often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism, disrupted the CBS evening news with [[Walter Cronkite]] in 1973, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.

Another setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.  (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]).

=====AIDS epidemic=====
Some historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of [[AIDS]], which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many.&lt;ref name="before" /&gt; This era saw a resurgence of militancy with [[direct action]] groups like [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots [[Queer Nation]] (1990) and the [[Lesbian Avengers]] (1992). Some younger activists, seeing ''gay and lesbian'' as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using ''[[queer]]'' as a defiant statement of all [[sexual minority|sexual minorities]] and [[gender variant]] people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with ''gay''. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]] like ''[[LGBT]]'', ''LGBTQ'', and ''LGBTI'', where the ''Q'' and ''I'' stand for ''[[queer]]'' or ''[[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]]'' and ''[[intersex]]'', respectively.

====="The Overhauling of Straight America"=====
A 1987 essay titled "The Overhauling of Straight America", by [[Marshall Kirk]] and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=The Overhauling of Straight America |url=http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm |author=Kirk, Marshall and Pill, Erastes (pseud.) |date=1987 |publisher=Guide Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; lays out a six-point plan for a campaign, which was first published in ''Guide'' magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book ''"After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s."''  The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the [[gay liberation]] phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of ''Newsweek'', ''Time'' and ''The Washington Post''. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as [[Focus on the Family]] as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged "homosexual agenda".&lt;ref name="osten"&gt;{{Citation

=====Warrenton "War Conference"=====
A "War Conference" of 200 gay leaders was held in Warrenton, VA in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/02/27/Gay-rights-leaders-gather-in-Virginia/5403572936400/?spt=su |publisher=United Press International |title=Gay rights leaders gather in Virginia |date=1988-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closing statement of the conference set out a plan for a media campaign:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/19/gay-activists-divided-on-whether-to-bring-out-politicians/5ddd8954-c65b-4c3e-8e99-c1b46f8b154a/ |date=1989-09-19 |publisher=Washington Post |author=Weiser, Benjamin |title=Gay Activists Divided on Whether to "Bring Out" Politicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warrentonpaper"&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/HRC/exhibition/stage/REX023_164.pdf |title=Final Statement of the War Conference, Airlie House, Warrenton, VA |date=February 28, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote |First, we recommend a nation-wide media campaign to promote a positive image of gays and lesbians. Every —national, state, and local—must accept the responsibility. We must consider the media in every project we undertake. We must, in addition, take every advantage we can to include public service announcements and paid advertisements, and to cultivate reporters and editors of newspapers, radio, and television. To help facilitate this we need national media workshops to train our leaders. And we must encourage our gay and lesbian press to increase coverage of the national process. Our media efforts are fundamental to the full acceptance of us in American life. But they are also a way for us to increase the funding of our movement. A media campaign costs money, but ultimately it may be one of our most successful fund-raising devices.}} 
The statement also called for an annual planning conference "to help set and modify our national agenda."&lt;ref name="warrentonpaper"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Campaign]] lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where [[National Coming Out Day]] originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-history-of-coming-out | publisher=Human Rights Campaign | title = The History of Coming Out | date=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 1994, the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines. In the Middle East, LGBT organizations remain illegal, and LGBT rights activists face extreme opposition from the state.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers, [[gay-straight alliance]]s in high schools, and youth-specific activism, such as the [[National Day of Silence]]. Colleges also became places of LGBT activism and support for activists and LGBT people in general, with many colleges opening LGBT centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeequalityindex.org/list-colleges-lgbt-center |title=List of Colleges with a LGBT Center |website=College Equality Index |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726161842/http://www.collegeequalityindex.org/list-colleges-lgbt-center |archivedate=2014-07-26 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw a rapid push of the [[transgender]] movement, while at the same time a "sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual." In the English-speaking world, [[Leslie Feinberg]] published ''Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come'' in 1992. Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] activists campaigned for recognition as a [[third gender|third sex]] in India and [[Travesti]] groups began to organize against police brutality across [[Latin America]] while activists in the [[United States]] formed direct-confrontation groups such as the [[Transexual Menace]].

For example, [[Rhea County, Tennessee]] unsuccessfully tried to "ban homosexuals" in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/18/national/main607050.shtml|title=Tenn. County Reverses On Gay Ban|date=18 March 2004|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, in the case ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down [[sodomy laws]] in fourteen states, making consensual homosexual sex legal in all 50 states, a significant step forward in LGBT activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBT social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, Jeanne, ''When We Were Outlaws'' (2011) p 51-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 to 9 November 2006, [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] on application of [[international human rights law]] in relation to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] was adopted by an international meeting of 29 specialists, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] and the [[International Service for Human Rights]].
The [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 13 December 2008.

On 22 October 2009, the assembly of the [[Church of Sweden]], voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Synod opened on same-sex marriages |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kyrkomotet-oppnade-for-homovigslar-1.979744 |newspaper=DN.se |date=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226085746/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kyrkomotet-oppnade-for-homovigslar-1.979744 |archivedate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the term marriage, ("matrimony").

[[Iceland]] became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through a unanimous vote: 49-0, on 11 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/06/11/icelands-parliament-unanimously-approves-gay-marriage/|title=Iceland's parliament unanimously approves gay marriage|work=PinkNews|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, [[Argentina]] became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage.

The 1993 "Don't ask, don't tell" law, forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military, was repealed in 2010. This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation. In 2012, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs.  The new regulations ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

On June 26, 2015, in ''[[Obergefell v.

[[Eric Rofes]] author of the book, ''A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?'', argues that the inclusion of teachings on [[homosexuality]] in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals.&lt;ref name="Rofes"&gt;Rofes, Eric E. "Chapter 2: Candy from Strangers: Queer Teachers and the (Im)Moral Development of Children." A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer. Ed. Eric E. Rofes. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005. 15–37. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take [[political radicalism|radical]] approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Rofes" /&gt; According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that "something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur."The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay rights]] activists such as [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]]. Former [[California]] senator, John Briggs proposed [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a [[ballot initiative]] that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be " the corruption of the children's minds".&lt;ref name="Fetner"&gt;Fetner, Tina. 2008. How the Religious Rights Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism. University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Rofes" /&gt; Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as [[Out There (youth program)|Out There]] and [[Committee for Gay Youth]], stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.

[[David Campos]], author of the book, ''Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook'', illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of [[heterosexuality]] are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth.&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campos, David|title=Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook|location=Washington, D.C|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FKmVUwbUlGgC&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage|isbn=978-1-57607-776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these [[homosexual]] youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Campos" /&gt;

Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Fetner" /&gt; In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in schools entirely. In her book entitled "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [[Margaret Cruickshank]] provides statistical data from the [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris and Yankelovich polls]] which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and [[abortion]] should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.&lt;ref name="Darder"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Darder, Antoninia|editor2=Marta Baltodano|editor3=Raldolfo Torres|lastauthoramp=y|title=The Critical Pedagogy Reader|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2bvKJ6S-L8C&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;pg=PA496#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-415-92261-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards [[same-sex marriage]] as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sherkat, Darren E.|author2=Kylan M.

Location also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of [[rural]] and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wienke, Chris &amp; Hill, Gretchen. (2013). Does Place of Residence Matter? Rural-Urban Differences and the Wellbeing of Gay Men and Lesbians. Journal of homosexuality. 60. 1256-79. 10.1080/00918369.2013.806166.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for "LGBT individuals with like-minds" that are "enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/17876310/|title=Moovz - The Global LGBT Social Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/28/moovz-gay-social-network_n_4681259.html|title='Moovz,' Gay Social Network, Launched By Interacting Technology|last=Nichols|first=JamesMichael|date=2014-01-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]],  researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LBGT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage—generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Studies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than [[Protestants]]; 63% of African Americans claim that they are [[Black church|Baptist]] or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. [[Religion]], as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by [[Jews]], liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not "systematically condemned homosexual behaviors" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical Protestants]]. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Olson, Laura R.|author2=Wendy Cadge|author3=James T. Harrison|title=Religion and Public Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage|journal=Social Science Quarterly|series=2nd ser.|volume=87|issue=2|year=2006|pages=341–60|url=http://www.wendycadge.com/assets/OlsonCadgeHarrison2006.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction literature also has an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in [[Rafael Grugman]] dystopian fiction book ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. Underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Grugman|title=Nontraditional Love|location=New York|publisher=Liberty Publishing House|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Masterman''' (4 May 1910 &amp;ndash; 1 April 1986) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[linguist]] and [[philosopher]], most known for her pioneering work in the field of [[computational linguistics]] and especially [[machine translation]]. She founded the Cambridge Language Research Unit.

== Biography ==
Margaret Masterman was born in London on 4 May 1910 to [[Charles Masterman|Charles F. G. Masterman]], a politician, and [[Lucy Masterman|Lucy Blanche Lyttelton]], a politician, poet and writer. In 1932 she married [[Richard Bevan Braithwaite]], a philosopher. They had a son and a daughter.

== Work ==
Margaret Masterman was one of six students in [[Wittgenstein]]'s course of 1933–34 whose notes were compiled as ''[[Blue and Brown Books|The Blue Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=Alice|last2=Lazerowtiz|first2=Morris|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophy and Language|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415488440|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 she founded and directed the [[Cambridge Language Research Unit]] (CLRU), which grew from an informal discussion group to a major research centre in [[computational linguistics]] in its time. She was a student at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] and read modern languages and then Moral Sciences (as philosophy was then called). The  [[Cambridge Language Research Unit]] was founded in a small but beautiful building called Adie's Museum which had housed far eastern art: small buddhist sculptures were built into its walls and carved doors. For a period of twenty years starting in 1953 it was a source of significant research in machine translation, computational linguistics, and quantum physics even though outside the official university structures in Cambridge. It was funded by grants from US agencies (AFOSR, ONR, NSF), UK Government agencies (OSTI) and later, from EU funds in Luxembourg. Its computing facilities were primitive—an ancient ICL 1202 computer---and most of its more serious computation was done either on the Cambridge university machine, in the then Mathematical Laboratory—or by CLRU visitors at sites in the US. One measure of its impact, and from a staff that never exceeded ten people, was that of the Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards from the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] in the US, three have been awarded to CLRU alumni: [[Martin Kay]], [[Karen Spärck Jones]] and [[Yorick Wilks]].

Margaret Masterman was ahead of her time by some twenty years: many of her beliefs and proposals for language processing by computer have now become part of the common stock of ideas in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine translation (MT) fields.  She was never able to lay adequate claim to them because they were unacceptable when she published them, and so when they were written up later by her students or independently “discovered” by others, there was no trace back to her, especially in these fields where little or nothing over ten years old is ever reread.

The core of her beliefs about language processing was that it must reflect the coherence of language, its redundancy as a signal.  This idea was a partial inheritance from the old “information theoretic” view of language: for her, it meant that processes analysing language must take into account its repetitive and redundant structures and that a writer goes on saying the same thing again and again in different ways; only if the writer does that can the ambiguities be removed from the signal.  This sometimes led her to overemphasise the real and explicit redundancy she would find in rhythmical and repetitive verse and claim, implausibly, that normal English was just like that if only we could see it right.

This led in later years to the key role she assigned to rhythm, stress, breathgroupings and the boundaries they impose on text and the processes of understanding.  To put it crudely, her claim was that languages are the way they are, at least in part, because they are produced by creatures that breathe at fairly regular intervals.  It will be obvious why such claims could not even be entertained while Chomsky's views were preeminent in language studies. However she could never give systematic surface criteria by which the breathgroups and stress patterns were to be identified by surface cues, or could be reduced to other criteria such as syntax or morphology, nor would she become involved in the actual physics of voice patterns.

Her views on the importance of semantics in language processing (which, she continued to defend in the high years of Chomskyan syntax between 1951 and 1966) were much influenced by [[R. H. Richens]]' views on classification and description by means of a language of semantic primitives with its own syntax.   These, along with associated claims about semantic pattern matching onto surface text, were developed in actual programs, from which it might be assumed that she was a straightforward believer in the existence of semantic primitives in some Katzian or Schankian sense.  Nothing could be further from the truth: for she was far too much a Wittgensteinian sceptic about the ability of any limited sublanguage or logic to take on the role of the whole language.  She always argued that semantic primitives would only make sense if there were empirical criteria for their discovery and a theory that allowed for the fact that they, too, would develop exactly the polysemy of any higher or natural language; and she always emphasised the functional role of primitives in, for example, resolving sense ambiguity and as an interlingua for MT.

She hoped that the escape from the problem of the origin of semantic primitives would lie in either empirical classification procedures operating on actual texts (in the way some now speak of deriving primitives by massive connectionist learning), or by having an adequate formal theory of the structure of thesauri, which she believed to make explicit certain underlying structures of the semantic relations in a natural language: a theory such that “primitives” would emerge naturally as the organizing classification of thesauri.  For some years, she and colleagues explored lattice theory as the underlying formal structure of such thesauri.

Two other concerns that went through her intellectual life owe much to the period when [[Michael Halliday]], as the University Lecturer in Chinese at Cambridge, was a colleague at C.L.R.U.  She got from him the idea that syntactic theory was fundamentally semantic or pragmatic, in either its categories and their fundamental definition, or in terms of the role of syntax as an organizing principle for semantic information.  She was the first AI researcher to be influenced by Halliday, long before [[Terry Winograd]]. Again, she became preoccupied for a considerable period with the nature and function of Chinese ideograms, because she felt they clarified in an empirical way problems that Wittgenstein had wrestled with in his so-called picture-theory-of-truth.   This led her to exaggerate the generality of ideogrammatic principles and to seem to hold that English was really rather like Chinese if only seen correctly, with its meaning atoms, highly ambiguous and virtually uninflected.  It was a view that found little or no sympathy in the dominant linguistic or computational currents of the time.

Her main creation in 1953, one which endured for twenty years, was the [[Cambridge Language Research Unit]], which grew out of an informal discussion group with a very heterogeneous membership interested in language from philosophical and computational points of view.  Subsequently, the attempt to build language processing programs which had a sound philosophical basis was a distinctive feature of the Unit's work.  This approach to language processing, and the specific form it took in the use of a thesaurus as the main vehicle for semantic operations, will probably come to be seen as the Unit's major contributions to the field as a whole, and it was Margaret who was primarily responsible for them.  Her vision of language processing and its possibilities was remarkable at a time when computers were very rudimentary: indeed much of the C.L.R.U.'s work had to be done on the predecessors of computers, namely Hollerith punched card machines.  Equally, Margaret's determination in establishing and maintaining the Unit, with the enormous effort in fund raising that this involved, was very striking: the fact that it could continue for decades, and through periods when public support for such work was hard to come by, is a tribute to Margaret's persistence and charm.  It is difficult for us now, in these days of artificial intelligence in the ordinary market place, and very powerful personal computers, to realise how hard it was to get the financial resources needed for language-processing research, and the technical resources to do actual experiments.

Perhaps the best comment on Margaret's initiative in embarking on language processing research, and specifically on machine translation work, comes from a somewhat unexpected source.  Machine translation, after an initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was cast into outer darkness in 1966 by funding agencies who saw little return for their money. Reviewing twenty five years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody Bledsoe, one of the long-standing leaders of the field, though in areas quite outside language, said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties: "They may have failed, but they were right to try; we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult".

What she and C.L.R.U. were trying to do was far ahead of its time.   Efforts were made to tackle fundamental problems with the computers of the day that had the capacity of a modern digital wrist watch.  Despite every kind of problem, the Unit produced numerous publications on language and related subjects, including information retrieval and automatic classification.   For over ten years the Unit's presence was strongly felt in the field, always with an emphasis on basic semantic problems of language understanding.   Margaret had no time for those who felt that all that needed doing was syntactic parsing, or that complete parsing was necessary before you did anything else.  Now that the semantics of language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding by machine, the ideas of C.L.R.U. seem curiously modern.

Margaret's main contribution to the life of CLRU was in the continual intellectual stimulus she gave to its research, and through this to the larger natural language processing community: she had wide ranging concerns, and lateral ideas, which led her, for example, to propose the thesaurus as a means of carrying out many distinct language processing tasks, like indexing and translation.  Margaret's emphasis on algorithms, and on testing them, was vital for the development of CLRU's work on language processing; but her ideas were notable, especially for those who worked with her, not just for their Intellectual qualities, but for their sheer joyousness.

Serious research stopped at CLRU about 1978 and Margaret tried to restart the CLRU in 1980 with William Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25469921|title=Margaret Masterman: In Memoriam|first1=William|last1=Williams|first2=Frank|last2=Knowles|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=Computers and Translation|volume=2|issue=4|pages=197–203|via=|doi=10.1007/bf01682179}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that the new breed of micro-computers could be used to develop her algorithms for natural language translation. Margaret walked the 7 miles from Millington Road in Cambridge to Orwell and purchased two [[NorthStar Horizon|North Star Horizon]] computers from Intelligent Artefacts (see [[ST Robotics]]). These were installed with the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] programming language, written by David Sands and used by various students from the University of Cambridge who programmed Margaret's algorithms into the computers. Margaret's approach to natural language translation at this time was to split a sentence into "breath group" segments. Since each breath group had a unique meaning it could be translated into the target language and the target sentence reconstructed using the translated breath groups. This contrasted with the predominant language translation techniques of the time, notably [[Systran]] which used a dictionary and rule based system still used today. When Margaret died in 1986 William Williams closed down CLRU and its unique library of early MT documents were dumped into a skip, even though two university bodies had offered to give it a home.

She was one of cofounders of [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish College]] and its first Vice-President (1965–1975). She was a [[great-niece]] of [[Lucy Cavendish]] after whom the college is named. She also was a founder and the major inspiration of the [[Epiphany Philosophers]], a group which shared some membership with the CLRU and was dedicated to the study of the relationship of science and religion and the forms of religious practice.

In 1965, Margaret Masterman read the work: "The Nature of a Paradigm" at the Fourth International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Masterman |first=Margaret |origyear=1965 |chapter=The Nature of a Paradigm  |pages=59&amp;ndash;90 |editor1-last=Lakatos |editor1-first=Imre |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Musgrave |year=1970 |title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |series=Proceedings of the 1965 International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science |volume=4 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=3 |isbn=9780521096232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; She conducted a detailed textual criticism of Thomas S. Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), characterizing the book as "at once scientifically perspicuous and philosophically obscure."  Masterman praised Kuhn as "one of the outstanding philosophers of science of our time" and his concept of paradigms as "a fundamental idea and a new one in the philosophy of science."  She criticised [[Thomas Kuhn]] for his vague and inconsistent use of the concept "Paradigm," noting that it is used in at least 21 different senses, which can be summarized in three groups:  metaparadigms, sociological paradigms, and artefact or construct paradigms. Masterman proposed that Kuhn's critics in the philosophy of science dealt only with metaparadigms and explored the insights and implications of the various conceptions.  This criticism was accepted by Thomas Kuhn and was crucial in the shift of the concept "Paradigm" to "Incommensurability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kuhn |first=T.

'''Mark Duncan''' (1570?–1640) was a Scottish regent of the [[University of Saumur]].{{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

==Life==
Duncan was the son of Thomas Duncan of Maxpoffle, [[Roxburghshire]], by Janet, daughter of Patrick Oliphant of Sowdoun in the same county, is supposed to have been born about 1570, and to have been educated partly in Scotland and partly on the continent. He certainly took the degree of M.D., but at what university is not known. {{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

From [[Philippe de Mornay|Duplessis-Mornay]], he was appointed governor of Saumur by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1589; he received the post of professor of philosophy in the [[University of Saumur]], of which he subsequently became regent. {{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

Duncan is said to have been versed in mathematics and theology, as well as in philosophy, and to have acquired such a reputation for medical skill that [[James I of England|James I]] offered him the post of [[physician in ordinary]] at the English court, and even forwarded to him the necessary patent; but to have declined the royal invitation out of regard to his wife (a French lady), who was reluctant to leave her native land.{{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

Duncan lived at Saumur until his death, which took place in 1640, to the regret, it is said, of Protestants and Catholics alike.{{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

==Works==
Duncan published in 1612 ''Institutiones Logicæ'', to which Burgersdijck, in the preface to his own ''Institutiones Logicæ'' (second edition 1634), acknowledged himself much indebted, and which indeed seems to have served as a model to the latter work; also (anon.) in 1634, ''Discours de la Possession des Religieuses Ursulines de Loudun'', an investigation of the supposed cases of demoniacal possession among the [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] nuns of [[Loudun]]. The phenomena had been attributed to the sorcery of [[Urbain Grandier]], curé and canon of Loudun, who had been [[burned at the stake]] in consequence.
Duncan explained them, at much risk to himself, as the result of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. He is said to have been shielded from the vengeance of the clergy only by the influence of the wife of the Maréchal [[Urbain de Maillé-Brézé]], then governor of Saumur.

This work elicited an answer in the shape of a ''Traité de la Mélancholie'' by the Sieur de la Menardière, and that in its turn an ''Apologie pour Mr. Duncan, Docteur en Médecine, dans laquelle les plus rares effects de la Mélancholie et de l'imagination sont expliquez contre les reflexions du Sieur de la M&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; par le Sieur de la F. M.''. La Flèche (no date).{{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

Duncan also wrote a treatise entitled ''Aglossostomographie'' on a boy who continued to speak after he had lost his tongue, pronouncing only the letter "r" with difficulty. The faulty Greek of the title, which should have been ''Aglossostomatographie'', was very severely criticised in prose and verse by a rival physician of Saumur, named Benoit.{{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

==Family==
Duncan had three sons, who took the names respectively [[Mark Duncan de Cérisantis]], Saint Helène, and Montfort.{{sfn|Rigg|1888|p=171}}

'''Heshang Moheyan''' ({{zh|c=和尚摩訶衍|p=Héshang Móhēyǎn}}) was a late 8th century [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] associated with the [[East Mountain Teaching]]. He became famous for representing [[Chan Buddhism]] in the so called "Council of Lhasa," a debate between adherents of the Indian teachings of "gradual enlightenment" and the Chinese teachings of "sudden enlightenment," which according to tradition was won by the "gradual teachings."

==Etymology==
''Hvashang'' is a Tibetan approximation of the Chinese ''héshang'' "[[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] ({{zh|c=和尚}}). This, in turn, comes from the [[Sanskrit]] title ''upādhyāya'' "teacher".&lt;ref group=web name="Chua, Ying 2008"&gt;[http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/Essays/YC97.270Arhats.html Chua, Ying (1998), ''Arhats'']. (accessed: January 14, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glashoff|first1=Klaus|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=Upadhyaya+&amp;trans=Translate|website=spokensanskrit.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Dunhuang sojourn===
Whilst the East Mountain Teachings (pejoratively known as the "Northern School" Chan) were in decline, having been attacked by [[Shenhui]] (a student of [[Huineng]]) as a supposed "gradual enlightenment" teaching, Moheyan  traveled to [[Dunhuang]], which at the time belonged to the [[Tibetan Empire]], in 781 or 787.{{sfn|Ray|2005}} For Moheyan, this was a new opportunity for the spread of (Northern) Chan.{{sfn|Ray|2005}}

===Council of Lhasa===
[[File:A grand view of Samye.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of [[Samye]]]]
{{main|Samye Debate}}
After teaching in the area of [[Dunhuang]], Moheyan was invited by [[Trisong Detsen]] of the [[Tibetan Empire]] to settle at [[Samye]], then the center of emerging Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik TCI"&gt;[http://earlytibet.com/2007/11/13/tibetan-chan-i-the-emperors-chan Sam van Schaik (2008), ''Tibetan Chan I: The Emperor's Chan'']&lt;/ref&gt; Moheyan promulgated a variety of Chan Buddhism and disseminated teachings from Samye where he attracted a considerable number of followers.

However, in 793 Trisong Detsen resolved that Moheyan did not hold the true [[Dharma]]. Following intense protests from Moheyan’s supporters, Trisong Detsen proposed to settle the matter by sponsoring a debate.{{refn|group=note|[[Dialectic]] is an ancient aspect of the [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], as it is in [[Himalaya]]n tradition.}} The most famous of these debates has become known as the "Council of Lhasa", although it may have taken place at Samye, a considerable distance from [[Lhasa]]. For the famed Council of Lhasa, an Indian monk named [[Kamalaśīla]] was invited to represent [[history of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]], while Moheyan represented East Mountain Teachings and [[Chinese Buddhism]].

While Moheyan took a [[subitism|subitist]] approach to [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], his position was weakened when conceding that practices such as the [[pāramitā|perfection of morality]], studying the sutras and teachings of the masters, and cultivating meritorious actions were appropriate. These types of actions were seen as part of the "gradualist" school, and Moheyan held that these were only necessary for those of "dim" facility and "dull" propensity. Those of "sharp" and "keen" facility and propensity do not need these practices, as they have "direct" access to the truth through meditation. This concession to the "gradualists", that not everyone can achieve the highest state of meditation, left Moheyan open to the charge that he had a dualistic approach to practice. To overcome these inconsistencies in his thesis, Moheyan claimed that when one gave up all conceptions, an automatic, all-at-once attainment of virtue resulted. He taught that there was an "internal" practice to gain [[prajñā (Buddhism)|insight]] and liberate one-self, and an "external" practice to liberate others ([[upaya]], or skillful means). These were seen as two independent practices, a concession to human psychology and scriptural tradition.

Most Tibetan sources state that the debate was decided in Kamalaśīla's favour (though many Chinese sources claim Moheyan won){{sfn|Powers|2004|p=38-44}} and Moheyan was required to leave the country and that all sudden-enlightenment texts were gathered and destroyed by royal decree. This was a pivotal event in the history of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which would afterward continue to follow the late Indian model with only minor influence from [[China]].

Nevertheless, Chan texts were produced until the 10th century in Tibet, which casts doubt on these Tibetan sources.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik TCI" /&gt;

==Teachings==

===Sudden teachings===
{{Main article|East Mountain Teaching|Chan Buddhism|Subitism}}

Moheyan’s teachings were a mixture of the East Mountain Teachings{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Chinese: 東山法門 ''tung-shan fa-men''; given the appellation of "Northern School" Chan by Shenhui (670-762)}} associated with [[Yuquan Shenxiu ]] and [[Baotang]] Chan.{{sfn|Hanson-Barber|1985}} Broughton gives the following nomenclature:{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}
{{quote|Mo-ho-yen's teaching in Tibet as the famed proponent of the all-at-once gate can be summarized as "gazing-at-mind" (k'an-hsin... &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; sems la bltas{{refn|group=note|IOL Tib J 468: (1v) {{lang|xct|//bsam gtan nyId du ‘jug pa’I tshe/ bdag gI sems la bltas na/ cI yang sems dpa’ myed de myI bsam mo/ rtog pa’I sems g.yos na tshor bar bya/ cI ltar tshor bar bya zhe na/ gang g.yos pa’I sems de nyId/ g.yos pa dang ma g.yos par yang myI brtag/ yod pa dang myed par yang (2r) myI brtag/ dge ba dang myI dge bar yang myI brtag/ nyong mongs pa dang rnam par byang bar yang myI brtag/ ste// chos thams cad cI lta bur yang myI brtag go// sems g.yos pa de lta bur tshor na rang bzhin myed pa yIn te/ /de nI chos lam spyod pa zhes bya’}}//&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://earlytibet.com/2008/05/15/tibetan-chan-ii-the-teachings-of-heshang-moheyan/ Sam van Schaik (2008), ''Tibetan Chan II: the teachings of Heshang Moheyan''] (accessed: Saturday April 17, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}} and "no examining" (pu-kuan... &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; myi rtog pa) or "no-thought no-examining" (pu-ssu pu-kuan... &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; myi bsam myi rtog). "Gazing-at-mind" is an original Northern (or East Mountain Dharma Gate) teaching. As will become clear, Poa-t'ang and the Northern Ch'an dovetail in the Tibetan sources. Mo-ho-yen's teaching seems typical of late Northern Ch'an. It should be noted that Mo-ho-yen arrived on the central Tibetan scene somewhat late in comparison to the Ch'an transmissions from Szechwan.{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}}}

The dichotomy of the gradual north and sudden south is a historical construction, as both Northern and Southern Schools contained "gradualist teachings"{{refn|group=note|Chinese: ''tun-men''}} and "sudden teachings"{{refn|group=note|Chinese: ''chien-men''}} and practices.

===Liberation from ''vikalpa-citta''===
Gōmez gives a detailed account of the doctrinary differences that were at stake at the "council of Lhasa", based on [[Buton Rinchen Drub]]'s ''Chos-'yun'', which in turn may have been based on Kamalaśīla's ''Third [[Bhāvanākrama]]''.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} Buton Rinchen Drub had chosen two points to summarize the conflict, which entails complex doctrinal and historical issues.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}}

Most of what is known of Moheyan’s teaching comes from fragments of writings in Chinese and Tibetan found in the [[Mogao Caves]] of Dunhuang (now in [[Gansu]], [[China]]). The manuscript given the appellation ''IOL Tib J 709'' is a collection of nine Chan texts, commencing with the teachings of Moheyan.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik TCI" /&gt;

According to Buton Rinchen Drub, the conflict centered around two theses set out by Moheyan:{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}}
# "As long as one carries out good or evil acts, one is not free from transmigration."{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}}
# "Whoever does not think of anything, whoever does not reflect, will be totally free from transmigration. Not thinking, not pondering, non-examination, non-apprehension of an object - this is the immediate access [to liberation]."{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=71}}

yet, a principal point of Moheyan's teaching is that according to Moheyan, the root cause of samsara is the creation of false distinctions, ''vikalpa-citta''.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=74}} As long as these false distinctions are being created, one is bound to samsara.

====Good and evil acts====
According to Buton Rinchen Drub, Moheyan taught that carrying out good or evil acts binds one to transmigration.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=71}} Moheyan's point is that the concept of good or false is itself still conceptual thinking, which obscures enlightenment. If all thought, good or bad, obscures enlightenment, then all actions must be based on the simplest principles of conduct. To achieve proper conduct, all conceptions, without exception should be seen as false: 
{{quote|If one sees conceptions as no conception, one sees the [[Tathāgata]].{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=90}}}}

====Not-thinking====
Sam van Schaik notes that Moheyan "didn’t advocate the suppression of thoughts," but rather advised, in his own words:
{{quote|[Y]ou should not suppress concepts. Whenever they arise, if you do not fabricate anything but instead let them go, then they will stay as they are and come to rest by themselves; thus you will not pursue them.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik TCIII"&gt;[http://earlytibet.com/2008/06/10/tibetan-chan-iii-more-teachings-of-heshang-moheyan/ Sam van schaik (2008), ''Tibetan Chan III: more teachings of Heshang Moheyan'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By practicing ''[[dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'', awareness should be reverted toward this awareness itself:
{{quote|To turn the light [of the mind] towards the mind’s source, that is contemplating the mind [...] one does not reflect on or observe whether thoughts are in movement or not, whether they are pure or not, whether they are empty or not.{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=93}}}}

By turning the attention inward, one discovers that no "self-nature" can be found in the movements of the mind.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=74-75}} Eventually, dhyana leads to the realisation that awareness is [[Sunyata|empty]], and cannot be grasped by concepts:
{{quote|When he enters a state of deep contemplation, he looks into his own mind. There being no-mind, he does not engage in thought. If thoughts of discrimination arise, he should become aware of them [...] Whatever thoughts arise, one does not examine [...] He does not examine any dharma whatsoever. If he becomes aware in this way of the arising (of thoughts, he perceives) the absence of self-existence [...] After sitting (in this manner) for a long time, the mind will become tame, and one will realize that his awareness is also discriminating mind [...] Awareness itself is without name or form [...] [T]he awareness and place where it occurs cannot be obtained by any search. There is no way of reflecting on the inconceivable. Not to cling even to this absence of thought is (the immediate access of) the Tathagatas.{{sfn|Gómez|1983|p=108–109}}{{refn|group=note|Cited in Paul Williams (1994), ''Mahayana Buddhism'', p.195-196}}}}

==Influence==
The teachings of Moheyan and other Chan masters were unified with the [[Kham]] [[Dzogchen]] ("Great Perfection") lineages{{refn|group=note|This may or may not be congruent with the Kahma (Tibetan: ''bka' ma'') lineages}} through the ''Kunkhyen'' (Tibetan for "[[omniscient]]"), [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]].{{sfn|Barber|1990}} The Dzogchen of the [[Nyingma]] was often identified with the subitist ("sudden enlightenment"){{refn|group=note|Tibetan: ''cig car gyi ‘jug pa''}} of Moheyan, and was called to defend itself against this charge by avowed members of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineages]] that held to the staunch view of "gradual enlightenment"{{refn|group=note|Tibetan: ''rim gyis ‘jug pa''}}{{sfn|Schaik|2007}}

==Iconography==
According to Ying Chua, Moheyan is often [[iconography|iconographically]] depicted holding a ''[[shankha]]'' (Sanskrit) and a ''[[Buddhist prayer beads|mala]]'' (Sanskrit):
{{quote|He is usually depicted as a rotund and jovial figure and holding a mala, or prayer beads in his left hand and a sankha, conch shell in his right. He is often considered a benefactor of children and is usually depicted with at least one or more playing children around him.&lt;ref group=web name="Chua, Ying 2008"/&gt;}}

An iconographic [[thangka]] depiction of Moheyan is held in the [[Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art]] (SAMA) collection, St. Francis College, Loretto, [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/arh/pgs/T1016M.html Kaladarshan Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720154139/http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/arh/pgs/T1016M.html |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">'''{{IAST|Pakudha Kaccāyana}}''' was an Indian teacher who lived around the 5th or 4th century BCE, contemporaneous with [[Mahavira]] and [[the Buddha]]. {{PaliCanonSamanaViews}}
According to Pakudha, there are seven eternal "elements": Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Joy, Sorrow and Life.  Pakudha further asserted that these elements do not ''interact'' with one another.

The [[Samannaphala Sutta]] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 2) represents Pakudha's views as follows:
:"'...[T]here are these seven substances — unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar — that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. Which seven? The earth-substance, the liquid-substance, the fire-substance, the wind-substance, pleasure, pain, and the soul as the seventh. These are the seven substances — unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar — that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, and are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain.
:"'And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing, no hearer nor one who causes hearing, no cognizer nor one who causes cognition. When one cuts off [another person's] head, there is no one taking anyone's life. It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Thanissaro (1997).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 1), theories such as Pakudha's are labeled as "'''Atomic theory'''" ([[Pali]]/[[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''{{IAST|anu vaada}}'') and "'''eternalism'''" (''{{IAST|sassatavādā}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar (1972).[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3945.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 700, entry for "Sassata"] defines ''{{IAST|sassata-vāda}}'' as: "an eternalist, eternalism."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empedocles]] is known as Pakudha Kaccayana of Greece.

'''''Phenomenology of Perception''''' ({{lang-fr|Phénoménologie de la perception}}) is a 1945 book by the French philosopher [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], in which the author expounds his thesis of "the primacy of perception". The work established Merleau-Ponty as the pre-eminent philosopher of the body, and is considered a major statement of French [[existentialism]]. The relationship between ''Phenomenology of Perception'' and Merleau-Ponty's late, unfinished work has received much scholarly discussion.

==Summary==
Merleau-Ponty begins by attempting to define [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which according to him has not yet received a proper definition. He asserts that phenomenology contains a series of apparent contradictions, which include the fact that it attempts to create a philosophy that would be a rigorous science while also offering an account of [[space]], [[time]] and the world as people experience them. Merleau-Ponty denies that such contradictions can be resolved by distinguishing between [[Edmund Husserl]]'s views and those of [[Martin Heidegger]], commenting that Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927) "springs from an indication given by Husserl and amounts to no more than an explicit account of the 'natürlicher Weltbegriff' or the '[[Lebenswelt]]' which Husserl, toward the end of his life, identified as the central theme of phenomenology, with the result that the contradiction appears in Husserl's own philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. Trans: Colin Smith. ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1965) [p. vii]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty attempts to reveal the phenomenological structure of [[perception]]. He writes that while the "notion of sensation...seems immediate and obvious", it is in fact confused. Merleau-Ponty asserts that because "traditional analyses" have accepted it, they have "missed the phenomenon of perception." Merleau-Ponty argues that while sensation could be understood to mean "the way in which I am affected and the experiencing of a state of myself", there is nothing in experience corresponding to "pure sensation" or "an atom of feeling". He writes that, "The alleged self-evidence of sensation is not based on any testimony of consciousness, but on widely held prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. Trans: Colin Smith. ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1965) [pp. 4-5]&lt;/ref&gt; Merleau-Ponty's central thesis is that of the "primacy of perception." He critiques of the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] stance of ''"[[cogito ergo sum]]"'' and expounds a different conception of [[consciousness]]. Cartesian [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism of mind and body]] is called into question as the primary way of existing in the world, and is ultimately rejected in favor of an [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] conception or [[dialectical]] and [[intentionality|intentional]] concept of consciousness. The body is central to Merleau-Ponty's account of perception. In his view, the ability to reflect comes from a pre-reflective ground that serves as the foundation for reflecting on actions.

Merleau-Ponty's account of the body helps him undermine what had been a long-standing conception of consciousness, which hinges on the distinction between the for-itself (subject) and [[being in itself|in-itself]] (object), which plays a central role in the philosophy of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], whose ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' was released in 1943. The body stands between this fundamental distinction between subject and object, ambiguously existing as both. Merleau-Ponty devotes a chapter to "The Body in its Sexual Being", in which he suggests that the body "can symbolize existence because it brings it into being and actualizes it."&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. Trans: Colin Smith. ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (London: Routledge, 2005) [e.g. pp. 408]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Phenomenology of Perception'' was first published in 1945. An English translation by Colin Smith was published in 1962; another English translation, by Donald Landes, was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. Trans: Colin Smith. ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1965) [p. iv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. Trans: Donald Landes.

==Reception==
===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]], writing in ''Philosophy in the Twentieth Century'' (1982), criticized Merleau-Ponty's arguments against the sense datum theory of perception, finding them inconclusive. He described Merleau-Ponty's inclusion of a chapter on sexuality as "surprising", suggesting that Merleau-Ponty included it to give him an opportunity to revisit the Hegelian dialectic of the master and the slave. He compared Merleau-Ponty's views on sex to those of Sartre in ''Being and Nothingness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayer, A. J. |title=Philosophy in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Unwin Paperbacks |location=London |year=1984 |pages=216-7, 222 |isbn=0-04-100044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray S. Davis, writing in ''Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology'' (1983), observes that Merleau-Ponty's view that aspects of psychoanalysis, such as its attribution of meaning to all human actions and the diffusing of sexuality throughout the whole of human existence, are similar to phenomenology is controversial, and that other authors would view psychoanalysis as "materialistic and mechanical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Murray S. |title=Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1985 |pages=247-248 |isbn=0-226-13792-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmut R. Wagner, writing in ''Phenomenology of Consciousness and Sociology of the Life-world'' (1983), described ''Phenomenology of Perception'' as an important contribution to phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wagner, Helmut R. |title=Phenomenology of Consciousness and Sociology of the Life-world: An Introductory Study |publisher=The University of Alberta Press |location=Edmonton |year=1983 |page=219 |isbn=0-88864-032-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), described Merleau-Ponty's chapter on sexuality as "surprisingly unhelpful".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger, ''Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation'' (London: Phoenix, 1994) [p. 396]&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[David Abram]], writing in ''The Spell of the Sensuous'' (1996), observed that while "the sensible thing" is "commonly considered by our philosophical tradition to be passive and inert", Merleau-Ponty consistently describes it in the active voice in ''Phenomenology of Perception''. He rejected the idea that Merleau-Ponty's "animistic turns of phrase" are the result of poetic license, arguing that Merleau-Ponty "writes of the perceived things as entities, of sensible qualities as powers, and of the sensible itself as a field of animate presences, in order to acknowledge and underscore their active, dynamic contribution to perceptual experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Abram, David |title=The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-Than-Human World |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=54-6 |isbn=0-679-43819-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Priest, writing in ''Merleau-Ponty'' (1998), commented that, following the publication of ''Phenomenology of Perception'', Merleau-Ponty decided that in it he had taken "subject-object dualism as phenomenologically primitive" and "made use of a comparatively superficial psychologistic vocabulary" that he wished to replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Priest, Stephen |title=Merleau-Ponty |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2003 |page=9 |isbn=0-415-30864-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G. B. Madison, writing in ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' (1999), observed that ''Phenomenology of Perception'' was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism, and is best known for Merleau-Ponty's central thesis of "the primacy of perception". According to Madison, Merleau-Ponty was criticized on the grounds that, by grounding all intellectual and cultural acquisitions in the prereflective and prepersonal life of the body, the ''Phenomenology of Perception'' promotes [[reductionism]] and [[anti-intellectualism]] and undermines the ideals of reason and truth, and that Merleau-Ponty sought to respond to this charge in his subsequent work in the 1940s and 1950s. Madison further states that the relationship between the book and Merleau-Ponty's late, unfinished work ''The Visible and the Invisible'', edited by the philosopher [[Claude Lefort]], has received much scholarly discussion, with some commentators seeing a significant shift in direction in his later thought, and others emphasizing the continuity of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Madison, G. B. |editor=Audi, Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |pages=558-9 |isbn=0-521-63722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Robert Bernasconi]], writing in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005), observed that ''Phenomenology of Perception'' established Merleau-Ponty as the pre-eminent philosopher of the body, and along with Merleau-Ponty's other writings, found a more receptive audience among [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] than the works of other phenomenologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernasconi, Robert |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=588 |isbn=0-19-926479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence===
In a 1999 interview with the critic [[Louis Menand]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', American vice president [[Al Gore]] mentioned ''Phenomenology of Perception'' as an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Renshon, Stanley A. |title=America's Second Civil War: Dispatches from the Political Center |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick |year=2002 |pages=197-8 |isbn=978-0765800879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''process theory''' is a system of ideas that explains how an entity changes and develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van de Ven|first1=Andrew|title=Engaged scholarship: a guide for organizational and social research|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Process theories are often contrasted with '''variance theories''', that is, systems of ideas that explain the [[variance]] in a [[dependent variable]] based on one or more [[independent variable]]s. While process theories focus on how something happens, variance theories focus on why something happens. Examples of process theories include evolution by [[natural selection]], [[continental drift]] and the [[nitrogen cycle]].

==Process Theory Archetypes==

Process theories come in four common [[archetype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van De|first1=A. H.|last2=Poole|first2=M. S.|title=Explaining development and change in organizations|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=1995|volume=20|issue=3|pages=510–540|doi=10.5465/AMR.1995.9508080329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary process theories explain change in a population through variation, selection and retention—much like biological evolution. In a dialectic process theory, “stability and change are explained by reference to the balance of power between opposing entities” (p.&amp;nbsp;517). In a teleological process theory, an agent “constructs an envisioned end state, takes action to reach it and monitors the progress” (p.&amp;nbsp;518). In a lifecycle process theory, “the trajectory to the final end state is prefigured and requires a particular historical sequence of events” (p.&amp;nbsp;515); that is, change always conforms to the same series of activities, stages, phases, like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly.

==Applications and Examples==

Motivation theories can be classified broadly into two different perspectives: Content and Process theories. 
*[[Content theories]] deal with ''“what”'' motivates people and it is concerned with individual needs and goals. Maslow, Alderfer, Herzberg and McClelland studied motivation from a “content” perspective. 
*Process theories deal with the “process” of motivation and are concerned with ''“how”'' motivation occurs.  Vroom, Porter &amp; Lawler, Adams and Locke  studied motivation from a “process” perspective.&lt;ref&gt;http://ozgurzan.com/management/management-theories/theories-about-motivation/&lt;/ref&gt;

Process theories are also used in education, psychology, geology and many other fields; however, they are not always called "process theories".

'''''Rangtong''''' and '''''shentong''''' are two [[Distinctive feature|distinctive]] views on emptiness ([[sunyata]]) and the [[two truths doctrine]] within [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

''Rangtong'' ({{bo|w=rang stong}}; "empty of self-nature") is a [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical]] term in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] that is used to distinguish the majority Madhyamaka teaching on the nature of [[śūnyatā]] or "emptiness", namely that all phenomena are empty of an enduring and/or unchanging essence or "self," and that this emptiness is not an absolute reality, but a mere nominal characterisation of phenomena.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt; It is related to the ''[[prasangika]]'' approach, which argues that no syllogistic forms of reasoning should be used to debate the notion of inherent existence, but only arguments which show the logical implications and absurdity of positions based upon inherent existence. This position is the mainstream Gelugpa interpretation of [[Madhyamaka]], one of the main [[Mahayana]] schools, which dominates [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism.

''Shentong'' ({{Bo|t=གཞན་སྟོང་|w=gzhan stong|l=ɕɛ̃̀tṍŋ}}, also transliterated ''zhäntong'' or ''zhentong''; literally "other-emptiness") is a position within Tibetan Madhyamaka. It applies ''śūnyatā'' in a specific way, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality (''Paramarthasatya''){{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"}} is "non-dual [[Buddha-nature|Buddhajnana]]"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"}} and "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) only of "other," ({{bo|w=gzhan}}) relative phenomena, but is itself not empty{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}} and "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=12}} This absolute reality is described by positive terms, an approach which helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit [...] of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does ''prasangika'', but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

Shentong was systematized and articulated under that name by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361), who identified absolute reality with the Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}} Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the [[Gelug]] authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its [[bhikkhu|monks]] and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

After this suppression various shentong views were propagated mainly by [[Karma Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lamas. The 19th century saw a revival of Shentong-views,{{sfn|Stearns|2002|p=76}} and continued with the [[Rimé movement]]. Nowadays Shentong is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the [[Jonang]] school, although it is also taught by the [[Sakya]] and [[Kagyu]] schools,&lt;ref name=TaiSitupa&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje, 12th Tai Situpa|authorlink1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje|title=Ground, Path and Fruition|publisher=Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Charitable Trust|isbn=978-1877294358|page=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=13}} where it is identified with centerless awareness.

==Etymology==
The term ''rangtong'' is not an autonym but rather arose from the shentong theorist [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]], who coined the term "shentong" to characterise his own teachings and "rangtong" to refer to the teachings he opposed.&lt;ref name=Stearns /&gt;

''Shentong'' literally means "other-emptiness", "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) of "other" ({{bo|w=gzhan}}), i.e., empty of all qualities other than its own inherent existent.  Yet, the term ''shentong'' also refers to Yogacara teachings,{{sfn|Brunholzl|2009|p=446}} or ''Yogacara Madhyamaka'',{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} which includes the teachings of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. In the Gelugpa understanding of the [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction]], ''Yogacara Madhyamaka'' is labeled as ''svatantrika'', and set against a strict ''prasaṅgika'' approach which rejects any inherent existence.

Another translation of ''shentong'' is "extrinsic emptiness,"{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=113}} a term which is also used to refer to "Great Mādhyamaka" (''dbu ma chen po''), a term which has also been used by [[Longchenpa|Klong chen pa]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] to refer to Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka, and [[Tsongkhapa]] has also used this term.{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=113}}

==Rangtong==
''Rangtong'' is the majority Tibetan teaching on the nature of [[śūnyatā]] or "emptiness", namely that all phenomena are empty of a self-nature in both the relative and absolute sense, without positing anything beyond that.&lt;ref name=Stearns&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Cyrus|title=The Buddha from Dölpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dölpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|date=2010|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=9781559393430|edition=Rev. and enl.|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=t9rlyjOHZ98C&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;ots=ZB4NCICYy9&amp;dq=%22The%20Buddha%20from%20D%C3%B6lpo%20%3A%20a%20study%20of%20the%20life%20and%20thought%20of%20the%20Tibetan%20master%20D%C3%B6lpopa%20Sherab%20Gyaltsen%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=autonym&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is the mainstream Tibetan interpretation of [[Madhyamaka]], especially by the followers of [[Prasaṅgika]] [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]]

[[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), who also wrote in response to ''shentong'', is the most outspoken defendant of ''rangtong''. He saw [[Sunyata|emptiness]] as a consequence of dependent designation, the teaching that no ''thing or phenomenon'' has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence upon conceptual designation by a conscious mind. (See [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction#Designation .26 .22Conventional Truth.22|Designation &amp; "Conventional Truth"]])

Tsongkhapa's view on "ultimate reality" is condensed in the sort text ''In Praise of Dependent Arising''&lt;ref name="Berzin"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/sutra-texts/in-praise-of-dependent-arising Alexander Berzin, ''In Praise of Dependent Arising'']&lt;/ref&gt; c.q. ''In Praise of Relativity''&lt;ref name="RobertThurman"&gt;[http://www.bodhicitta.net/Essence%20of%20Eloquence.htm Robert Thurman, ''Praise of Buddha Shakyamuni for his teaching of Relativity. The Short Essence of Eloquence'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt; c.q. ''The Essence of Eloquency''.&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt; It states that "things" ''do'' exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence:&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt;
{{quote|Whatever depends on causes and conditions&lt;br&gt;Is empty of intrinsic reality&lt;br&gt;What excellent instruction could there be&lt;br&gt;More marvellous than this discovery?&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings"&gt;[http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ Patrick Jennings, ''Tsongkhapa: In Praise of Relativity; The Essence of Eloquence''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074106/http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This means that conventionally things ''do'' exist, and that there is no use in denying that. But it also means that ultimately those things have no 'existence of their own', and that cognizing then as such results from cognitive operations, not from some unchangeable essence.&lt;ref name="SusanKahn"&gt;[http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']&lt;/ref&gt; Tsongkhapa:
{{quote|Since objects do not exist through their own nature, they are established as existing through the force of convention.&lt;ref name="SusanKahn" /&gt;}}

It also means that there is no "transcendental ground," and that "ultimate reality" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind.&lt;ref name="PatrickJennings" /&gt; Susan Kahn further explains:
{{quote|Ultimate truth does not point to a transcendent reality, but to the transcendence of deception. It is critical to emphasize that the ultimate truth of emptiness is a negational truth. In looking for inherently existent phenomena it is revealed that it cannot be found. This absence is not findable because it is not an entity, just as a room without an elephant in it does not contain an elephantless substance. Even conventionally, elephantlessness does not exist. Ultimate truth or emptiness does not point to an essence or nature, however subtle, that everything is made of.&lt;ref name="SusanKahn" /&gt;}}

==Shentong==
[[File:Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen.jpg|thumb|[[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]], an early Tibetan exponent of the shentong view.]]

===Philosophy===
{{See also|Buddha-nature|l1=Buddha-nature|Two truths doctrine#East Asian Buddhism|l2=Two Truths doctrine in China}}

''Shentong'' views the [[two truths doctrine]] as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) only of "other" ({{bo|w=gzhan}}) relative phenomena, but is itself not empty.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}} This absolute reality is the "ground or substratum" which is "uncreated and undestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination."{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=82}} Dolpopa identified this absolute reality with the Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=3}}

The shentong-view is related to the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the [[Nature of mind (Buddhism)|empty nature of mind]]. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.

[[Shenpen Hookham|Hookham]] explains the Shentong position, referring to her Kagyu teacher [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche|Khenpo Tsultrim]]'s ''Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness''.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19}} Khenpo Tsultrim presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19-26}}{{sfn|Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso|1994}}
* "Sravaka meditation on non-self" - meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self;
* "Cittamatra-approach" - meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver;
* "Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach" - meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any "substance";
* "Prasangika-Madhyamaka approach" - meditation on "the non-conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness." In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned;
*  Shentong (Yogacara Madhyamaka) - meditation on ''Paramarthasatya'' ("Absolute Reality"),{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"|According to Hookham, non-dual experience is Ultimate Reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} ''Buddhajnana'',{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"|According to Hookham, "The Chinese Tathagarba schools describe Buddhajnana as the totality of all that is, which pervades every part of all that is in its totality."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}} According to Hookham, for Shentong Buddhajnana is "the non-dual nature of Mind completely unobscured and endowed with its countless Buddha Qualities (''Buddhagunas'').{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} This approach helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit - fosterd on the earlier stages of the path - of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

===Origins and development===
The notion of ''sentong'' grew out the Tibetan attempts to reconcile the contradiction between the Madhyama stance on the emptiness of phenomena, and the later notion of an eternal [[Buddha-nature]].{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=1}}

The earliest shentong views are usually asserted to have been presented in a group of treatises variously attributed jointly to [[Asanga]] and [[Maitreya-nātha|Maitreyanātha]], especially in the treatise known as the ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga (text)|Unsurpassed Continuum]]'' (''Uttaratantraśāstra'', also called the ''Ratnagotravibhāga''),{{sfn|Hokham|1991}} and in a body of Mādhyamaka treatises attributed to [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (e.g., the ''[[Dharmadhātustava]]'', "In praise of the [[Dharmadhatu]]").{{sfn|Brunnhölzl|2008}}

The first exposition of a shentong view is sometimes attributed to [[Śāntarakṣita]] ( 725–788), but most scholars argue that his presentation of Madhyamaka thought is more accurately labeled ''Yogācāra-Svātantrika-Madhyamaka''. The eleventh-century Tibetan master [[Yumo Mikyo Dorje]], a student of the Kashmiri scholar Somanatha, was possibly the first Tibetan master to articulate a shentong view, after his experiences during a [[Kalachakra|Kālacakra]] retreat.{{sfn|Stearns|1999}}

Shentong was systematized and articulated under that name by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]] (1292–1361),{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=2}} who originally was [[Sakya]]-trained [[lama]], and joined the [[Jonang]] school with which ''shentong'' is strongly associated. In 1321 Dolpopa visited [[Tsurphu]] Monastery for the first time, and had extensive discussions with [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama|Rangjung Dorje]] (1284–1339) about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his shentong method.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=17, 47-48, 51-52, 61}}{{refn|group=note|See also Karl Brunnhölzl (2008), ''In Praise of Dharmadhatu'', a translation of Rangjung Dorje's commentary on the ''[[Dharmadhātustava]]'', "I  Parise of the Dharmadhatu," a treatise which is (incorrectly) attributed to Nagarjuna.}} Dolpopa claimed to have extraordinary insights,{{refn|group=note|Dolpopa: "I discovered many profound essential points which have not been discovered, have not been realized, and have not been mastered by egotistical scholars, most great meditators endowed with experience and realization, and most of those who are arrogant as great upholders of secret mantra. Because a fine realization burst forth from within, and because I have an exceptional certainty untainted by doubts, not only most great meditators endowed with experience and realization, and those who are arrogant as great upholders of secret mantra, but even the Buddha definitely could not turn me back from this."{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=54}}}} and his meditational experience seems to have played a great role in the development of his ''shentong''-stance.{{sfn|Stears|1999|p=46-47}} Dolpopa developed a new philosophical vocabulary, based on Sanskrit and Tibetan, to express his insights, presenting provisional statements on absolute reality and Buddha-nature as statements of definitive meaning, which didn't requite further interpretation.{{sfn|Stears|1999|p=48-49}}

[[Chödrak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama]] (1454–1506), and the Sakya scholar Sakya Chokden ({{bo|w=gSer mdog Pan chen Sa kya mChog ldan}}, 1428–1507) were also important proponents of a shentong view.{{sfn|Stearns|1999|p=60-63}} In the [[Jonang]] tradition, [[Taranatha|Tāranātha]] [1575–1635] is second in importance only to Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen himself. He was responsible for the short-lived renaissance of the school as a whole in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and of the widespread revitalization of the shentong theory in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns 1999 p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

After the suppression of the Jonang school and its texts and the texts of Sakya Chokden by the Tibetan government in the seventeenth century, various shentong views were propagated mainly by [[Karma Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lamas. In particular, the eighth [[Tai Situpa]] (1700–1774) and [[Katok Tsewang Norbu]] (1698–1755)—Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas, respectively, and close colleagues—were very instrumental in reviving shentong among their sects.

Also instrumental was [[Situ Panchen]] (1700–1774), senior court chaplain in the [[Kingdom of Derge]], a student of Katok Tsewang Norbu. "In the end it would be Situ more than anyone who would create the environment for the widespread acceptance of the Shentong theories in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen | first = Cyrus | last = Stearns | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ., | year = 2003 | isbn = 81-208-1833-4 | page = 76 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zYiWkLTrU3oC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Situ+Panchen&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA76,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival was continued by [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], a nineteenth-century [[Rimé movement|ecumenical]] (''rimé'') scholar and forceful exponent of shentong. shentong views were also advanced recently by the eminent Kagyu Lamas [[Kalu Rinpoche]] and [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]].

===Criticisms and repression===
Shentong views have often come under criticism by followers of all four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, but particularly by the [[Gelug]]. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the [[Gelug]] authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its [[bhikkhu|monks]] and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

"Exclusive Rangtongpas", as the contemporary western [[Kagyu]] scholar S.K. Hookham would call them, have claimed that shentong views are inconsistent with the basic [[mahayana|Mahāyāna]] teaching of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], because Shentongpas posit an absolute. They sometimes label ''shentong'' Madhyamaka "eternalistic Madhyamaka."

The great fourteenth-century Sakya master [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] (1290–1364) was very critical of shentong views. [[Gyaltsab Je]] and [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama]], two of Gelug founder Je Tsongkhapa’s primary disciples, were also particularly critical of the shentong views of their time.

Among Kagyupas and [[Nyingma]]pas, the noted nineteenth-century Nyingma lama [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] wrote works both supportive and critical of shentong positions,{{refn|group=note|I.e., in his ''Lion's Roar of Extrinsic Emptiness'' (q.v. external link cited below) and in his ''Long Excursus on the Core of Thus-Arrivedness'' i.e., ''tathãgatagarbha'' (''bde-gshegs snying-po stong-thun chen-mo seng-ge'i nga-ro''). In the ''Long Excursus'' Mipham Rinpoche follows closely the gist of an historically much earlier discussion of the subject of "lineage", {{refn|group=note|(Tib. ''rigs'', Skt. ''gotta''), synonymous with Buddha-nature}} that of [[Longchenpa]]'s ''Treasure of Philosophical Systems'' (''grub mtha' mdzod''). There Mipham identifies two general extremes of interpretation, the nihilistic identification of Buddha-nature with emptiness to the exclusion of form, and the identification of Buddha-nature as a substantially real entity that is "empty-of-other" (''gzhan-gyis stong-pa''). Thus it appears that Mipham Rinpoche wished to distance himself from both the Gelug/Sakya mainstream (e.g., rangtong or self-emptiness) interpretation as well as the shentong mainstream. However, what Mipham refers to in the ''Long Excursus'' as shentong is only vaguely defined as such, and to that extent, bears more resemblance to the stock misinterpretations of shentong as given by its ideological opponents, than with any actual position held by classical ''Shentongpas'' themselves. In the final analysis, both [[Longchenpa]]'s and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso's interpretations of Buddha-nature in the aforementioned texts are substantially identical with most (though not all) of the most important philosophical distinctions invoked by Dolpopa and others in propounding the superiority and definitude of shentong approaches. Where [[Longchenpa]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] differ most obviously from self-identified ''Shentongpa'' commentators is in not applying the shentong label to their positions, such as ''Great Madhyamaka of Other-Emptiness" (''gzhan-stong dbu-ma chen-po'').}} as did  [[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama]].

==Scholarly studies==
According to Burchardi, limited attention given in academic studies to the various interpretations of ''gzhan stong''.&lt;ref&gt;Burchardi, Anne (2007). ''A Look at the Diversity of the Gzhan stong Tradition''. JIATS, no. 3 (December 2007), THDL #T3128, 24 pp. 2007 by Anne Burchardi, IATS, and THDL. Source: [http://www.thdl.org/collections/journal/jiats/index.php?doc=jiats03burchardi.xml&amp;s=d0e287] (accessed: Sunday August 17, 2008) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary western Kagyu scholar Karl Brunnhölzl argues that there is no such thing as "shentong Madhyamaka," but rather that orthodox [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] philosophy (when understood properly) is entirely compatible with Madhyamaka, and therefore shentong is not a novel position. He argues that Yogācāra has often been mischaracterized and unfairly marginalized in Tibetan Buddhist curricula.

'''Roger Bacon''' {{post-nominals|list=[[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|k|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bacon "Bacon"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Rogerus}} or ''{{lang|la|Rogerius Baconus, Baconis}}'', also ''{{wikt-lang|la|frater|Frater}} Rogerus''; {{circa|lk=no|1219/20|1292}}), also known by the [[scholastic accolade]] '''''Doctor {{wikt-lang|la|mirabilis|Mirabilis}}''''', was an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[history of philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] who placed considerable emphasis on the study of [[nature]] through [[empiricism]]. In the [[early modern era]], he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his [[history of robotics|mechanical]] or [[necromancy|necromantic]] [[brazen head]]. He is sometimes credited (mainly since the 19th century) as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern [[scientific method]] inspired by [[Aristotle]] and by the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Arab scientist]] [[Alhazen]].{{sfnp|Ackerman|1978|p=119}} 

His linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a [[universal grammar]]. However, more recent re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his "experimental" knowledge obtained from books in the [[Scholasticism|scholastic tradition]].{{sfnp|''MSTM''|2005}} He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the [[medieval university]] curriculum, which saw the addition of [[history of optics|optics]] to the traditional ''{{lang|la|[[quadrivium]]}}''.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§1}} A survey of how Bacon's work was received over the centuries found that it often reflected the concerns and controversies that were central to his readers.{{sfnp|Power|2006}} 

Bacon's major work, the ''[[Opus Majus]]'', was sent to [[Pope Clement IV]] in Rome in 1267 upon the pope's request. Although [[gunpowder]] was [[History of gunpowder|first invented and described in China]], Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula.

Roger Bacon was born in [[Ilchester]] in [[Somerset, England|Somerset]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], in the early 13th century, although his date of birth is sometimes narrowed down to {{circa|lk=no|1210}},{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=10}} "1213 or 1214",{{sfnp|James|1928}} or "1215".{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=11}} However, modern scholars tend to argue for the date of {{circa|lk=no|1220}}, but there are disagreements on this.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=10}} The only source for his birth date is a statement from his 1267 ''{{lang|la|Opus Tertium}}'' that "forty years have passed since I first learned the ''{{lang|la|Alphabetum}}''".{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=9}} The latest dates assume this referred to the [[alphabet]] itself, but elsewhere in the ''{{lang|la|Opus Tertium}}'' it is clear that Bacon uses the term to refer to rudimentary studies, the [[trivium]] or [[quadrivium]] that formed the [[Medieval university#Course of study|medieval curriculum]].{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=10–11}} His family appears to have been well off.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=218}}

Bacon studied at [[Oxford University|Oxford]].{{refn|group=n|Bacon has been claimed as an alumnus by both [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] and [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], despite having attended before the establishment of the collegiate system.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT111 111]}}}} While [[Robert Grosseteste]] had probably left shortly before Bacon's arrival, his work and legacy almost certainly influenced the young scholar{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=10}} and it is possible Bacon subsequently visited him and [[William of Sherwood]] in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]].{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=12}} Bacon became a [[master of arts|master]] at Oxford, lecturing on [[Aristotle]]. There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate. (The title ''{{lang|la|Doctor Mirabilis}}'' was posthumous and figurative.) A caustic cleric named Roger Bacon is recorded speaking before the king at Oxford in 1233.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Paris|Paris]], ''[[Chronica Majora|Chron. Maj.]]'', Vol. III, pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roger Bacon Wellcome M0005408.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A diorama of Bacon presenting one of his works to the chancellors of [[Paris University]]]]
In 1237 or at some point in the following decade, he accepted an invitation to teach at the [[University of Paris]].{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=13–14}} While there, he lectured on [[Latin grammar]], [[Aristotelian logic]], [[History of arithmetic|arithmetic]], [[medieval geometry|geometry]], and the mathematical aspects of [[medieval astronomy|astronomy]] and [[medieval music|music]].{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} His faculty colleagues included [[Robert Kilwardby]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Peter of Spain (pope)|Peter of Spain]],{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=Intro.}} the future [[Pope John XXI]].{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=14}} The [[Cornish people|Cornishman]] [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall|Richard Rufus]] was a scholarly opponent.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} In 1247 or soon after, he left his position in Paris.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=14}}

[[File:Bacon_1867.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A 19th&amp;nbsp;century engraving of Bacon observing the stars at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]]]
As a private scholar, his whereabouts for the next decade are uncertain{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=15}} but he was likely in Oxford {{circa|lk=no|1248}}–1251, where he met [[Adam Marsh]], and in Paris in 1251.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} He seems to have studied most of the known [[Greek science|Greek]] and [[Islamic optics|Arabic]] works on [[history of optics|optics]]{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=Intro.}} (then known as "perspective", ''{{lang|la|perspectiva}}''). A passage in the ''{{lang|la|Opus Tertium}}'' states that at some point he took a two-year break from his studies.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|p=9}}

By the late 1250s, resentment against [[Henry III of England|the king]]'s preferential treatment of [[Lusignan dynasty|his émigré Poitevin relatives]] led to [[Henry III of England#Revolution|a coup]] and the imposition of the [[Provisions of Oxford]] and [[Provisions of Westminster|Westminster]], instituting a [[baron]]ial council and more frequent [[Parliament of England|parliaments]]. [[Pope Urban IV]] absolved the king of his oath in 1261 and, after [[Treaty of Kingston|initial abortive resistance]], [[Simon de Montfort, 6th&amp;nbsp;Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] led a force, enlarged due to recent crop failures, that prosecuted the [[Second Barons' War]]. Bacon's own family were considered royal partisans:{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63 63]}} De Montfort's men seized their property{{refn|group=n|Though probably granting it to a partisan of their own cause, rather than razing it to the ground as is sometimes reported.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63 63]}}}} and drove several members into exile.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=220}}

[[File:Roger Bacon in his observatory at Merton College, Oxford. Oi Wellcome M0001840.jpg|200px|left|thumb|alt=Wellcome Library, oil|Ernest Board's portrayal of Bacon in his observatory at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]]]
In 1256 or 1257, he became a [[friar]] in the [[Franciscan Order]] in either Paris or Oxford, following the example of scholarly English Franciscans such as [[Robert Grosseteste|Grosseteste]] and [[Adam Marsh|Marsh]].{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} After 1260, Bacon's activities were restricted by a statute prohibiting the friars of his order from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=13–17}} He was likely kept at constant menial tasks to limit his time for contemplation{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62 62]}} and came to view his treatment as an enforced absence from scholarly life.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}}

By the mid-1260s, he was undertaking a search for patrons who could secure permission and funding for his return to Oxford.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62 62]}} For a time, Bacon was finally able to get around his superiors' interference through his acquaintance with [[Guy le Gros de Foulques|Guy de Foulques]], [[bishop of Narbonne|bishop]] of [[diocese of Narbonne|Narbonne]], [[cardinal of Sabina|cardinal]] of [[diocese of Sabina|Sabina]], and the [[papal legate]] who negotiated between England's royal and baronial factions.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63 63]}}

In 1263 or 1264, a message garbled by Bacon's messenger, Raymond of Laon, led Guy to believe that Bacon had already completed a summary of the sciences. In fact, he had no money to research, let alone copy, such a work and attempts to secure financing from his family were thwarted by the [[Second Barons' War]]. However, in 1265, Guy was summoned to a conclave at [[Perugia]] that [[papal election|elected]] him {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}}.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64 64]}} William Benecor, who had previously been the courier between [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and the pope, now carried the correspondence between Bacon and Clement.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64 64]}} Clement's reply of 22&amp;nbsp;June 1266 commissioned "writings and remedies for current conditions", instructing Bacon not to violate any standing "prohibitions" of his order but to carry out his task in utmost secrecy.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64 64]}}

While faculties of the time were largely limited to addressing disputes on the known texts of Aristotle, Clement's patronage permitted Bacon to engage in a wide-ranging consideration of the state of knowledge in his era.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} In 1267 or '68, Bacon sent the Pope his ''{{lang|la|[[Opus Majus]]}}'', which presented his views on how to incorporate [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Greek science#Aristotle|science]] into a new theology, supporting Grosseteste's text-based approach against the "sentence method" then fashionable.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}}

Bacon also sent his ''{{lang|la|Opus Minus}}'', ''{{lang|la|De Multiplicatione Specierum}}'',{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=17–19}} ''{{lang|la|De Speculis Comburentibus}}'', an optical lens,{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} and possibly other works on [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]].{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=17–19}}{{refn|group=n|It is still uncertain whether the ''{{lang|la|Opus Tertium}}'' was sent with the others or kept for further revision and development.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}}}} The entire process has been called "one of the most remarkable single efforts of literary productivity", with Bacon composing referenced works of around a million words in about a year.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67 67]}}

Pope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector. The [[Condemnations of 1277]] banned the teaching of certain philosophical doctrines, including deterministic astrology. Some time within the next two years, Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under [[house arrest]]. This was traditionally ascribed to [[Minister-General of the Franciscan Order|Franciscan Minister-General]] [[Jerome of Ascoli]], probably acting on behalf of the many clergy, monks, and educators attacked by Bacon's 1271 ''{{lang|la|Compendium Studii Philosophiae}}''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=220}}

Modern scholarship, however, notes that the first reference to Bacon's "imprisonment" dates from eighty years after his death on the charge of unspecified "suspected novelties"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicle of the 24 Generals]]'', late 14th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Maloney|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fx84AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]}} and finds it less than credible.{{sfnp|Lindberg|1995|p=70}} Contemporary scholars who do accept Bacon's imprisonment typically associate it with Bacon's "attraction to contemporary prophesies",{{sfnp|Shank|2009|p=21}} his sympathies for "the radical 'poverty' wing of the Franciscans",{{sfnp|Lindberg|1995|p=70}} interest in certain [[astrology|astrological]] doctrines,{{sfnp|Sidelko|1996}} or generally combative personality{{sfnp|Maloney|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fx84AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]}} rather than from "any scientific novelties which he may have proposed".{{sfnp|Lindberg|1995|p=70}}

Sometime after 1278, Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where he continued his studies{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=19–20}} and is presumed to have spent most of the remainder of his life. His last dateable writing – the ''{{lang|la|Compendium Studii Theologiae}}'' – was completed in 1292.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=220}} He seems to have died shortly afterwards and been buried at Oxford.{{sfnp|''ODNB''|2004}}

[[File:Roger Bacon Wellcome M0004484.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A manuscript illustration of Bacon presenting one of his works to the chancellor of the [[University of Paris]].]]
Medieval European philosophy often relied on [[appeal to authority|appeals to the authority]] of [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]], and on works by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] only known at second hand or through (sometimes highly inaccurate) Latin translations. By the 13th century, new works and better versions—in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or in new Latin translations from the Arabic—began to trickle north from [[Muslim Spain]]. In Roger Bacon's writings, he upholds Aristotle's calls for the collection of facts before deducing scientific truths, against the practices of his contemporaries, arguing that "thence cometh quiet to the mind".

Bacon also called for reform with regard to [[theology]]. He argued that, rather than training to debate minor philosophical distinctions, theologians should focus their attention primarily on the [[Bible]] itself, learning the languages of its original sources thoroughly. He was fluent in several of these languages and was able to note and bemoan several corruptions of scripture, and of the works of the Greek philosophers that had been mistranslated or misinterpreted by scholars working in Latin. He also argued for the education of theologians in science ("[[natural philosophy]]") and its addition to the [[Medieval university#Course of study|medieval curriculum]].

===''Opus Maius''===

{{main article|Opus Maius}}
Bacon's ''Greater Work'', the ''{{lang|la|[[Opus Maius]]}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Opus Maius}}'',{{refn|group=n|In his works, Bacon also refers to it as his "primary writing" (''{{lang|la|scriptum principale}}'').{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64 64]}}}} contains treatments of [[mathematics]], [[optics]], [[alchemy]], and [[astronomy]], including theories on the positions and sizes of the [[celestial bodies]].

It was not intended as a complete work but as a "persuasive preamble" (''{{lang|la|persuasio praeambula}}''), an enormous proposal for a reform of the [[medieval university]] curriculum and the establishment of a kind of library or encyclopedia, bringing in experts to compose a collection of definitive texts on these subjects.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66 66]}} The new subjects were to be "perspective" (i.e., [[optics]]), "astronomy" (inclusive of [[astronomy]] proper, [[astrology]], and the [[geography]] necessary in order to use them), "weights" (likely some treatment of [[mechanics]] but this section of the ''{{lang|la|Opus Majus}}'' has been lost), [[alchemy]], [[agriculture]] (inclusive of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]), [[medicine]], and "[[experimental science]]", a [[philosophy of science]] that would guide the others.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66 66]}} The section on geography was allegedly originally ornamented with a [[history of cartography|map]] based on ancient and Arabic computations of longitude and latitude, but has since been lost.&lt;ref name=worthy&gt;{{harvp|''Worthies''|1828|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjhkAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA45 45–46]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His (mistaken) arguments supporting the idea that dry land formed the larger proportion of the globe were apparently similar to those which later guided [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].&lt;ref name=worthy/&gt;

In this work Bacon criticises his contemporaries [[Alexander of Hales]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], who were held in high repute despite having only acquired their knowledge of [[Aristotle]] at second hand during their preaching careers.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Classification"|pp=49–52}}{{sfnp|Hackett|1980}} Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle, [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroës]],{{sfnp|Easton|1952|pp=210–219}} a situation Bacon decried: "never in the world [had] such monstrosity occurred before."{{sfnp|LeMay|1997|pp=40–41}}

In Part I of the ''Opus Majus'' Bacon recognizes some philosophers as the ''Sapientes'', or gifted few, and saw their knowledge in philosophy and theology as superior to the ''vulgus philosophantium'', or common herd of philosophers. He held Islamic thinkers between 1210 and 1265 in especially high regard calling them "both philosophers and sacred writers" and defended the integration of Islamic philosophy into Christian learning.{{sfnp|Hackett|2011|pp=151–166}}

{{anchor|Calendar reform}}

====Calendrical reform====
{{hatnote|Main: [[Calendrical reform#Julian/Gregorian reforms|Calendrical reform]] and [[Gregorian calendar#Gregorian reform|Gregorian calendar]]}}
In Part IV of the ''{{lang|la|Opus Majus}}'', Bacon proposed a [[calendrical reform]] similar to the later [[Gregorian calendar#Gregorian reform|system]] introduced in 1582 under [[Pope Gregory XIII]].&lt;ref name=baconI4/&gt; Drawing on [[Greek astronomy|ancient Greek]] and [[Islamic astronomy|medieval Islamic]] astronomy recently introduced to western Europe via Spain, Bacon continued the work of [[Robert Grosseteste]] and criticized the then-current [[Julian calendar]] as "intolerable, horrible, and laughable".

It had become apparent that [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Sosigenes of Alexandria|Sosigenes]]'s assumption of a year of 365¼ days was, over the course of centuries, too inexact. Bacon charged that this meant the [[computus|computation of Easter]] had shifted forward by 9 days since the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.&lt;ref name=dunkin&gt;{{citation |last=Duncan |first=David Ewing |author-mask=Duncan |title=The Calendar |date=2011 |pp=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal to drop one day every 125 years&lt;ref name=baconI4&gt;{{harvp|Bridges|1897|loc=[https://archive.org/details/opusmajusrogerb01bridgoog Vol.&amp;nbsp;I], [https://archive.org/stream/opusmajusrogerb01bridgoog#page/n293/mode/2up Pt.&amp;nbsp;IV] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|North|1983|pp=75, 82–84}} and to cease the observance of fixed [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s&lt;ref name=dunkin/&gt; was not acted upon following the death of [[Pope Clement IV]] in 1268. The eventual [[Gregorian calendar]] drops one day from the first three centuries in each set of 400 years.

====Optics====

{{see also|History of optics}}
In Part V of the ''{{lang|la|[[Opus Majus]]}}'', Bacon discusses [[visual system|physiology of eyesight]] and the anatomy of the [[human eye|eye]] and the [[human brain|brain]], considering [[light]], distance, position, and size, direct and [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] vision, [[refraction]], [[mirror]]s, and [[lens (optics)|lenses]].&lt;ref name=baconII5/&gt; His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of [[Alhazen]]'s ''[[Book of Optics]]''. He also draws heavily on [[Eugene of Palermo]]'s Latin translation of the Arabic translation of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]''; on [[Robert Grosseteste]]'s work based on [[Al-Kindi]]'s ''[[Optics (Al-Kindi)|Optics]]''; {{sfnp|Ackerman|1978|p=119}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] |title=Optics |publisher=(Smith trans.) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhLVHR5QAQkC |date=1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mhLVHR5QAQkC&amp;pg=PA58 58] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, through Alhazen ([[Ibn al-Haytham]]), on [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]'s work on [[dioptrics]].{{sfnp|El-Bizri|2005}}

A passage in the ''{{lang|la|Opus Majus}}'' and another in the ''{{lang|la|Opus Tertium}}'' are usually taken as the first European descriptions of a mixture containing the essential ingredients of [[gunpowder]]. [[J. R. Partington|Partington]] and others have come to the conclusion that Bacon most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of [[Yuan Empire|Chinese]] [[firecracker]]s, possibly obtained by Franciscans—including Bacon's friend [[William of Rubruck]]—who visited the [[Mongol Empire]] during this period.{{sfnp|Needham|Lu|Wang|1987|pp=48–50}}{{refn|group=n|"Europeans were prompted by all this to take a closer interest in happenings far to the east. Four years after the invasion of 1241, the pope sent an ambassador to the Great Khan's capital in Mongolia. Other travellers followed later, of whom the most interesting was [[William of Rubruck]] (or Ruysbroek). He returned in 1257, and in the following year there are reports of experiments with gunpowder and rockets at Cologne. Then a friend of William of Rubruck, Roger Bacon, gave the first account of gunpowder and its use in fireworks to be written in Europe. A form of gunpowder had been known in China since before AD 900, and as mentioned earlier... Much of this knowledge had reached the Islamic countries by then, and the saltpetre used in making gunpowder there was sometimes referred to, significantly, as 'Chinese snow'."{{sfnp|Pacey|1991|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=X7e8rHL1lf4C&amp;pg=PA45 45]}}}} The most telling passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning.{{sfnp|Needham|Lu|Wang|1987|pp=48–50}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, Henry William Lovett Hime of the [[Royal Artillery]] published the theory that Bacon's ''{{lang|la|Epistola}}'' contained a [[cryptogram]] giving a recipe for the gunpowder he witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Hodgkinson |first=William Richard Eaton |author-link=William Richard Eaton Hodgkinson |wstitle=Gunpowder |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was criticized by [[Lynn Thorndike|Thorndike]] in a 1915 letter to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''{{sfnp|Thorndike|1915}} and several books, a position joined by [[M. M. Pattison Muir|Muir]],{{sfnp|Stillman|1924|p=202}} [[John Maxon Stillman|Stillman]],{{sfnp|Stillman|1924|p=202}} [[Robert Steele (medievalist)|Steele]],{{sfnp|Steele|1928}} and [[George Sarton|Sarton]].{{sfnp|Sarton|1948|p=958}} [[Joseph Needham|Needham]] et al. concurred with these earlier critics that the additional passage did not originate with Bacon{{sfnp|Needham|Lu|Wang|1987|pp=48–50}} and further showed that the proportions supposedly deciphered (a 7:5:5 ratio of [[saltpetre]] to [[charcoal]] to [[sulphur]]) as not even useful for firecrackers, burning slowly with a great deal of smoke and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel.{{sfnp|Needham|Lu|Wang|1987|loc=Vol.&amp;nbsp;V, Pt.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;358}} The ~41% [[nitrate]] content is too low to have explosive properties.{{sfnp|Hall|1999|p=xxiv}}

===Secret of Secrets===
{{main article|Secretum Secretorum}}
Bacon attributed the ''Secret of Secrets'' (''{{lang|la|Secretum Secretorum}}''), the Islamic "Mirror of Princes" ({{lang-ar|Sirr al-ʿasrar}}&lt;!--sic--&gt;), to [[Aristotle]], thinking that he had composed it for [[Alexander the Great]]. Bacon produced an edited edition complete with his own introduction and notes and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led [[Stewart C. Easton|Easton]]{{sfnp|Easton|1952}} and others including [[Robert Steele (medievalist)|Robert Steele]]{{sfnp|Williams|1997}} to argue that the text spurred Bacon's own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.){{sfnp|Williams|1997}} The dating of Bacon's edition of the ''Secret of Secrets'' is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date,{{sfnp|Williams|1997}} but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon's conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}}

===Alchemy===
[[File:Roger Bacon conducting an alchemical experiment in a vaulted Wellcome V0025604.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=J. Nasmyth (1845)|A 19th-century etching of Bacon conducting an alchemical experiment]]
Bacon has been credited with a number of [[alchemy|alchemical]] texts.{{sfnp|Bartlett|2006|p=124}}

The ''Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature and on the Vanity of Magic'' (''{{lang|la|Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae et de Nullitate Magiae}}''),{{sfnp|Brewer|1859|pp=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k50167j/f631.item.zoom 523 ff]}} also known as ''On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature'' (''{{lang|la|De Mirabili Potestate Artis et Naturae}}''), a likely-forged letter to an unknown "William of Paris," dismisses practices such as [[necromancy]]{{sfnp|Zambelli|2007|pp=48–49}} but contains most of the alchemical formulae attributed to Bacon,{{sfnp|Bartlett|2006|p=124}}  including one for a [[philosopher's stone]]{{sfnp|Newman|1997|pp=328–329}} and another possibly for [[gunpowder]].{{sfnp|Needham|Lu|Wang|1987|pp=48–50}} It also includes several passages about [[history of flight|hypothetical flying machines]] and [[history of submarines|submarines]], attributing their first use to [[Alexander the Great]].{{sfnp|Gray|2011|pp=185–186}} ''On the Vanity of Magic'' or ''The Nullity of Magic'' is a [[debunking]] of esoteric claims in Bacon's time, showing that they could be explained by natural phenomena.{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 132]}}

===Linguistics===
{{main article|Summa Grammatica}}
{{see also|Universal grammar}}
Bacon's early linguistic and logical works are the ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' (''{{lang|la|Summa Grammatica}}''), ''{{lang|la|Summa de Sophismatibus et Distinctionibus}}'', and the ''{{lang|la|Summulae Dialectices}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Summulae super Totam Logicam}}''.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} These are mature but essentially conventional presentations of Oxford and Paris's terminist and pre-[[modistae|modist]] logic and grammar.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} His later work in linguistics is much more idiosyncratic, using terminology and addressing questions unique in his era.&lt;ref name=hovd1&gt;{{harvp|Hovdhaugen|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8UxAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124 121–122]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek]]'' and ''[[Grammatica Hebraica|Hebrew Grammars]]'' (''{{lang|la|Grammatica Graeca}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Hebraica}}''), in his work "On the Usefulness of Grammar" (Book III of the ''{{lang|la|[[#Opus Majus|Opus Majus]]}}''), and in his ''Compendium of the Study of Philosophy'',&lt;ref name=hovd1/&gt; Bacon stresses the need for scholars to know several languages.&lt;ref name=hovd8/&gt; Europe's vernacular languages are not ignored—he considers them useful for practical purposes such as [[medieval trade|trade]], [[Christian proselytism|proselytism]], and [[government in the High Middle Ages|administration]]—but Bacon is mostly interested in his era's languages of science and religion: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Medieval Latin|Latin]].&lt;ref name=hovd8&gt;{{harvp|Hovdhaugen|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8UxAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 128]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon is less interested in a full practical mastery of the other languages than on a theoretical understanding of their grammatical rules, ensuring that a Latin reader will not misunderstand passages' [[authorial intent|original meaning]].&lt;ref name=hovd8/&gt; For this reason, his treatments of Greek and Hebrew grammar are not isolated works on their topic&lt;ref name=hovd8/&gt; but contrastive grammars treating the aspects which influenced Latin or which were required for properly understanding Latin texts.&lt;ref name=hovd9&gt;{{harvp|Hovdhaugen|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8UxAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129 129]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He pointedly states, "I want to describe Greek grammar for the benefit of Latin speakers".&lt;ref name=hovd3/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Latin: ''{{lang|la|Cupiens igitur exponere gramaticam grecam ad vtilitatem latinorum}}''.&lt;ref name=hovd3&gt;{{harvp|Hovdhaugen|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8UxAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123 123]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is likely only this limited sense which was intended by Bacon's boast that he [[Language education|could teach an interested pupil a new language]] within three days.&lt;ref name=hovd9/&gt;{{refn|group=n|It has been claimed that the copies of Bacon's grammars which have survived was not their final form, but [[Eva Hovdhaugen|Hovdhaugen]] considers that—even if that were the case—the final form would have been similar in scope to the surviving texts and mostly focused on improving a Latinate reader's understanding of texts in translation.&lt;ref name=hovd9/&gt;}}

Passages in the ''Overview'' and the Greek grammar have been taken as an early exposition of a [[universal grammar]] underlying all [[human]] [[language]]s.&lt;ref name=lawman&gt;{{harvp|Murphy|1974|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8B5z0MiRnJ8C&amp;pg=PA153 153]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek grammar contains the tersest and most famous exposition:&lt;ref name=lawman/&gt;
{{quote|Grammar is one and the same in all languages, substantially, though it may vary, accidentally, in each of them.{{refn|[[Edmond Nolan|Nolan]],{{sfnp|Nolan &amp; al.|1902|p=27}} cited in [[James J. Murphy|Murphy]].{{sfnp|Murphy|1974|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8B5z0MiRnJ8C&amp;pg=PA154 154]}}}}{{refn|group=n|[[Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|...grammatica vna et eadem est secundum substanciam in omnibus linguis, licet accidentaliter varietur...}}.''&lt;ref name=hovd3/&gt;}}}}
However, Bacon's lack of interest in studying a literal grammar underlying the languages known to him and his numerous works on linguistics and comparative linguistics has prompted [[Eva Hovdhaugen|Hovdhaugen]] to question the usual literal translation of Bacon's ''{{lang|la|grammatica}}'' in such passages.&lt;ref name=hovd7/&gt; She notes the ambiguity in the Latin term, which could refer variously to the [[grammar|structure of language]], to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions: i.e., [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=hovd7&gt;{{harvp|Hovdhaugen|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8UxAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127 127–128]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
[[File:Roger Bacon Wellcome M0004130.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A portrait of Roger Bacon from a 15th-century edition of ''{{lang|la|De Retardatione}}''&lt;ref&gt;MS Bodl. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{expand list|date=October 2015}}

Bacon states that his ''Lesser Work'' (''{{lang|la|Opus Minus}}'') and ''Third Work'' (''{{lang|la|Opus Tertium}}'') were originally intended as summaries of the ''{{lang|la|Opus Majus}}'' in case it was lost in transit.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66 66]}} [[Stewart C. Easton|Easton]]'s review of the texts suggests that they became separate works over the course of the laborious process of creating a [[fair copy]] of the ''{{lang|la|Opus Majus}}'', whose half-million words were copied by hand and apparently greatly revised at least once.{{sfnp|Clegg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IiqeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67 67]}}

Other works by Bacon include his "Tract on the Multiplication of Species" (''{{lang|la|Tractatus de Multiplicatione Specierum}}''),{{sfnp|Bridges|1897|p=[https://archive.org/stream/opusmajusofroger02bacouoft#page/404/mode/2up 405–552]}} "On Burning Lenses" (''{{lang|de|De Speculis Comburentibus}}''), the ''{{lang|la|Communia Naturalium}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Mathematica}}'', the "Compendium of the Study of Philosophy" and "of Theology" (''{{lang|la|Compendium Studii Philosophiae}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Theologiae}}''), and his ''Computus''.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§2}} The "Compendium of the Study of Theology", presumably written in the last years of his life, was an anticlimax: adding nothing new, it is principally devoted to the concerns of the 1260s.

===Apocrypha===
''[[Speculum Alchemiae|The Mirror of Alchimy]]''&lt;!--sic--&gt; (''{{lang|la|Speculum Alchemiae}}''), a short treatise on the origin and composition of metals, is traditionally credited to Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Zwart |first=Hub |author-mask=Zwart |title=Understanding Nature |date=2008 |p=236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It espouses the Arabian theory of [[mercury (metal)|mercury]] and [[sulphur]] forming the other metals, with vague allusions to [[Alchemy|transmutation]]. [[John Maxson Stillman|Stillman]] opined that "there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon's style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries", and [[M. M. Pattison Muir|Muir]] and [[Edmund Oscar von Lippmann|Lippmann]] also considered it a [[pseudepigraph]].{{sfnp|Stillman|1924|p=271}}

The cryptic [[Voynich manuscript]] has been attributed to Bacon by various sources, including by its first recorded owner,{{sfnp|Newbold &amp; al.|1928}}{{sfnp|Goldstone &amp; al.|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4DD103AF933A15751C0A9639C8B63&amp;pagewanted=1 |contribution=The Bacon Code |last=Steele |first=Margaret Farley |author-mask=Steele |date=20 Feb 2005 |title=NY Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[history of science|historians of science]] [[Lynn Thorndike]] and [[George Sarton]] dismissed these claims as unsupported.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thorndike |first=Lynn |author-mask=Thorndike |author-link=Lynn Thorndike |contribution=Review of ''The Cipher of Roger Bacon'' |title=[[The American Historical Review]] |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;34, No.&amp;nbsp;2 |date=Jan 1928 |pp=317–319 |jstor=1838571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sarton |first=George |author-mask=Sarton |author-link=George Sarton |contribution=Review of ''The Cipher of Roger Bacon'' |title=Isis |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;11, No.&amp;nbsp;1 |pp=141–145 |jstor=224770 |date=Sep 1928 |doi=10.1086/346365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Foster |first=Benjamin R. |author-mask=Foster |editor-last=Garraty |editor-first=John Arthur |editor2-last=Carnes |editor2-first=Mark Christopher |display-editors=0 |title=[[American National Biography]] |contribution=William Romaine Newbold |date=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vellum]] of the manuscript has since been dated to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UA Experts Determine Age of Book 'Nobody Can Read'|url=http://uanews.arizona.edu/story/ua-experts-determine-age-of-book-nobody-can-read|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favor of other scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=218}} although his works were studied by Bonaventure, [[John Pecham]], and [[Peter of Limoges]], through whom he may have influenced [[Raymond Lull]].{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=Intro.}} He was also partially responsible for the addition of [[history of optics|optics]] (''{{lang|la|perspectiva}}'') to the [[medieval university]] [[medieval university#curriculum|curriculum]].{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§1}}

By the [[early modern period]], the English considered him the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of [[Western esotericism|forbidden knowledge]], a [[Faust]]-like magician who had tricked the [[Devil (Christianity)|devil]] and so was able to go to [[heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a [[Brazen head|talking brazen head]] which could answer any question. The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of ''The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon'',{{refn|group=n|Although the manuscript was circulated in by {{circa|lk=no|1555}}, it was not published until 1627.{{sfnp|''Fryer Bacon''|1627}} It was republished in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Thomas |editor-first=William J. |display-editors=0 |title=Early English Prose Romances: With Bibliographical and Historical Introductions |location=London |publisher=Nattali &amp; Bond |date=1858 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by "the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples",&lt;ref name=fryer&gt;{{harvp|''Fryer Bacon''|1627}}.&lt;/ref&gt; testing his theory that speech is caused by "an effusion of vapors".{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134 134]}}

Around 1589, [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] adapted the story for the stage as ''[[The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay]]'',{{sfnp|Greene|1594}}{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129 129]}}{{sfnp|Kavey|2007|pp=38–39}} one of the most successful [[Elizabethan drama|Elizabethan comedies]].{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129 129]}} As late as the 1640s, [[Thomas Browne]] was still complaining that "Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, ''Time is''".&lt;ref name=girlscout&gt;[[Thomas Browne|Browne]], ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica|Pseud. Epid.]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo717.html#brazenhead Bk.&amp;nbsp;VII, Ch.&amp;nbsp;xvii, §7.]&lt;/ref&gt; Greene's Bacon spent seven years creating a brass head that would speak "strange and uncouth aphorisms"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene]], ''[[Friar Bacon &amp; Friar Bungay|Fr. Bacon]]'', iii.168.&lt;/ref&gt; to enable him to encircle [[Great Britain (island)|Britain]] with a wall of brass that would make it impossible to conquer.

Unlike his source material, Greene does not cause his head to operate by natural forces but by "[[necromancy|nigromantic]]&lt;!--sic--&gt; charms" and "the enchanting forces of the [[devil (Christianity)|devil]]":&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene]], ''[[Friar Bacon &amp; Friar Bungay|Fr.

A [[brazen head|necromantic head]] was ascribed to [[Pope Sylvester&amp;nbsp;II]] as early as the 1120s,&lt;ref&gt;[[William of Malmesbury|Malmesbury]], ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of England|Chron.]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTpLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181  Bk.&amp;nbsp;II., Ch. x., p.&amp;nbsp;181].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[William of Malmesbury|Malmesbury]] even notes that "probably some may regard all this as a fiction, because the vulgar are used to undermine the fame of scholars, saying that the man who excels in any admirable science, holds converse with the devil"&lt;ref&gt;[[William of Malmesbury|Malmesbury]], ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of England|Chron.]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTpLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174  Bk.&amp;nbsp;II., Ch. x., p.&amp;nbsp;174].&lt;/ref&gt; but professes himself willing to believe the stories about [[Pope Sylvester II|Sylvester]] because of the (spurious) accounts he had of the pope's "shameful end".&lt;ref&gt;[[William of Malmesbury|Malmesbury]], ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of England|Chron.]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTpLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175  Bk.&amp;nbsp;II., Ch. x., p.&amp;nbsp;175].&lt;/ref&gt;}} but [[Thomas Browne|Browne]] considered the legend to be a misunderstanding of a passage in [[Petrus Bonus|Peter the Good]]'s {{circa|lk=no|1335}} ''[[Pretiosa Margarita Novella|Precious Pearl]]'' where the negligent alchemist misses the birth of his creation and loses it forever.&lt;ref name=girlscout/&gt; The story may also preserve the work by Bacon and his contemporaries to construct clockwork [[armillary sphere]]s.{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138 138]}} Bacon had praised a "self-activated working model of the heavens" as "the greatest of all things which have been devised".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, ''[[De Nullitate Magiae|De Null. Mag.]]'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 16th century, [[natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] like [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], [[John Dee|Dee]],{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 132–4]}} and [[Francis Bacon]]{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§1}} were attempting to rehabilitate Bacon's reputation and to portray him as a scientific pioneer who had avoided the petty bickering of his contemporaries to attempt a rational understanding of nature. By the 19th century, commenters following [[William Whewell|Whewell]]{{sfnp|Whewell|1858}}{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§1}} considered that "Bacon... was not appreciated in his age because he was so completely in advance of it; he is a 16th or 17th century philosopher, whose lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century".{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=218}} His assertions in the ''{{lang|la|Opus Majus}}'' that "theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data, aided by instruments, and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses"&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, ''Opus Majus'', Bk.&amp;VI.&lt;/ref&gt; were (and still are) considered "one of the first important formulations of the [[scientific method]] on record".{{sfnp|Borlik|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_ShAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 132]}}

This idea that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist reflected two views of the period: that the principal form of scientific activity is experimentation and that 13th-century Europe still represented the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]".{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Scientia Experimentalis"|p=279}} This view, which is still reflected in some 21st-century [[popular science]] books,{{refn |E.g., [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Clegg]]'s 2003 treatment of Roger Bacon, entitled ''The First Scientist''.{{sfnp |Clegg |2003}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wooley |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Wooley |author-mask=Wooley |date=17 May 2003 |contribution-url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview10 |contribution=Review of ''The First Scientist'' |title=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp |Goldstone &amp; al. |2005}}}} portrays Bacon as an advocate of modern experimental science who emerged as a solitary genius in an age hostile to his ideas.{{sfnp|Gray|2011|p=184}} Based on Bacon's [[#Apocrypha|apocrypha]], he is also portrayed as a visionary who predicted the invention of the [[submarine#History|submarine]], [[history of aviation|aircraft]], and [[automobile#History|automobile]].{{sfnp|Mayer|1966|pp=500–501}}

However, in the course of the 20th century, [[Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and others emphasized the importance to modern science of [[Rene Descartes|Cartesian]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] projections of [[mathematics]] over sensory perceptions of nature; Heidegger in particular noted the lack of such an understanding in Bacon's works.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§1}} Although [[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie]],{{sfnp|Crombie|1953}} [[Thomas S. Kuhn|Kuhn]],{{sfnp|Kuhn|1976}} and [[Matthias Schramm|Schramm]]{{sfnp|Schramm|1998}} continued to argue for Bacon's importance to the development of "qualitative" areas of modern science,{{sfnp|''SEP''|2013|loc=§1}} [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]],{{sfnp|Duhem|1915|p=442}} [[Lynn Thorndike|Thorndike]],{{sfnp|Thorndike|1914}}{{sfnp|Thorndike|1916}} [[Raoul Carton|Carton]],{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Scientia Experimentalis"|p=280}} and [[Alexander Koyré|Koyré]]{{sfnp|Koyré|1957}} emphasized the essentially medieval nature of Bacon's ''{{lang|la|scientia experimentalis}}''.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Scientia Experimentalis"|p=280}}{{sfnp|Lindberg|1996|p=lv}}

Research also established that Bacon was not as isolated—and probably not as persecuted—as was once thought. Many medieval sources of and influences on Bacon's scientific activity have been identified.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Scientia Experimentalis"|pp=279–284}} In particular, Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of [[Robert Grosseteste]]:{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=11–12}} his work on [[#Optics|optics]] and the [[#Calendrical reform|calendar]] followed Grosseteste's lead,{{sfnp|Crombie|1990|p=129}} as did his idea that [[inductive reasoning|inductively-derived conclusions]] should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.{{sfnp|Gauch|2003|p=222}} 

Bacon noted of [[William of Sherwood]] that "nobody was greater in philosophy than he";{{sfnp|Brewer|1859}}{{sfnp|Wood|1786|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyantiquiti00wood#page/38/mode/2up 38]}} praised [[Peter of Maricourt]] (the author of "A Letter on Magnetism")&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Turner |first=Gillian |author-mask=Turner |title=North Pole, South Pole |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John of London]] as "perfect" mathematicians; [[Campanus of Novara]] (the author of works on astronomy, astrology, and the calendar) and a Master Nicholas as "good";{{sfnp|Molland|1997}} and acknowledged the influence of [[Adam Marsh]] and lesser figures. He was clearly not an isolated genius.{{sfn|Hackett (1997), "Life"|pp=11–12}} The medieval church was also not generally opposed to scientific investigation{{sfnp|Lindberg|2003}} and [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]] was both varied and extensive.{{refn|group=n|"If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the [[Age of Reason]], they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities."{{sfnp|Grant|2001|p=9}}}}

As a result, the picture of Bacon has changed. Bacon is now seen as part of his age: a leading figure in the beginnings of the [[medieval university|medieval universities]] at [[University of Paris#History|Paris]] and [[History of the University of Oxford|Oxford]] but one joined in the development of the philosophy of science by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[William of Auvergne (bishop)|William of Auvergne]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Albert Magnus]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[John Duns Scotus]], and [[William of Ockham]].{{sfnp|Gauch|2003|p=51}} [[David C. Lindberg|Lindberg]] summarised:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bacon was not a modern, out of step with his age, or a harbinger of things to come, but a brilliant, combative, and somewhat eccentric [[scholasticism|schoolman]] of the thirteenth century, endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions... of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge".{{sfnp|Lindberg|1987|p=520}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A recent review of the many visions of Bacon across the ages says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought: his commitment to the Franciscan order. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;His {{lang|la|Opus maius}} was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme [[Pope|spiritual head of the Christian faith]], written against a background of [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the [[friar]]s. It was designed to improve training for [[missionary|missionaries]] and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non-Christians and of the [[Antichrist]]. It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the [[history of science]] and [[history of philosophy|philosophy]].{{sfnp|Power|2006}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to religion's influence on Bacon's philosophy, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] noted, "To Roger Bacon,... the schoolmen's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth... [but] Of all kinds of experience, the best, he thought, was interior illumination, which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover, such as the [[transubstantiation]] of bread."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |author-link=Charles Sanders Peirce |date=1877 |title=The Fixation of Belief |url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] lore, Bacon is credited as the namesake of [[Folly Bridge]] for having gotten himself placed under house arrest nearby.{{sfnp|Smith|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAE7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21 "Bacon Friar"]}} Although this is probably untrue,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thacker |first=Frederick Samuel |author-mask=Thacker |title=The Stripling Thames |url=http://thames.me.uk/0TST/t00020.htm |date=1909 |volume=Ch. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it had formerly been known as "Friar Bacon's Bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=C. |contribution=Friar Bacon's, or Folly Bridge, Oxford |date=Aug 1829 |p=105 |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvdfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |editor-last=Cave |editor-first=Edward |editor-link=Edward Cave |display-editors=0 |title=Gentleman's Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvdfAAAAcAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon is also honoured at Oxford by a plaque affixed to the wall of the new Westgate shopping centre.{{sfnp|Smith|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAE7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21 "Bacon Friar"]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29264">{{Kabbalah}}
In [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]], '''''seder hishtalshelus''''' or '''''hishtalshelut''''' ({{lang-he-n|סדר השתלשלות}}) refers  to the chain-like descent of [[Astral plane|spiritual worlds]] ([[Four Worlds|''Olam/Olamot'']]) between God and Creation. Each spiritual world denotes a complete realm of existence, resulting from its general proximity or distance to Divine revelation. Each realm is also a form of consciousness reflected in this world through the psychology of the soul.

The [[Kabbalah#Overview|theosophical tradition]] in Kabbalah is concerned with defining in great detail the [[esotericism|esoteric]] nature, particular [[Partzufim|divine manifestations]], and functional role of each level between the infinite and the finite. Each spiritual realm embodies a creative stage God continually uses to go from his self to the creation of the physical world, the material Universe being the end of the chain, and the only physical realm. Hasidic thought applies the Kabbalistic scheme to its own concern of perceiving [[Panentheism|divine omnipresence]] in this material world. In this, Hasidism varies in its use of Kabbalah, [[Hasidic thought#Schools of thought|Mainstream-Hasidism]] avoiding Kabbalistic focus, while [[Habad]] thought explains ''seder hishtalshelus'' in relation to man's psychology. In contrast to the functional aim of Kabbalah, this [[Jewish meditation|contemplates]] ''seder hishtalshelus'' as a vehicle for relating to the divine unity with creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/overview/overvie5.htm Chassidut: Kabbalah's Final Frontier] from inner.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/stages/stages5.htm Divine Omnipresence and the Kabbalah of the Baal Shem Tov] from inner.org. Here Yitzchak Ginsburgh refers to Hasidic thought as a final stage in Kabbalah: "The dimension of Kabbalistic thought introduced by the Baal Shem Tov is what allowed for a fuller appreciation of God's omnipresence within Creation. Although the concept of God's immanence within the created realm was always a central one within Kabbalah, the implications of this concept as expounded by the Baal Shem Tov amounted to an entirely new revelation. According to the Baal Shem Tov, Divine immanence implies a direct equivalence between God and all other levels of reality, as expressed by the Hasidic aphorism: 'All is God and God is all'. The proper understanding of this idea, especially as it differs from that of pantheism, represents the supreme insight to be attained prior to the Messianic age. The presumption of a stratified reality, be it one which is statically hierarchic (as described by Moshe Cordovero) or dynamically interactive (as described by Isaac Luria), is one intuited by finite minds unable to grasp the true nature of existence. Although both the systems of Cordovero and Luria play an important role in advancing our awareness of the Divine element within Creation, they are only stepping stones on the path to a fully liberated consciousness capable of seeing God within all reality and thus attesting to His absolute exclusivity of Being."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Seder Hishtalshelus'' is sometimes used restrictively to refer to the actually emergent Created Order (the comprehensive [[Four Worlds]]). More broadly, all preceding levels are included, as their function underlies resulting Existence. This page lists and links to all the main spiritual levels described in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the scheme of [[Isaac Luria]] (1534–1572), the basis of modern Jewish mysticism. Its listing incorporated, expanded and explained earlier Medieval/Classical Kabbalah. After Luria, esoteric Kabbalists broadened explanation within the Lurianic listing. The supra-rational doctrines of Luria described [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah-Wisdom]] levels of Divinity ([[Tzimtzum]], [[Tohu and Tikun|Shevira]]) that preceded the "rationally" perceived [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah-Understanding]] levels of Medieval Kabbalah and [[Moshe Cordovero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/stages/stages.htm The Development of Kabbalah in Three Stages] from inner.org: "Whereas the revealed law of the Torah realized its greatest revelation at Sinai, only to have its clarity [[Yeridat ha-dorot|diminish over time]], the hidden tradition experienced a virtually opposite situation; its doctrine has come into sharper focus with every passing generation. Each stage in the historical revelation of Kabbalah represents a conceptual approach to understanding Kabbalistic tradition. Each system of thought served to advance the evolution of Kabbalistic theory by providing new and more illuminating frameworks within which to organize the totality of Kabbalistic doctrine existing up to their time."&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Habad Hasidic exploration described [[Keter|Keter-Will]] levels of Divine intention that preceded Creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/worlds/atzmut.htm Ohr Ein Sof: Ten stages of God's Infinite Light before the beginning of the creative process] from inner.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inner.org/chassidut/chassidut.htm Overview of Hasidic thought] from inner.org: "By using the individual’s own inner experience as an allegorical model for understanding the deepest mysteries of the universe, Hasidut both elevates the consciousness of the ordinary Jew as well as expands the conceptual territory of Kabbalistic thought. Indeed, the classical tradition of Kabbalah can be considered superficial relative to that of Hasidut. By focusing upon immediate experience, Hasidut identifies aspects of Divinity that the highly formal and abstract system of Kabbalistic induction leaves unexplored."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Seder hishtalshelus'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|links=no|סדר השתלשלות}}) means the "order of development" or "order of evolution", where the word ''Hishtalshelus'' (or ''Hishtalshelut'') is derived from the reduplicated [[quadriliteral]] root ŠLŠL "to chain", and so literally means "the chain-like process".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==The Upper Unity==

===Ohr Ein Sof===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Preparatory stages in the ''[[Ohr|Ohr Ein Sof]]'' ("God's Infinite Light") before the beginning of the creative process. The ''Ohr Ein Sof'' is a paradoxical form of divine self-revelation. These are above any world/limitation. Kabbalah considered the functional question whether the ''Ein Sof'' represents God's divine essence or God as [[First Cause]]. [[Habad]] intellectual Hasidic thought explores ''[[Atzmut]]'' (divine essence) in the purpose of Creation:

* ''[[Atzmut]]'' ("God's Absolute Essence")
* ''Yachid'' ("The Single One")
* ''Echad'' ("The One")
* ''Sha'ashuim Atzmi'im'' ("The Delights of Self")
* ''Aliyat Haratzon'' ("Rose in His Will")
* ''Ana Emloch'' ("I will reign")
* ''Ein Sof'' ("No End" - classic term for the Unknowable God in Kabbalah)
* ''Kadmon'' ("Primordial One")
* ''Avir Kadmon'' ("Primordial Atmosphere")
* ''Adam Kadma'ah Stima'ah'' ("Concealed Primordial Man") [[God's will]] for Creation before the ''Tzimtzum''

===Tzimtzum===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Three stages of the ''Sod HaTzimtzum'' ("Secret of Contraction") taught in the new doctrines of [[Lurianic Kabbalah]]. These received differing interpretations after Luria, from the literal (more mythological) to the metaphorical (more philosophical). In this dynamic myth, the first act in Creation was Divine Self-Withdrawal, the opposite of Creative revelation. ''Tzimtum'' is a paradox as Creation depends on God also being present in the vacuum and resulting existence:
* ''[[Tzimtzum]]'' ("Contraction") "Self-Withdrawal/removal" of God's Infinite Light to create the ''Khalal'' ("Vacuum")
* ''Reshimu'' ("Impression") Light left behind in the vacuum, the Residue
* ''Kav'' ("Ray") New Divine light radiated into the primordial darkness/vacuum

[[Adam Kadmon]] ("Primordial Man"), an [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|anthropomorphic]] term, is the revelation of the specific Divine Will for Creation after the Tzimtzum. Its paradoxical nature is expressed as both Adam (creation) and ''Kadmon'' ("primary" divinity). As the level of [[Keter]] ("Crown") divine will, it is pure light, with no vessels, bounded by its future potential to create vessels. It is sometimes counted as the first of the [[Five Worlds]], but its supreme transcendence is prior to the emergence of the [[sephirot]] and ''Shevirat Hakeilim'' ("Shattering of their Vessels"):
* ''Ratzon Kadum'' ("Original Desire")
* Adam Kadmon ("Primordial Man")
* ''Orot Ozen-Chotem-Peh'' (Five "lights from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and forehead" of Adam Kadmon)

===Akudim, Nekudim, Berudim===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Three Worlds of "lights" and "vessels" resulting from the interacting lights that emanated from Adam Kadmon, in the Lurianic Kabbalah. Each embodies different stages in the emergence of the 10 ''sephirot'' ("Divine Attributes"). Their progression corresponds to the archetypal realms of [[Tohu and Tikun|''Tohu'' and ''Tikun'']] ("Chaos and Rectification") described in the new doctrines of Luria. ''Tohu'' causes ''Shevirat HaKeilim'' ("Shattering of the sephirot Vessels"), the catastrophic exile in Creation:
* ''[[Akudim]]'' ("Binding") 10 lights in one vessel - Stable ''Tohu'' ("Chaos")
* ''[[Nekudim]]'' ("Points") 10 isolated lights in 10 vessels - Unstable ''Tohu'' ("Chaos")
* ''[[Berudim]]'' ("Connection") 10 inter-relating lights in 10 vessels - beginning of ''Tikun'' ("Rectification")

==The Lower Unity==
{{Four Worlds}}
{{Main|Four Worlds}}

===Keter of Atzilut===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
The World of [[Atzilut]] ("Emanation") is the first of the comprehensive [[Four Worlds]] (ABiY"A) of our Created Order, which are collectively the realm of ''Tikun'' ("Rectification") of the Shattered Vessels from ''Tohu''. ''Atzilut'' completes the Upper rectification, which began in ''Berudim'', through the ''sephirot'' transforming into ''[[Partzufim]]'' ("Divine Countenances"). ''Partzufim'' harmonise the ''sephirot'' in the scheme of ''Yosher'' ("Upright") full interacting configurations in the form of Man. Rectification of ''Atzilut'' begins with rectification of its ''[[Keter]]'' ("Crown") Will. Eight rectification stages in ''Keter D'Atzilut'' ("The Crown of Emanation"):

* ''[[Atik Yomin]]'' ("Ancient of Days") Upper ''partzuf'' of ''Keter'' (Inner Will-Delight)
* ''[[Arich Anpin]]'' ("Long Countenance/Infinitely Patient One") Lower ''partzuf'' of ''Keter'' (Outer Will)
* ''Reisha D'lo Ityada'' (RaDLA) ("Unknowable Head")
* ''Reisha D'Ayin'' ("Head of Nothingness")
* ''Reisha D'Arich'' ("Head of Infinity")
* ''Gulgalta'' ("Skull") ''Keter'' in ''Arich Anpin''
* ''Mocha Stima'ah'' ("Concealed Brain") Origin of ''Chochmah''-Wisdom in ''Arich Anpin''
* ''Dikna'' ("Beard") Contracts the light of ''Arich Anpin'' through [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|13 channels]]

===Atzilut===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
[[Tikun (Kabbalah)|Rectification]] of ''Olam Ha'[[Atzilut]]'' (the "World of Emanation"), first of the [[Four Worlds]], is completed with ten stages of [[Partzufim]] (Divine "Countenances") after ''Keter''. Each of the 6 Primary and 12 Secondary ''Partzufim'' correspond to the 10 Sephirot arranging around one of their number. Interaction of the ''Partzufim'' rectifies ''Atzilut'' eternally, completing Upper rectification. Redemption of the fallen sparks by Man rectifies the time-related three lower Worlds Below. ''Atzilut'' is separated from the three independent lower Worlds by its exclusive consciousness of Divine Unity, without self-awareness, the level of ''[[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]]'' ("Wisdom"). [[Ayin and Yesh|Creation from Nothing]] is seen from the view of ''Ayin'' ("Nothing"):
* ''Abba'' ("Father") General partzuf of Chokhmah (Wisdom)
* ''Imma'' ("Mother") General partzuf of Binah (Understanding)
* ''Abba Ila'ah'' ("Higher Father") Upper secondary partzuf of Chokhmah
* ''Imma Ila'ah'' ("Higher Mother") Upper secondary partzuf of Binah
* ''Yisrael Sabba'' ("Israel the Elder") Lower secondary partzuf of Chokhmah
* ''Tevunah'' ("Comprehension") Lower secondary partzuf of Binah
* ''[[Zeir Anpin]]'' ("Short Countenance"-"Ben" Son) General partzuf of Emotions
* ''Nukvah D'Ze'ir Anpin'' ("Female of Zeir Anpin"-"Bat" Daughter) General parzuf of Malkhut (Kingdom)
* Leah (First wife of Jacob) Upper secondary partzuf of Malkhut
* Rachel (Second wife of Jacob) Lower secondary partzuf of Malkhut

The 10 ''sephirot'' shine in each of the Four Worlds, the last ''sephirah'' ''[[Malkuth]]'' ("Kingship") of a World becoming the first ''sephirah'' ''[[Keter]]'' ("Crown") of the next Realm. ''Malkuth'' of ''Atzilut'', called "God's speech", is the general source of independent Creation.

==Analogies for Seder Hishtalshelut==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
The basic stations of this process from above to below are:

*[[Atzmus]] [[Ohr|Ohr Ein Sof]] before the Tzimtzum ("The Essence of the Infinite Light before the Contraction")
*The [[Tzimtzum]] ("The Contraction")
*The Reshimu ("The Impression")
*The Kav ("Line of Light")
*Ratzon Kadum ("Original Desire")
*[[Adam Kadmon]] ("Original Man")
*[[Atzilut]] ("World of Emanation")
*The Masach ("The Curtain")
*[[Beri'ah|Beriah]] ("World of Creation")
*[[Yetzirah]] ("World of Formation")
*[[Assiah]] ("World of Action")

Although these are the basic stations, each level contains innumerable details. To understand Seder Hishtalshelus properly, one must first understand how all of the analogies exist in a person. Once one has understood this, one can begin to see how all of these levels exist in the world. Then, one will be able to take any event or aspect of creation and trace it up the chain to God Himself, then back down to the original view and see how God is literally here with us, relating to us directly through his creations.

The purpose of learning about Seder Hishtalshelus in [[Hasidic thought]] is not merely to know about many distinct levels, rather, the purpose is to see how all the levels in between us and God are transparent and irrelevant, and in truth God is relating to us directly, and there is "none besides for Him". (Deuteronomy 4:35) Because of this, the [[Tanya]] states that learning about the Seder Hishtalshelus will bring a person to a "complete heart".

This is much like two friends talking on the phone. There are many stages one's voice must undergo before it reaches the other. Yet, the two people are talking to each other, not to their phones. The stages in between become irrelevant and transparent in such a situation.

One can understand these levels through the analogy of a man who wants a house. The hishtalshelus is generally broken down into two  general stages, called the "Upper Unity" and the "Lower Unity". Below are the relevant analogies for all the basic stations of the hishtalshelus in the analogy of a man who wants a house starting from the top (primordial desires) and going down (until the desire is actualized).

*''[[Atzmut]] [[Ohr|Ohr Ein Sof]] Lifnei Hatzimtzum'' ("Essence of the Infinite Light before the Contraction"):&lt;br /&gt;The analogy for this stage is the essence of the person's soul. At this stage we are dealing with only the person himself, who at this point has no revealed desire for a house or any other physical object. However, since he is human, we must say that at some point he will desire a house because this is part of human nature. At this stage, however,  this desire doesn't have any independent existence at all, but is simply a part of his soul.
*''[[Tzimtzum]]'' and ''Reshimu'' ("Contraction and Impression"):&lt;br /&gt;At this stage there is still no revealed desire for a house. However, the person realizes that his ultimate desire will be to express his true self through things that are separate from himself, such as  through music, art, a house, etc. Those decisions have not yet been made, however. There is only the realization that one will want to express his true self by making something that appears separate from him, express him. This is similar to the way one might want the challenge of playing an instrument, which is something separate from a person, and allow himself to be expressed through it. Reshimu means impression, because at this stage the person realizes that he will not be able to express himself directly, but his self will somehow leave its own impression on the things he does so he can be seen through them.
*''Kav'' ("Measuring Line"):&lt;br /&gt;This is the part of the person that connects the Tzimtzum and Reshimu to the Infinite Light before the Tzimtzum. The analogy for The Kav is the person's judgement. In life, whatever choices a person makes, will be free choices made by the person, without influence from those around him. Even small and seemingly insignificant choices, such as what one decides to order at a restaurant, still express his essence, because they are 'his' choices, and are his way of expressing himself. If one looks carefully at a person's choices one can see how they bring across his unique taste and personality. At this point there is still no revealed desire for a house, but only the subconscious framework that will eventually be used when he begins to desire one.
*''Ratzon Kadum'' ("Original Desire"):&lt;br /&gt;Now that person is  most likely older, he begins to feel a desire for independence and belonging. This is one particular expression of his original desire to express himself. But now it is specific to wanting a sense of contentment and a feeling of being at "home". At this point, he still does not desire a home, but wishes for the happiness gained when one gains a house. Technically he could still express this desire in other ways than having a house, such as interacting friends or participating in activities which he enjoys and achieve that same sense of belonging and contentment. There are still no details yet of how the desire for belonging will be fulfilled.
*''[[Adam Kadmon]]'' (A"K-"Primordial Man"):&lt;br /&gt;The person now looks at the outside world for the first time. Up until this point, he was only thinking about himself, and his desires. Now, in order to bring out this desire to practicality, he must decide what in the physical world will fit these desires. He creates a world image, i.e., a picture of what is going on in the world. He then decides where in this mental picture he belongs. He eventually realizes that the best way to integrate into society is to possess a house, and will choose a house that fits his particular character in order to best express himself. The kind of house he will want has been limited at this point due to his still ignorant outlook on the world and the very basic ideas of his own personality. However, he still does not truly desire a physical house. Rather, it is that he has realized his own desires and needs and now knows the best type of "house" that would suit him.
*''[[Atzilut|Keter of Atzilut]]'' ("Crown of the World of Emanation"):&lt;br /&gt;This stage is what results from the associations created in A"K, namely, a particular desire for a particular house. This stage mainly compromises two concepts: Arich Anpin-Outer/Chitzoneyus of Keter: Desire for this particular house; and Atik Yomin-Inner/Pnimiyus of Keter: The pleasure he receives in knowing that this will express who he is.
*''[[Atzilut]]'' ("World of Emanation"):&lt;br /&gt;A"K already included all the details of the levels below it. However, the actual details only come out as needed. Now he knows the way he will express himself will be specifically through a house. At this stage he may sit down with his wife, or real estate agent, and clarifies exactly how he wants his house to be. This stage includes [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chochma]] (Wisdom) of Aztilus which is when he creates the general picture of what he wants in the abstract, "a warm home". [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] (Understanding) of Atzilus involves figuring out what are the components of such a home; everything he wants the house to be with all their details. In A"K he only knew what types of homes are appropriate with what kind of person.  Here he actually decides where he will fit into the picture. Here he also decides what is practical based on how much money he has and what is available etc. Based on all of these things he comes up with the Zeir Anpin (Z"A-"the Small Face"-Emotions) of Atzilus: This stage is the picture of what things are good and what are bad. Here he sets up what things will bring him closer to his goal (his dream house) and what things will bring him further. He will have [[Chesed (Kabbalah)|Chesed]] (a love) for things he will like. He will have [[Gevurah (Kabbalah)|Gevurah]] (a fear or hate) for things he will not like. He will have [[Tiferet]] (Beauty) for the compromises he makes (or the beauty that results) and [[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]] (feeling of victory in spite of challenges) to want to go and get what he wants, and the [[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]] to not settle for something less than he wants.  He will have a [[Yesod (Kabbalah)|Yesod]], which forms the compromise of how he will actually interact with everyone resulting from the interplay between his Netzach and Hod. This results in [[Malkuth|Malchut]] ("Kingdom" or actualization), which is the stage at which he will talk to himself about what he likes and doesn't like. And he will talk about what he is actually going to do. Finally, all of the above will lead to his creation of his Malchus of Atzilus i.e. he will actually tell the real estate agent what he wants, what he will settle for and what he will not, what he likes hates etc. The desires are all set up now, but still the real building process of the house has not occurred.
*''[[Beri'ah]]'' ("World of Creation"):&lt;br /&gt;At this stage the real-estate agent will take everything the man told him about what kind of house he wants. He will take these words of the original guy and translate them into things that can exist in a home. For instance, if the person said he wants a home where he can swim, the real-estate agent might translate that into him having a pool, or having a beach-home. This translations process is called the masach (screen) which carries across all the upper desires and connects them to things in the real world. Real estate agent must pull out from those words what this guy really wants and how to find a house that will accomplish his goal. To translate what this guy wants to get out of a house and make it into a picture of an actual house. What he creates is the world of Beriyah. He must figure out all the different scenarios that would have all the elements with the best combination=Beriya. The real-estate broker need not do this, this technically could also be done within the person's self.
*''[[Yetzirah]]'' ("World of Formation"):&lt;br /&gt;Now someone must figure out exact dimensions for each of these things, its  shape, what it will be constructed out of. Will it be made of brick, limestone, wood or something else. Someone must look at the person's style, needs and desires. For instance if they intend to have parties, they should probably have a hardwood floor instead of carpet. Someone at this stage figures out the exact shape, size of the house and its location and then creates a floorplan.
*''[[Assiah|Asiyah Ruchnit]] ("Spiritual World of Action"):&lt;br /&gt;Now this plan must go to the builders. The builders must look at the blueprint and figure out how to actually build a house like this. Sometimes a certain type of house can be drawn up in Yetzira but in real life wouldn't hold up or would be impracticable. These builder must figure out how to pour the cement, how to make it strong, and figure out where they will we get the furniture to actually make something like that. They must study the blueprint and figure out how to make something that will work.
*''[[Assiah|Asiyah Gashmit]]'' ("Physical World of Action"):&lt;br /&gt;The builders actually pour the cement or whatever and build the physical structure and everything in the house. Now the man can go live in the house and enjoy and express himself in fulfillment of his original desire which started this entire process in the Infinite Light before the Contraction.

===Only Analogies===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
While the Hasidic texts offer many analogies of how Seder Hishtalshelus exists within a person, such as the one given above, they also emphasize that these are only analogies and the analogue is nothing like the analogies. These analogies are meant only to give a glimpse into Seder Hishtalshelus in a way that we are familiar with, but the true analogue deals with how God interrelates with our world. Much like a house, God desires a "dwelling place" in this world. This means He desired that his Essence be revealed through the medium of this world much like a person might wish his own essence to be revealed through the medium of his house. While analogies are a necessary step, the true goal of studying Seder Hishlshelus must be to pick out the point that unites all of the analogies and apply it to the analogue i.e. how God is being revealed in our world directly.

On the other hand, the analogies are not vague, These analogies are precise and exact, much scholarly work has been dedicated to understanding and analyzing why particular analogies have been used, some that are not, and some that are inconsistent in application (i.e. a text may use different analogies to demonstrate the same point - the analysis required is to understand and examine the deficiency in each analogy, and how they can be reconciled with each other)

==Relation to Western philosophy==
Study and [[Jewish meditation|contemplation]] of Seder Hishtalshelus is central to the Intellectual-Hasidism school of [[Chabad]]. Some speculate that the recent Hasidic explanations of Seder Hishtalshelus may have been influenced by certain principles in [[Western philosophy]]. Various dichotomies mentioned in philosophy are strikingly similar to those mentioned in late Hasidic texts: Form/Matter, Sense/Feeling, Initial Cognition/Semiotic Cognition/Semiotic Transition.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Maamar (Habad)|Maamarim]] 5663 by [[Shalom DovBer Schneersohn]] (the Rashab), with ''Values in a Universe of Chance'' by Charles S. Peirce&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the prose of the [[Rebbe Rashab]] is almost identical to that of [[G. W. F. Hegel]].

Others counter that the dichotomies meantioned in Hasidic texts originate in sources predating Western philosophy. Proponents of [[Hasidic philosophy]], counter that since Intellectual-Hasidut is an essential wisdom that is higher than, and includes all other wisdoms it would necessarily make reference to all other forms of wisdom, whether Western or otherwise. They would argue that such similarities are not proof of influence of Western philosophy, but rather are evidence that Hasidic philosophy touches upon, unites, and enlightens every other wisdom, whether it be Torah or secular.

The website and books of Sanford Drob bring the Seder Hishtalshelut [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] scheme of [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] into dialogue with [[Modernity|Modern]] and [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] Philosophy and Psychology. In our age when Western philosophy deconstructs the possibility of metaphysics, he sees the Lurianic scheme as an essence-myth that transcends and incorporates secular disciplines, allowing it to re-open the possibilities of philosophy. This process both enriches the secular disciplines, while giving intellectual insights into the Lurianic myth through revealing its facets in human life. This dialogue includes [[Hegelian dialectic]]s and its application in [[Marxism]], [[Freud]], [[Jung]] and [[Deconstructionism]], as well as ancient systems of thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkabbalah.com/index3.html newkabbalah.com] and books including ''Kabbalistic Metaphors: Jewish Mystical Themes in Ancient and Modern Thought'', Sanford L. Drob, Jason Aronson, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley Victor Keeling''' (9 August 1894 – 28 November 1979), usually cited as '''S.V. Keeling''', was a British philosopher, formerly a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] at [[University College London]] (UCL). He is best known for his 1934 monograph ''Descartes'', printed in a second edition in 1968, which for decades served as the standard English introduction to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aqOvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=keeling,+stanley+victor+(1894+-+1979)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw7a-p9IbZAhVMQMAKHXhNAWgQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=KEELING, Stanley Victor (1894-1979)|last=Chávez-Arvizo|first=Enrique|work=The Dictionary of Twentieth-Century British philosophers|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|year=2005|isbn=9781843710967|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Stuart|location=Bristol, England|pages=502–503|oclc=58455514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=DR S.

== Biography ==
 
Stanley Keeling was born in [[Islington]] on 9 August 1894 and studied at Southend Secondary School in Essex, where he remained until c.1911.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a conscientious objector to World War I, Keeling refused to submit to conscription as demanded by the [[Military Service Act 1916]]. He was thus arrested and convicted in court martial in January 1917. He was incarcerated at [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs]] and, later, at [[HM Prison Dartmoor|Dartmoor]], being released not long before 10 April 1919.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 1919 Keeling enrolled at University College London but it was not until October 1920 that he took on an advised curriculum. This was under [[George Dawes Hicks]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who, in 1904, had become the first appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at UCL (the Chair having previously gone unfilled&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/665/|title=Philosophy at University College London: Part 1: From Jeremy Bentham to the Second World War|last=Jonathan|first=Wolff,|date=2006|website=sas-space.sas.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;). After his death, Keeling would describe Hicks as a teacher "wholly engrossed in philosophy" who "firmly believed that it, as no other subject, could impart to his students an influence and a training such as would render them habitually reflective about their existence and destiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keeling|first=S. V.|date=1941|title=George Dawes Hicks|jstor=2250986|journal=Mind|volume=50|issue=199|pages=306–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeling was befriended by [[Bertrand Russell]] who, along with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], convinced him to continue his studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was admitted to the same in October 1922 and awarded his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] there in 1924. The philosophy taught at Cambridge at the time was, however, largely a disappointment to him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The sole exception reportedly being J. M. E. McTaggart who Keeling "held in the highest esteem as the only original metaphysician" of the century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Richard Wollheim]]. a later colleague at UCL from 1949, described Keeling as "a disciple of McTaggart who thought him right "on nearly all topics" (apart from "one which left.. a bitter taste" - whilst Keeling was a pacifist, "McTaggart was rabidly militaristic").&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24504740|title=A.J. Ayer memorial essays|last=|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Ayer, A. J. (Alfred Jules), 1910-1989., Griffiths, A.

Keeling was then to spend two years studying in France.  He first attended the [[University of Toulouse]] where he was awarded a ''certificat d'études supérieures'', then the [[University of Montpellier]], where, in 1925, he presented his thesis ''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/universite-de-montpellier-faculte-des-lettres-la-nature-de-lexperience-chez-kant-et-chez-bradley-par-stanley-victor-keeling/oclc/459739657?referer=di&amp;ht=edition La nature de l'expérience chez Kant et chez Bradley]'' (which Russell is known to have read&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Kenneth|date=1987-12-31|title=Addenda to the Checklist of Theses and Dissertations on Bertrand Russell|url=https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/1715|journal=Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies|language=en-US|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.15173/russell.v7i2.1715|issn=1913-8032}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and was awarded his ''Docteur ès Lettres (D. ès L.).''  Keeling was also to be honored in France as an ''officier d' Académie''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The scholar's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' noted that although philosophy was his "consuming passion from early adolescence" Keeling "found a second love in the wine and food and conversation of France". And that during his working life "he returned whenever possible to France, to Provence or to his splendid apartment in... Paris".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (Indeed [[Richard Wollheim]] described Keeling as having lived in Paris and come over weekly to deliver his lectures&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;).

It is recorded in ''[[Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies|Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies]]'' that, in 1925, Keeling received a letter from Russell in recommendation for a post in philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spadoni|first=Carl|date=1981-06-30|title=Recent Acquisitions: Correspondence|url=https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/1524|journal=Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies|language=en-US|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.15173/russell.v1i1.1524|issn=1913-8032}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the online records of the Bertrand Russell Archives at [[McMaster University|McMasters University]] clarify that the same is dated 20 December of that year and is not so much a letter but a testimonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bracers.mcmaster.ca/55541|title=55541 {{!}} BRACERS|website=bracers.mcmaster.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeling was awarded a degree of MA with distinction by UCL in 1926.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Declining a fellowship at [[Harvard University]], Keeling took up a position as a philosophy lecturer at UCL in 1927 where he was successively appointed as senior lecturer and then reader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; University College London would also award Keeling a [[Doctor of Letters|D. Litt.]] As was noted in his obituary, Keeling's combination of the ''Docteur ès Lettres'' and ''Doctor Litterarum''  was an "unusual distinction".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The latter was awarded in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XgHY1yq-WyIC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22S.V.+Keeling%22++D.+Litt.++University+of+London+1939&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7K9TfqSZsz&amp;sig=5iiON6FjTzIaD_BxM_FgNdA2B6I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ5dP_l4nZAhWiDsAKHe9RBGsQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22S.V.%20Keeling%22%20%20D.%20Litt.%20%20University%20of%20London%201939&amp;f=false|title=The eudemian ethics on the voluntary, friendship, and luck : the Sixth S.V.

Wollheim recalls that [[A. J. Ayer|A.J. Ayer]] (who was at UCL as [[Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor]] from 1944 until 1959) liked Keeling, and particularly. talking to him in French but that "the feeling was not reciprocated". On the announcement of Keeling's decision to retire, Ayer paid for an expensive dinner in his honor but that Keeling "without waiting for Freddie's panegyric, announced to us all that he had been chased out of philosophy by some new wave, of which 'you' he said pointing at Freddie, 'are a major agent—no', he went on, 'I flatter you, you could never be more than a minor agent'".  Ayer, Wollhein reports, was amused: "'What a rogue' he used to say afterwards—'rogue' being quite a term of endearment which he applied to most of his older philosophical colleagues in the other London colleges".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The ''Times'' obituary report's that Keeling's "thirst for depth and precision" could be satisfied "only precariously among his philosophical colleagues at London". But that he had found "some relief" whilst employed at UCL through the conversations he had had with [[Émile Meyerson]], [[Léon Robin|Leon Robin]] and [[Étienne Gilson|Etienne Gilson]] during his frequent returns to France.  (The latter of which he had described in ''Descartes'' as a "prince among Cartesian scholars".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;)   Keeling retired in 1954 to Paris with his wife and died there on 28 November 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q_lADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=Stanley+Victor+Keeling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB1pCWv4fZAhWKK8AKHR0HCaMQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Stanley%20Victor%20Keeling&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Greek philosophy : S.V.

'''Steven Arthur Pinker''' (born September 18, 1954) is a Canadian-American [[Cognitive Psychology|cognitive psychologist]], [[Linguistics|linguist]], and [[popular science]] author. He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at [[Harvard University]], and is known for his advocacy of [[evolutionary psychology]] and the [[computational theory of mind]].

Pinker's academic specializations are [[perception|visual cognition]] and [[psycholinguistics]]. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and [[grammar]], and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including [[euphemism]], [[innuendo]], emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of [[language acquisition]] and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with [[Alan Prince]] published in 1989 critiqued the [[connectionist]] model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding "-ed" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.

In his popular books, he has argued that the human faculty for language is an [[instinct]], an innate behavior shaped by [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation|adapted]] to our communication needs. He is the author of eight books for a general audience. Five of these, ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994), ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997), ''[[Words and Rules]]'' (2000), ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline.

His seventh book, ''[[The Sense of Style]]'' (2014), is intended as a general [[style guide]] that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.  His eighth book, ''[[Enlightenment Now]]'' (2018), continues the optimistic thesis of ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' by using social science data from various sources to argue for a general improvement of the human condition over recent history.

Pinker has been named as one of the world's most influential intellectuals by various magazines. He has won awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain|Royal Institution]], the [[Cognitive Neuroscience Society]] and the [[American Humanist Association]]. He delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 2013. He has served on the editorial boards of a variety of journals, and on the advisory boards of several institutions. He has frequently participated in public debates on science and society.

Pinker graduated from [[Dawson College]] in 1973. He received a Bachelor of Arts in [[psychology]] from [[McGill University]] in 1976, and earned his Doctorate of Philosophy in [[experimental psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1979 under [[Stephen Kosslyn]]. He did research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for a year, after which he became an [[assistant professor]] at Harvard and then [[Stanford University]].

From 1982 until 2003, Pinker taught at the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Sciences]] at MIT, was the co-director of the Center for [[Cognitive science]] (1985&amp;ndash;1994), and eventually became the director of the Center for [[Cognitive neuroscience]] (1994&amp;ndash;1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Curriculum Vitae|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|url=http://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/cv_steven_pinker_1.pdf|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking a one-year sabbatical at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], in 1995–96.

About his Jewish background Pinker has said, "I was never religious in the theological sense&amp;nbsp;... I never outgrew my conversion to [[atheism]] at 13, but at various times was a serious [[Secular Jewish culture|cultural Jew]]."&lt;ref name=Dougla&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3926387,00.html "Steven Pinker: the mind reader" by Ed Douglas] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Accessed 3 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he says he considered himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] until he witnessed [[civil unrest]] following [[Murray-Hill riot|a police strike in 1969]], when:

{{quote|As a young teenager in proudly peaceable Canada during the romantic 1960s, I was a true believer in Bakunin's anarchism. I laughed off my parents' argument that if the government ever laid down its arms all hell would break loose. Our competing predictions were put to the test at 8:00&amp;nbsp;A.M. on October 17, 1969, when the Montreal police went on strike ... This decisive empirical test left my politics in tatters (and offered a foretaste of life as a scientist).&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven (2002), ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'', [[Penguin Putnam]], {{ISBN|0-670-03151-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pinker identifies himself as an [[equity feminism|equity feminist]], which he defines as "a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology".&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven, ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'' (Viking, 2002), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; He reported the result of a test of his political orientation that characterized him as "neither leftist nor rightist, more [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] than [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]."&lt;ref name = "genome"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/magazine/11Genome-t.html "My Genome, My Self" by Steven Pinker] ''[[The New York Times Sunday Magazine]]'' Accessed 10 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes himself as having "experienced a primitive tribal stirring" after his genes were shown to trace back to the Middle East, noting that he "found it just as thrilling to zoom outward in the diagrams of my genetic lineage and see my place in a family tree that embraces all of humanity".&lt;ref name="Forward 12 Aug 11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/140896/ |title=DNA and You – Personalized Genomics Goes Jewish | date=12 August 2011 | newspaper=The Forward |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker also identifies himself as an [[atheist]]. In the 2007 interview with the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast, Pinker states that he would "defend atheism as an empirically supported view." He sees theism and atheism as competing empirical hypotheses, and states that "we're learning more and more about what makes us tick, including our moral sense, without needing the assumption of a deity or a soul. It's naturally getting crowded out by the successive naturalistic explanations."&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/steven_pinker_evolutionary_psychology_and_human_nature/ | title=Podcast:Steven Pinker - Evolutionary Psychology and Human Nature| publisher=Point of Inquiry with D.J.

==Research and theory==

Pinker's research on visual cognition, begun in collaboration with his thesis adviser, Stephen Kosslyn, showed that mental images represent scenes and objects as they appear from a specific vantage point (rather than capturing their intrinsic three-dimensional structure), and thus correspond to the neuroscientist [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]]'s theory of a "two-and-a-half-dimensional sketch."&lt;ref&gt;The nature of the language faculty and its implications for evolution of language&lt;/ref&gt;  He also showed that this level of representation is used in visual attention, and in [[object recognition]] (at least for asymmetrical shapes), contrary to Marr's theory that recognition uses viewpoint-independent representations.

In psycholinguistics, Pinker became known early in his career for promoting [[computational learning theory]] as a way to understand [[language acquisition]] in children. He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were
''Language Learnability and Language Development'' (1984), in Pinker's words "outlin[ing] a theory of how children acquire the words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue",&lt;ref name=LongBiog&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | title=Steven Pinker: Long Biography | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=18 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229054325/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html | archivedate=29 December 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Learnability and Cognition: The Acquisition of Argument Structure'' (1989), in Pinker's words "focus[ing] on one aspect of this process, the ability to use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different combinations of complements and indirect objects".&lt;ref name=LongBiog/&gt; He then focused on verbs of two kinds that illustrate what he considers to be the processes required for human language: retrieving whole words from memory, like the past form of the [[Regular and irregular verbs|irregular verb]]&lt;ref&gt;Pinker has written a piece on [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html The Irregular Verbs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606015902/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html |date=2014-06-06 }}, stating that "I like the Irregular verbs of English, all 180 of them, because of what they tell us about the history of  the  language  and  the  human  minds  that  have perpetuated it.&lt;/ref&gt; "bring", namely "brought"; and using rules to combine (parts of) words, like the past form of the regular verb "walk", namely "walked".&lt;ref name=LongBiog/&gt;

In 1988 Pinker and [[Alan Prince]] published an influential critique of a [[connectionist]] model of the acquisition of the past tense (a textbook problem in language acquisition), followed by a series of studies of how people use and acquire the past tense. This included a monograph on children's [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of irregular forms and his popular 1999 book, ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language]]''. Pinker argued that language depends on two things, the associative remembering of sounds and their meanings in words, and the use of rules to manipulate symbols for [[grammar]]. He presented evidence against connectionism, where a child would have to learn all forms of all words and would simply retrieve each needed form from memory, in favour of the older alternative theory, the use of words and rules combined by [[generative phonology]]. He showed that mistakes made by children indicate the use of default rules to add suffixes such as "-ed": for instance 'breaked' and 'comed' for 'broke' and 'came'. He argued that this shows that irregular verb-forms in English have to be learnt and retrieved from memory individually, and that the children making these errors were predicting the regular "-ed" ending in an open-ended way by applying a mental rule. This rule for combining verb stems and the usual suffix can be expressed as&lt;ref name=WRessay&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | title=Words and rules (essay) | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=24 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830145603/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Edinburgh.pdf | archivedate=30 August 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|V&lt;sub&gt;past&lt;/sub&gt; → V&lt;sub&gt;stem&lt;/sub&gt; + d}}

where V is a verb and d is the regular ending. Pinker further argued that since the ten most frequently occurring English verbs (be, have, do, say, make ... ) are all irregular, while 98.2% of  the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a "massive correlation" of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has to be committed to memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized. Any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost, and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead.&lt;ref name=WRessay/&gt;

In 1990, Pinker, with [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]], published the paper "Natural Language and Natural Selection", arguing that the human language faculty must have evolved through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinker,&amp;nbsp;S. &amp; Bloom, P. (1990). Natural language and natural selection. Behavioral and&amp;nbsp;Brain&amp;nbsp;Sciences&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;(4):&amp;nbsp;707‐784&lt;/ref&gt; The article provided arguments for a continuity based view of language evolution, contrary to then current discontinuity based theories that see language as suddenly appearing with the advent of ''Homo sapiens'' as a kind of evolutionary accident. This discontinuity based view was prominently argued by two of the main authorities, linguist Noam Chomsky and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name=journey&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanjourney.us/firstWord3.html | title=Language Development:The First Word. The Search for the Origins of Language | author=Christine Kenneally | authorlink=Christine Kenneally | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214704/http://www.humanjourney.us/firstWord3.html | archivedate=2014-07-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper became widely cited and created renewed interest in the evolutionary prehistory of language, and has been credited with shifting the central question of the debate from "did language evolve?" to "how did language evolve".&lt;ref name=journey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.replicatedtypo.com/2612/2612.html | publisher=Replicatedtypo.com |title=The 20th Anniversary of Steven Pinker &amp; Paul Bloom: Natural Language and Natural Selection (1990)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article also presaged Pinker's argument in ''The Language Instinct''.

Pinker's research includes delving into human nature and what science says about it. In his interview on the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast in 2007, he provides the following examples of what he considers defensible conclusions of what science says human nature is:

* The sexes are not statistically identical; "their interests and talents form two overlapping distributions". Any policy that wants to provide equal outcomes for both men and women will have to discriminate against one or the other.
* "Individuals differ in personality and  intelligence." 
* "People favor themselves and their families over an abstraction called society." 
* Humans are "systematically self deceived. Each one of us thinks of ourselves as more competent and benevolent than we are."
* "People crave status and power"

He informs the listeners that one can read more about human nature in his book, ''Blank Slate''.

Pinker also speaks about [[evolutionary psychology]] in the podcast and believes that this area of science is going to pay off. He cites the fact that there are many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview" /&gt;

{{main|The Language Instinct|Words and Rules|How the Mind Works|The Blank Slate|The Stuff of Thought}}

&lt;!--[[File:AmericanBeaver.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Pinker argues that the human faculty for [[language]] is as much an instinct as a [[beaver]]'s ability to build dams.]]--&gt;
Pinker's 1994 ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' was the first of several books to combine [[cognitive science]] with [[behavioral genetics]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. It introduces the science of language and popularizes [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's [[grammar]] is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that [[Great Ape language|other great apes can learn languages]]. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an [[instinct]] as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a [[spider]]'s web-weaving or a [[beaver]]'s dam-building.

Pinker states in his introduction that his ideas are "deeply influenced"&lt;ref name=LIintro/&gt; by Chomsky; he also lists scientists whom Chomsky influenced to "open up whole new areas of language study, from child development and speech perception to neurology and genetics"&lt;ref name=LIintro/&gt; — [[Eric Lenneberg]], [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], [[Roger William Brown|Roger Brown]], [[Morris Halle]] and [[Alvin Liberman]].&lt;ref name=LIintro&gt;{{cite book | title=The Language Instinct | publisher=Penguin | author=Pinker, Steven | year=1994 | pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown mentored Pinker through his thesis; Pinker stated that Brown's "funny and instructive"&lt;ref name=BrownObit&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | title=Obituary: Roger Brown | author=Pinker, Steven | journal=Cognition | year=1998 | pages=199–213 (see page 205) | doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(98)00027-4 | volume=66 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518180224/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/Brown_obituary.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; book ''Words and Things'' (1958) was one of the inspirations for ''The Language Instinct''.&lt;ref name=BrownObit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/brown-roger-w.pdf | title=Roger William Brown 1925-1997 | author=Kagan, Jerome | journal=Biographical Memoirs | year=1999 | volume=77 | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality of Pinker's proposed language instinct, and the related claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by many linguists. One prominent opponent of Pinker's view is [[Geoffrey Sampson]] whose 1997 book, ''[[Educating Eve|Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate]]'' has been described as the "definitive response" to Pinker's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/1449/|title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate|publisher=University of Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sampson&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grsampson.net/REmpNat.html | title=Empiricism v. Nativism: Nature or Nurture? | publisher=GRSampson.net | accessdate=8 June 2014}}. More at [http://www.grsampson.net/BLID.html The 'Language Instinct' Debate]&lt;/ref&gt; Sampson argues that while it may seem attractive to argue the nature side of the 'nature versus nurture' debate, the nurture side may better support the creativity and nobility of the human mind. Sampson denies there is a language instinct, and argues that children can learn language because people can learn anything.&lt;ref name=Sampson/&gt; Others have sought a middle ground between Pinker's nativism and Sampson's culturalism.&lt;ref name=Cowley&gt;Cowley, S. J. (2001). The baby, the bathwater and the "language instinct" debate. Language Sciences, 23(1), 69-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptions underlying the [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] view have also been criticised in [[Jeffrey Elman]]'s ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]: A Connectionist Perspective on Development'', which defends the connectionist approach that Pinker attacked. In his 1996 book ''Impossible Minds'', the [[machine intelligence]] researcher [[Igor Aleksander]] calls ''The Language Instinct'' excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, "a cultural repository of language just seems the easy trick for an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic [[state machine]] to play."&lt;ref name=Aleksander&gt;{{cite book | title=Impossible Minds | author=Aleksander, Igor | year=1996 | pages=228–234 | isbn=1-86094-030-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other books, ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), broadly surveyed the mind and defended the idea of a complex human nature with many mental faculties that are [[adaptive]] (Pinker is an ally of [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] in many disputes surrounding [[adaptationism]]). Another major theme in Pinker's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. On the debate around ''The Blank Slate'', Pinker called [[Thomas Sowell]]'s book ''[[A Conflict of Visions]]'' "wonderful",&lt;ref name=Sailer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html | title=Q&amp;A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate' | agency=United Press International | date=30 October 2002 | accessdate=10 May 2014 | author=Sailer, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explained that "The Tragic Vision" and the "Utopian Vision" are the views of human nature behind [[right-wing|right-]] and left-wing ideologies.&lt;ref name=Sailer/&gt;

In ''[[Words and Rules|Words and Rules: the Ingredients of Language]]'' (1999), Pinker argues from his own research that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup, respectively, and that language can be understood as an interaction between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/wr/index.html |title=Words and Rules (book) |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=24 May 2014 |author=Pinker, Steven |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330020838/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/wr/index.html |archivedate=March 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Words and Rules" is also the title of an essay by Pinker outlining many of the topics discussed in the book.&lt;ref name=WRessay/&gt; Critiqueing the book from the perspective of [[generative linguistics]] [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]], in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', writes that "this book never runs low on [[hubris]] or [[hyperbole]]".&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n16/charles-yang/dig-dug-think-thunk | title=Dig-dug, think-thunk (review of ''Words and Rules'' by Steven Pinker) | author=Yang, Charles | journal=London Review of Books | date=24 August 2000 | volume=22 | issue=6 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's topic, the English past tense, is in Yang's view unglamorous, and Pinker's attempts at compromise risk being in no man's land between rival theories. Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long 'words': they can't be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. "All Pinker (and the connectionists) are doing is turning over the rocks at the base of the intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution."&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;

In ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007), Pinker looks at a wide range of issues around the way words related to thoughts on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to [[Stone Age]] life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html | title=The Stuff of Thought | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=30 May 2014 | author=Pinker, Steven | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163145/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html | archivedate=9 May 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker is critical of theories about the [[Evolution of language|evolutionary origins of language]] that argue that linguistic cognition might have evolved from earlier musical cognition. He sees language as being tied primarily to the capacity for logical reasoning, and speculates that human proclivity for music may be a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] — a feature not adaptive in its own right, but that has persisted through other traits that are more broadly practical, and thus selected for. In ''How the Mind Works'', Pinker reiterates [[Immanuel Kant]]'s view  that music is not in itself an important cognitive phenomenon, but that it happens to stimulate important auditory and spatio-motor cognitive functions. Pinker compares music to "auditory cheesecake", stating that "As far as biological cause and effect is concerned, music is useless". This argument has been rejected by [[Daniel Levitin]] and [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], experts in [[music cognition]], who argue that music has had an important role in the evolution of human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levitin | first1 = D.

Pinker has also been critical of "[[whole language]]" reading instruction techniques, stating in ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', "...the dominant technique, called 'whole language,' the insight that [spoken] language is a naturally developing human instinct has been garbled into the evolutionarily improbable claim that ''reading'' is a naturally developing human instinct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=[[How the Mind Works]]|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|place=New York|pages=342|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the appendix to the 2007 reprinted edition of ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker cited ''Why Our Children Can't Read'' by cognitive psychologist [[Diane McGuinness]] as his favorite book on the subject and noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One raging public debate involving language went unmentioned in ''[[The Language Instinct]]'': the "reading wars," or dispute over whether children should be explicitly taught to read by decoding the sounds of words from their spelling (loosely known as "[[phonics]]") or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text-rich environment (often called "whole language"). I tipped my hand in the paragraph in [the sixth chapter of the book] which said that language is an instinct but reading is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=[[The Language Instinct]]|publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]|place=New York|pages=186|edition=3rd|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it's essential for children to be taught to become aware of speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=[[The Language Instinct]]|publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]|place=New York|pages=PS14|edition=3rd|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:NormandySupply edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Despite the immense violence of the [[Second World War]], as in [[Operation Overlord|the D-Day landings of 1944]], Steven Pinker argues that violence is decreasing.]]--&gt;

In ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'', published in 2011, Pinker argues that violence, including tribal warfare, homicide, cruel punishments, child abuse, animal cruelty, domestic violence, lynching, pogroms, and international and civil wars, has decreased over multiple scales of time and magnitude. Pinker considers it unlikely that human nature has changed. In his view, it is more likely that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and those that counteract them, the "better angels of our nature". He outlines six 'major historical declines of violence' that all have their own socio/cultural/economic causes:&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Decline of Violence|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-decline-of-violence|publisher=IAI|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "The Pacification Process" – The rise of organized systems of government has a correlative relationship with the decline in violent deaths. As states expand they prevent tribal feuding, reducing losses.
# "The Civilizing Process" – Consolidation of centralized states and kingdoms throughout Europe results in the rise of criminal justice and commercial infrastructure, organizing previously chaotic systems that could lead to raiding and mass violence.
# "The Humanitarian Revolution" – The 18th - 20th  century abandonment of institutionalized violence by the state (breaking on the wheel, burning at the stake). Suggests this is likely due to the spike in literacy after the invention of the printing press thereby allowing the proletariat to question conventional wisdom.
# "The Long Peace" – The powers of 20th Century believed that period of time to be the bloodiest in history. This to a largely peaceful 65-year period post World War I and World War II. Developed countries have stopped warring (against each other and colonially), adopted democracy, and this has led a massive decline (on average) of deaths.
# "The New Peace" –  The decline in organized conflicts of all kinds since the end of the Cold War.
# "The Rights Revolutions" – The reduction of systemic violence at smaller scales against vulnerable populations (racial minorities, women, children, homosexuals, animals).

The book was welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its arguments convincing and its synthesis of a large volume of historical evidence compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Horgan |title=Will War Ever End?

==English writing style in the 21st century==

In his seventh popular book, ''[[The Sense of Style|The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century]]'' (2014), Pinker attempts to provide a writing style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.

In a November 2014 episode of the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast, host Lindsay Beyerstein, asked Pinker how his style guide was different from the many guides that already exist.  His answer,

{{quote|''The Thinking Person's Guide'' because I don't issue dictates from on high as most manuals do but explain why the various guidelines will improve writing, what they do for language, what they do for the reader's experience, in the hope that the users will apply the rules judiciously knowing what they are designed to accomplish, rather than robotically.&lt;ref name=SofS01&gt;{{cite web|title=Steven Pinker: Using Grammar as a Tool, Not as a Weapon|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/steven_pinker_using_grammar_as_a_tool_not_as_a_weapon/|website=[[Point of Inquiry]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=9 January 2017|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also indicated that the 21st century was applicable because language and usage change over time and it has been a long time since [[William Strunk Jr.|William Strunk]] wrote ''[[Elements of Style]]''.&lt;ref name="SofS01"/&gt;

==Public debate==
Pinker is a frequent participant in public debates surrounding the contributions of science to contemporary society. Social commentators such as Ed West, author of ''The Diversity Illusion'', consider Pinker important and daring in his willingness to confront taboos, as in ''The Blank Slate''. This doctrine (the ''[[tabula rasa]]''), writes West, remained accepted "as fact, rather than fantasy"&lt;ref name=WestTelegraph&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100177038/a-decade-after-steven-pinkers-the-blank-slate-why-is-human-nature-still-taboo/ | title=A decade after Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate, why is human nature still taboo? | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=17 August 2012 | accessdate=30 May 2014 | author=West, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decade after the book's publication. West describes Pinker as "no polemicist, and he leaves readers to draw their own conclusions".&lt;ref name=WestTelegraph/&gt;

In January 2005, Pinker defended [[Lawrence Summers]], president of Harvard University, whose comments about a [[gender role|gender gap]] in mathematics and science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses ought to be the subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=505366 "PSYCHOANALYSIS Q-and-A: Steven Pinker"] ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' Accessed 8 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edge.org]] ran a debate between Pinker and [[Elizabeth Spelke]] on gender and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html | title=The Science of Gender and Science: Pinker Vs. Spelke, A Debate | publisher=Edge.org | date=16 May 2005 | accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pinker wrote a mixed review of [[Malcolm Gladwell]]'s essays in ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticizing his analytical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Pinker-t.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Pinker | title=Malcolm Gladwell, Eclectic Detective | date=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker's comments about the importance of [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] on teaching performance and by analogy, the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/books/review/Letters-t-LETSGOTOTHET_LETTERS.html | work=The New York Times | title=Let's Go to the Tape | date=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advanced NFL Stats]] addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing that differences in methodology could explain the two men's differing opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burke |first=Brian |url=http://www.advancednflstats.com/2010/04/steven-pinker-vs-malcolm-gladwell-and.html |title=Steven Pinker vs. Malcolm Gladwell and Drafting QBs |publisher=Advanced NFL Stats |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[David Shenk]] criticized Pinker for siding with the "nature" argument and for "never once acknowledg[ing] [[gene-environment interaction]] or [[epigenetics]]" in an article on [[nature versus nurture]] in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geniusblog.davidshenk.com/2009/01/steven-pinkers-probabilistic-genes.html Steven Pinker's "probabilistic" genes], David Shenk&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker responded to a question about epigenetics as a possibility for the [[The Better Angels of Our Nature|decline in violence]] in a lecture for the [[BBC World Service]]. Pinker said it was unlikely since the decline in violence happened too rapidly to be explained by genetic changes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00m98km Exchanges At The Frontier 2011]", BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Helga Vierich and Cathryn Townsend wrote a critical review of Pinker's sweeping "Civilizational" explanations for patterns of human violence and warfare in response to a lecture he gave at Cambridge University in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Human violence and morality http://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/pdf/10.3828/hgr.2015.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Pinker is also noted for having identified the rename of Phillip Morris to [[Altria]] as an "egregious example" of [[phonesthesia]], with the company attempting to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive carcinogens to a place or state marked by altruism and other lofty values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Steven |last1=Pinker |date=2007 |title=The Stuff of Thought |publisher=Penguin Books |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TadLeA84f7UC&amp;pg=PT451 304]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker continued to court controversy through his 2018 book ''[[Enlightenment Now]]'', in which he argues that enlightenment rationality has driven tremendous progress and should be defended against attacks from both the left and right. ''The'' ''Guardian'' criticized the book as a "triumphalist" work that has a "curious relationship to intellectual history" and overestimates the role of campus activists in mainstream discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/14/enlightenment-now-steven-pinker-review|title=Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker review – life is getting better|last=Davies|first=William|date=2018-02-14|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While promoting the book on the NPR show [[1A (radio)|1A]], Pinker caused a minor social media backlash when he said that "I don't think [[Malcolm X]] did the world much good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://the1a.org/shows/2018-02-14/steven-pinker-looks-at-the-bright-side|title=Steven Pinker Looks At The Bright Side|date=Feb 14, 2018|work=1A|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/PalomaSaenz7/status/963819864413454336|title=Paloma Saenz on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-05-12}}{{Primary source inline|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/daviddaviddawud/status/964157316357672961|title=David on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-05-12}}{{Primary source inline|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Summa Theologiae''''' (written 1265–1274 and also known as the '''''Summa Theologica''''' or simply the '''''Summa''''') is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274). Although unfinished, the ''Summa'' is "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jAcwGItzssC&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as an instructional guide for theology students, including seminarians and the literate laity. It is a compendium of all of the main [[theology|theological]] teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The ''Summa''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s topics follow a cycle: [[God]]; Creation, Man; [[teleology|Man's purpose]]; [[Christ]]; the [[Sacraments]]; and back to God.

The ''Summa'' is Aquinas' "most perfect work, the fruit of his mature years, in which the thought of his whole life is condensed".&lt;ref&gt;Perrier, Joseph Louis, Ph.D., "The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century" (New York: The Columbia University Press, 1909), pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Among non-scholars, the ''Summa'' is perhaps most famous for its five arguments for the existence of God, which are known as the "five ways" ({{lang-la|[[quinque viae]]}}). The five ways, however, occupy only one of the ''Summa'''s 3,125 articles.

Throughout the ''Summa'', Aquinas cites [[Christian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], [[Judaism|Hebrew]], and [[Paganism|Pagan]] sources including but not limited to [[Catholic Bible|Christian Sacred Scripture]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Boethius]], [[John of Damascus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], [[Maimonides]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], and [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Eriugena]].

The ''Summa'' is a more structured and expanded version of Aquinas's earlier ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''. These works were written for different purposes, the ''Summa Theologiae'' to explain the Christian faith to beginning theology students, and the ''Summa contra Gentiles'' to explain the Christian faith and defend it in hostile situations, with arguments adapted to the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain belief or a specific [[heresy]].&lt;ref name="GilsonC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilson|first=Etienne|title=The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas|year=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0-268-00801-7|pages=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas conceived the ''Summa'' specifically as a work suited to beginning students: "Because a doctor of catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. As the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3: 1–2, ''as to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat'', our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion, in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa theologiae, I, 1, prooemium:"Quia Catholicae veritatis doctor non solum provectos debet instruere, sed ad eum pertinet etiam incipientes erudire, secundum illud apostoli I ad Corinth. III, tanquam parvulis in Christo, lac vobis potum dedi, non escam; propositum nostrae intentionis in hoc opere est, ea quae ad Christianam religionem pertinent, eo modo tradere, secundum quod congruit ad eruditionem incipientium."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while teaching at the [[Santa Sabina]] ''studium provinciale'', the forerunner of the [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] ''[[studium generale]]'' and College of Saint Thomas, which in the 20th century would become the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], that Aquinas began to compose the ''Summa''. He completed the ''Prima Pars'' (first part) in its entirety and circulated it in Italy before departing to take up his second regency as professor at the University of Paris (1269–1272).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Torrell, O.P. ''Saint Thomas Aquinas'', vol 1, The Person and His Work, trans. Robert Royal, Catholic University, 1996, 146 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only has the ''Summa Theologiae'' been one of the main intellectual inspirations for [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]], but it also had such a great influence on [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' that Dante's epic poem has been called "the ''Summa'' in verse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;dq=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;cd=10 ''The Fordham Monthly''] Fordham University, Vol. XL, Oct. 1921 – June 1922, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
Even today, both in Western and Eastern Catholic Churches, Orthodoxy, and the mainstream original Protestant denominations (Anglicanism and Episcopalianism, Lutheranism, Methodism, and Presbyterianism), it is very common for the Summa Theologiae to be required or strongly urged reading, in whole or in part, for all those seeking ordination to the diaconate or priesthood, or to professed male or female religious life, or for laypersons studying philosophy and theology at the collegiate level.

== Structure ==

[[Image:Tommaso - Summa theologica, 1596 - 4593718.tif|thumb|''Summa theologica'', 1596]]

The ''Summa'' is structured into three '''Parts''' which are subdivided into 614 '''Questions''' or "QQ".  Questions, in turn, are subdivided into 3,125 '''Articles'''.  "Questions" are specific topics of discussion, while their articles are even more specific questions, facets of the parent question.  For example, Part I, Question 2, "The Existence of God" is divided into three articles: "Whether the existence of God is self-evident?", "Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?", and "Whether God exists?"  Additionally, questions on a broader theme are grouped into '''Treatises''', though the category of treatise is reported differently, depending on the source.

The ''Summa's'' three parts have a few other major subdivisions.

* '''First Part''' (119 QQ, 584 Art.): in Latin, ''Prima Pars''.  God's existence and nature; the creation of the world; [[angel]]s; the nature of man.
* '''Second Part''' (303 QQ, 1536 Art.), subdivided into two sub-parts:
:* '''First part of the Second Part''' (114 QQ, 619 Art.): ''Prima Secundae'', or Part I-II.  General principles of morality (including a theory of [[law]]).
:* '''Second part of the Second Part''' (189 QQ, 917 Art.): ''Secunda Secundae'', or Part II-II.  Morality in particular, including individual virtues and vices.
* '''Third Part''' (90 QQ, 549 Art.): ''Tertia Pars''.  The person and work of Christ, who is the way of man to God; the [[sacrament]]s. Aquinas left this part unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;McInerny, Ralph, ''A First Glance at St. Thomas Aquinas'', Notre Dame Press:Indiana, (1990), p.197, {{ISBN|0-268-00975-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* '''Supplement''' (99 QQ, 446 Art.). The third part proper is attended by a posthumous supplement which concludes the third part and the ''Summa'', treating of Christian [[eschatology]], or "the last things".
* '''Appendix I and II''' (2 QQ, 8 Art; 1 Q, 2 Art.). Additionally, there are two very small appendices which discuss the subject of [[purgatory]].

The ''Summa'' has a standard format for each article, which can be explained by taking another article (Pt. III, Q. 40, Art. 3) as an example: "Whether [[Christ]] should have led a life of poverty in this world?",&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/TP/TP040.html#TPQ40A3THEP1 Summa Theologica]'', Third Part, Question 40, Article 3. Retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a facet of the larger question "Of Christ's Manner of Life."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/TP/TP040.html Summa Theologica]'', Third Part, Question 40.  Retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* A series of objections to the (yet to be stated) conclusion are given; one such objection, for example, is that "Christ should have embraced the most eligible form of life...which is a mean between riches and poverty."&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3/&gt; Note that this said conclusion can mostly (but not without exception) be extracted by setting the introduction to the first objection into the negative, thus, St. Thomas begins here "It would seem that Christ should not have led a life of poverty in this world", and his thesis in the end is "Christ should have led a life of poverty in this world" (or to be more precise in today's language, "That Christ lived, as he actually did, a life of poverty in this world was fittingly done so").
* A short counter-statement, beginning with the phrase ''sed contra'' ("on the contrary"), is then given; this statement almost always references authoritative literature, such as the [[Bible]], [[Aristotle]], or the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, Peter. ''Summa of the Summa,'' Ignatius Press (1990), pp. 17–18.  {{ISBN|0-89870-300-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The actual argument is then made; this is generally a clarification of the issue. For example, Aquinas states that "it was fitting for Christ to lead a life of poverty in this world" for four distinct reasons, each of which is expounded in some detail.&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3/&gt;
* Individual replies to the preceding objections are then given, if necessary. These replies range from one sentence to several paragraphs in length. Aquinas's reply to the above objection is that "those who wish to live virtuously need to avoid abundance of riches and beggary, ... but voluntary poverty is not open to this danger: and such was the poverty chosen by Christ."&lt;ref name=ST3_40_3/&gt;

This method of exposition is derived from [[Averroes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02150c.htm Turner, William. "Averroes."] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company (1907). "St. Thomas Aquinas used the "Grand Commentary" of Averroes as his model, being, apparently, the first Scholastic to adopt that style of exposition..." Retrieved 2009-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt; to whom Aquinas refers respectfully as "the Commentator".

== References within the ''Summa'' ==
[[File:Summa Theologica.JPG|thumb]]
The ''Summa'' makes many references to certain thinkers held in great respect in Aquinas's time. The arguments from authority, or ''sed contra'' arguments, are almost entirely based on citations from these authors. Some were called by special names:
* '''The Apostle:''' [[Paul the Apostle]]. He wrote the majority of the [[New Testament]] canon after his conversion, earning him the title of The Apostle in Aquinas's ''Summa'' even though Paul wasn't among the original twelve followers of Jesus.
* '''The Philosopher:''' [[Aristotle]]. He was considered the most astute philosopher – the one who had expressed the most truth up to that time. The main aim of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians was to use his precise technical terms and [[logical system]] to investigate theology.
* '''The Commentator:''' [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd). He was among the foremost commentators on Aristotle's works in Arabic, and his commentaries were often translated into Latin (along with Aristotle's text).

== Overview of the entire ''Summa'' ==
[[File:Aquinas summa cycle.svg|300px|thumb|Graphical depiction of the cyclic structure of the work.]]
The structure of the ''Summa Theologiae'' is meant to reflect the [[cyclic history|cyclic]] nature of the cosmos, in the sense of the emission and return of the Many from and to [[the One (Neoplatonism)|the One]] in [[Platonism]], cast in terms of Christian theology: The procession of the material universe from [[Ousia|divine essence]], the culmination of creation in [[Creation of Man|man]], and the motion of man [[Salvation in Christianity|back towards God]] by way of [[Christ]] and the [[Sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;
Thomas Franklin O'Meara, ''Summa Theologiae: Volume 40, Superstition and Irreverence'', Cambridge University Press, (2006), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=EL59l6bgk0MC&amp;pg=PR19  p. xix].&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the work reflects this cyclic arrangement.  It begins with God and his existence in Question 2. The entire first part of the ''Summa'' deals with God and his creation, which reaches its zenith in man. The First Part, therefore, ends with the treatise on man.

The second part of the ''Summa'' deals with man's purpose (the meaning of life), which is happiness. The ethics detailed in this part are a summary of the ethics (Aristotelian in nature) that man must follow to reach his intended destiny.

Since no man on his own can truly live the perfect ethical life (and therefore reach God), it was necessary that a perfect man bridge the gap between God and man. Thus God became man. The third part of the ''Summa'', therefore, deals with the life of Christ.

In order to follow the way prescribed by this perfect man, in order to live with God's grace (which is necessary for man's salvation), the Sacraments have been provided; the final part of the ''Summa'' considers the Sacraments.

== Summary of key opinions in the ''Summa'' ==

=== The Summa, Part I: Theology ===
St. Thomas's greatest work was the ''Summa'', and it is the fullest presentation of his views. He worked on it from the time of [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] (after 1265) until the end of his life. When he died, he had reached Question 90 of Part III (on the subject of [[penance]]). What was lacking was added afterwards from the fourth book of his commentary on the ''Sentences'' of Peter Lombard as a ''supplementum'', which is not found in manuscripts of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The ''Summa'' was translated into Greek (apparently by [[Maximus Planudes]] around 1327), Armenian, many European languages, and Chinese.

It consists of three parts. Part I treats of God, who is the "[[first cause]], himself uncaused" (''[[primum movens]] immobile'') and as such existent only in act (''actu'') – that is, pure actuality without potentiality, and therefore without corporeality. His essence is ''[[Actus Purus|actus purus et perfectus]]''. This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the fivefold proof for the existence of God; namely, there must be a first mover, unmoved, a first cause in the chain of causes, an absolutely necessary being, an absolutely perfect being, and a rational designer. In this connection the thoughts of the unity, [[infinity]], unchangeability, and goodness of the highest being are deduced.

As God rules in the world, the "plan of the order of things" preexists in him; in other words, his [[Divine providence|providence]] and the exercise of it in his government are what condition as cause everything which comes to pass in the world. Hence follows [[predestination]]: from eternity some are destined to eternal life, while as concerns others "he permits some to fall short of that end". [[Reprobation]], however, is more than mere foreknowledge; it is the "will of permitting anyone to fall into sin and incur the penalty of condemnation for sin".  

The effect of predestination is grace. Since God is the first cause of everything, he is the cause of even the free acts of men through predestination. Determinism is deeply grounded in the system of St. Thomas; things (with their source of becoming in God) are ordered from eternity as means for the realization of his end in himself.  

On moral grounds, St. Thomas advocates freedom energetically; but, with his premises, he can have in mind only the psychological form of self-motivation. Nothing in the world is accidental or free, although it may appear so in reference to the proximate cause. From this point of view, miracles become necessary in themselves and are to be considered merely as inexplicable to man. From the point of view of the first cause, all is unchangeable, although from the limited point of view of the secondary cause, miracles may be spoken of.

In his doctrine of the [[Trinity]], Aquinas starts from the Augustinian system. Since God has only the functions of thinking and willing, only two ''processiones'' can be asserted from the Father; but these establish definite relations of the persons of the Trinity, one to another. The relations must be conceived as real and not as merely ideal; for, as with creatures relations arise through certain accidents, since in God there is no accident but all is substance, it follows that "the relation really existing in God is the same as the essence according to the thing". From another side, however, the relations as real must be really distinguished one from another. Therefore, three persons are to be affirmed in God.

Man stands opposite to God; he consists of [[soul]] and body. The "intellectual soul" consists of [[nous|intellect]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. Furthermore, the soul is the absolutely indivisible form of man; it is immaterial substance, but not one and the same in all men (as the [[Averroism|Averroists]] assumed). The soul's power of knowing has two sides: a passive (the ''[[passive intellect|intellectus possibilis]]'') and an active (the ''intellectus agens'').  

It is the capacity to form concepts and to abstract the mind's images (''species'') from the objects perceived by sense; but since what the intellect abstracts from individual things is universal, the mind knows the universal primarily and directly and knows the singular only indirectly by virtue of a certain ''reflexio'' (compare [[Scholasticism]]). As certain principles are immanent in the mind for its speculative activity, so also a "special disposition of works" – or the ''[[synderesis]]'' (rudiment of conscience) – is inborn in the "practical reason", affording the idea of the moral law of nature so important in medieval ethics.

=== The Summa, Part II: Ethics ===

==== Structure ====
Part II of the ''Summa'' is divided into two parts. The first part comprises 114 ''quaestiones'', and the second part comprises 189. The two parts of the second part are usually presented as containing several "treatises". The contents are as follows:
* '''First part of Part II''':
** Treatise on the last end (qq. 1 to 5)
** Treatise on human acts: Acts peculiar to humans (qq. 6 to 21)
** Treatise on the passions (qq. 22 to 48)
** Treatise on habits (qq. 49 to 54)
** Treatise on habits in particular (qq. 55 to 89): Good habits, i.e., virtues (qq. 55 to 70)
** Treatise on [[law]] (qq. 90 to 108)
** Treatise on [[Divine grace|grace]] (qq. 109 to 114)
* '''Second part of Part II''':
** Treatise on the [[theological virtues]] (qq. 1 to 46)
** Treatise on the [[cardinal virtues]] (qq. 47 to 170)
*** Treatise on [[prudence]] (qq. 47 to 56)
*** Treatise on [[justice]] (qq. 57 to 122)
*** Treatise on [[Courage|fortitude]] and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] (qq. 123 to 170)
** Treatise on gratuitous graces (qq. 171 to 182)
** Treatise on the states of life (qq. 183 to 189)

==== Content in general ====
The first part of the ''Summa'' is summed up in the premise that [[God]] governs the world as the "universal [[first cause]]". God sways the intellect; he gives the power to know and impresses the ''species intelligibiles'' on the mind, and he sways the will in that he holds the good before it as aim, creating the ''virtus volendi''. "To will is nothing else than a certain inclination toward the object of the volition which is the universal good." God works all in all, but so that things also themselves exert their proper efficiency. Here the Areopagitic ideas of the graduated effects of created things play their part in St. Thomas's thought. The second part of the ''Summa'' (two parts, ''Prima Secundae'' and ''Secunda Secundae'') follows this complex of ideas. Its theme is man's striving for the highest end, which is the blessedness of the ''visio beata''. Here, St. Thomas develops his system of ethics, which has its root in [[Aristotle]].

In a chain of acts of will, man strives for the highest end. They are free acts, insofar as man has in himself the knowledge of their end (and therein the principle of action). In that the will wills the end, it wills also the appropriate means, chooses freely and completes the ''consensus''. Whether the act is good or evil depends on the end. The "human reason" pronounces judgment concerning the character of the end; it is, therefore, the law for action. Human acts, however, are meritorious insofar as they promote the purpose of God and his honor.

By repeating a good action, man acquires a moral habit or a quality that enables him to do the good gladly and easily. This is true, however, only of the intellectual and moral virtues (which St. Thomas treats after the manner of [[Aristotle]]); the theological virtues are imparted by God to man as a "disposition", from which the acts here proceed; while they strengthen, they do not form it. The "disposition" of evil is the opposite alternative. An act becomes evil through deviation from the reason and from divine moral law. Therefore, sin involves two factors: its substance (or matter) is lust; in form, however, it is deviation from the divine law.

[[Sin]] has its origin in the will, which decides (against reason) for a "changeable good". Since, however, the will also moves the other powers of man, sin has its seat in these too. By choosing such a lower good as its end, the will is misled by self-love, so that this works as cause in every sin. God is not the cause of sin since, on the contrary, he draws all things to himself; but from another side, God is the cause of all things, so he is efficacious also in sin as ''actio'' but not as ''ens.'' The devil is not directly the cause of sin, but he incites the imagination and the sensuous impulse of man (as men or things may also do).

Sin is [[original sin]]. Adam's first sin passes through himself to all the succeeding race; because he is the head of the human race and "by virtue of procreation human nature is transmitted and along with nature its infection." The powers of generation are, therefore, designated especially as "infected". The thought is involved here by the fact that St. Thomas, like other scholastics, believed in creationism; he therefore taught that souls are created by God.  

Two things, according to St. Thomas, constituted man's righteousness in paradise – the ''justitia originalis'', or the harmony of all man's powers before they were blighted by desire, and the possession of the ''gratis gratum faciens'' (the continuous, indwelling power of good). Both are lost through original sin, which, in form, is the "loss of original righteousness." The consequence of this loss is the disorder and maiming of man's nature, which shows itself in "ignorance; malice, moral weakness, and especially in ''concupiscentia, ''which is the material principle of original sin."  

The course of thought here is as follows: when the first man transgressed the order of his nature appointed by nature and grace, he (and with him the human race) lost this order. This negative state is the essence of original sin. From it follow an impairment and perversion of human nature in which thenceforth lower aims rule, contrary to nature, and release the lower element in man.

Since sin is contrary to the divine order, it is guilt and subject to punishment. Guilt and punishment correspond to each other; and since the "apostasy from the invariable good which is infinite," fulfilled by man, is unending, it merits everlasting punishment.

God works even in sinners to draw them to the end by "instructing through the law and aiding by grace." The law is the "precept of the practical reason." As the moral law of nature, it is the participation of the reason in the all-determining "eternal reason"; but since man falls short in his appropriation of this law of reason, there is need of a "divine law"; and since the law applies to many complicated relations, the ''practicae dispositiones'' of the human law must be laid down.

The divine law consists of an old and a new. Insofar as the old divine law contains the moral law of nature, it is universally valid; what there is in it, however, beyond this is valid only for the Jews. The new law is "primarily grace itself" and so a "law given within"; "a gift superadded to nature by grace," but not a "written law." In this sense, as sacramental grace, the new law justifies. It contains, however, an "ordering" of external and internal conduct and so regarded is, as a matter of course, identical with both the old law and the law of nature. The ''consilia ''show how one may attain the end "better and more expediently" by full renunciation of worldly goods.

Since man is sinner and creature, he needs grace to reach the final end. The "first cause" alone is able to reclaim him to the "final end." This is true after the fall, although it was needful before. Grace is, on one side, "the free act of God", and, on the other side, the effect of this act, the ''gratia infusa'' or ''gratia creata,'' a ''[[Habitus (medieval philosophy)|habitus]] infusus'' that is instilled into the "essence of the soul," "a certain gift of disposition, something supernatural proceeding from God into man." Grace is a supernatural ethical character created in man by God, which comprises in itself all good, both faith and love.

[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] by [[Divine grace|grace]] comprises four elements: "the infusion of grace, the influencing of free will toward God through faith, the influencing of free will respecting sin, and the remission of sins." It is a "transmutation of the human soul," and takes place "instantaneously". A creative act of God enters, which, however, executes itself as a spiritual motive in a psychological form corresponding to the nature of man. Semipelagian tendencies are far removed from St. Thomas. In that man is created anew, he believes and loves, and now, sin is forgiven. Then begins good conduct; grace is the "beginning of meritorious works." Aquinas conceives of merit in the Augustinian sense: God gives the reward for that toward which he himself gives the power. Man can never of himself deserve the ''prima gratis''," nor ''meritum de congruo'' (by natural ability; cf. R. Seeberg, ''Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte'', ii. 105–106, Leipsic, 1898).

After thus stating the principles of morality, in the ''Secunda Secundae,'' St. Thomas comes to a minute exposition of his ethics according to the scheme of the virtues. The conceptions of faith and love are of much significance in the complete system of St. Thomas. Man strives toward the [[highest good]] with the will or through love; but since the end must first be "apprehended in the intellect," knowledge of the end to be loved must precede love; "because the will can not strive after God in perfect love unless the intellect have true faith toward him."  

Inasmuch as this truth that is to be known is practical, it first incites the will, which then brings the reason to "assent"; but since, furthermore, the good in question is transcendent and inaccessible to man by himself, it requires the infusion of a supernatural "capacity" or "disposition" to make man capable of faith as well as love.  

Accordingly, the object of both faith and love is God, involving also the entire complex of truths and commandments that God reveals, insofar as they in fact relate to God and lead to him. Thus, faith becomes recognition of the teachings and precepts of the Scriptures and the Church ("the first subjection of man to God is by faith"). The object of faith, however, is, by its nature, object of love; therefore, faith comes to completion only in love ("by love is the act of faith accomplished and formed").

==== Treatise on Law ====
{{main article|Treatise on Law}}
According to Question 90, Article Four of the Second Part of the ''Summa'', [[law]] "is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated." All law comes from the eternal law of Divine Reason that governs the universe, which is understood and participated in by rational beings (such as men and [[angels]]) as the [[natural law]]. The natural law, when codified and promulgated, is the [[lex humana|human law]].  

In addition to the human law, dictated by reason, man also has the divine law, which, according to Question 91, is dictated through revelation, that man may be "directed how to perform his proper acts in view of his last end," "that man may know without any doubt what he ought to do and what he ought to avoid," because "human law could not sufficiently curb and direct interior acts," and since "human law cannot punish or forbid all evil deeds: since while aiming at doing away with all evils, it would do away with many good things, and would hinder the advance of the common good, which is necessary for human intercourse." Human law is not all-powerful; it cannot govern a man's [[conscience]], nor prohibit all vices, nor can it force all men to act according to its letter, rather than its spirit.  

Furthermore, it is possible that an edict can be issued without any basis in law as defined in Question 90; in this case, men are under no compulsion to act, save as it helps the common good. This separation between law and acts of force also allows men to depose [[tyrant]]s, or those who flout the [[natural law]]; while removing an agent of the law is contrary to the common good and the eternal law of God, which orders the powers that be, removing a tyrant is lawful as he has ceded his claim to being a lawful authority by acting contrary to law.

=== The Summa, Part III: Christ ===
The way which leads to God is [[Christ]], the theme of Part III. It can be asserted that the [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] was absolutely necessary. The ''Unio'' between the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] and the human nature is a "relation" between the divine and the human nature, which comes about by both natures being brought together in the one person of the Logos. An incarnation can be spoken of only in the sense that the human nature began to be in the eternal hypostasis of the divine nature. So Christ is ''unum'' since his human nature lacks the hypostasis.  

The person of the Logos, accordingly, has assumed the impersonal human nature, and in such way that the assumption of the soul became the means for the assumption of the body. This union with the human soul is the ''gratia unionis'', which leads to the impartation of the ''gratia habitualis'' from the Logos to the human nature. Thereby, all human potentialities are made perfect in Jesus. Besides the perfections given by the vision of God, which Jesus enjoyed from the beginning, he receives all others by the ''gratia habitualis''. Insofar, however, as it is the limited human nature which receives these perfections, they are finite. This holds both of the knowledge and the will of Christ.  

The Logos impresses the ''species intelligibiles'' of all created things on the soul, but the ''[[active intellect|intellectus agens]]'' transforms them gradually into the impressions of sense. On another side, the soul of Christ works miracles only as instrument of the Logos, since omnipotence in no way appertains to this human soul in itself. Concerning redemption, St. Thomas teaches that Christ is to be regarded as redeemer after his human nature but in such way that the human nature produces divine effects as organ of divinity.  

The one side of the work of redemption consists herein, that Christ as head of humanity imparts ''ordo'', ''perfectio'', and ''virtus'' to his members. He is the teacher and example of humanity; his whole life and suffering as well as his work after he is exalted serve this end. The love wrought hereby in men effects, according to Luke vii. 47, the forgiveness of sins.

This is the first course of thought. Then follows a second complex of thoughts, which has the idea of satisfaction as its center. To be sure, God as the highest being could forgive sins without satisfaction; but because his justice and mercy could be best revealed through satisfaction, he chose this way. As little, however, as satisfaction is necessary in itself, so little does it offer an equivalent, in a correct sense, for guilt; it is rather a "superabundant satisfaction", since on account of the divine subject in Christ in a certain sense his suffering and activity are infinite.  

With this thought, the strict logical deduction of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm's]] theory is given up. Christ's suffering bore personal character in that it proceeded "out of love and obedience". It was an offering brought to God, which as a personal act had the character of merit. Thereby, Christ "merited" salvation for men. As Christ, exalted, still influences men, so does he still work on their behalf continually in heaven through the intercession (''interpellatio''). 

In this way, Christ as head of humanity effects the forgiveness of their sins, their reconciliation with God, their immunity from punishment, deliverance from the devil, and the opening of heaven's gate; but inasmuch as all these benefits are already offered through the inner operation of the love of Christ, Aquinas has combined the theories of Anselm and [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] by joining the one to the other.

=== The sacraments ===
The doctrine of the [[sacrament]]s follows the Christology; the sacraments "have efficacy from the incarnate Word himself". They are not only signs of sanctification, but also bring it about. It is inevitable that they bring spiritual gifts in sensuous form, because of the sensuous nature of man. The ''res sensibiles'' are the matter, the words of institution the form of the sacraments. Contrary to the Franciscan view that the sacraments are mere symbols whose efficacy God accompanies with a directly following creative act in the soul, St. Thomas holds it not unfit to agree with [[Hugo of St. Victor]] that "a sacrament contains grace", or to teach that they "cause grace".

St. Thomas attempts to remove the difficulty of a sensuous thing.... producing a creative effect, by distinguishing between the ''causa principalis et instrumentalis''. God, as the principal cause, works through the sensuous thing as the means ordained by him for his end. "Just as instrumental power is acquired by the instrument from this, that it is moved by the principal agent, so also the sacrament obtains spiritual power from the benediction of Christ and the application of the minister to the use of the sacrament.  

There is spiritual power in the sacraments in so far as they have been ordained by God for a spiritual effect." This spiritual power remains in the sensuous thing until it has attained its purpose. At the same time, St. Thomas distinguished the ''gratia sacramentalis'' from the ''gratia virtutum et donorum'', in that the former perfects the general essence and the powers of the soul, whilst the latter in particular brings to pass necessary spiritual effects for the Christian life. Later, this distinction was ignored.

In a single statement, the effect of the [[sacrament]]s is to infuse justifying grace into men. That which Christ effects is achieved through the sacraments. Christ's humanity was the instrument for the operation of his divinity; the sacraments are the instruments through which this operation of Christ's humanity passes over to men. Christ's humanity served his divinity as ''instrumentum conjunctum'', like the hand; the sacraments are ''instrumenta separata'', like a staff; the former can use the latter, as the hand can use a staff. For a more detailed exposition, cf. Seeberg, ''ut sup.'', ii. 112 sqq.

=== Eschatology ===
Of St. Thomas's eschatology, according to the commentary on the ''Sentences'', this is only a brief account. Everlasting blessedness consists in the vision of God - this vision consists not in an abstraction or in a mental image supernaturally produced, but the divine substance itself is beheld, and in such manner that God himself becomes immediately the form of the beholding intellect. God is the object of the vision and, at the same time, causes the vision.  

The perfection of the blessed also demands that the body be restored to the soul as something to be made perfect by it. Since blessedness consists in ''operatio, ''it is made more perfect in that the soul has a definite ''operatio'' with the body, although the peculiar act of blessedness (in other words, the vision of God) has nothing to do with the body.

==Editions and translations==
{{see| Corpus Thomisticum}}
;Editions
Early partial editions were printed still in the [[Incunabula|15th century]], as early as 1463; 
an edition of the first section of part 2 was printed by Peter Schöffer of Mainz in 1471.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.edu/Bridwell/SpecialCollectionsandArchives/Exhibitions/PeterSchoefferPrinterofMainz/SchoefferAlone/Aquinas1471 Bridwell Library (smu.edu)]&lt;/ref&gt; A full edition was printed by Michael Wenssler of Basel in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/summa-theologica/oclc/699664146 OCLC 699664146].&lt;/ref&gt;
From the 16th century, numerous commentaries on the ''Summa'' were published, notably by [[Peter Crockaert]] (d. 1514), [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and by [[Thomas Cajetan]] (1570).

;Translations
The most accessible English translation of the work is that originally published by Benziger Brothers, in five volumes, in 1911 (with a revised edition published in 1920). 
The translation is entirely the work of Laurence Shapcote (1864-1947), an English Dominican friar. Wanting to remain anonymous, however, he attributed the translation to the Fathers of the English Dominican Province. Father Shapcote also translated various of Aquinas's other works.&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Aquinas's 'Summa Theologiae': A Guide and Commentary" by Brian Davies [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. xiv].
From 1917 until his death, Shapcote was based in [[Natal Province]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]. Fergus Kerr, "The Shapcote Translation", ''New Blackfriars'' (August 2011),  {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-2005.2011.01454.x}}.

[[File:Tine Hribar 2010.jpg|thumbnail|Tine Hribar]]
'''Tine Hribar''' (born 28 January 1941 as '''Velentin Hribar''') is a [[Slovenia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[public intellectual]], notable for his interpretations of [[Heidegger]] and his role in the democratization of Slovenia between 1988 and 1990, known as the [[Slovenian Spring]]. He is the husband of author, essayist and political commentator [[Spomenka Hribar]].

He was born in the small village of [[Goričica pri Ihanu|Goričica]] near [[Ihan]] in central Slovenia (then part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]). He studied philosophy and sociology at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. He continued his studies at the [[University of Zagreb]] under the supervision of [[Croatia]]n phenomenologist philosopher [[Vanja Sutlić]]. In 1971 he started teaching philosophy and sociology at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana. In 1975 he was fired from the University, together with fellow sociologist [[Veljko Rus]], because of his non-[[Marxist]] attitudes. In 1981 he co-founded the alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''.

In 1987 Hribar was among the editors of the famous "[[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]]", published in a special number of the journal ''Nova revija'', in which sixteen authors demanded a democratic and sovereign Slovenia. Between 1989 and 1991 he was an active member of the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]], one of the central parties within the [[DEMOS coalition]] that won the first free elections in Slovenia in April 1990.  Hribar and [[Peter Jambrek]] and [[France Bučar]] were the party's main strategists. After the party broke up in 1991, Hribar joined the [[left liberal]] [[Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Democratic Party]], but withdrew from active engagement in politics.

In 1992 Hribar became a professor at the University of Ljubljana again. In 1995 he became a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

== Political commentator ==
Hribar's role in Slovenian public life after 1991 caused controversy. In the early 1990s he warned against the recurrence of [[clericalism]] in Slovenia, and was critical of his former coalition partners of the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]], especially the former Prime Minister [[Lojze Peterle]]. After 1994 he became a critic of conservative opposition leader [[Janez Janša]], his former party colleague and close collaborator between 1989 and 1991. In the 1990s Hribar supported the ruling centre-left [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]]. In 2004 however, he turned against the ruling left-wing coalition, accusing it of fostering a "vulgar type of liberalism". He co-founded the [[liberal conservative]] civic platform [[Rally for the Republic (Slovenia)|Rally for the Republic]], which publicly supported the centre-right electoral coalition led by Janez Janša. This sudden and radical turn in Hribar's political affiliation was widely criticized, especially by post-Marxist philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], Hribar's former collaborator from the late 1970s.

Between 2004 and 2008, Hribar was relatively supportive of the policies of Janša's government, especially the [[Slovenian Democratic Party]], which he had fiercely criticized in the 1990s. He has nevertheless maintained his thoroughly [[anti-clerical]] and, to a certain extent, [[anti-Catholic]] position.

After the parliamentary elections of 2008, which brought the left wing to power in Slovenia, Hribar adopted critical stance towards the Slovenian left, accusing it of abusing power for personal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delo.si/clanek/100827&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained a critical, but substantially favourable attitude towards the Slovenian secular right wing parties, especially to the [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] and its leader [[Janez Janša]], whom he nevertheless accused of an excessively moralizing political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delo.si/clanek/100827&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8407">A '''transcendental argument''' is a [[deductive]] [[philosophical argument]] which takes a manifest feature of experience as granted, and articulates which must be the case so that experience as such is possible.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;Transcendental-arguments and Scepticism; Answering the Question of Justification (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 2000), pp 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepticism and Naturalism"&gt;Strawson, P., Skepticism and Naturalism: Some Varieties, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985) Premise-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Transcendental arguments may have additional standards of [[Theory of justification|justification]] that are more demanding than those of traditional deductive arguments.&lt;ref&gt;"Transcendental arguments… have to formulate boundary conditions we can all recognize. Once they are formulated properly, we can see at once that they are valid. The thing is self-evident. But it may be very hard to get to this point, and there may still be dispute… For although a correct formulation will be self-evidently valid, the question may arise whether we have formulated things correctly. This is all the more so since we are moving into an area [experience] that the ordinary practice of life has left unarticulated, an area we look through rather than at." Charles Taylor, "The Validity of Transcendental Arguments", ''Philosophical Arguments'' (Harvard, 1997), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arguments==
Typically, a transcendental argument starts from some accepted aspect of experience, and then deduces what must be true for that type of experience to be possible. Transcendental arguments are often used as arguments against [[skepticism]], usually about the reality of the external world or other minds.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;

So-called '''progressive''' transcendental arguments begin with an apparently indubitable and universally accepted statement about people's experiences of the world, and use this to make substantive knowledge-claims about the world, e.g., that it ''is'' causally and spatiotemporally related. They start with what is left at the ''end'' of the skeptics process of doubting.

'''Regressive''' transcendental arguments, on the other hand, ''begin at the same point'' as the skeptic, e.g., the fact that we have experience as of a causal and spatiotemporal world, and show that certain notions are implicit in our conceptions of such experience. Regressive transcendental arguments are more conservative in that they do not purport to make substantive ontological claims about the world.

An example is used by Kant in his  refutation of idealism. Idealists believe that the experience of objects independent of our mind is not legitimate. Briefly, Kant shows that

*since idealists acknowledge that we have an inner mental life, and
*an inner life of self-awareness is bound up with the concepts of objects which are not inner, and which interact causally,
*then we must have legitimate experience of outer objects which interact causally.

He has not established that outer objects exist, but only that the concept of them is legitimate, contrary to [[idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/trans-ar/#H8 The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Transcendental Arguments], Adrian Bardon section 8, third paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stapleford, Scott. Kant’s Transcendental Arguments: Disciplining Pure Reason - Continuum Publishing 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-8264-9928-8}} - hb)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all use of transcendental arguments are intended to counter skepticism, however.  The Dutch philosopher, Herman [[Dooyeweerd]],&lt;ref&gt;Dooyeweerd, H. 1984 [1955] ''A New Critique of Theoretical Thought'', Paideia Press, Jordan Station, Ontaria CA.  See also http://www.dooy.info/tc.html&lt;/ref&gt; used transcendental critique to establish the conditions that make a theoretical attitude of thought (not just the process of thinking, as in Kant) possible.  In particular he showed that theoretical thought cannot be neutral, rather, must be based on presuppositions that are "religious" in nature (in the sense of pre-theoretical commitment).

==Kant==

It was [[Immanuel Kant]] who gave transcendental arguments their name and notoriety. It is controversial, though, whether his own transcendental arguments should be classified as progressive or regressive.&lt;ref&gt;For a progressive reading of Kant's arguments, see Strawson, P. F. (1966), ''The Bounds of Sense: An Essay on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.'' For a regressive reading, see Karl Ameriks (1978), "Kant’s Transcendental Deduction as a Regressive Argument", ''Kant-Studien.'' Volume 69, Pages 273–287&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) Kant developed one of philosophy's most famous transcendental arguments in 'The Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]]. 1998. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 'Transcendental Aesthetic', Kant used transcendental arguments to show that sensory experiences would not be possible apart from our contributing to them their spatial and temporal form.

==Criticisms of transcendental arguments==

As stated above, one of the main uses of transcendental arguments is to use one thing we can know, the nature of our experiences, to counter skeptics' arguments that we cannot ''know'' something or other about the nature of the world. One need not be a skeptic about those matters, however, to find transcendental arguments unpersuasive. There are a number of ways that one might deny that a given transcendental argument gives us knowledge of the world. The following responses may suit some versions and not others.

*First, critics respond by claiming that the arguer cannot be sure that he or she is having particular experiences. That a person cannot be sure about the nature of his or her own experiences may initially seem bizarre. However, it may be claimed that the very act of thinking about or, even more, describing our experiences in words, involves interpreting them in ways that go beyond so-called 'pure' experience.&lt;ref name=toolkit&gt;[[Julian Baggini|Baggini, Julian]] and Peter S. Fosl. 2003. '2.10 Transcendental arguments'. In ''The Philosopher's Toolkit: A compendium of philosophical concepts and methods''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;
*Second, skeptics object to the use of transcendental arguments to draw conclusions about the nature of the world by claiming that even if a person ''does'' know the nature of his or her experiences, the person cannot know that the reasoning from these experiences to conclusions about the world is accurate.&lt;ref name=toolkit/&gt;
*Lastly, critics have debated whether showing that we must think of the world in a certain way, given certain features of experience, is tantamount to showing that the world answers to that conception. Perhaps transcendental arguments show only necessities of our cognitive apparatus rather than realities of the world apart from us. This objection may amount to throwing doubt on whether transcendental arguments are ever more than merely "regressive".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]], "Transcendental Arguments" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Epistemology'', Jonathan Dancy and Ernest Sosa, eds (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992) .&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9635">'''Transcendental perspectivism''' is a hybrid philosophy developed by German-born philosopher, [[Werner Krieglstein]].  A blending of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[perspectivism]] and the [[utopian]] ideals of the [[transcendental philosophy|transcendentalism]] movement, transcendental perspectivism challenges Nietzsche's claim that there are no absolute truths while fully accepting his observation that all truth can only be known in the context of one's own perception.  This is accomplished through an appreciation of the emotional relationship between two perceptions (the "perceiver" and the "other").

== Background ==
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that no purely objective science can exist because no ideation or thought can exist outside the influences of an individual perception.  The [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] of any single [[perception]] is limited not only by the physics of its existence, but also by its own assumptions and beliefs which are formed by the perceiver's unique culture and history.  A conclusion of this philosophy is that no absolute (or transcendental) truth can exist because in order to be a transcendental truth it would need to transcend the limits of perception.

== Relationship to the Other ==
For any given truth, a perceiver must realize it.  In any given relationship, that truth can be shared with another perceiver (the ''other''). In the traditional sense of objective reality, a transcendental truth known by one perceiver would be equally valid for the ''other'', because it transcends each of their unique perceptions.  This relationship is unequal in that the transcendental truth is right and the ''other'' is wrong.  Knowers of a transcendental truth are then provided with unique authority over the ''other'' which does not know the same truth.

In Perspectivism, the absence of any transcendental truth leaves the perceiver with truth that is only valid from the perceiver's own perspective.  Truth becomes arbitrary and the ''other'' becomes a pawn in the formulations of the perceiver's self-perceived truths.  This led Nietzsche to ponder the justification of things like authoritarianism that conflict with the moral positions of many philosophers.

Transcendental perspectivism argues that each truth is the product of the perceiver; however, if two perceivers share a truth, then that truth transcends each individual perceiver.  This is achieved not by one perceiver convincing the ''other'' about the validity of a held truth, but rather by the union of two truths held by each perceiver.  The ''other's'' perception plays an equal role in the development of a transcendental truth. A key artifact of transcendental perspectivism is that the transcendence of a truth can not be achieved through force.  That is, if a truth held by a perceiver is forced on the ''other'', then that truth has not transcended both perceptions.  Domination of the ''other'' has only produced subjugation, and can not produce acceptance of a shared truth because the perspective of the ''other'' was not involved in the development of the truth and thus the truth is not true for the ''other''. In order to avoid domination and to truly develop a transcendental truth, the perceiver must experience empathy and compassion for the perception of the ''other''.

A logic formula developed by Krieglstein's son for this process reads as such:

&lt;math&gt; X_{p} + X_{o^{N}}+ E = X_{po^{N}}&lt;/math&gt;

In that, &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a given phenomenon, &lt;math&gt; X_{p} &lt;/math&gt; is the perceiver's perspective of that phenomenon, &lt;math&gt;X_{o^{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is one or more other people's perception of that phenomenon, and &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is an error term.  The result is &lt;math&gt; X_{po^{N}}&lt;/math&gt; which is a truth about the given phenomenon that is shared by the perceiver and the other, but transcends the limited perception of either to become a transcendental truth. It is important to note that &lt;math&gt; X_{po^{N}}&lt;/math&gt;is not necessarily just the sum total of two perspectives, but rather a new and unique truth that is only achieved through sharing.

== Current relevance ==

Transcendental perspectivism's call for compassion of the ''other'' has gained it widespread acceptance in the partnership field founded by [[Riane Eisler]].  The philosophy's unique perspective on the role consciousness plays in the development of physical truths has gained it some recognition in the field of consciousness research.  To help focus the practical acceptance of transcendental perspectivism, Krieglstein wrote a manifesto containing 11 key facets of the philosophy.

1. Transcendental perspectivism recognizes truth as experiential and personal, but not as objective and universal. Therefore, all religious beliefs including agnosticism and atheism are respected equally, as long as they do not impose their values on others.

2. Transcendental perspectivism prefers diversity and difference over singularity. These are assumed to be more natural and beneficial in evolutionary terms.

3. Transcendental perspectivism rejects domination in all its forms. It especially rejects domination of men over women. For this reason Transcendental Perspectivism embraces a reevaluation of the philosophical canon from a feminist perspective.

4. Transcendental perspectivism aims for cooperation and connectedness over competition and survival of the fittest. This, too, is seen to be more natural and adaptive.

5. Transcendental perspectivism assumes that there is a unique perspective, an inside-out view for everything that exists, including Nothingness. This puts consciousness at the center.

6. Central to transcendental perspectivism is the search for the Other. Since all is consciousness we can communicate with all. This makes transcendental perspectivism a shamanistic philosophy.

7. Transcendental perspectivism assumes a holistic view of the human body. Mind and body are one. Healing the body can never be seen in isolation and vice versa, a sickness of the mind affects the body.

8. As a shamanistic philosophy transcendental perspectivism provides the basis for a reanimation of the natural (material or inanimate) world. This will not result in a new superstition, but will be complemented by mathematical structure and empirical verification.

9. Transcendental perspectivism bridges the gap between the sciences and the humanities. It reunites the various fields of the cognitive enterprise of humanity by providing a new and in depth understanding of the physical world on which all human knowledge is based.

10. By providing a full and in-depth understanding of the physical nature of the human being transcendental perspectivism initiates a renaissance of the body. It invites a physical celebration of the human being within a physical world. This reevaluation of the human body will lead to a third enlightenment, the Enlightenment of the Body.

11. By reconnecting humanity with the rest of the physical world transcendental perspectivism will initiate a new spirituality. This has been called a cosmic spiritually. It is cosmic consciousness because these new individuals will be fully aware of being members of a larger whole, as they themselves are the composite symphony of numerous smaller wholes.

In the [[Pāli Canon]]'s ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first four [[nikāya]]s, ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' is one of three overlapping Pali terms used to refer to the mind, the others being ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]'' and ''[[citta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/vijnana-449563|title=What is Vijnana in Buddhism?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ag-70|title=Question: What is the difference between jnana and vijnana? {{!}} Sri Chinmoy Library|website=www.srichinmoylibrary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/alaya-vijnana-the-storehouse-consciousness-449659|title=Alaya-vijnana: The Storehouse Consciousness, Source of All Experience|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each is used in the generic and non-technical sense of "mind" in general, but the three are sometimes used in sequence to refer to one's mental processes as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Identity and Experience.''

==Buddhism==
This section considers the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept primarily in terms of [[Early Buddhism]]'s [[Pali literature]] as well as in the literature of other [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]].

===Pali literature===
Throughout Pali literature, ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''&lt;ref name=Pali_use /&gt; can be found as one of a handful of synonyms for the mental force that animates the otherwise inert material body.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), entry for "Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a," states: 
:"In what may be a very old Sutta [[Samyutta Nikaya|S]] ii.95 [viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a] is given as a synonym of citta (q. v.) and mano (q. v.), in opposition to kāya used to mean body. This simpler unecclesiastical, unscholastic popular meaning is met with in other [[Sūtra|sutta]]s. E. g. the body (kāya) is when animated called '''sa-viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}aka''' [with consciousness]...."
Bodhi (2000b), pp. 769-70, n. 154, also mentions this generalized use of ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' in the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] and [[atthakatha|commentaries]] (cf. "[[#Overlapping_Pali_terms_for_mind|Overlapping Pali terms for mind]]" section below).&lt;/ref&gt;
In a number of Pali texts though, the term has a more nuanced and context-specific (or "technical") meaning.  In particular, in the [[Pali Canon]]'s "Discourse Basket" (''[[Suttapitaka]]''), ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' (generally translated as "consciousness") is discussed in at least three related but different contexts:&lt;br&gt;
:(1) as a derivative of the sense bases (''[[āyatana]]''), part of the experientially exhaustive "All" (''sabba'');
:(2) as one of the five aggregates (''[[Skandha|khandha]]'') of clinging (''[[upadana]]'') at the root of suffering (''[[dukkha]]''); and,
:(3) as one of the twelve causes (''[[Twelve Nidanas|nidana]]'') of "Dependent Origination" (''[[Pratitya-samutpada|paticcasamuppāda]]'') which provides a template for Buddhist notions of [[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and release.&lt;ref name=PED/&gt;
In the Pali Canon's [[Abhidhamma]] and in post-canonical [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]], consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is further analyzed into 89 different states which are categorized in accordance with their kammic results.
{{Chachakka|figno=1}}
{{PancaKhandha|figno=2}}

====Sense-base derivative====
In Buddhism, the [[Sadayatana|six sense bases]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|saḷāyatana}}''; Skt.: ''{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}'') refer to the five physical sense organs (cf. [[receptive field]]) (belonging to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body), the mind (referred to as the sixth sense base) and their associated objects (visual forms, sounds, odors, flavors, touch and mental objects).  Based on the six sense bases, a number of mental factors arise including six "types" or "classes" of consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a-kāyā'').  More specifically, according to this analysis, the six types of consciousness are eye-consciousness (that is, consciousness based on the eye), ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mind-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html (Thanissaro, 1998).]  In this framework, the Pali word translated as "consciousness" is ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' and the word translated as "mind" is ''mano''.  Thus, the faculty of awareness of the mind (the base of, e.g., abstractions sythesized from physical sensory experience) is referred to as ''mano-viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' ("mind-consciousness").&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, for instance, when an ear's receptive field (the [[proximal stimulus]], more commonly known by Buddhists as a sense base, or sense organ) and sound (the [[distal stimulus]], or sense object) are present, the associated (ear-related consciousness) arises.  The arising of these three elements (''dhātu'') &amp;ndash; e.g. ear, sound and ear-consciousness &amp;ndash; lead to the [[percept]], known as "[[phassa|contact]]" and in turn causes a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral "[[vedana|feeling]]" to arise.  It is from such feeling that "[[tanha|craving]]" arises.  (See Fig. 1.)

In a discourse entitled, "The All" (''Sabba Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.23), the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] states that there is no "all" outside of the six pairs of sense bases (that is, six internal and six external sense bases).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1140; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html  Thanissaro (2001c).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215645/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html |date=March 3, 2016 }} According to Bodhi (2000b), p. 1399, ''n''. 7, the Pali commentary regarding the ''Sabba Sutta'' states: "...[I]f one passes over the twelve sense bases, one cannot point out any real phenomenon."  Also see [https://archive.is/20120707171513/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3261.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 680, "Sabba" entry] where ''{{IAST|sabbaŋ}}'' is defined as "the (whole) world of sense-experience." References to the "All" (''sabba'') can be found in a number of subsequent discourses including [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.24, 35.25, 35.26, 35.27 and 35.29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "To Be Abandoned Discourse" (''Pahanaya Sutta'', SN 35.24) further expands the All to include first five aforementioned sextets (internal sense bases, external sense bases, consciousness, contact and feeling).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1140; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.024.than.html Thanissaro (2001b).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508030327/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.024.than.html |date=May 8, 2016 }}  These five sextets are implicitly referenced as the bases for clinging (''[[upādāna]]'') and [[fetters (Buddhism)|fetters]] in other discourses such as "Advice to Anāthapi{{IAST|ṇḍ}}ika Discourse" (''Anāthapi{{IAST|ṇḍ}}ikavāda Sutta'' [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 143; Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi, 2001, pp. 1109-13) and the "Great Discourse on the Sixfold Base" (''Mahāsa{{IAST|ḷ}}āyatanika Sutta'' [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 149; Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi, 2001, pp. 1137-39).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the "Six Sextets" discourse (''Chachakka Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148), a further expansion can be seen where the "six sextets" (''cha-chakka'') include the five aforementioned sextets plus feeling-dependent craving (''[[taṇhā|ta{{IAST|ṇ}}hā]]''). (For MN 148, see Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 1129-36; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html Thanissaro (1998).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421005716/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html |date=April 21, 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; In the famed "[[Fire Sermon]]" (''Ādittapariyāya Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.28) the Buddha declares that "the All is aflame" with passion, aversion, delusion and suffering (''[[dukkha]]''); to obtain release from this suffering, one should become disenchanted with the All.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.028.than.html Thanissaro (1993).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421022933/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.028.than.html |date=April 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, in this context, ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' includes the following characteristics:
* ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' arises as a result of the material sense bases (''[[āyatana]]'')&lt;ref&gt;This, for instance, can be juxtaposed with an [[Idealism|Idealist]] epistemology where the material world arises from consciousness (Bodhi, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
* there are six types of consciousness, each unique to one of the internal sense organs
* consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is separate (and arises) from mind (''mano'')
* here, consciousness cognizes or is aware of its specific sense base (including the mind and mind objects)
* ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' is a prerequisite for the arising of craving (''ta{{IAST|ṇ}}hā'')
* hence, for the vanquishing of suffering (''dukkha''), one should neither identify with nor attach to ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''

====The aggregates====
In Buddhism, consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is one of the five classically defined experiential "[[skandha|aggregates]]" (Pali: ''khandha''; Skt.: ''skandha''). As illustrated (Fig. 2), the four other aggregates are material "form" (''[[rupa (Buddhism)|rupa]]''), "feeling" or "sensation" (''[[vedana]]''), "perception" (''[[saṃjñā|sanna]]''), and "volitional formations" or "fabrications" (''[[sankhara]]'').

In [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.79, the Buddha distinguishes consciousness in the following manner:
:"And why do you call it 'consciousness'? Because it cognizes, thus it is called consciousness. What does it cognize? It cognizes what is sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, alkaline, non-alkaline, salty, &amp; unsalty. Because it cognizes, it is called consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;''Khajjaniya Sutta'' ("Chewed Up," [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.29) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.079.than.html (Thanissaro, 2001a).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230225/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.079.than.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This type of awareness appears to be more refined and introspective than that associated with the aggregate of perception (''saññā'') which the Buddha describes in the same discourse as follows:
:"And why do you call it 'perception'? Because it perceives, thus it is called 'perception.' What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives yellow, it perceives red, it perceives white. Because it perceives, it is called perception."&lt;ref&gt;''Khajjaniya Sutta'' ("Chewed Up," [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.29) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.079.than.html (Thanissaro, 2001a).] Regarding SN 22.79's typifying perception (saññā) through visual colors and consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') through assorted tastes, Bodhi (2000b, p. 1072, n. 114) mentions that the Samyutta Nikaya's subcommentary states that perception grasps appearances and shapes while consciousness "can grasp particular distinctions in an object even when there is no appearance and shape."&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, in the traditionally venerated 5th-century CE commentary, the [[Visuddhimagga]], there is an extended analogy about a child, an adult villager and an expert "money-changer" seeing a heap of coins; the child's experience is likened to perception, the villager's experience to consciousness, and the money-changer's experience to true understanding (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|paňňā]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Buddhaghosa]] (1999), pp. 435-6)&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, in this context, "consciousness" denotes more than the irreducible subjective experience of sense data suggested in the discourses of "the All" (see prior section); it additionally entails a depth of awareness reflecting a degree of memory and recognition.

All of the aggregates are to be seen as [[anatta|empty of self-nature]]; that is, they arise dependent on causes (''hetu'') and conditions (''paticca''). In this scheme, the cause for the arising of consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is the arising of one of the other aggregates (physical or mental); and the arising of consciousness in turn gives rise to one or more of the mental (''nāma'') aggregates.  In this way, the chain of causation identified in the aggregate (''khandha'') model overlaps the chain of conditioning in the Dependent Origination (''[[Pratitya-samutpada|paticcasamuppāda]]'') model.&lt;ref&gt;This overlap is particularly pronounced in the ''Mahanidana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15) where consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is a condition of name-and-body (''nāmarūpa'') and ''vice versa'' (see, e.g., Thanissaro, 1997a).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dependent origination====
Consciousness (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') is the third of the traditionally enumerated [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes]] (''nidāna'') of [[Pratitya-samutpada|Dependent Origination]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|paṭiccasamuppāda}}''; Skt.: ''pratītyasamutpāda'').&lt;ref&gt;Not all canonical texts identify twelve causes in Dependent Origination's causal chain.  For instance, the ''Mahanidana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997a)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421133205/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html |date=April 21, 2016 }} identifies only nine causes (omitting the six sense bases, formations and ignorance) and the initial text of the ''Nalakalapiyo Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.67) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html (Thanissaro, 2000)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=May 3, 2016 }} twice identifies ten causes (omitting formations and ignorance) although its final enumeration includes the twelve traditional factors.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the context of Dependent Origination, different canonical discourses represent different aspects of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, similar to the sensory-specific description of consciousness found in discussing "the All" (above), the "Analysis of Dependent Origination Discourse" (''Paticcasamuppada-vibhanga Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.2) describes ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' ("consciousness") in the following manner:
:"And what is ''consciousness''? These six are classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, intellect-consciousness. This is called consciousness." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997b)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504215121/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html |date=May 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following aspects are traditionally highlighted:
:* consciousness is conditioned by mental fabrications (''{{IAST|[[sankhara|saṅkhāra]]}}'');
:* consciousness and the mind-body (''[[namarupa|nāmarūpa]]'') are interdependent; and,
:* consciousness acts as a "life force" by which there is a continuity across rebirths.

=====Mental-fabrication conditioning and kamma=====
Numerous discourses state:

:"From fabrications [''{{IAST|[[sankhara|saṅkhāra]]}}''] as a requisite condition comes consciousness [''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'']."&lt;ref name=SN12_2&gt;For instance, see the ''Paticcasamuppada-vibhanga Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.2) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997b).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504215121/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html |date=May 4, 2016 }}  Square-bracketed Pali terms were added.  Also see various other discourses in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]'s chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In three discourses in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]], the Buddha highlights three particular manifestations of ''{{IAST|saṅkhāra}}'' as particularly creating a "basis for the maintenance of consciousness" (''{{IAST|ārammaṇaṃ ... viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā}}'') that could lead to future existence,&lt;ref&gt;''punabbhavābhinibbatti'' ("for again becoming reborn"), mentioned in "Volition (1) Discourse" (Bodhi, 2000b, p. 576)&lt;/ref&gt; to the perpetuation of bodily and mental processes,&lt;ref&gt;''nāmarūpassa avakkanti'' ("for entry of name-and-form"), mentioned in "Volition (2) Discourse" (Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 576-77).&lt;/ref&gt; and to craving&lt;ref&gt;''Nati'' (literally, "bending" or "inclination"), which the Samyutta Nikaya commentary states is synonymous with "[[tanha|craving]], called 'inclination' in the sense of inclining ... towards pleasant forms, etc.," mentioned in "Volition (3) Discourse" and its end notes (Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 577, 761 ''n''. 116).&lt;/ref&gt; and its resultant suffering.  As stated in the common text below (in English and Pali), these three manifestations are intending, planning and enactments of latent tendencies ("obsessing")&lt;ref&gt;''ca ceteti ca pakappeti ca anuseti'': Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25) translate this as "to intend, to start to perform, to carry out" (pp.&amp;nbsp;268–69, entry for "Cinteti &amp; ceteti" (retrieved 2007-11-21 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:1497.pali){{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; Bodhi (2000b) translates this as "intends ... plans ... has a tendency towards" (pp.&amp;nbsp;576–77); and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.038.than.html Thanissaro (1995)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504215333/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.038.than.html |date=May 4, 2016 }} translates it as "intends ... arranges ... obsesses about." Thanissaro (1995), ''n''. 1, further elaborates:
:"The seven obsessions are: the obsession of sensual passion, the obsession of resistance, the obsession of views, the obsession of uncertainty, the obsession of conceit, the obsession of passion for becoming, and the obsession of ignorance. See [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 7.12."&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Thus, for instance, in the "Intention Discourse" (''Cetanā Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.38), the Buddha more fully elaborates:
:[[Bhikkhu]]s, what one intends, and what one plans, and whatever one has a tendency towards: this becomes a basis for the maintenance of consciousness. When there is a basis there is a support for the establishing of consciousness.  When consciousness is established and has come to growth, there is the production of future renewed [[bhava|existence]].  When there is the production of future renewed existence, future [[jati (Buddhism)|birth]], [[jaramarana|aging-and-death]], sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be.  Such is the origin of this whole mass of [[dukkha|suffering]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 576. Also see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.038.than.html Thanissaro (1995).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the post-canonical Samyutta Nikaya [[atthakatha|commentary]] and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary]] further affirm that this text is discussing the means by which "kammic consciousness" "yield[s] fruit in one's mental continuum."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 757-9 ''n''. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, certain intentional or obsessive acts on one's part inherently establish in present consciousness a basis for future consciousness's existence; in this way, the future existence is conditioned by certain aspects of the initial intention, including its wholesome and unwholesome qualities.

Conversely, in the "Attached Discourse" (''Upaya Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.53), it states that if passion for the five [[skandha|aggregates]] (forms and mental processes) are abandoned then:
:"... owing to the abandonment of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no base for consciousness. Consciousness, thus unestablished, not proliferating, not performing any function, is released. Owing to its release, it is steady. Owing to its steadiness, it is contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated. Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within. He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.053.than.html Thanissaro (1997c).]  Parenthetical phrase "(the monk)" is in the original translation.  Also see Bodhi (2000b), pp. 890-91.  Note that "unbound" is Thanissaro's translation of "nibbāna" (Pali; Sanskrit: [[nirvana]]); thus, Bodhi (2000b), p. 891, provides the alternate translation of "Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna."&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mind-body interdependency=====
Numerous discourses state:
:"From consciousness [''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''] as a requisite condition comes name-form [''[[namarupa|nāmarūpa]]'']."&lt;ref name=SN12_2/&gt;
In addition, a few discourses state that, simultaneously, the converse is true:
:"Consciousness comes from name-form as its requisite condition."&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997a)], and [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.67 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html (Thanissaro, 2000)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As indicated in the immediately preceding section, "fabrications" (also known as "formations" or "mental formations" or "volitional formations") — as opposed to "name-form" — are more often identified as the requisite conditions for consciousness.  These two different statements are not however contradictory insomuch that, as indicated by the [[skandha|Five Aggregates]] model, name-form includes mental fabrications (see the "Five Aggregates" diagram above).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Sheaves of Reeds Discourse" (''Nalakalapiyo Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.67), Ven. [[Sariputta]] uses this famous analogy to explain the interdependency of consciousness and name-form:
:"It is as if two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another. In the same way, from name-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness, from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-form....
:"If one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds, the other would fall; if one were to pull away the other, the first one would fall. In the same way, from the cessation of name-form comes the cessation of consciousness, from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-form...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Thanissaro (2000).]&lt;/ref&gt;

====="Life force" aspect and rebirth=====

As described above in the discussion of mental fabrications' conditioning of consciousness, past intentional actions establish a [[Karma in Buddhism|kammic]] seed within consciousness that expresses itself in the future.  Through consciousness's "life force" aspect, these future expressions are not only within a single lifespan but propel kammic impulses (''kammavega'') across [[samsara|samsaric]] [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]s.

In the "Serene Faith Discourse" (''Sampasadaniya Sutta'', [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 28), Ven. [[Sariputta]] references not a singular conscious entity but a "stream of consciousness" (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a-sota'') that spans multiple lives:
:"... [U]nsurpassed is the Blessed Lord's way of teaching [[Dhamma]] in regard to the attainment of vision....  Here, some ascetic or Brahmin, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, vigilence and due attention, reaches such a level of concentration that he ... comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness as established both in this world and in the next...."&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1995), pp. 419-20, para. 7.  In an end note on p. 606, ''n''. 865, Walshe states that ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a-sota'' is "a rare expression which seems to equate with ''[[bhavanga]]'', the (mainly) [[atthakatha|commentarial]] term for the 'life-continuum' (Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli)."  The error of attributing to the Buddha a teaching that consciousness across life spans is a ''singular'' entity is the mistake made by a bhikkhu named Sati who is publicly upbraided for this misconstrual by the Buddha in the "Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving" (''Mahatanhasankhya Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 38; trans. Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi, 2001, pp. 349-61).  Note that the phrase "steam of consciousness" here refers to successive, interdependent conscious ''states'' as opposed to Western psychology's use of "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]" to refer to successive, interdependent conscious ''thoughts''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Great Causes Discourse" (''Mahanidana Sutta'', [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15), in a dialogue between the Buddha and the Ven. [[Ananda]], describes "consciousness" (''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') in a way that underlines its "life force" aspect:&lt;ref name=PED/&gt;
:"'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form. If consciousness were not to descend into the mother's womb, would name-and-form take shape in the womb?"

:"No, lord."

:"If, after descending into the womb, consciousness were to depart, would name-and-form be produced for this world?"

:"No, lord."

:"If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off, would name-and-form ripen, grow, and reach maturity?"

:"No, lord."

:"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for name-and-form, i.e., consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html Thanissaro (1997a).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourses such as this {{According to whom|appear|date=December 2013}} to describe a consciousness that is an animating phenomenon capable of spanning lives thus giving rise to rebirth.

An [[Anguttara Nikaya]] discourse provides a memorable metaphor to describe the interplay of kamma, consciousness, craving and rebirth:

:[Ananda:] "One speaks, Lord, of 'becoming, becoming'. How does becoming tak[e] place?"
:[Buddha:] "... Ānanda, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed and craving the moisture for consciousness of beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving to become established in [one of the [[Tiloka|"three worlds"]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Thus, there is re-becoming in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.76 (Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi, 1999, p. 69.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abhidhammic analysis====
The [[Patthana]], part of the [[Theravada|Theravadin]] [[Abhidharma]], analyzes the different states of consciousness and their functions. The Theravāda school method is to study every state of consciousness. Using this method, some states of consciousness are identified as positive, some negative and some neutral. This analysis is based on the principle of [[karma]], the main point in understanding the different consciousness.  All together according to the Abhidhamma, there are 89 kinds of consciousness, 54 are of the "sense sphere" (related to the five physical senses as well as craving for sensual pleasure), 15 of the "fine-material sphere" (related to the meditative absorptions based on material objects), 12 of the "immaterial sphere" (related to the immaterial meditative absorptions), and eight are supramundane (related to the realization of [[Nirvana|Nibbāna]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000a), pp. 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, a ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' is a single moment of conceptual consciousness and normal mental activity is considered to consist of a continual succession of ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''s.

''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'' has two components: the awareness itself, and the object of that awareness (which might be a perception, a feeling etc.). Thus, in this way, these ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''s are not considered as ultimate (underived) phenomena as they are based on mental factors (''cetasika''). For example, [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhānic]] (meditative) states are described as based on the five ultimate mental factors of applied thought (''[[vitakka]]''), sustained thought (''[[vicara]]''), rapture (''[[Pīti|piti]]''), serenity (''[[sukha]]'') and one-pointedness (''[[ekaggata|ekaggatā]]'').{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

====Overlapping Pali terms for mind====
According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the post-canonical Pali [[atthakatha|commentary]] uses the three terms ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'', ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|mano]]'' and ''[[citta]]'' as synonyms for the mind sense base (''mana-[[ayatana]]''); however, in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], these three terms are generally contextualized differently:
* '''''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''''' refers to awareness through a specific internal sense base, that is, through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind.  Thus, there are six sense-specific types of ''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''.  It is also the basis for personal continuity within and across lives.
* '''''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]''''' refers to mental "actions" (''kamma''),  as opposed to those actions that are physical or verbal.  It is also the sixth internal sense base (''[[ayatana]]''), that is, the "mind base," cognizing  mental sensa (''dhammā'') as well as sensory information from the physical sense bases.
* '''''[[Citta]]''''' includes the formation of thought, emotion and volition; this is thus the subject of Buddhist mental development (''[[Buddhist meditation|bhava]]''), the mechanism for release.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 769-70, ''n''. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The citta is called "[[Luminous mind|luminous]]" in [[Anguttara Nikaya|A]].I.8-10.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Across Buddhist schools===
While most Buddhist schools identify six modes of consciousness, one for each [[ayatana|sense base]], some Buddhist schools have identified additional modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/LunCong/023/383-434.htm |title=心識論與唯識說的發展 |access-date=2010-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130085803/http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/LunCong/023/383-434.htm |archive-date=2009-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Six vijñānas====
As described above, in reference to the "All" (''sabba''), the [[Sutta Pitaka]] identifies six vijñānas related to the six sense bases: 
# Eye consciousness
# Ear consciousness
# Nose consciousness
# Tongue consciousness
# Body consciousness
# Mind consciousness describe the consciousness of "ideas" - Buddhism describes not five but six perceptions.

====Eight vijñānas====
{{main|Eight Consciousnesses}}
The [[Yogacara]] / [[Cittamatra]] school consider two more consciousnesses. 
# a consciousness called klistamanas, which gathers the hindrances, the poisons, the karmic formations.
# the ālāyavijñāna is the consciousness "basis of everything" and has been translated as "store consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Nhat Hanh (2001), pp. 1 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Every consciousness is based on this one. It is the phenomenon which explains the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].

According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the "store consciousness" of Yogacara thought exists in the early texts as well, as the "citta."&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amalavijñāna====
The [[:fr:Amalavijñāna|amalavijñāna]] ([[:ja:阿摩羅識|阿摩羅識]]), "immaculate consciousness", is considered by some Yogācāra schools as a ninth level of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism (amalavijñāna)|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=33|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "pure consciousness is identified with the  nature of reality (parinispanna) or Suchness."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Diana (1981). The Structure of Consciousness in Paramārtha's Purported Trilogy, Philosophy East and West, 31/3, 310&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, amalavijñāna may be considered the pure aspect of ālāyavijñāna.

Some buddhists also suggest [[Heart Sutra#Title|hrdaya]] (Heart) consciousnesses (一切一心識), or an eleven consciousnesses theory or an infinity consciousness ([[:zh:无量识|無量識]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:s:佛學大辭典/九識]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wiki.fjdh.com/index.php?doc-view-17132.html |title=识-法相词典- 佛教百科 佛教百科 |access-date=2010-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711004917/http://wiki.fjdh.com/index.php?doc-view-17132.html |archive-date=2011-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary usages===
''Viññāna'' is used in [[Thai Buddhism]] to refer specifically to one's consciousness or life-force after it has left the body at the moment of death.  Thais differentiate between winyaan and "jid-jai" (จิตใจ), which is the consciousness while it is still connected to a living body.  Even though the jid-jai leaves the body while you dream at night and can also externalize during advanced meditation practice, it is still connected to the body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Hinduism==
Sri [[Ramakrishna]] defines ''vijñāna'' as

:"He alone who, after reaching the Nitya, the Absolute, can dwell in the [[L&amp;#299;l&amp;#x101;]], the :Relative, and again climb from the L&amp;#299;l&amp;#x101; to the Nitya, has ripe knowledge and :devotion. Sages like [[Narada]] cherished love of God after attaining the Knowledge of :Brahman. This is called vijn&amp;#x101;na."  Also:  "What is vijnana? It is to know God distinctly by realizing His existence through an intuitive experience and to speak to Him intimately."&lt;ref&gt;Swami Nikhilananda (1985), ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'' (Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center), p. 523 &amp; 1225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on ancient texts, V.S.Apte (1890, rev. 1957-59) provides the following definition for ''vijñānam'' (विज्ञानम्):
# Knowledge, wisdom, intelligence, understanding; यज्जीव्यते क्षणमपि प्रथितं मनुष्यैर्विज्ञानशौर्यविभवार्यगुणैः समेतम्। तन्नाम जीवितमिह ... [[Panchatantra]] (Pt.) 1.24;5.3; विज्ञानमयः कोशः 'the sheath of intelligence' (the first of the five sheaths of the soul).
# Discrimination, discernment.
# Skill, proficiency; प्रयोगविज्ञानम् - [[Shringara Tilaka]] (Ś.) 1.2.
# Worldly or profane knowledge, knowledge derived from worldly experience (opp. ज्ञान which is 'knowledge of Brahma or Supreme Spirit'); ज्ञानं ते$हं सविज्ञानमिदं वक्ष्याम्यशेषत - [[Bhagavad Gita]] (Bg.) 7.2;3.41;6.8; (the whole of the 7th Adhyāya of Bg. explains ज्ञान and विज्ञान).
# Business, employment.
# Music.
# Knowledge of the fourteen lores.
# The organ of knowledge; पञ्चविज्ञानचेतने (शरीरे) - [[Mahabharata]] (Mb.) 12.187. 12.
# Knowledge beyond the cognisance of the senses (अतीन्द्रियविषय)&lt;ref&gt;See Apte (1957-59), p. 1434. Retrieved 1 Feb. 2011 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.5:1:2152.apte .&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Monier Williams]] (1899; rev. 2008) provides the following definition:
# to distinguish, discern, observe, investigate, recognize ascertain, know, understand - [[Rig Veda]] (RV.), etc., etc. (with ''na'' and inf.: 'to know not how to');
# to have right knowledge - [[Katha Upanishad]] (KaṭhUp.)
# to become wise or learned - Mn. iv, 20;
# to hear or learn from (gen.) - [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (ChUp.); [[Mahabharata]] (MBh.);
# to recognize in (loc.) - [[Panchatantra]] (Pañcat.);
# to look upon or regard or consider as (two acc.), Mn.; MBh., etc.; Kāv., etc.;
# to explain, declare - BhP.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1899; rev. 2008), p. 961.  Retrieved 1 Feb. 2011 from U.Cologne at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0961-vijRmbhin.jpg .&lt;/ref&gt;

===''States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity'' (1995)===
In this work Brown asks how a sense of woundedness can become the basis for individual and collective forms of identity. From outlawing hate speech to banning pornography, Brown argues, well-intentioned attempts at protection can legitimize the state while harming subjects by codifying their identities as helpless or in need of continuous governmental regulation. While breaking ground in political theory, this work also represents one of Brown's key interventions in feminist and queer theory. The book offers a novel account of legal and political power as constitutive of norms of sexuality and gender. Through the concept of "wounded attachments", Brown contends that psychic injury may accompany and sustain racial, ethnic, and gender categories, particularly in relation to state law and discursive formations. In this and other works Brown has criticized representatives of second wave feminism, such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]], for reinscribing the category of "woman" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acc.english.ucsb.edu/ACGCC%2014-15/Brown_The%20Impossibility%20of%20Women%27s%20Studies.pdf|title=The Impossibility of Women's Studies|website=acc.english.ucsb.edu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5715.html|title=States of Injury book description|website=Press.princeton.edu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}} Prior to ''States of Injury'', Brown addressed ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' (1989) in ''[[The Nation]]'', characterizing it as a "profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility" as well as "flatly dated" and "developed at 'the dawn of feminism's second wave ... framed by a political-intellectual context that no longer exists -- a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse'". See Wendy Brown, "Consciousness Razing", ''[[The Nation]]'', January 8/15, 1990, pp. 61–64. for reinscribing the category of "woman" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Politics Out of History'' (2001) ===
This book comprises a series of essays on contemporary political issues from the problem of moralism in politics to the legacies of past injustices in the present. Throughout her thematically overlapping chapters, Brown asks: "What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7210.html|title=Politics Out of History|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this book takes history and liberalism themselves as objects of theoretical reflection and sites of contestation. Drawing on a range of thinkers, such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]] and [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], Brown rethinks the disorientation and possibility inherent to contemporary democracy.

===''Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics'' (2005)===
This work consists of seven articles responding to particular occasions, each of which "mimic, in certain ways, the experience of the political realm: one is challenged to think here, now, about a problem that is set and framed by someone else, and to do so before a particular audience or in dialogue with others not of one's own choosing." Each individual essay begins with a specific problem: what is the relationship between love, loyalty, and dissent in contemporary American political life?; how did neoliberal rationality become a form of governmentality?; what are the main problems of women's studies programs?; and so on. According to Brown, the essays do not aim to definitively answer the given questions but "to critically interrogate the framing and naming practices, challenge the dogmas (including those of the Left and of feminism), and discern the constitutive powers shaping the problem at hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8079.html|title=Wendy Brown, Edgework, Princeton University Press|website=Press.princeton.edu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire'' (2006)===
In this book, Brown subverts the usual and widely accepted notion that [[Toleration|tolerance]] is one of the most remarkable achievements of Western modernity. She suggests that tolerance (or toleration) cannot be perceived as the complete opposite to violence. At times, it can also be used to justify violence. Brown argues that tolerance primarily operates as a discourse of subject construction and a mode of governmentality that addresses or confirms asymmetric relations between different groups, each of which must then "tolerate" other groups and categories or "be tolerated" by the dominant groups and categories.

To substantiate her thesis, Brown examines the tolerance discourse of figures like [[George W. Bush]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Susan Okin]], [[Michael Ignatieff]], [[Bernard Lewis]], and [[Seyla Benhabib]] and argues that "tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant, it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers protection or incorporation to the less powerful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8306.html|title=Regulating Aversion|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those influenced by Brown's thinking on this subject are [[Joan Wallach Scott]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|date=2008-04-01|title=Tolerance as an Ideological Category|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/592539|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=34|issue=4|pages=660–682|doi=10.1086/592539|issn=0093-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose respective works ''The Politics of the Veil'' (2007) and ''Violence: Six Sideways Reflections'' (2007) draw heavily on Brown's account of tolerance discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YD74-yqAp-cC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=joan+wallach+scott+politics+of+the+veil+wendy+brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gw58u1KuHR&amp;sig=Llvq6iqdC19pO2Sls2_RMFnR8mE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1vMiMraDVAhWCxFQKHUP3A08Q6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=joan%20wallach%20scott%20politics%20of%20the%20veil%20wendy%20brown&amp;f=false |title=The Politics of the Veil |author=Joan Wallach Scott |page=11 |website=Books.google.com |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&amp;biw=1118&amp;bih=618&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=7277941321159015026 |title=Google Scholar |website=Scholar.google.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a debate with [[Rainer Forst]] at the ICI in Berlin Brown addressed this problematic again,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ici-berlin.org/videos/spannungsuebung-3/ The power of tolerance]'' – Debate between Wendy Brown and Rainer Forst, ICI Berlin, 2008] (July 16, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; later published as a co-authored book, The Power of Tolerance (2014). Here Brown argues against primarily moral or normative approaches to power and discourse, and warns against the dangers of uncritically celebrating the liberal ideal of tolerance, as frequently happens in Western notions of historical, civilizational or moral progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-power-of-tolerance/9780231170185 ''The Power of Tolerance: A Debate''], Columbia.edu (July 16, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Les Habits neufs de la politique mondiale'' (2007)===
Published exclusively in French, ''Les habits neufs de la politique mondiale'' (''The New Clothes of World Politics'') argues that the following political fact is irreversible: liberal democracy, as a global social and historical modality of statecraft, is dying. The two movements delivering such blows, neoliberalism and neoconservatism, feature both resonances and disonances. Brown argues that whilst the former acts as a political rationality, a mode of general regulation of behavior, the latter is both necessary to its survival, and parasitic of its survival. As a form of governmentality that redefines freedom, neoliberalism will moralize politics, limiting its scope; this is the function of neo-conservatism.

===''Walled States, Waning Sovereignty'' (2010)===
This book examines the revival of wall-building under shifting conditions of global capitalism. Brown not only problematizes the assumed functions of walls, such as the prevention of crime, migration, smuggling, and so on. She also argues that walling has taken on new a significance due to its symbolic function in an increasingly globalized and precarious world of financial capital. As individual identity as well as nation-state sovereignty are threatened, walls become objects invested with individual and collective desire. Anxious efforts to shore up national identity are thus projected onto borders as well as new material structures that would appear to secure them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonebooks.org/titles/BROW_WAL.html |title=Zone Books, Wendy Brown's Walled States, Waning Sovereignty|website=Zonebooks.org |accessdate=June 6, 2017}} See also, Timothy Shenk, "[https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/booked-3-what-exactly-is-neoliberalism-wendy-brown-undoing-the-demos Booked #3: What Exactly Is Neoliberalism?]" Dissent Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reprinted with a new preface by the author following the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zonebooks.org/pdf/ZoneBooks2017.pdf |format=PDF |title=Zone Books |date=2017 |website=Zonebooks.org |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's Stealth Revolution'' (2015)===
Brown's study begins by engaging and revising key arguments in [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''The Birth of Biopolitics'' with the aim of analyzing different ways that democracy is being hollowed out by neoliberal rationality.&lt;ref name="sociologicalimagination.org"/&gt; She describes neoliberalism as a thoroughgoing attack on the most foundational ideas and practices of democracy. The individual chapters of the book examine the effects of neoliberalization on higher education, law,&lt;ref name="springer1"/&gt; governance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicseminar.org/2015/08/on-wendy-brown/#.WTZ0JBN97wc|title=On Wendy Brown|website=Publicseminar.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the basic principles of liberal democratic institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-sociology-archives-europeennes-de-sociologie/article/undoing-the-undoing-of-the-demos-brown-wendy-undoing-the-demos-neoliberalisms-stealth-revolution-new-york-zone-books-2015/A50DF30DA9958B43CA3A795F7EEB0B66|title=Review of Wendy Brown: Undoing the Demos|website=Cambridge.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as radical democratic imaginaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/194010-neoliberalism-is-changing-our-world-without-our-even-noticing|title=Undoing the Demos Review in Pop Matters|website=Popmatters.com|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown treats "neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is 'economized' and in a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state) is governed as a firm." To address such threats, Brown argues, democracy must be reinvigorated not only as an object of theoretical inquiry but also as a site of political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonebooks.org/titles/BROW_UND.html |title=Zone Books, Wendy Brown: Undoing the Demos |website=Zonebooks.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Neoliberalism's Frankenstein: Authoritarian Freedom, White Nationalism, and the Weaponization of Moral Values'' ===
Brown is currently researching right nationalism in the US, completing a book provisionally titled ''Neoliberalism's Frankenstein: Authoritarian Freedom, White Nationalism, and the Weaponization of Moral Values''. The book will shift between the frames of neoliberal governmentality, Nietzsche's social analysis and Marcuse's psychoanalysis to explain the production of a society unmoored from moral concerns (hence social justice), obligations to truth (the post-truth moment) and democratic interests (replaced by the self-interest of human capital). Brown draws from [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]] by Nietzsche and Marcuse's [[One-Dimensional Man]], attributing these right energies to a combination of world-historical nihilism and forces of consumer culture in advance industrial society. Nihilism has, Brown argues, largely generated 'neoliberal reason itself, which posits no value apart from that generated by price and speculative markets.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Wendy|date=2018|title=Neoliberalism's Frankenstein: Authoritarian Freedom in Twenty-First Century "Democracies"|url=https://ctjournal.org/index.php/criticaltimes/article/view/12|journal=Critical Times: Interventions in Global Critical Theory|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|page=71|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades, Brown has been active in efforts to resist measures toward the privatization of the [[University of California]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528635|title=The Economist|website=Economist.com|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her capacity as co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, she raised awareness, organized marches, and spoke publicly about the privatization of public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucbfa.org/2011/09/talking-points-in-defense-of-uc-and-public-education|title=In Defense of UC and Public Education|website=Ucbfa.org|accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been critical of the university's decision to cut costs by utilizing lecturers rather than hiring tenure and tenure track professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2011/07/07/academic-council-approves-recommendation-to-utilize-more-lecturers|title=The Daily Californian - Academic Council approves recommendation to utilize more lecturers|website=Dailycal.org|accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, she has voiced concern over the perils of the UC's proposed online education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucbfa.org/2010/10/wendy-brown-on-online-education|title=Wendy Brown on Online Education|date=2010-10-20|website=Ucbfa.org|accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Brown's article on this topic, published in a "Qui Parle" special issue, see {{cite web|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/qui-parle-20-1/?viewby=title|title=Wendy Brown article on Education in Qui Parle: Critical Humanities and Social Sciences|website=Dukeupress.edu|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown has criticized university administration for their response to sexual assault. "I think many faculty feel there are repeat harassers on our faculty who are never charged ... Graduate students gave up on careers, and these perpetrators were allowed to continue, and that was wrong—never should have happened," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/28/feminist-uc-berkeley-faculty-members-call-for-improved-response-to-sex-harassment|title=Feminist UC Berkeley faculty members call for improved sexual harassment policy|website=Dailycal.org |accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the "99 Mile March" to Sacramento she addressed her criticism to more general trends: "We are marching to draw attention to the plight of public education in California and to implore Californians to re-invest in it. For all its resources, innovation and wealth, California has sunk to nearly the bottom of the nation in per student spending, and our public higher education system, once the envy of the world, is in real peril."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucbfa.org/2012/02/uc-faculty-join-99-mile-march-to-sacramento|title=UC Faculty Join "99 Mile March" to Sacramento|website=Ucbfa.org|accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown supported [[Occupy Wall Street]] as part of the UC faculty council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2011/10/16/uc-faculty-council-endorses-occupy-wall-street|title=UC faculty council endorses Occupy Wall Street &amp;#124; The Daily Californian|date=2011-10-16|website=Dailycal.org|accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "We understand this to be part of what (the movement) stands for. We are delighted by the protests and consider our campaign to be at one with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/384018/summary|title=On the Demos, by Wendy Brown|website=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/459205|title=On Occupy|website=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakzan was additionally a celebrated master of the [[Dances of Universal Peace]] as originated by [[Samuel L. Lewis]] and an acknowledged peer of the Sheikhs of the [http://www.ruhaniat.org/ Sufi Islamia Ruhaniat Society].  Yakzan was a long term resident of Honolulu, Hawaii.  He established Sufi communities in Hawaii, Chile, and Spain.  
  
Yakzan was born in Jujuy, Argentina, and was tutored as a child under the educational curriculum of [[Rudolf Steiner]].  He moved to New York City as a young man where he studied design and [[Ikebana]].  Enamored with the teachings of [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]]-O-[[Murshid]] [[Inayat Khan]] as taught by his son, [[Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan]], Yakzan received multiple initiations culminating in initiation as Sheikh of the Sufi Order.  Yakzan created a series of trainings or “intensives” that distilled the teachings of [[Oscar Ichazo]] of the [[Arica School]] and the principles of [[Gurdjieff]]’s [[Fourth Way]] in combination with the tenets of [[Sufism]] as derived from the work of [[Ibn 'Arabi]], [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]]-O-[[Murshid]] [[Inayat Khan]], [[Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan]], and [[Murshid]] [[Samuel L. Lewis]].  

Yakzan was a charismatic teacher of [[Sufism]], the [http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/ssr/issues/volume3/number2/ssr03-02-e04.html Path of Love].
