'''1 New York Plaza''' is an office building in [[New York City]]'s [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]], built in 1969 at the intersection of [[South Street (Manhattan)|South]] and [[Whitehall Street]]s.  It is the southernmost of all [[Manhattan]] [[skyscrapers]].

The building is 640 feet (195 m) tall with 50 floors. The building was designed by [[William Lescaze]] &amp; Assocs. and [[Kahn &amp; Jacobs]].  The building has 2.556 million square feet of office space.  There is a {{convert|40,000|ft2|m2}} retail concourse on the lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brookfieldofficeproperties.com/us/new-york/one-new-york-plaza |title=One New York Plaza in New York - New York |publisher=Brookfield Office Properties |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facade was designed by Nevio Maggiora, consisting of a boxlike "beehive" pattern with the windows recessed within, made of aluminum-clad wall elements resembling a type of thermally activated elevator button popular at the time of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956992385|title=Europe meets America : William Lescaze, architect of modern housing|author=Gaia Caramellino|year=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:One New York Plaza.jpg|thumb|left|200px|North facade]]

In 1959, the City of New York attempted to acquire the land under this development through [[eminent domain]] as part of the [[Battery Park]] Urban Renewal Area. The plan involved consolidating several blocks into a "[[City block|superblock]]" for [[public housing]]. When that plan fell through, the city hoped to entice the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to relocate to the property. However, the owner of the property—the firm of Atlas McGrath—successfully sued to retain their land, claiming they were more than willing to develop the site privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-architecture.com/LM/LM024-ONENEWYORKPLAZA.htm |title=New York Architecture Images-ONE NEW YORK PLAZA |publisher=Nyc-architecture.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was renovated in 1994, and repainted from a dark black and grey color scheme to a lighter white and light grey.

The building was used in the 2014 film [[The Other Woman (2014 film)|The Other Woman]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== Incidents ===
On August 5, 1970, the building suffered a fire in which two people were killed and 35 injured. The deaths were caused after an occupied elevator was "summoned" to the burning floor when one of the thermally-activated call buttons—designed to react to a warm finger tapping it—reacted instead to the heat of the fire on that floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lipton |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Lipton |last2=Glanz |first2=James |authorlink2=James Glanz |date=2002-04-02 |title=U.S. Report on Trade Center Echoes Lessons of Past Disasters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/02/nyregion/02TOWE.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the building was heavily damaged by [[Hurricane Sandy]].  An estimated 23&amp;nbsp;million gallons of water flooded the lower levels of the building.

{{Politics}}
The term '''administration''', as used in the context of government, differs according to [[jurisdiction]].
==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Government --&gt;

In [[Americans|American]] usage, the term generally refers to the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] under a specific [[President of the United States|president]] (or [[Governor#United States|governor]], [[Mayor#United States|mayor]], or other local executive);  or the term of a particular executive; for example: "President Y's administration" or "Secretary of Defense X during President Y's administration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/administration administration noun – definition in American English Dictionary – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also mean an executive branch agency headed by an administrator, as the [[Small Business Administration]] or the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

The term "administration" has been used to denote the executive branch in [[presidential system]]s of government.

==Europe==
The term's usage in [[Europe]] varies by country, but most typically the word "administration" refers to [[management | managerial functions]] in general, which may include local governments, or the hierarchy of national and local government, that applies to a town or district. More specifically, it may refer to [[public administration]], the business of administering [[Policy|public policy]] as determined by government. However, outside France and Romania, this usage of the word is uncommon.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

For the British sense{{which?|date=January 2018}} of the word, most countries (be they [[English language|English-speaking]] or not) use the term ''government'', referring to the "administration" of [[Winston Churchill]] as the "Churchill government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/government_1 government noun (GROUP) – definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the non-European members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  An older, chiefly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] usage, is the term [[Ministry (collective executive)| "ministry"]], as in "Churchill Ministry", which is still in official and academic use in Britain, Australia and Canada to refer the terms of [[prime ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ministry Ministry – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of government, the word [[coalition]] may be used for a specific government. In the Netherlands, cabinet is the most-used term (as in "the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]]"), although "coalition" or "government" are also used when one does not refer to a specific coalition (note that the two terms have slightly different meanings).

==Biography==
Ananda Krishnan was born in 1938 in [[Brickfields]], Kuala Lumpur to [[Tamil people|Tamil]] parents, who were of [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan]] origin. He studied at Vivekananda Tamil School in Brickfields and furthered his studies at [[Victoria Institution]], Kuala Lumpur. Later, as a [[Colombo Plan]] scholar, he attended the [[University of Melbourne]], Australia for his B.A. (Honours) degree majoring in political science. During that time he boarded in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]. Following that, Krishnan obtained a [[Master of Business Administration|Masters in Business Administration]] from [[Harvard Business School]], graduating in 1964.&lt;ref name=A&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|title= Ananda Krishnan |author=|author2= |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/YK1N.html|publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=26 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518063321/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/YK1N.html| archivedate= 18 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnan has two daughters and a son who is also a [[Theravada]] Buddhist monk known as Ajahn Siripanyo.&lt;ref name="monk flew"&gt;{{cite web|title=The monk who flew in a jet |url=http://www.businessbhutan.bt/?p=3954 |publisher=Business Bhutan |date=1 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720090028/http://businessbhutan.bt/the-monk-who-flew-in-a-jet/ |archivedate=20 July 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ananda Krishnan makes time for son|last=Chow|first=Tan Sin|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2012/04/24/ananda-krishnan-makes-time-for-son/|date=24 April 2012|publisher=The Star |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Krishnan's first entrepreneurial venture was a [[Malaysia]]n consultancy MAI Holdings Sdn Bhd. He set up Exoil Trading, which went on to purchase oil drilling concessions in various countries. Later, he moved into gambling (in Malaysia). In the early part of the 1990s, he started diversifying into the multimedia arena.

Currently, he has business interests in media ([[Astro (television)|Astro]], Johnston Press Plc), satellite ([[MEASAT Satellite Systems|MEASAT]], [[SES S.A.|SES]]), oil and gas (Bumi Armada, Pexco), telecommunications ([[Maxis Communications|Maxis]], [[Aircel]], [[AXIS Telekom Indonesia|Axis]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]]). He owns stakes in [[Tanjong|Tanjong Public Limited Company]], an investment holding company with subsidiaries involved in power generation ([[Powertek]]), gaming (Pan Malaysian Pools), leisure (tropical islands, [[TGV Cinemas]]) and property (67% Maxis Tower etc.).

Krishnan first came to prominence by helping to organise the Live Aid concert with Bob Geldof in the mid-1980s. In the early 1990s, he began building a multimedia empire that now includes two telecommunication companies—[[Maxis Communications]], [[MEASAT Satellite Systems|MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems]] and [[SES World Skies]]—and has three communication satellites circumnavigating the earth.

He effected the purchase of 46% of [[Maxis Communications]], the country's largest cellular phone company, from [[América Móvil]], [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], [[BT Group|British Telecom]], [[Proximus Group|Belgacom]], [[Ooredoo]], [[Orange S.A.]] and [[KPN|Royal KPN N.V.]] for $1,180 million—raising his stake to 70%. Maxis has more than ten million subscribers, with around 40% market share in Malaysia. He also owns stakes in [[Aircel]], [[AXIS Telekom Indonesia|Axis]] and [[Sri Lanka Telecom]].

In an agreement between [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] and India's [[Sun Network]], Krishnan plans to produce TV channels which cater to the Indian market, especially [[Tamils|Tamil people]] in countries such as US, Western Europe and Middle East. He also plans to offer TV services featuring Web-based interactivity. Ananda Krishnan owns stakes in [[TVB]].com and the [[List of Shaw Brothers films|Shaw Brothers]] movie archives.

In 2003 Krishnan's Usaha Tegas launched the Harapan Nusantara education fund. Since 2004 the fund has sponsored 100 students a year to attend special programs at local private universities that collaborate with foreign universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2003/06/26/harapan-nusantara-puts-up-rm100m-to-benefit-malay-students/|title=Harapan Nusantara puts up RM100m to benefit Malay students - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the company also started the Yu Cai Education Foundation with a grant of $6.6 million to help ethnic Chinese groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0315/philanthropy-technology-telecom-malaysia-billionaire-ananda-krishnan.html#410807fd77c5|title=Malaysia's Telecom Billionaire Gives Back|last=Mertens|first=Brian|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On 3 May 2012, Tan Sri Annuar Musa was suspended from taking part in any football activities in Kelantan where he is the President. The [[Football Association of Malaysia]] (FAM) disciplinary committee found Annuar's negative statement against the national football team on 12 Feb had breached the status of FAM's Article 88 (2010-2014). FAM's Article 88 states that only the president and the secretary-general can comment on the national team's performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bolasepakmalaysia.com/p/annuar-musa-digantung-fam-selama-30-bulan/ Annuar Musa Digantung FAM Selama 30 Bulan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808172402/http://www.bolasepakmalaysia.com/p/annuar-musa-digantung-fam-selama-30-bulan/ |date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Annuar's decision to quit as Kafa president during Kelantan football team, [[Kelantan FA|The Red Warriors]] (TRW) was going through bad performances and the financial problem of settling outstanding footballers and even coach salaries was questioned by many who had likened him to [[The captain goes down with the ship|"the captain abandoning his sinking ship"]].&lt;ref name="KAFA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No turning back |url=https://www.pressreader.com/malaysia/new-straits-times/20161119/282518658090128 |last1=SINGH |first1= DEVINDER |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=19 November 2016 |publisher= New Straits Times Press (M) Berhad  |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=K’tan to pay outstanding salaries for footballers in stages, says Annuar |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/327028|last1= |first1= |work=Bernama |date=15 January 2016 |publisher= [[Malaysiakini]] |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=(Football) PFAM blasts former Kafa president over accusation of interference|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/12/200821/football-pfam-blasts-former-kafa-president-over-accusation-interference |last1=SINGH |first1= AJITPAL |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=31 December 2016 |publisher= New Straits Times Press (M) Berhad  |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JDT take a jab at KAFA over Jonny McKain’s unpaid salary |url=https://www.fourthofficial.com/2017/43607/jdt-take-jab-kafa-jonny-mckains-unpaid-salary/ |last1=Krishnan |first1= Gowri |work=FourthOfficial |date=24 February 2017 |publisher= FourthOfficial |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Annuar Musa and KAFA, it’s time to own up to your own mistakes! |url=https://www.fourthofficial.com/2017/46111/annuar-musa-kafa-time-mistakes/ |last1= |first1= |author= Keeshaanan Sundaresan |work=FourthOfficial |date=6 May 2017 |publisher= FourthOfficial |accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Category design''' is a [[business strategy]] and discipline that helps companies create, develop, and dominate new categories of products and services.

Category design extends beyond a [[Leadership|leadership team's]] narrower focus on products, [[Organizational culture|company culture]] and [[business model]]s. Taught in academia as a [[Business Strategy|business]] and [[Marketing strategy|market strategy]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecorner.stanford.edu/videos/4231/The-Journey-of-Category-Design|title=Dave Peterson: The Journey of Category Design {{!}} Stanford eCorner|website=ecorner.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/go-to-market-and-category-design-fundamentals/|title=Jennifer Johnson {{!}} Go-To-Market And Category Design Fundamentals {{!}} Heavybit|date=2017-03-29|work=Heavybit|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is explicitly deployed by [[disruptive innovation]] companies like [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Airbnb]] and other start up brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246784|title=5 Essentials for Creating a New Market Category|last=Snyder|first=Michelle|date=2015-06-17|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2015/10/creating-category-of-one-brands.html#.WXcN_YiGPIU|title=Creating Category Of One Brands {{!}} Branding Strategy Insider|date=2015-10-30|work=Branding Strategy Insider|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2014/01/7-strategies-to-create-new-business-categories.html|title=7 Strategies To Create New Business Categories|date=2014-01-17|website=Branding Strategy Insider|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business magazines such as ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' and ''[[Inc.

== History ==
Category design is

* discovering and defining a category problem,
* creating a clear story (called a [[Point of view (philosophy)|point-of-view]]) that explains and sells the category idea,
* defining a category blueprint,
* driving the category strategy across a company's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (mobilization),
* shaping customers' thinking (lightning strikes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/play-bigger/the-key-to-designing-your-company-success-category-king.html|title=How to Design a Business That Dominates Its Niche|last=|first=|date=13 Jun 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-07-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The concepts tie back into recent writings about how our brains work, particularly [[cognitive bias]]es as described by [[Daniel Kahneman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-came-behavioural-economics-now-its-time-liz-griffith|title=First came behavioural economics – Now it's time for behavioural marketing|last=Griffith|first=Liz|date=2017-04-19|work=Linkedin Pulse|access-date=2017-06-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good category takes advantage of cognitive biases such as the choice supportive bias and [[groupthink]] bias.

After the book was published in June 2016, [[Mike Maples]], a founding partner of [[Floodgate Fund|Floodgate]], published articles supporting the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/floodgates-mike-maples-on-what-makes-category-kings/|title=Floodgate's Mike Maples on what makes category kings {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Stebbings|first=Harry|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 6–10 law ===

Data research shows that "category kings" (companies that dominates a market category)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/05/keys-to-ascending-the-consumer-internet-throne/|title=Keys to ascending the consumer-internet throne {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Lee|first=Roger|last2=Lu|first2=Jeff|access-date=2017-06-27|last3=Ravichandran|first3=Deepak}}&lt;/ref&gt; that go public when they are between six and ten years old create most of the value among all VC-funded tech companies. Companies that go public sooner than six years old often lose value; companies that [[Initial public offering|IPO]] after ten years old create little value for [[shareholder]]s. The reason is thought to be that categories take around six years to develop, and most of a category's growth happens in that six to ten year timeframe. After ten years, a category is established and growth slows, so [[share price]]s level off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sandhill.com/article/the-6-10-law-data-science-reveals-how-age-and-money-impact-startup-value-creation/|title=The 6–10 Law: Data Science Reveals How Age and Money Impact Startup Value Creation {{!}} Sandhill|website=sandhill.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was discussed in a ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article titled "How Unicorns Grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/online/unicorns-mythological-creatures/|title=Unicorns and Other Mythological Creatures|website=harvardpolitics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chan Chor Khine''' ({{zh|t=曾祖慨|poj=Chan Chó̍-khài}}; born in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]]) was a [[Burmese-Chinese]] businessman, land-owner, investor and philanthropist.

==Early life ==
Chan was born in 1886 to self-made millionaire father [[Chan Mah Phee]] and his mother, the daughter of a Burmese peasant. He attended [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St Paul's High School, Rangoon]] before being educated further in China.

==Rangoon==
Chan returned to Burma to join his father's business [[Taik Leong]]. The company dealt primarily in oil, rice and tobacco exports. Chan ultimately became manager of the company upon his father's retirement. He served as an honorary magistrate on the board of the [[Corporation of Rangoon]].&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Chan donated 10 acres of land for the construction of the [[Chinese High School, Rangoon|Chinese High School]] in Rangoon.

==Death==
Chan committed suicide in April 1934 at 10:20am by shooting himself in the head at his estate, [[the Brightlands]].

A '''corporate lawyer''' is a [[lawyer]] who specializes in [[corporate law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America|author=Ralph Nader and Wesley J. Smith|isbn=0-375-75258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles and responsibilities ==
The role of a corporate lawyer is to ensure the legality of commercial transactions, advising corporations on their legal rights and duties, including the duties and responsibilities of [[corporate officer]]s.  In order to do this, they must have knowledge of aspects of [[contract law]], [[tax law]], [[accounting]], [[securities law]], [[bankruptcy]], [[intellectual property rights]], [[licensing]], [[zoning law]]s, and the laws specific to the business of the corporations that they work for.&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to Your Career|author=Alan B. Bernstein and Princeton Review Publishing Staff|chapter=Corporate Lawyer|date=2004|publisher=[[The Princeton Review]]|isbn=0-375-76399-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vault&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vault College Career Bible|author=Vault Editors|chapter=Corporate Law Basics|pages=289&amp;ndash;290|date=2007|publisher=Vault Inc.|isbn=1-58131-419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, controversies involving well known companies such as, [[Walmart]] and [[General Motors]] have highlighted the complex role of corporate lawyers in internal investigations, in which  [[attorney-client privilege]] could be considered to shelter potential wrongdoing by the company. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Steven Davidoff|title=Keeping Corporate Lawyers Silent Can Shelter Wrongdoing|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/keeping-corporate-lawyers-silent-can-shelter-wrongdoing/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=The New York Times|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a corporate lawyer's internal company clients are not assured of confidentiality, they will be less likely to seek legal advice, but keeping confidences can shelter society's access to vital information. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bishop|first1=Keith Paul|title=Why Keeping Corporate Lawyers Quiet Is Good For Us All|journal=The National Law Review|date=28 August 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/why-keeping-corporate-lawyers-quiet-good-us-all|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The practice of corporate law is less adversarial than that of trial law.  Lawyers for both sides of a commercial transaction are less opponents than facilitators.  One lawyer (quoted by Bernstein) characterizes them as "the [[handmaiden]]s of the deal".  Transactions take place amongst peers.  There are rarely wronged parties, underdogs, or inequities in the financial means of the participants.  Corporate lawyers structure those transactions, draft documents, review agreements, negotiate deals, and attend meetings.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vault /&gt;

What areas of corporate law a corporate lawyer experiences depend from where the firm that he/she works for is, geographically, and how large it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brycelegal.com/2016/08/how-i-got-my-legal-dream-job-series-how-to-become-one-of-the-most-powerful-lawyers-in-new-york-state-government/|title=Intensive Practical Skills Training Build a Foundation for a Legal Career|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-07-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small-town corporate lawyer in a small firm may deal in many short-term jobs such as drafting [[will (law)|will]]s, [[divorce]] settlements, and real estate transactions, whereas a corporate lawyer in a large city firm may spend many months devoted to negotiating a single business transaction.  Similarly, different firms may organize their subdivisions in different ways.  Not all will include [[mergers and acquisitions]] under the umbrella of a corporate law division, for example.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vault /&gt;

Some corporate lawyers become partners in their firms.  Others become in-house counsel for corporations.  Others still migrate into other professions such as [[investment banking]] and teaching law.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;

Some publications read by those in the profession include ''Global Legal Studies'', ''Lawyers Weekly'', and the ''[[National Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;

==Salary==
The salary of a corporate lawyer can vary widely: those employed by major [[international]] [[law firms]] ("BigLaw" firms) earn starting salaries of US$180,000, which rise every year with experience (this amount excludes any additional bonus payments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/business/dealbook/law-firm-salaries-jump-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-a-decade.html?_r=0|title=Law Firm Salaries Jump for the First Time in Nearly a Decade|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the geographical location, the starting salary may be closer to US$160,000 if the market is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/business/dealbook/welcome-to-your-first-year-as-a-lawyer-your-salary-is-160000-a-year.html|title=Welcome to Your First Year as a Lawyer.

'''Cost externalizing''' is a socioeconomic term describing how a business maximizes its profits by off-loading indirect costs and forcing negative effects to a third party.  An externalized cost is known to economists as a [[Externality#Negative|negative externality]].

==Business to society==
Fundamentally, cost externalization occurs when a company transfers some of its moral responsibilities as costs to the community directly or as degradation to the environment. For example, railroads and airlines transfer the cost of fuel, noise, and terminal infrastructure to the community. Airlines and auto manufacturers transfer the cost of degraded air quality to the community and the environment. By externalizing to the community or the environment, many true costs become lost in analysis because the true cost is non-quantifiable and neither the community nor the environment have effective advocates to recoup the damages. A major modern theme in the relationship of business to society is the society's ability (or inability) to resist this kind of externalization. In its extreme, society collapses as business realizes its profits.

==Business to market==
Cost externalizing is one of the steps a company may take to "shape up" or reduce overhead by [[down sizing]] a [[cost centre (business)|cost center]] or an unprofitable department.

An example of cost externalizing would be using a global courier service (such as [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]) to do all or most of the shipping and logistics work for the company. For a business to take on the responsibilities of worldwide shipping by itself would be too costly. It would be far more sensible to let a third party who specialize in shipping to take care of the task and pay them for it.

===B2B cost externalization===
{{Tone|section|date=August 2017}}
Cost externalizing in no way should be considered a quick fix. Simply forcing suppliers and service providers to take on more responsibilities and cost is not a healthy externalization of cost. Careful operational forecasting must take place before taking steps towards cost externalization. Otherwise, there is no way to ascertain if cost externalizing would actually lower the operational cost of the company.

To externalize cost, [[budget]]ing must also take place. Because the company will be paying out to a third party, the cost would be more clear than when the process took place in-house. This would in turn give a chance for the suppliers and service providers to compete for business and may further reduce cost. Yet in some cases, the reduction in cost may lead to reduction in quality. Because quality is not quantified easily, it may be difficult to measure and compare - especially if the quality for all parties begin to fall, business managers may fail to notice the change in quality. This is one kind of control that a business loses when externalizing cost.

===B2C cost externalization===
Another option is for a company to transfer some of its costs to its customers. For example, reducing staff in a customer service department that handles incoming phone calls will usually increase hold times for customers seeking support. The company reduces its costs by reducing staff, while the customer bears the increased cost of waiting on hold. Thus an expense has been transferred from the company to the customer. This can reduce customer satisfaction, to the point that some customers will be motivated to switch to another company. However if the company can gain a legal monopoly (through, for example, intellectual property laws) the customer has no choice of a competitor available. The customer's only option then is to take it or leave it.

Customers can also absorb some of a company's costs by performing tasks that the company formerly provided. An early example of this was the self-service gas station, followed more recently by [[self checkout]] kiosks in grocery stores. This can have less of a negative customer satisfaction impact because some customers actually prefer to help themselves.

As in any business operation, costs externalization has its pros and cons. It is up to the business managers to make the decisions and take advantage of cost externalization.

'''Danish Open Source Society''' (abbreviated '''DOSS''') is working to promote [[open standard]]s and [[open source]]. The purpose of DOSS is to create tangible results through the work of the its members. DOSS has a very pragmatic approach and values tangible results higher than intangible principles. Most of the work of DOSS is done by a small group of very serious members.

As part of the DOSS-approach to promote Open Source, the society is behind a development project in [[Chinandega]] in the Northeastern [[Nicaragua]]. Open Source is here used to enhance the communication and learning in several villages. In that way DOSS is contributing, through the promotion of Open Source, to the improvement of the conditions of life in a specific area of the world.

This pilot project can be viewed as an integrated part of the overall strategy of DOSS on the promotion of Open Source and Open Standards.

The '''Women's City Club''' is a women's club located at 2110 Park Avenue in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], within the [[Park Avenue Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)|Park Avenue Historic District]]. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

==History==
[[Woman's club movement|Women's organizations]] became increasingly influential in the years after the [[American Civil War]] as a class of highly educated, middle class women arose in the nation.&lt;ref name="det1701"&gt;[http://www.detroit1701.org/Women's%20City%20Club.html Women’s City Club of Detroit] from Detroit1701.org&lt;/ref&gt; Their impact was at its peak in the years around [[World War I]], when the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women's suffrage, was ratified. In Detroit, it became apparent at that time that the many women's organizations in the city needed a centralized place to meet.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/detroit/d21.htm Women's City Club] from the National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, a number of local activists founded the "Women's City Club" to "promote a broad acquaintance among women."&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hill, Eric J. and John Gallagher | title=AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture | year=2002 | publisher=Wayne State University Press | isbn=0-8143-3120-3}} P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The club hired architect William B.

The exterior of the building is built of brick, in a featureless modern style.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; The six stories are differentiated into the lower three floors, which are blocky and regular; and the three upper floors, which appear to be set onto the lower floors.&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aia"/&gt; The brick color differs between the two sections, as does the appearance of the windows. There is also a horizontal range of bricks between the two sections.&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt; The lower floors were designed to be meeting spaces for social events and planning the activities of members. The three upper floors were used as an apartments for women who moved to Detroit for employment and wished to live in a wholesome environment.&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt;

The interior decor was strongly influenced by the then-current [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] movement, with hand-wrought ironwork and [[Pewabic Pottery]] tilework.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; The swimming pool was also decorated with Pewabic tile.&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt;

==Use==
The City Club offered a number of classes and recreation programs for women, eventually enrolling over 8,000 members.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; However, membership declined after [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; and in 1974 the club moved to smaller quarters.&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt; The social space was used for various purposes, including a restaurant and bar in later years.&lt;ref name="det1701"/&gt; The building is currently owned by Forbes Management (also owners of the [[Elwood Bar]], [[Gem Theater]], and [[The Fillmore Detroit]]), and has recently received an upgrade of its façade.&lt;ref name="modeld"&gt;[http://www.modeldmedia.com/developmentnews/wex75.aspx "Women's City Club building on Park Ave. gets facade upgrades"] fropm ModelD, December 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglas Harriman Kennedy''' (born March 24, 1967) is the tenth child of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ethel Kennedy]], named in honor of [[W. Averell Harriman]], a family friend and former governor of [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Life and career==
Kennedy was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] He married Molly Elizabeth Stark, daughter of John Sherwood Stark and Sharon Ellen Wing, on August 22, 1998, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]].

They have five children: Riley Maria Kennedy, born Aug 1999 in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]]; Mary Julia Kennedy, born Aug 2001; Rowen Frances Kennedy, born Feb 2004; George Skakel Kennedy, born April 2007 and Anthony Boru Kennedy, born Jan 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-02-25/news/31099346_1_stefan-friedman-maternity-ward-douglas-kennedy | location=New York | work=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy graduated from [[Georgetown Preparatory School]] and [[Brown University]] and began his career as a print journalist with ''The Nantucket Beacon'' and later ''The [[New York Post]]''. As an investigative reporter for the Post, Kennedy obtained the first interview with the officer who arrested [[Oklahoma City bombing]] suspect [[Timothy McVeigh]] and broke numerous other health care and metropolitan area stories.

He joined [[Fox News Channel]] as a general assignment reporter in August 1996 and hosts a bi-weekly program on the network, ''Douglas Kennedy’s American Stories''. While at Fox News, he covered the Presidential elections of 1996, 2000, and 2004, as well as [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="FoxBio"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1218,00.html Fox News Biography of Doug Kennedy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427051237/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1218,00.html |date=April 27, 2006 }} dated July 14, 2006; accessed September 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, while working as a correspondent for the Fox News show ''[[The Big Story (2000 TV series)|The Big Story]]'', he commented on the controversy over whether the film of "Crocodile Hunter" [[Steve Irwin]]'s last moments should be shown, noting that he and his siblings "had to grow up with" repeatedly seeing broadcasts and video clips of Kennedy's own father's death. He said that in Irwin's case, it would be really "unnecessary and in very poor taste."&lt;ref name="FoxVideo"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,212321,00.html# Should Video of 'Crocodile Hunter' Steve Irwin's Death Be Released?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107071151/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,212321,00.html |date=November 7, 2006 }} September 5, 2006 [[Associated Press|AP]] report on Fox site; must click "video" link in sidebar to see Kennedy's remarks.

On November 20, 2012, Kennedy was acquitted of misdemeanor physical harassment and child endangerment charges in connection with a January 7, 2012 altercation with two nurses at Northern Westchester Hospital in [[Mount Kisco, New York]], two days after his son, Daniel Boru, was born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Douglas Kennedy, son of RFK, acquitted in NY maternity ward scuffle involving his newborn son |url=https://news.yahoo.com/douglas-kennedy-son-rfk-acquitted-ny-maternity-ward-201258681.html |publisher=The Associated Press |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128092617/http://news.yahoo.com/douglas-kennedy-son-rfk-acquitted-ny-maternity-ward-201258681.html |archivedate=November 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Douglas Kennedy, son of RFK, acquitted in NY maternity ward scuffle involving his newborn son|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/douglas-kennedy-son-of-rfk-acquitted-in-ny-maternity-ward-scuffle-involving-his-newborn-son/2012/11/20/31199b64-334e-11e2-92f0-496af208bf23_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 20, 2012}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-kennedy-20120226,0,3854060.story |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227060729/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-kennedy-20120226,0,3854060.story |archivedate=February 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tarrytowndv /&gt; Kennedy attempted to take his infant off the maternity ward for some fresh air, which two nurses said was against hospital policy, and who claimed that he physically assaulted them when they tried to stop him from doing so.&lt;ref name=tarrytowndv&gt;{{cite web|last=Cusano|first=Art|title=Northern Westchester Hospital Defends Nurses in Kennedy Incident|url=http://tarrytown.dailyvoice.com/news/nwh-defends-nurses-kennedy-incident|publisher=The Tarrytown Daily Voice|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birsh|first=Alex|title=Published Report: Kennedy, Nurses Clash At Northern Westchester Hospital|url=http://yorktown.dailyvoice.com/news/douglas-kennedy-nurses-clash-hospital|publisher=The Yorktown Daily Voice|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was separately investigated by New York child welfare authorities following the incident, but social workers found no signs of child abuse in his home and declared the allegations unfounded in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/AP-source-NY-finds-no-child-abuse-of-Kennedy-heir-3458994.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202015200/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/AP-source-NY-finds-no-child-abuse-of-Kennedy-heir-3458994.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-02 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fast Money''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[finance|financial]] [[stock trader|stock trading]] [[talk show]] that began airing on the [[CNBC]] [[cable television|cable]]/[[satellite television|satellite]] [[TV channel]] on 2006-06-21. Beginning October 10, 2007, it was broadcast every weeknight at 5pm [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]], one hour after the close of trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], until mid-2011 when it was moved to just four nights per week, Monday through Thursday, to make room for special option and currency trading shows on Friday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/programming_changes_at_cnbc_67915.asp Programming Changes At CNBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007182052/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/programming_changes_at_cnbc_67915.asp |date=2008-10-07 }} a September 27, 2007 article from [[Mediabistro.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, 2013, it returned to the Friday night slot as a half-hour show, followed by the ''Options Action'' half-hour show.&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;{{cite web |title=CNBC Schedule Change for Fridays |publisher=CNBC |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100577898}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show originates from the [[NASDAQ MarketSite]] in [[New York City]].

==Program format==
[[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]] anchors a fast-paced discussion among four professional [[Wall Street]] traders. The group discusses various investment strategies, including [[technical analysis]], and debate the merits of each other's arguments for or against a particular stock or sector. The show covers topics such as [[option (finance)|options trading]], [[commodities]], and [[exchange-traded fund]]s.

Most episodes feature regularly appearing traders: [[Pete Najarian]], [[Guy Adami]], [[Karen Finerman]], [[Tim Seymour]], and [[Joe Terranova]].

==History==
The success of ''[[Mad Money]]'' prompted CNBC to look to replicate that success with another show.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  ''Fast Money'' was created by [[Dylan Ratigan]] and Susan Krakower, Vice President of Strategic Programming and Development,&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite web | title= ''Fast'' Flare-up Rattles CNBC | url= http://www.nypost.com/seven/03272009/gossip/pagesix/fast_flare_up_rattles_cnbc_161468.htm | work= [[Page Six]] | publisher= [[New York Post]] | date= March 27, 2009 | accessdate= 2009-07-16 | quote= There was high drama at CNBC yesterday as "Fast Money" anchor Dylan Ratigan quit — sources say today will be his last day on-air — and an insider is blaming his battles with network big Susan Krakower.

The show originally aired from CNBC headquarters in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], with Ratigan as host, and a regular panel of Jeff Macke, Guy Adami, Tim Strazzini, and Eric Bolling.&lt;ref name="nyt2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Jensen |title=The Brashness Is Back in Money Talk, and Also at CNBC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/business/media/02cnbc.html?ex=1174190400&amp;en=3506d7c02a8cbda0&amp;ei=5070 |publisher=The New York Times |date=2006-10-02 |accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 8, 2007, it became a weekday show with its studio at the [[NASDAQ MarketSite]].&lt;ref name="cnbcpress"/&gt;

On Fridays, beginning with March 5, 2010, the show was truncated to just 30 minutes as ''Options Action'' (also hosted by Melissa Lee) was aired in the 5:30 ET timeslot.  Both ''Fast Money'' and ''Options Action'' are broadcast from the NASDAQ MarketSite.

In mid-2011, ''Fast Money'' was removed from the Friday night line-up altogether to make room for ''Money in Motion: Currency Trading'' (also hosted by Melissa Lee) which airs in the 5:30 ET time slot, while ''Options Action'' was moved up a half-hour to 5pm ET. On March 22, 2013, it returned to the Friday night lineup. The program airs the first half hour (5pm ET) followed by half hour of ''Options Action'' at 5:30pm ET. ''Money in Motion'' was removed from the CNBC lineup&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt;

On October 13, 2014, ''Fast Money'', along with CNBC's other business-day programs, were launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 presentation.

==Panelist changes==
Strazzini was replaced by Najarian on May 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/new_panelist_on_fast_money_59451.asp New Panelist On Fast Money] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210136/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/new_panelist_on_fast_money_59451.asp |date=2007-09-30 }} from [[Mediabistro.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolling was replaced by Finerman on September 4, 2007. Seymour, who had appeared on the show as a substitute panelist, was made a regular in October 2008.  After published rumors of conflict with ''Fast Money'' co-creator Susan Krakower,&lt;ref name="nypost"/&gt; Ratigan left the network on March 27, 2009 when his CNBC contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;Three months later Ratigan appeared as the host of ''[[Morning Meeting]]'', a new mid-day show on CNBC's sister network [[MSNBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ratigan was replaced by Lee, who sometimes filled in for Ratigan.  Macke left CNBC on June 15, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/jeff-macke-officially-out-at-cnbc/29224 Jeff Macke Officially Out at CNBC], a June 15, 2009 article from [[Mediabistro.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming and ratings==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
''Fast Money's'' first 13 episodes (including one live audience broadcast) aired during the summer of 2006 in the Wednesday 8pm ET timeslot.  Ratings were relatively low, with the program averaging a bit over 110,000 viewers per week.  During the week of 2006-09-18, the program tried a new timeslot at 5pm ET, the plush timeslot with highly rated ''[[Closing Bell]]'' serving as the lead-out (bumping ''[[Kudlow &amp; Company]]'' to 8pm for the week).  Here the show flourished, nearly doubling its viewership average to 211,000 viewers (on-par with what K&amp;C normally gets). The 5pm ET timeslot, while successful, bumped ''Kudlow &amp; Company'' to 8pm.  This brought the show's ratings down substantially compared to where they were before the temporary move. After its successful 5pm test run during the week of 2006-09-18, CNBC retried the program again at 8pm the week after. CNBC had hoped it may have gained some traction after the increased viewership from the week prior.  The show did not.  Ratings were roughly on-par with the summer 2006 airings.

===CNBC Europe===
[[CNBC Europe]] does not generally broadcast the programme live apart from on special occasions when the news of the day merits extra live news programming. The channel instead airs broadcasts of CNBC documentaries and weekly magazine programmes in the timeslot.  

In recent years ''Fast Money'' was shown on [[CNBC Europe]] on a delayed basis between October and March. However this year (November 2016 to March 2017) CNBC Europe has not shown the programme, instead broadcasting [[Nightly Business Report]] and a repeat of a weekly magazine show or a one-off report.

==''Fast Money Halftime Report''==
''Fast Money Halftime Report'' is an American financial stock trading talk show that airs from noon-1 ET on CNBC.  This show, which follows the same format as the 5pm show, debuted July 7, 2010.  It spun off from a segment on ''[[Power Lunch]]'', which itself moved to 1 ET from noon ET on July 7, 2010.  Unlike ''Fast Money'', this halftime market show is hosted by Scott Wapner, and is broadcast live from CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ.

Originally aired as a half-hour show, the ''Fast Money Halftime Report'' doubled its runtime from 30 minutes to 60 minutes on October 17, 2011 and also moved up to the noon ET timeslot.  The newly expanded hour-long show replaced ''[[The Strategy Session]]'', which was cancelled October 14, 2011 as a result of very low ratings.

'''Felipe Esteban Llavallol''' (December 26, 1802 — April 4, 1874) was an Argentine merchant, philanthropist, lawmaker and briefly Governor of the secessionist [[State of Buenos Aires]].

==Life and times==
Llavallol was born in [[Buenos Aires]] to María Gertrudis de Merlo and Jaime Llavallol; the elder Llavallol was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] merchant from [[Barcelona]] who had emigrated to [[Buenos Aires]] in the 1790s, and Felipe Llavallol joined his father in business. He married the former Martina Monasterio in 1833, and they had seven children. He inherited his father's [[commerce|commercial]] establishment in 1838 and became one of Buenos Aires' leading businesspeople.

Following the September 11, 1852, declaration of the secessionist [[State of Buenos Aires]], Llavallol held numerous posts in the new government. He was elected to the Lower House of Congress, becoming President of the Chamber, and to the Senate in 1854, serving as its president until 1856. He was appointed Economy Minister and took part in the establishment of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]] in 1854, and served as its first president until August 1855. Named President of the newly established [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]], he presided over the August 30, 1857, inaugural of its first line, designed by British engineer [[William Bragge]].

Elected Vice-Governor in [[Valentín Alsina]]'s ticket in December 1858, the defeat of Buenos Aires forces by those of the [[Argentine Confederation]] at the [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)]] led to Confederate President [[Justo José de Urquiza]]'s demand that Alsina resign, and the more pragmatic Llavallol succeeded Alsina as governor on October 23, 1859.

Governor Llavallol's brief tenure as governor was highlighted by the resulting negotiations, which produced the [[Pact of San José de Flores]] and significant concessions toward Buenos Aires. He stepped down on May 3, 1860, upon the legislature's election of Colonel [[Bartolomé Mitre]], who defeated Confederate forces at the 1861 [[Battle of Pavón]] and reincorporated Buenos Aires into a unified [[Argentina]].

Llavallol continued his work as a member of the ''Comisión Filantrópica'' [[charity organization]], and died in Buenos Aires in 1874, at age 71. He was interred in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogiafamiliar.net/showmedia.php?mediaID=976&amp;medialinkID=3642|title= Genealogía familiar: Mausoleo familiar Llavallol|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Karl Piëch''' (born 17 April 1937) is an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[business magnate]], engineer and executive who was the chairman of the [[executive board]] (''Vorstandsvorsitzender'') of [[Volkswagen Group]] in 1993-2002 and the chairman of the [[supervisory board]] (''Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender'') of [[Volkswagen Group]] in 2002-2015.&lt;ref name="finanzen.net"/&gt;

A grandson of [[Ferdinand Porsche]], Piëch started his career at [[Porsche]], before leaving for Audi after an agreement that no member of the Porsche or Piëch families should be involved in the day-to-day operations of the company. Piëch eventually became the head of Audi, where he is credited with evolving and growing Audi into a competitor to equal [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]], thanks in part to innovative designs such as the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]] and [[Audi 100|100]]. In 1993, Piëch became the chairman and CEO of [[Volkswagen Group]], which he is credited with turning into the large conglomerate it is today; He oversaw the purchase of [[Lamborghini]] and [[Bentley]], as well as 
the founding of [[Bugatti Automobiles]], all of which he integrated with the [[Volkswagen]], [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]], [[SEAT]] and [[Audi]] brands into a ladder-type structure similar to that used by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors]]. Piëch was required to retire at age 65 per Volkswagen company policy, but he remained on its supervisory board and was involved in the company's strategic decisions until his  resignation on 25 April 2015.&lt;ref name = "Ousted"&gt;{{cite news|title= Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech quits in power struggle|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32468360|date=25 April 2015|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated as an engineer, Piëch influenced the development of numerous significant cars including the [[Audi Quattro]] and notably, the [[Bugatti Veyron]], which as of 2012 was the fastest, most powerful and most expensive road legal automobile ever built.  Due to his influence on the automobile industry, Piëch was named the [[Car Executive of the Century]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= This Just In: Model T Gets Award|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DF1439F937A15751C1A96F958260|date=24 December 1999|accessdate=8 May 2008 | first=James G. | last=Cobb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Piëch was born in Vienna, Austria, to [[Louise Piëch|Louise]] (''née'' Porsche; Ferdinand's daughter) and [[Anton Piëch]], a lawyer. He studied at the [[Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz]] and graduated from the [[ETH Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], in 1962, with a degree in mechanical engineering, having written a master thesis about the development of a [[Formula One]] (F1) engine.  At the same time, Porsche was involved in F1 and developed an 8-cylinder engine for the [[Porsche 804]].

From 1963 to 1971, he worked at [[Porsche]] in [[Stuttgart]], on the development of the [[Porsche 906]] and following models that led to the successful [[Porsche 917]]. In 1972, he moved to [[Audi]] in [[Ingolstadt]]. Starting from 1975, he was manager of technological engineering, being responsible for the concepts of the [[Audi 80]] and [[Audi 100]].  He celebrated his 40th birthday on 17 April 1977 with a ball at which guests included [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and at which the staff of the Porsche Hotel presented him with an Audi 80 that was just {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and constructed of [[marzipan]].&lt;ref name=AutoMotoruSport197709&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed_| title = Personalien: Ferdinand Piech| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = Heft 9 1977| pages = Seite 7 |date = 27 April 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he also initiated the development of a car for the [[World Rally Championship]], resulting in the [[four-wheel drive]] [[Audi Quattro]].  The engine used in the Quattro model was a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Straight-five engine|inline-5]] cylinder unit.

Piëch held a small engineering company in the time between leaving Porsche AG and joining Audi, and while there, he developed a 5 cylinder in-line [[diesel engine]] for [[Mercedes-Benz]].  He picked up the concept again after moving to Audi, because there was a market demand for engines with more than 4 cylinders. At the time, Audi (and the Audi-derived VW Passat/Santana model range) used longitudinally mounted inline engines and front wheel drive. More conservative layouts with 6 cylinders were rejected because of engineering and production costs ([[V6 engine]]) or packaging requirements ([[Straight-six engine|straight 6]] did not fit because front wheel drive required that it be mounted in front of the axis).

In 1993, Piëch moved to Volkswagen AG, parent company of the [[Volkswagen Group]], where he became [[Chairman]] of the Board of Management, succeeding [[Carl Hahn]]. At that time Volkswagen was only three months from bankruptcy, and he was central to orchestrating its dramatic turnaround.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}} He retired from the Board of Management in 2002, but still serves in an advisory capacity as Chairman of the [[Supervisory Board]].
In 2000, he was named chairman of [[Scania (company)|Scania AB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scania.com/news/press_releases/2000/q2/press_9741.asp Ferdinand Piëch new chairman of the Scania Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070038/http://www.scania.com/news/press_releases/2000/q2/press_9741.asp |date=27 September 2007 }} 24 May 2000, Scania.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the management board in 2002 and was succeeded as chairman by [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]].

While head of [[Volkswagen Group]], Piëch was known for his aggressive moves into other markets.  He drove the Volkswagen and Audi brands upmarket with great success.  Piëch also pursued other [[marque]]s, successfully acquiring [[Lamborghini]] for Audi, and establishing [[Bugatti Automobiles SAS]].  His purchase of British [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]] was more controversial.  After successfully buying the [[Crewe]], [[England]], carbuilding operation, VW was denied the use of the Rolls-Royce brand name.  Piëch later claimed that he only really wanted the Bentley brand, but at the time the loss of Rolls to rival [[BMW]] was widely seen as a major failure.

What was not a failure, however, was his effort to revitalize Volkswagen in [[North America]].  Hahn's previous efforts to regain market share in the United States and [[Canada]]—which he had built up as the head of [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] from 1958 to 1965—were unsuccessful, but Piëch helped reverse VW's fortunes by the decision to manufacture the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]], the introduction of which in 1998 gave Volkswagen of America a much needed impulse.

Due to his continued influence in the auto industry, [[Automobile Magazine]] announced that Piëch has won their Man of the Year award for 2011.&lt;ref name = "Auto"&gt;[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/awards/1101_2011_man_of_the_year_ferdinand_piech/index.html Ferdinand Piech - 2011 Man of the Year - Automobile Magazine] Retrieved 16 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodman-Ludwigshafen - Ludwigshafen - Hafenstraße - Ludwigs Erbe r 09 ies.jpg|thumb|Relief ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwigs Erbe|de}}'' by [[Peter Lenk]], close to Zollhaus and tourist information, Hafenstraße 5, Ludwigshafen am Bodensee, [[Bodman-Ludwigshafen]] in Germany: Right-hand part of the triptych, top: [[Utz Claassen]], [[Dieter Zetsche]], '''Ferdinand Piëch''', bottom: [[Leo Kirch]]]]

At Porsche, Piëch triggered significant changes in the company's policy.  For example, the position of drivers in [[auto racing|race cars]] was moved from the left to the right, as this gives advantages on the predominantly clockwise race tracks.  After making mainly small 2000&amp;nbsp;cc race cars that were supposed to be closely related to road cars, Porsche made a risky investment by unexpectedly building twenty-five 5000&amp;nbsp;cc [[Porsche 917]], surprising the rule makers at the [[FIA]].  Even [[Ferrari]] had needed to sell his company to [[Fiat]] before making such a move.  Always thinking big, Piëch started development of a [[16-cylinder engine]] for the [[Can-Am]] series.  It is probably no coincidence that his grandfather had developed a famous supercharged 16-cylinder engine for the [[Auto Union]] racing cars in the 1930s.  Piëch was denied the chance to complete it, as a turbocharged version of the existing 12-cylinder was simpler, more powerful and very successful.  Three decades later as CEO of Volkswagen Group, Piëch insisted on the very ambitious [[Bugatti Veyron]], with a [[turbocharged]] [[W16 engine|W16]]-cylinder, {{convert|1001|hp|kW}} and {{convert|407|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed. Some of these figures are still not higher than those of the Porsche 917/30, but higher than most current racing cars.  Piëch was also behind the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury saloon, which was intended as a rival to other German luxury cars, but the sales of the model have been disappointing.

==Porsche ownership==
Piëch owns a significant share of [[Porsche]], exactly 10%. In order to prevent discussions among the many family members, a policy was established in early 1972 that no [[Porsche family]] member is allowed to be involved in the management of the company.  Even company founder [[Ferry Porsche]], Piëch's uncle, only held a seat on the supervisory board of Porsche after the company's legal form was changed from a limited partnership to a private legal company.  This made Piëch move to [[Audi]] after the foundation of his engineering bureau.

==Personal life and management style==
Piëch has fathered 12 children with four different women, and is currently married to Ursula (Uschi) Piëch.&lt;ref name = "Auto" /&gt; He is [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]],&lt;ref name = "Auto" /&gt; an atheist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Ferdinand_Piech|title=Ferdinand Piech|work=celebatheists.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a vast car collection that includes two [[Bugatti Veyron]]s that are regularly driven by him and his wife. An aggressive and demanding manager, Piëch's prolific firing of subordinates throughout his career has been legendary in automotive circles, particularly how he engineered the ousting of former Volkswagen CEO [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]] and Porsche CEO [[Wendelin Wiedeking]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2012}} According to Piëch, he fires any subordinate who "makes the same mistake twice".&lt;ref name = "Auto" /&gt;  However, his efforts to similarly oust chief executive [[Martin Winterkorn]] backfired and led to the resignations of Piëch and his wife from the supervisory board.&lt;ref name = "Ousted" /&gt;

'''Gabriel Marselis''' (1609 &amp;ndash; 15 April 1673) was a Dutch tradesman and land owner. He was born in [[Hamburg]], the son of merchant [[Gabriel Marselis, Sr.]] (c. 1575&amp;ndash;1643), and was a brother of [[Selius Marselis]]. He settled in [[Amsterdam]] in 1634. His trading with King [[Christian IV]] of [[Denmark-Norway]] was partly paid with the Crown's properties and goods. Marselis thus became the owner of several iron works and copper works in Norway, and also became one of the largest landowners in Denmark and Norway. Among his sons were Vilhelm, Baron and ancestor of the noble family [[Güldencrone (noble family)|Güldencrone]], and [[Constantin Marselis|Constantin]], Baron of [[Marselisborg]] and [[Constantinsborg]] at [[Aarhus]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gabriel Marselis D.Y.|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Anne-Hilde |last=Nagel |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Gabriel_Marselis_D.Y./utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gabriel Marselis |first=Marius A |last=Mardal |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Gabriel_Marselis|language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg Josef Riedel''' (born December 16, 1949) is an Austrian glassmaker and businessman. He is the 10th-generation owner of [[Riedel (glass manufacturer)]] established in 1756 and best known for its production of grape variety-specific glassware designed to enhance types of wines based on specific properties of individual grape varieties. Georg Riedel joined the family business in 1973 serving as accountant, before rising to co-CEO of Riedel Crystal alongside his father, Professor [[Claus Josef Riedel]], from 1987 until 1994. He served as Chief Executive Officer from 1994 until 2013. Georg Riedel succeeded his father, who first developed the concept of wine-enhancing glassware in 1958, and is best known for bringing variety-specific wine glasses to a global audience.

==Early life==

Georg Josef Riedel was born in 1949 in [[Innsbruck, Austria]] to Claus J Riedel and Adia Rosa Riedel (née Parodi).

==Career==

In 1973, Georg Riedel joined his family’s company as an accountant. In 1982, he expanded Riedel’s product-development process, founding the Glass Workshop based at the company headquarters in [[Kufstein]], [[Austria]], with an increased focus on the development of new glassware shapes to enhance the flavors of alcoholic beverages on the palate [https://www.riedel.com/en/heritage/history-generations Riedel History &amp; Generations]. In 1987 Riedel was named co-CEO of the company alongside his father Claus. In this role, Georg Riedel worked directly with industry experts and leading winemakers, including [[Robert Mondavi]] and [[Angelo Gaja]], inviting them to taste their wines in Riedel glasses of different shapes and sizes to determine the glass that best expressed the flavors and aromas of their single variety wines. As a result, Riedel Crystal earned the endorsement of industry experts and influential winemakers, who insisted that their wines be served exclusively in Riedel glasses. To that end, in 1991, [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.]] who described Riedel glassware in [[The Wine Advocate]], claimed: “The finest glasses for both technical and hedonistic purposes are those made by Riedel. The effect of these glasses on fine wine is profound.”&lt;ref name="Cellarmaster Wines"&gt;[http://www.cmwines.com.sg/general/about_riedelcrystal.aspx], About Riedel Crystal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Georg Riedel took over as sole Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal.  In 2013, Riedel stepped down as CEO and named his son, 11th-generation [[Maximilian Riedel]], President and CEO of Riedel Crystal and its worldwide subsidiaries. Today, Riedel is managed jointly by Georg Riedel and Maximilian Riedel. The two travel the world to educate over 20,000 people annually on variety specific stemware.

==Acquisition of Subsidiaries &amp; Expansion==

In 1979 Georg Riedel established Riedel Crystal of America in New York. He continued the company’s expansion, opening Riedel offices in Canada (1992), Germany (1996), Japan (2000), the UK (2001), Australia (2007), and China and Japan (2011).

In 2004, Georg Riedel bought the German-based F.X. Nachtmann, which included both the Nachtmann decorative and wine glassware brand and the Spiegelau beer and wine glassware brand. The three brands (Riedel, Nachtmann, Spiegelau) operate under “Riedel Glass Works” as one of the largest producers of fine glass in Europe.&lt;ref name="Nachtmann"&gt;[http://www.nachtmann.com/fileadmin/img/Service/CURVE_2013_issue44.pdf], Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design Innovation Timeline==

* '''1986:''' Developed the Vinum Series, the first variety-specific glassware made by machine. The Vinum Series expanded on the mouthblown Sommeliers Series, Riedel Crystal’s first line of variety-specific glassware, and provided an affordable glassware alternative to a growing segment of wine-drinkers in the United States, which increased by 12% between 1980 and 1990.&lt;ref name="University of California, Davis"&gt;[http://aic.ucdavis.edu/rmiminisymposium/RMI-CWE%20lapsley%208-23-2010.pdf], UC Davis.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1989:''' Developed the Ouverture Series, positioned as the entry level variety-specific glass for wine drinkers who appreciate good, reasonably priced wine.
* '''2000:''' Developed the Vinum Extreme Series, Riedel’s first collection of glasses designed specifically for New World wines.
* '''2007:''' Developed Tyrol, Riedel’s first variety-specific glassware line with a stout, solid base. The collection was created to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Riedel family’s Kufstein factory located in the Tirol province of Austria.
* '''2011:''' Developed the Escargot decanter, whose shape was inspired by a snail and was designed to double-decant wine, a Riedel-developed technology that achieves hours of decanting in a matter of minutes.

==Awards and nominations==
* '''1996:''' [[Decanter (magazine)]], Decanter Man of the Year, nomination &lt;ref name="Graffina"&gt;[http://www.graffignawines.com/ssl/FacebookGlassApp/files/gjriedel.pdf], Georg Riedel.&lt;/ref&gt;   
* '''2006:''' Award of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria 
* '''2007:''' Award of Honour by the State of Tyrol 
* '''2009:''' Wirtschaftsblatt daily newspaper Entrepreneur of the Year, nomination

==Personal life==

An avid runner, Riedel began running at age 30 and has completed 10 marathons and undertakes mountain hiking expeditions. Riedel has been married for 41 years to his wife, Eva. They met during his time as a student in Vienna and wed in 1973. They have two children, son Maximilian J Riedel and daughter Laetizia Riedel-Rothlisberger, and two grandsons.

==Early life and education==
Ashkenazi was born in the [[Jambyl Region|Zhambyl Oblast]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]. She grew up in [[Moscow]], where her father, engineer Yerkin Berkaliev, was a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Her mother, Saule, has degrees in both engineering and medicine. She has a sister, Meruert, who is 10 years older.&lt;ref name="times2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slater|first1=Lydia|title=Goga Ashkenazi:  not your average oligarch|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/magazine/article3728850.ece|accessdate=3 October 2015|work=[[The Times]]|date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, her family moved back to Kazakhstan. Eager for their daughter to get a competitive education, her parents sent the 12-year-old Goga to boarding school in England.&lt;ref name="nymag"/&gt; She first attended [[Buckswood School|Buckswood Grange School]] in East Sussex followed by [[Stowe School]], but was [[Rustication (academia)|rusticated]] after being caught kissing a boy.&lt;ref name="standard2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times2013"/&gt; She then attended [[Rugby School]], earning five A levels. She studied at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], graduating in 2001 with a degree in modern history and economics.&lt;ref name="times2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/goga-ashkenazi-by-royal-ascent-2239797.html|title=Goga Ashkenazi: By royal ascent|date=2011-03-12|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving Oxford, Ashkenazi worked at investment banking firms, including [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] in London and [[ABN AMRO]] in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="times2013"/&gt;

In 2003, Ashkenazi founded the MunaiGaz Engineering Group with her sister, Meruert.&lt;ref name="standard2010"/&gt; The company constructs compressor stations for gas pipelines and tunneling operations for utility networks, gas turbine and diesel plants.

Ashkenazi took over [[Vionnet (company)|Vionnet]] in 2012. She says she spent a year in Italy studying art, design, fashion and the Italian language.&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=J.J.|title=Vionnet's Lady Goga|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/interiors-entertaining/advice/a1101/fashionable-life-goga-ashkenazi-vionnet-1113/|work=[[Harper's Bazaar]]|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashkenazi is also on the board of Ivanhoe Mining Group.&lt;ref name="standard2010"/&gt;

==Personal life==
At age 23, she met and married American Stefan Ashkenazy, whose father [[Severyn Ashkenazy]] founded the [[L'Ermitage Beverly Hills|L'Ermitage Hotel Group]].&lt;ref name="times2013"/&gt; The couple separated in 2004 and divorced in 2007, but she retained his last name, albeit with a different spelling due to a typo on her Russian passport. Her parents are both sworn atheists as members of the Communist Party, but her father is of [[Muslim]] background and Goga is [[Jewish]] through her maternal grandmother. [[Halakha|Halachically Jewish]], Goga notes she did not need to convert to marry Ashkenazy in a Jewish ceremony. She also says that in her purse she carries a page from a 1,200-year-old [[Torah]].&lt;ref name="nymag"/&gt;

Ashkenazi had an extramarital affair with billionaire [[Timur Kulibayev]], the son-in-law of the [[Nursultan Nazarbayev|president of Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="standard2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ft2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuper|first1=Simon|title=Lunch with the FT: Goga Ashkenazi|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b011a812-d8da-11e2-84fa-00144feab7de.html|accessdate=3 October 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Kulibayev have two sons: Adam, born in 2007 and Alan, born in 2012. She divides her time between Milan, where she works on Vionnet, and London, where her children live.&lt;ref name="nymag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times2013"/&gt;

She is close friends with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]],&lt;ref name="standard2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dm2010"/&gt; as well as banker Nat Rothschild, real estate developer Nick Candy, Duran Duran band member Nick Rhodes and Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
She played the part of a G.I. in the Cineville production G.I.Jesus.

'''Hanwha Group''' ({{korean|hangul=한화그룹|rr=Hanhwa Geurup}})  is one of the largest business conglomerates (''[[chaebol]]'') in South Korea. Founded in 1952 as '''Korea Explosives Co.''' ({{korean|hangul='''한'''국'''화'''약주식회사|hanja='''韓'''國'''火'''藥株式會社 }}), the group has grown into a large multi-profile business conglomerate, with diversified holdings stretching from explosives, their original business, to retail to financial services. In 1992 the company adopted its abbreviation as the new name: "Hanwha".

The group owns [[Hanwha Eagles]], which is a professional baseball club in South Korea. The current Chairman of Hanwha is [[Kim Seung-yeon]].

Hanwha has 56 affiliates in South Korea alone and 226 networks (affiliates, branches and representative offices) around the world (as of June 2016).
However, on the other branches, other ceos have taken root. Some include Kim Ji-Dilleon and others.

== Branding and Localization ==

The Chinese branding for Hanwha is 韓華 (Simplified Chinese is 韩华). Chinese is the only foreign language in which Hanwha has a translated name. Officially, hanja(韓華) has not been used in South Korea.

'''Harvey Grenville Ward''' (1927 — 1995) was Director-General of the [[Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;''Monday World'', journal of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], October 1982, vol.2, no.5, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; noted for his [[anti-communism]] and for his support for [[Ian Smith]]'s government in [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]]. He was a leading member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].

==Biography==

===Background===
Ward was born in [[Southern Rhodesia]] to an English father and a South African mother. His parents settled in [[Africa]] and were engaged in enterprises such as the financing of [[railway]] construction and the building of numerous hotels. They managed the [[Victoria Falls Hotel]] until 1937. He chose a career in [[journalism]] starting with the Cape Argus and then becoming a specialist in African journalism covering the great social upheavals of the late 1950s and 60's for Reuters. He then settled in Salisbury and became Head of News Services at the Rhodesia Herald, eventually becoming Director-General of the [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation]] which, in effect, put him in charge of government [[propaganda]]. Ward is said to have removed references to black sporting achievements from sports programmes carried on state television.&lt;ref&gt;''The Herald'', Harare, Zimbabwe, April 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile===
Following an armed insurrection, several years of negotiations, and finally the imposition of sanctions by South Africa at the behest of The West, the [[Ian Smith|Smith administration]] was replaced by African majority rule in 1979.  Ward described this as "the betrayal of western nations to their own kind." As a prominent supporter of the Smith administration, Ward was forced to leave [[Zimbabwe]]. He and his family moved to [[South Africa]] and advised the white minority government there on avoiding international [[economic sanctions]].

===Anti-communism===
[[Image:WGI Dinner.jpg|thumb|250px|left|At the [[Western Goals Institute]]'s 'El Salvador' Dinner, London, September 25, 1989. L to R: [[Denis Walker]], [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley|Lord Sudeley]], [[El Salvador]]'s Foreign Minister, Andrew Smith (yellow tie), and Harvey Ward (leaning forward).]]
Subsequently, Ward served as a political adviser to many African leaders and was involved in international [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]. His watch-word became "dedicated to fighting [[communism]]" and he traveled worldwide, lecturing on [[Counter insurgency|counter-insurgency]] and [[terrorism]]. He described the [[Soviet Union]] as run by "gangsters" and totally untrustworthy.

He supported the anti-communist revolts in the former [[Soviet Bloc]] saying that it was "a simple matter of good versus evil." In Africa, Ward saw no hope. "Africa is the most exploited of all the continents, and it will stay that way. There has never been any peace in Africa, and I see no end to tribal conflict, spreading of diseases and other plagues," he said.

===Monday Club===
Ward was an overseas member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]] and found himself the center of a minor sensation on July 26, 1977 when immigration officials at [[Heathrow]] Airport held him for seven hours, before formally refusing him permission to enter Britain and placing him aboard another plane to [[Munich]]. He was due to address a meeting of the Africa Committee of the Monday Club at the [[House of Lords]], organized by the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Harold Soref]] on the 29th, and visit family in [[Gloucestershire]]. On being asked why entry had never been refused on previous journeys to Britain by Ward, a [[Home Office]] spokesman said "I don't know. It may have been a mistake or oversight." Formal protests were made to the Home Office by Tory [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) [[John Biggs-Davison]], Sir [[Patrick Wall]], and [[Teddy Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', both on July 27, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he wrote an article entitled ''Zimbabwe Today'' for the Monday Club's journal, ''Monday World'', prophetic in its content.&lt;ref&gt;''Monday World'', October 1982, vol.2, no.5, p.2 - 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife died in 1986 and he moved to [[UK|Great Britain]]. Three of his four children remained in [[South Africa]].

At the October 1988 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, [[Western Goals (UK)]] (which Ward had also joined) held a fringe meeting on the subject of "International Terrorism - how the West can fight back". Harvey Ward, Sir [[Alfred Sherman]], Rev [[Martin Smyth]], MP, and [[Andrew Hunter (British politician)|Andrew Hunter]], MP, were the speakers. The latter spoke concerning top-level links between the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref&gt;''Young European'' Newsletter, December 1988 edition, published by [[Western Goals (UK)]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Ward was working for [[James Gibb Stuart]] at Ossian Books Ltd. in [[Glasgow]]. He continued to travel and lecture, and joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. 

He became an active member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], and by 1990 was a member of the Club's Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Club News'', January 1991, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character assassination===
In 1991 Ward is claimed to have worked in conjunction with South African security policeman [[Paul Erasmus]] to secretly leak false accusations against [[Winnie Mandela]] and her daughters, accusing them of being nymphomaniacs and drug abusers.  The reports were described as having come from dissidents in the [[African National Congress]], and were issued in an effort to divide the ANC's leadership. They were subsequently taken up by papers such as ''[[Independent (UK)|The Independent]]'', the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. Erasmus later acknowledged profound regret for his actions in this and other matters, and affected a reconciliation with Mandela. He claimed Ward's role in the propaganda campaign during the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Times]]'', March 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; but only after Ward had died.

===Death===
In the early 1990s Ward's fourth child Rowena, who had been in the British Police Service returned to live in South Africa and Ward followed, taking up residence in [[Port Elizabeth]] with his son, Harvey and his daughter in law Kathy. His last public engagement was speaking at the Robbie Burns Society in Port Elizabeth in March 1995. One month later had a heart attack during a game of bowls, and died.

A member of the prominent [[Lodge family]], he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in history from [[Harvard University]]. He is best known for his positions on foreign policy, especially his battle with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1919 over the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The failure of that treaty ensured that the United States never joined the [[League of Nations]].

Born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], Lodge won election to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] after graduating from Harvard. He and his close friend, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], opposed [[James G. Blaine]]'s nomination at the [[1884 Republican National Convention]], but supported Blaine in the general election against [[Grover Cleveland]]. Lodge was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1886 before joining the [[United States Senate]] in 1893.

In the Senate, he sponsored the unsuccessful [[Lodge Bill]], which sought to protect the voting rights of [[African Americans]]. He supported the [[Spanish–American War]] and called for the annexation of the [[Philippines]] after the war. He also supported immigration restrictions, becoming a member of the [[Immigration Restriction League]] and influencing the [[Immigration Act of 1917]]. Lodge served as Chairman of the [[1900 Republican National Convention|1900]] and [[1908 Republican National Convention]]s. A member of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Lodge opposed Roosevelt's [[third party (United States)|third party]] bid for president in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], but the two remained close friends.

During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, Lodge advocated entrance into [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. He became Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States Senate|Senate Republican Conference]] and Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], emerging as the leader of the Senate Republicans. He led the opposition to Wilson's Treaty of Versailles, proposing [[Lodge Reservations|twelve reservations]] to the treaty. He most strongly objected to the provision of the treaty that required all nations to repel aggression, fearing that this would erode Congressional powers and commit the U.S. to burdensome obligations. Lodge prevailed in the treaty battle and Lodge's objections would influence the [[United Nations]], the successor to the League of Nations. After the war, Lodge participated in the creation of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which sought to prevent a naval [[arms race]]. He remained in the Senate until his death in 1924.

==Early life==
Lodge was born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]]. His father was John Ellerton [[Lodge family|Lodge]]. His mother was Anna [[Cabot family|Cabot]],&lt;ref name=HenryCabotLodgeMother&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/findingaids/doc.cfm?fa=fap044|title=Henry Cabot Lodge Photographs ca. 1860–1945: Guide to the Photograph Collection|publisher=[[Massachusetts Historical Society]] Library|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through whom he was a great-grandson of [[George Cabot]]. Lodge grew up on Boston's [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] and spent part of his childhood in [[Nahant, Massachusetts]] where he witnessed the 1860 kidnapping of a [[C. Allen Thorndike Rice|classmate]] and gave testimony leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://archive.yankeemagazine.com/article/how-henry-cabot-lodge-earned-his-gold-watch | title= ''How Henry Cabot Lodge earned his gold watch'' by John Mason | publisher= Yankee Magazine | date= August 1965 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100823210632/http://archive.yankeemagazine.com/article/how-henry-cabot-lodge-earned-his-gold-watch | archivedate= 2010-08-23 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cousin to the American [[polymath]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]].

In 1872, he graduated from [[Harvard College]], where he was a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], the [[Porcellian Club]], and the [[Hasty Pudding Club]]. In 1874, he graduated from [[Harvard Law School]], and was admitted to the bar in 1875, practicing at the Boston firm now known as [[Ropes &amp; Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl M. Brauer, ''Ropes &amp; Gray 1865–1992,'' (Boston: Thomas Todd Company, 1991.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
After traveling through Europe, Lodge returned to Harvard, and in 1876, became one of the first recipients of a Ph.D. in history and government from Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Featured_Bio_Lodge.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Featured Bio Lodge|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation dealt with the Germanic origins of Anglo-Saxon land law. His teacher and mentor during his graduate studies was [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]]; Lodge maintained a lifelong friendship with Adams.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodge was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, he was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistl|title=MemberListL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:Henry Cabot Lodge cph.3a38855.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lodge in 1901]]
In 1880–1882, Lodge served in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]]. Lodge represented his home state in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1887 to 1893 and in the Senate from 1893 to 1924.

Along with his close friend Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge was sympathetic to the concerns of the [[Mugwump]] faction of the Republican Party. Nonetheless, both reluctantly supported [[James Blaine]] and [[protectionism]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884 election]]. Blaine lost narrowly.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Tucker, ''Mugwumps: Public Moralists of the Gilded Age'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Lodge was a staunch supporter of the [[gold standard]], vehemently opposing the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] and the [[silverite]]s, who were led by the populist Democrat [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896.

Lodge was easily reelected time and again but his greatest challenge came in his reelection bid in January 1911. The Democrats had made significant gains in Massachusetts and the Republicans were split between the progressive and conservative wings, with Lodge trying to mollify both sides. In a major speech before the legislature voted, Lodge took pride in his long selfless service to the state. He emphasized that he had never engaged in corruption or self-dealing. He rarely campaigned on his own behalf but now he made his case, explaining his important roles in civil service reform, maintaining the gold standard, expanding the Navy, developing policies for the Philippine Islands, and trying to restrict immigration by illiterate Europeans, as well as his support for some progressive reforms. Most of all he appealed to party loyalty. Lodge was reelected by five votes.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge: A Biography'' (1953) 280-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodge was very close to Theodore Roosevelt for both of their entire careers. However, Lodge was too conservative to accept Roosevelt's attacks on the judiciary in 1910, and his call for the initiative, referendum, and recall. Lodge stood silent when Roosevelt broke with the party and ran as a third-party candidate in 1912. Lodge voted for Taft instead of Roosevelt; after Woodrow Wilson won the election the Lodge-Roosevelt friendship resumed.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, ''Henry Cabot Lodge: A Biography'' (1953) 287-91, 323&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights===
In 1890, Lodge co-authored the [[Lodge Bill|Federal Elections Bill]], along with Sen. [[George Frisbie Hoar]], that guaranteed federal protection for [[African American]] voting rights. Although the proposed legislation was supported by President [[Benjamin Harrison]], the bill was blocked by filibustering Democrats in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kirt H.

In 1891, he became a member of the Massachusetts Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. He was assigned national membership number 4,901.

That same year, following the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynching of eleven Italian Americans]] in New Orleans, Lodge published an article blaming the victims and proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Leach|first1=Eugene E.|title=Mental Epidemics: Crowd Psychology and American Culture, 1890–1940|journal=American Studies|publisher=Mid-America American Studies Association|volume=33|issue=1|date=1992|jstor=40644255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lodge|first1=Henry Cabot|title=Lynch Law and Unrestricted Immigration|journal=The North American Review|date=May 1891|volume=152|issue=414|pages=602–612|jstor=25102181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish–American War===
Lodge was a strong backer of U.S. intervention in [[Cuba]] in 1898, arguing that it was the moral responsibility of the United States to do so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the sympathies of the American people, generous, liberty-loving, I have no question. They are with the Cubans in their struggle for freedom. I believe our people would welcome any action on the part of the United States to put an end to the terrible state of things existing there. We can stop it. We can stop it peacefully. We can stop it, in my judgment, by pursuing a proper diplomacy and offering our good offices. Let it once be understood that we mean to stop the horrible state of things in Cuba and it will be stopped. The great power of the United States, if it is once invoked and uplifted, is capable of greater things than that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following American victory in the [[Spanish–American War]], Lodge came to represent the imperialist faction of the Senate, those who called for the annexation of the [[Philippines]]. Lodge maintained that the United States needed to have a strong navy and be more involved in foreign affairs.

===Immigration===
[[File:Cabotlodgebritannica.jpg|thumb|left|Lodge in 1909]]
Lodge was a vocal proponent of immigration restrictions, for a number of reasons. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, large numbers of immigrants, primarily from Eastern and Southern Europe, were flooding into industrial centers. Lodge feared that unskilled foreign labor was undermining the standard of living for American workers, and that a mass influx of uneducated immigrants would result in social conflict and national decline.

His position was also influenced by his beliefs about race. In a May 1891 article on Italian immigration, Lodge expressed his concern that immigration by "the races who have peopled the United States" was declining, while "the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood" was on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge (1891), p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; He considered northern Italians superior to southern Italians, not only because they tended to be better educated, but because they were more "Teutonic" than their southern counterparts, whose immigration he sought to restrict.&lt;ref name="puleo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|title=The Boston Italians|date=2007|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807050361|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jET-HIcybREC&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="puleo2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|title=Dark Tide: The Great Molasses Flood of 1919|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807096673|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWtJGLG0aEcC&amp;pg=PA34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodge was a supporter of "100% Americanism," a common theme in the nativist movement of the era. In an address to the New England Society of Brooklyn in 1888, Lodge stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let every man honor and love the land of his birth and the race from which he springs and keep their memory green. It is a pious and honorable duty. But let us have done with British-Americans and Irish-Americans and German-Americans, and so on, and all be Americans ... If a man is going to be an American at all let him be so without any qualifying adjectives; and if he is going to be something else, let him drop the word American from his personal description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lodge |first1=Henry Cabot |title=Speeches |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |date=1892 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IQhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He did not believe, however, that all races were equally capable or worthy of being assimilated. In "The Great Peril of Unrestricted Immigration" he wrote that "you can take a Hindoo and give him the highest education the world can afford ... but you cannot make him an Englishman", and cautioned against the mixing of "higher" and "lower" races:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the moral qualities of the English-speaking race, therefore, rest our history, our victories, and all our future. There is only one way in which you can lower those qualities or weaken those characteristics, and that is by breeding them out. If a lower race mixes with a higher in sufficient numbers, history teaches us that the lower race will prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lodge|first1=Henry Cabot|editor1-last=Frink|editor1-first=Henry Allyn|title=The New Century Speaker for School and College|date=1898|publisher=Ginn|pages=177–179|chapter=The Great Peril of Unrestricted Immigration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pYAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the public voice of the [[Immigration Restriction League]], Lodge argued in support of literacy tests for incoming immigrants. The tests would be designed to exclude members of those races he deemed "most alien to the body of the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Thomas H. |authorlink=Thomas H. O'Connor |title=The Boston Irish: A Political History |publisher=Back Bay Books |date=1995 |isbn=0-316-62661-9 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that the United States should temporarily shut out all further entries, particularly persons of low education or skill, the more efficiently to assimilate the millions who had come. From 1907 to 1911, he served on the [[Dillingham Commission]], a joint congressional committee established to study the era's immigration patterns and make recommendations to Congress based on its findings. The Commission's recommendations led to the [[Immigration Act of 1917]].

===World War I===
Lodge was a staunch advocate of entering [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], attacking President [[Woodrow Wilson]] for poor military preparedness and accusing pacifists of undermining American patriotism. After the United States entered the war, Lodge continued to attack Wilson as hopelessly idealistic, assailing Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] as unrealistic and weak. He contended that Germany needed to be militarily and economically crushed and saddled with harsh penalties so that it could never again be a threat to the stability of Europe. However, apart from policy differences, even before the end of Wilson's first term and well before America's entry into the Great War, Lodge confided to Teddy Roosevelt, "I never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred I feel toward Wilson."&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A. Scott|title=Wilson|year=2013|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-399-15921- -3|pages=612|url=http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780399159213,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] (1919–1924). 
He also served as chairman of the [[Senate Republican Conference]] from 1918 to 1924. His leadership of the Senate Republicans has led some to retrospectively call him the de facto [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]].&lt;ref name="USS19aug2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Cabot Lodge Senate Leader, Presidential Foe|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/People_Leaders_Lodge.htm|website=United States Senate|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his term in office, he and another powerful senator, [[Albert J. Beveridge]], pushed for the construction of a new navy.

===League of Nations===
{{main|Lodge Reservations}}
The summit of Lodge's Senate career came in 1919, when as the unofficial Senate majority leader, he dealt with the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. He  wanted to join the [[League of Nations]] with reservations.  The Democrats in the Senate, following Wilson's direction, rejected Lodge's proposal to join the League with reservations. Republicans opposed joining under Wilson's terms of no reservations which meant the League could force the U.S. to enter a war without approval of Congress. In the end the U.S. never joined the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;David Mervin, "Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations." ''Journal of American Studies'' 4#2 (1971): 201-214.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lodge won in the long run—his reservations were incorporated into the United Nations in 1945, where the U.S. was given a veto.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Gross,  "The Charter of the United Nations and the Lodge Reservations." ''American Journal of International Law'' 41.3 (1947): 531-554. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2193313 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodge's key objection to the League of Nations was [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]]. It required all signatory nations to repel aggression of any kind if ordered to do so by the League. Lodge rejected an open-ended commitment regardless of relevance to the national security interests of the United States. He especially insisted that Congress must approve. Lodge was also motivated by political concerns; he strongly disliked President Wilson{{sfn|Brands|2008|loc=part 3 at 0:00}} and was eager to find an issue for the Republican Party to run on [[United States presidential election, 1920|in the presidential election of 1920]].

Senator Lodge argued for a powerful American role in world affairs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States is the world's best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her powerful good, and endanger her very existence. Leave her to march freely through the centuries to come, as in the years that have gone. Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance; this great land of ordered liberty. For if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.{{Sfn|Lodge|1919}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lodge appealed to the [[patriotism]] of American citizens by objecting to what he saw as the weakening of national [[sovereignty]]: "I have loved but one flag and I can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league."

The Senate was divided into a "crazy-quilt" of positions on the Versailles question.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) 507–560&lt;/ref&gt; It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bailey, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt; One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a Treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. Finally, a bi-partisan group of 13 "irreconcilables" opposed a treaty in any form. The closest the Treaty came to passage was in mid-November 1919, when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise. Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's [[stroke]] on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: "Wilson's emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped. ... Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on [[delusion]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson,'' 544, 557–560; Bailey calls Wilson's rejection, "The Supreme Infanticide," ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Treaty of Versailles went into effect but the United States did not sign it, and made separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The League of Nations went into operation, but the United States never joined. Historians agree that the League was ineffective in dealing with major issues, but they debate whether American membership would have made much difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward C. Luck|title=Mixed Messages: American Politics and International Organization, 1919–1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmeohs5LC5wC&amp;pg=PA23|year=1999|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 it was replaced by the United Nations, which assumed many of the League's procedures and peacekeeping functions, although Article X of the League of Nations was notably absent from the UN mandate. That is, the UN was structured in accordance with Lodge's plan, with the United States having a veto power in the UN which it did not have in the old League of Nations. [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], Lodge's grandson, served as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]] from 1953 to 1960.

===Washington Naval Conference ===
In 1922, President Warren G. Harding appointed Lodge as a delegate to the [[Washington Naval Conference]] (International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments), led by Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and included [[Elihu Root]] and [[Oscar Underwood]]. This was the first disarmament conference in history and had a goal of world peace through arms reduction. Attended by nine nations, the United States, [[Japan]], [[China]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Portugal]], the conference resulted in three major treaties: [[Four-Power Treaty]], Five-Power Treaty (more commonly known as the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]) and the [[Nine-Power Treaty]], as well as a number of smaller agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Leslie Buell,  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=A-02AQAAMAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Washington+Naval+Conference&amp;ots=jAcJ5ATME6&amp;sig=sWuw65fEwFlJRdILyKNfOPtdhgM#v=snippet&amp;q=Lodge&amp;f=false ''The Washington Conference''] (D. Appleton, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lodge-Fish Resolution===
In June 1922, he introduced the [[Lodge-Fish Resolution]], to illustrate American support for the British policy in Palestine per the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]].

==Legacy==
[[File:John Singer Sargent - Henry Cabot Lodge - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|150px|1890 portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]
Historian [[George E. Mowry]] argues that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Henry Cabot Lodge was one of the best informed statesmen of his time, he was an excellent parliamentarian, and he brought to bear on foreign questions a mind that was at once razor sharp and devoid of much of the moral cant that was so typical of the age. ... [Yet] Lodge never made the contributions he should have made, largely because of Lodge the person. He was opportunistic, selfish, jealous, condescending, supercilious, and could never resist calling his opponent's spade a dirty shovel. Small wonder that except for Roosevelt and Root, most of his colleagues of both parties disliked him, and many distrusted him.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Mowry, "Politicking in Acid," [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1953oct03-00030 ''The Saturday Review'' October 3, 1953, p. 30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lodge served on the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for many years. His first appointment was in 1890, as a Member of the House of Representatives, and he served until his election as a senator in 1893. He was reappointed to the Board in 1905 and served until he died in 1924. The other Regents considered Lodge to be a "distinguished colleague, whose keen, constructive interest in the affairs of the Institution led him to place his broad knowledge and large experience at its service at all times."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION AT A SPECIAL MEETING HELD JUNE 3, 1924. | date = June 3, 1924 | publisher = Smithsonian Institution | location = Washington, D.C. | page = 632 | url = https://transcription.si.edu/transcribe/11810/SIA-SIA_000001_BORMTG_1920-1931_188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Lodge (Yakutat)|Mount Lodge]], also named ''Boundary Peak 166'', located on the [[Canada–United States border]] in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] was named in 1908 after him in recognition of his service as [[U.S. Boundary Commissioner]] in 1903.&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{cite gnis |id=1420628 |name=Mount Lodge |accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1871, he married Anna "Nannie" Cabot Mills Davis,{{sfn|Zimmermann|2002|p=157}} daughter of Admiral [[Charles Henry Davis]]. They had three children:
*Constance Davis Lodge (1872–1948), wife of [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Augustus Peabody Gardner]] (from 1892 to 1918) and [[Brigadier General]] Clarence Charles Williams (from 1923 to 1948)
*[[George Cabot Lodge]] (1873–1909), a noted poet and politician. George's sons, [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] (1902–1985) and [[John Davis Lodge]] (1903–1985), also became politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000395|title=LODGE, John Davis - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35685">The '''history of [[business architecture]]''' has its origins in the 1980s. In the next decades business architecture has developed into a discipline of "cross-organizational design of the business as a whole"&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt; closely related to [[enterprise architecture]]. The concept of business architecture has been proposed as a blueprint of the enterprise,&lt;ref name="MKB 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OMG 2008"/&gt; as business strategy,&lt;ref name="PTD 1996"/&gt; and also as the representation of business design.&lt;ref name="SC 2010"/&gt;

The concept of business architecture has evolved over the years. It was introduced in the 1980s as [[architectural domain]]s and as activity of business design. In the 2000s the study and concept development of business architecture accelerated. By the end of the 2000s the first handbooks on business architecture were published, separate frameworks for business architecture were being developed, separate views and models for business architecture were further under construction, the business architect as a profession evolved, and more businesses added business architecture to their agenda.

By 2015 business architecture has evolved into a common practice. The business architecture body of knowledge has been developed and is updated multiple times each year, and the interest from the academic world and from top management is growing.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Overview ==
Business architecture has its roots in traditional cross-organizational design. Bodine and Hilty (2009) stipulated, that the "responsibility for the cross-organizational design of the business as a whole, the work of the Business Architect, has historically fallen to the CEO or their assignee, supported by generalist management consulting firms whose teams of MBAs work with corporate managers to transform strategy into new business configurations using the newest tools."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"&gt;Paul Arthur Bodine and Jack Hilty. "Business Architecture: An Emerging Profession," at ''businessarchitectsassociation.org,'' Business Architects Association Institute. April 28, 2009. ([http://www.businessarchitectsassociation.org/resources/Documents/Business_Architecture-An_Emerging_Profession_Edition_4-28-09.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107140443/http://www.businessarchitectsassociation.org/resources/Documents/Business_Architecture-An_Emerging_Profession_Edition_4-28-09.pdf |date=2010-11-07 }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zachman]] (2012) commented in this context, that "a lot of material has been written about business architecture (by some definition), going back to ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' (1911) by Frederick Taylor."&lt;ref name="JAZ 2012"&gt;[[John A. Zachman]] "Foreword" in: Jonathan Whelan, Graham Meaden (2012) ''Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.'' p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the roots of business architecture lies in the proposals for enterprise architecture made since the 1980s and 1990s. Bernus &amp; Noran (2010) distinguished two types of proposals. On the one hand "Proposals that created generally applicable ‘blueprints’ (later to be called reference models, partial models...) so that the activities involved in the creation (or the change) of the enterprise could refer to such a common model (or set of models)."&lt;ref name="BN 2010"&gt;[[Bernus, Peter]], and Ovidiu Noran. "[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054819/document A metamodel for enterprise architecture]," ''Enterprise Architecture, Integration and Interoperability.'' Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2010. 56-65.&lt;/ref&gt; And on the other hand "proposals which claimed that to be able to organise the creation, and later the change, of enterprises one needs to understand the life cycle of the enterprise and of its parts... the ‘Enterprise Reference Architecture’."&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;

More specific about the emerge of business architecture Whelan &amp; Meaden (2012) described, that this emerged against a backdrop of change. The business architecture is "maturing into a discipline in its own right, rising from the pool of inter-related practices that include business strategy, enterprise architecture, business portfolio planning and change management – to name but a few.&lt;ref name="WM 2012"&gt;Jonathan Whelan, Graham Meaden (2012) ''Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==

=== Concept ===
The concept of business architecture emerged in the 1980s in the field of information systems development. One of the first to mention business architecture was the British management consultant [[Edwin E. Tozer]] in the 1986 article "Developing strategies for management information systems."&lt;ref name="EET 1986"&gt;[[Tozer, Edwin E.]] "Developing strategies for management information systems." ''Long Range Planning'' 19.4 (1986): 31-40.&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of business architecture in the context of [[business information systems planning]], and distinguished:
* Business architecture, and 
* [[Information architecture]], 
And he explained, that "each entity class in the Information Architecture is represented in some database and each business function may be supported by one or more systems."&lt;ref name="EET 1986"/&gt; In this paper Tozer was "prescriptive about the order in which [strategy] issues should be identified.",&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Jane, and Pam Hinton. "Case study-an information systems strategy: development and evolution at the University of Hertfordshire." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and focussed on "IS adaptability to organizational strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Palanisamy, Ramaraj. "Measurement and Enablement of Information Systems for Organizational Flexibility: An Empirical Study." Journal of Services Research 3.2 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First models ===
The American organizational theorist [[William R. Synnott]] (1987) presented one of the first models of business architecture, (see image), in the context of [[data management]]. Synnott wanted to develop an overall Information Resource Management (IRM) architecture, and proposed business architecture as its foundation. He described: 
[[File:Business architecture by Synnott, 1987 (2).svg|thumb|360px|Business architecture by Synnott, 1987]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Business architecture is the foundation upon which the IRM architecture rests. The architectural model consists of a set of building-blocks of linked architectures which together form the basis for the technology infrastructure of the firm... In the figure data architecture and communication architecture are shown as horizontal bars because these are corporate-wide information resource components. They serve all business units. The four vertical resource components are business specific. The resources can be divided according to the business units they serve. That us, data and communication might be centralizes resources, whereas human resources (professional systems staffs), computers, user-computing, and systems could all be decentralized resources to one degree or another.&lt;ref name="WRS 1987"&gt;[[William R. Synnott]] (1987). ''The Information Weapon: Winning Customers and Markets With Technology.'' p. 199-220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This model of Information Resource Management (IRM) distinguished seven types of architecture: 
* ''Centralized'': Business architecture, [[Data architecture]], and Communication architecture 
* ''Decentralized'' : Human resources architecture, [[Computer architecture]], User-computing architecture, and [[Systems architecture]].

This type of architectural model classifies different types of architecture. In the later theories and models different sets of architectures have been proposed. For example, the late 1980s [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]] distinguished five types, and this was incorporated in the 1990s [[Federal Enterprise Architecture]], which contained four types of architecture.

=== Base for the total development process ===
Synnott (1987) furthermore described, how business architecture should work and introduced the idea of architectural planning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The business architecture of the company (organization structure, strategic business units and missions, product and services) is the foundation of IRM planning. Since every company has an existing architecture, architectural planning begins with an inventory of the firm's information resources. Assembling the various information resource components' inventories results in an "as is" picture of the corporation's technology structure. From this inventory, the CIO can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the company's information resources, particularly as they relate to business information needs as identified in the strategic planning process. From this analysis one can evolve an architectural plan, which is a "to be" picture of where one wants to go and how to get there, not just a picture of the status quo.&lt;ref name="WRS 1987"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cees J. Schrama. (1988) of the European [[International Federation for Information Processing#IFIP TC8|IFIP Technical Committee on Information Systems]] IFIP TC8 presented the opinion, that "business architecture is required to provide a solid base for the total development process." He pictured another model consisted of elements such as information processing architecture and network architecture, and explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Business architecture] contains the fundamentals for the information processing architecture, where process data, support systems and network architecture are performed. In business architecture the following can 'be identified:
:- enterprise analysis: to indicate the business domains
:- business analysis
:- Information systems planning
There are some basic elements in business architecture: management, organization, processes to be performed and data to be made available/delivered. In the past, when mainly operational systems were developed, the processes received considerable attention. Information was seen as being needed to perform processes. This is changing. It is becoming important to have data available to serve information retrieval needs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Cees J. Schrama. "Composition and Decomposition in the Development of IS," in: Péter Kovács &amp; [[Elek Straub]] (editors). ''Governmental and Municipal Information Systems: Proceedings of the IFIP TC8 Conference on Governmental and Municipal Information Systems, Budapest, Hungary, September 8–11, 1987.'' [[IFIP TC8]], 1988. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These ideas around the concept of architectural planning evolved in th early 1990s into frameworks, such as [[TAFIM]], the predecessor of [[TOGAF]].

=== View models of enterprise architecture ===
In the 1987 article "A Framework for Information Systems Architecture" [[John Zachman]] presented some of the principles of Enterprise architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Zachman, John A. "A framework for information systems architecture." ''IBM systems journal'' 26.3 (1987): 276-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Framework for information systems architecture ===
[[File:NIST AE model 1989.jpg|thumb|240px|[[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]], one of the first EA models, 1989.]]
In the 5th [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model#NIST workshop on Information Management Directions|NIST workshop on Information Management Directions]] (1989) a working groups under guidance of [[W. Bradford Rigdon]] developed one of the first [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]s, the [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]]. In this model business architecture was incorporated as one of the layers of Enterprise Architecture. Bradford Rigdon et al. (1989) brought it like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A discussion of architecture must take into account different levels of architecture. These levels can be illustrated by a pyramid, with the business unit at the top and the delivery system at the base. An enterprise is composed of one or more Business Units that are responsible for a specific business area. The five levels of architecture are
* Business Unit 
* Information 
* Information System
* Data 
* Delivery System
The levels are separate yet interrelated... The idea if an [[enterprise architecture]] reflects an awareness that the levels are logically connected and that a depiction at one level assumes or dictates that architectures at the higher level.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Bradford Rigdon]] (1989) "Architectures and Standards". In: ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge'' E.N. Fong and A.H. Goldfine (eds). NIST Sept 1989. p. 137; Partly cited in: IT Governance Institute (2005) ''Governance of the Extended Enterprise''. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the original 1989 illustration of the NIST AE Framework (see image) the top layer was named "Business Unit Architecture." In representation of this model in the 1990s the top layer was named "Business architecture."

== 1990s ==

=== The unfolding information age ===
In the 1990s the [[information age]] was unfolding&lt;ref&gt;[[Zachman, John A.]] "[http://www.cioindex.com/nm/articlefiles/63503-EAIssueForTheCenturyZachman.pdf Enterprise architecture: The issue of the century]." ''Database Programming and Design'' 10.3 (1997): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt; changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture...&lt;ref name= "JG 1999"&gt;[[Gharajedaghi, Jamshid]]. ''Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity: A platform for designing business architecture.'' Elsevier, 1999; 2nd ed. 2005, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bodine and Hilty (2009) "important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]‘s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;

=== Descriptions ===
In the 1990s works the concept of business architecture is presented in distinguished ways: 
* ''As activity'' : Lindsay &amp; Price (1991) for example presented business architecture as a "self security activity," which included the "study of a function, including its component organizations, tools, methods, and relationships, both internal and external... The very activity of identifying and listing all these elements is an important learning process for managers. In addition to the element identification and listing processes, the architecture develops a set of principles. Principles are semi-permanent statements of philosophy. That is, they are the basic rules by which managers agree they want to operate."&lt;ref&gt;David T. Lindsay, W. L. Price, ''Information security: proceedings of the IFIP TC11 Seventh International Conference on Information Security--Creating Confidence in Information Processing, IFIP/Sec '91, Brighton, UK, 15–17 May 1991.'' 1991, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''As blueprint or model of the enterprise'' : Bourke (1994) described it as "a set of integrated blueprints of the ... [enterprise]'s business processes,"&lt;ref name="MKB 1994"&gt;Michael K. Bourke (1994). Strategy and architecture of health care information systems. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and Veasey (1994) spoke of business architecture as "a model of the enterprise which is a mechanism for the management of change."&lt;ref&gt;Veasey, Philip W. "Managing a programme of business re-engineering projects in a diversified business." ''Long Range Planning'' 27.5 (1994): 124-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''As strategy for any change program'' : Davis (1996) for example described that business architecture can be used to "describe the type of comprehensive plan required to set the stage for integrated change programmes. The term "architecture" connotes the level of creativity and holistic change required to achieve process excellence. A comprehensive business architecture defines the way in which human performance, processes and technology will be integrated to transform business performance and create value."&lt;ref name="PTD 1996"&gt;Peter T. Davis (1996) ''Securing Client/server Computer Networks.'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Business architectures is presented as tool for [[change management]], acknowledged Van Rensburg (1997). It "provide organisations with the means to understand organisational activities in such a manner that it is used as a mechanism to support the organisation through the business transformation process. Using an object-oriented modelling approach in the design of the business architecture allows for a robust modelling approach which captures real world instances in a business architecture repository. This enables the creation and caption of organisational understanding required for the transformation process."&lt;ref&gt;Van Rensburg, A. C. J. "An object-oriented architecture for business transformation." Computers &amp; industrial engineering 33.1 (1997): 167-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FEA and business subarchitecture ===
In 1996 the US government introduced the [[Clinger–Cohen Act]], to improve the acquisition and management of their information resources.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Enterprise reference architecture ===
Beside the enterprise architecture frameworks a second type of architectural models were proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were called Enterprise Reference Architecture.&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; 
* GRAI-GIM ([[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts]], 1987)
* [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]] ([[Theodore J. Williams|Williams]] 1994)
* [[CIMOSA]] (CIMOSA Association 1996), 
* [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems]] ([[August-Wilhelm Scheer|Scheer]] 1999), and 
* [[GERAM]] (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999)

=== Foundation ===
In 1999 two works on business architecture and its foundation were published, which became two of the most cited works on business architecture. In his "Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity" [[Jamshid Gharajedaghi]] presented a set of principles to design business architecture, which were based on [[systems thinking]]. Gharajedaghi argued, that business Architecture should be considered a [[system]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Business Architecture is a general description of a [[system]]. It identifies its purpose, vital functions, active elements, and critical processes and defines the nature of the interaction among them. Business architecture consists of a set of distinct but interrelated platforms, creating a multidimensional modular system. Each platform represents a dimension of the system, signifying a unique mode of behavior with a predefined set of performance criteria and measures.&lt;ref name= "JG 1999"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IBM researcher Douglas W. McDavid presented the paper "A standard for business architecture description." According to Evernden &amp; Evernden (2003) this paper described a "high-level semantic framework of standard business concepts – abstracted from experience, enterprise business models, the organization of business terminology and the various generic industry reference models. There is an excellent discussion on what constitutes business architecture and the nature and use of information categories, although concepts such as product and agreement seem to be missing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Evernden]], Elaine Evernden (2003). Information First: Integrating Knowledge and Information. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; McDavid argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concepts in the Business Architecture description provide a semantic framework for speaking about common business concerns... For our purposes, this semantic structure provides a common set of concept patterns to be able to understand the types of content that needs to be supported in technology-based information systems... a set of generic concepts and their interrelationships organize business information content in terms of requirements on the business, the boundary of the business, and the business as a system for delivery of value.&lt;ref&gt;McDavid, Douglas W. "A standard for business architecture description." IBM Systems Journal 38.1 (1999): 12-31.; As cited in: Glissman &amp; Sanz (2009, p. 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business architect ===
According to Bodine and Hilty (2009)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The arrival of Internet technologies like email, instant messaging and online data repositories in the mid-1990s opened up tremendous flexibilities in the ways co-workers could collaborate, while the new ability of buyers and sellers to interact in virtual space and transact online changed the traditional structure of businesses...
By the late 1990s, MBAs with advanced skills in Internet technologies began developing live business models for e-commerce websites in real-time. They used the development tools to both represent and build the business at the same time. The model became the business, and thousands were launched, allowing companies to access vast volumes of data and respond rapidly to changing market conditions... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ at the time returned just 12 results... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ in 2009 returns over 1 million listings.
This is just the beginning of a valuable and rapidly expanding profession. Today‘s Business Architects take a holistic view of the complete business representing all interests and engaging all expertise. They see the business organization as a constantly changing, dynamic organism that balances central planning with individual initiative to achieve its mission through the articulate implementation of its corporate strategy.&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Tools and frameworks ===
According to Bodine and Hilty (2009)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]‘s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bernus &amp; Noran (2010):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Architecture Frameworks have been used in many industries, including the domains of industrial automation / manufacturing / production management, business information systems (of various kinds), telecommunications and defence. Part of the Enterprise Architecture practice is ‘enterprise engineering’ and the practice of ‘enterprise modelling’ (or just modelling) and complete AFs describe the scope of modelling (which later can be summaised as a Modelling Framework that is part of the AF).&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One specific type of Framework is called the "Enterprise Reference Architecture." According to Bernus &amp; Noran (2010):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several proposals emerged in those two decades – e.g. [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]] (Williams 1994), [[CIMOSA]] (CIMOSA Association 1996), ARIS (Scheer 1999), GRAI-GIM ([[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts]], 1987), and the IFIP-IFAC Task Force, based on a thorough review of these as well as their proposed generalisation (Bernus and Nemes, 1994) developed [[GERAM]] (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999) which then became the basis of ISO15704:2000 “Industrial automation systems – Requirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies”...&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business Architecture Working Group ===
{{main article|OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group}}
The Business Architecture Special Interest Group (BASIG) is a working group on business architecture of the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). This working group was founded in 2007 as the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG).

=== Business strategy ===
In the 2006 article "Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT," [[Gerrit Versteeg (enterprise architect)|Versteeg]] &amp; [[Harry Bouwman|Bouwman]] explained the relation between business architecture, business activities and business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schelp, Joachim, and [[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]. "Language communities in enterprise architecture research." ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Design Science Research in Information Systems and Technology.'' ACM, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We use the concept of '[[Business Architecture]]’ to structure the responsibility over business activities prior to any further effort to structure individual aspects (processes, data, functions, organization, etc.). The business architecture arranges the responsibilities around the most important business activities (for instance production, distribution, marketing, et cetera) and/or economic activities (for instance manufacturing, assembly, transport, wholesale, et cetera) into domains &lt;ref&gt;[[Gerrit Versteeg (enterprise architect)|Versteeg, Gerrit]] &amp; [[Harry Bouwman|Bouwman]] (2006, p. 92), as cited in: McClure, Mark. ''[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/7665/2007-mcclure.pdf Framing a Collaborative Enterprise Architecture Governance Program within the Context of Service-Oriented Software Systems Development].'' University of Oregon Applied Information Management Program, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Versteeg &amp; Bouwman also stipulated, that "the perspectives for subsequent design next to organization are more common: information architecture, technical architecture, process architecture. The various parts (functions, concepts and processes) of the business architecture act as a compulsory starting point for the different subsequent architectures. It pre-structures other architectures. Business architecture models shed light on the scantly elaborated relationships between business strategy and business design. We will illustrate the value of business architecture in a case study."&lt;ref name="GHV 2006"&gt;Versteeg, G &amp; H. Bouwman. "Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT." ''Information Systems Frontiers'' 8 (2006) pp. 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handbooks ===
In the 2010 the first handbooks on Business architecture were published. In the US William M. Ulrich and Neal McWhorter of the OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group published the "Business Architecture: The Art and Practice of Business Transformation," in 2010.

In 2012 in Britain the business consultants Jonathan Whelan and Graham Meaden published their "Business Architecture: A Practical Guide."&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W 2012"&gt;Meaden &amp; Whelan 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
In several sources in the exact definition of "business architecture" is under review. InN 2008 Jeff Scott had commented in this matter: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Interest in business architecture is growing dramatically. During the past two years both IT and business leaders have joined the discussion about the need for a well-defined business architecture. Though there is a great deal of discussion, there is little consensus about what business architecture is, how it should be pursued, and what value it delivers. Business architects in IT as well as in the business have started developing business-unit-wide and enterprise-wide business architectures, learning as they go. Their ultimate goals are to improve business decision-making and facilitate better alignment between IT and the business units it supports. Architecture teams that want to play a leading role in business architecture development must start soon or be left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Scott (2008), ''Business Architecture’s Time Has Come,'' Forrester Publication. (summary at ''forrester.com'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sources came to the same conclusion, that over the years many different definitions of business architecture have been proposed&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittle &amp; Myrick (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerrie Holley, Ali Arsanjani. ''100 SOA Questions: Asked and Answered,'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Malik, "[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nickmalik/archive/2012/09/11/many-flawed-definitions-of-business-architecture.aspx Many (flawed) Definitions of Business Architecture]," ''blogs.msdn.com,'' 11 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more notable definitions have described business architecture as: 
:* "A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands" - [[OMG Business Architecture Working Group]], 2008&lt;ref name="OMG 2008"&gt;[[OMG Business Architecture Working Group]]. "Business Architecture Working Group," at ''bawg.omg.org,'' Oct 10, 2008.  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081006052814/http://bawg.omg.org/ archive.org, Oct. 10, 2008]).&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* "The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes information, as well as the interaction between these concepts." - TOGAF, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[[The Open Group]]. ''TOGAF™ Version 9 Foundation Study Guide,'' 2009, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* "The formal representation and active management of business design." - SOA Consortium, EA2010 Working group on Business Architecture, 2010&lt;ref name="SC 2010"&gt;SOA Consortium, EA2010 working group. ''[http://www.soa-consortium.org/EA2010_Business_Architecture.pdf Business Architecture; The Missing Link between Business Strategy and Enterprise Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130051908/http://www.soa-consortium.org/EA2010_Business_Architecture.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}.'' Copyright by OMG, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion kept going. [[John Zachman]] (2012) declared in this matter, that "a lot of people define business architecture differently (I know a lot of people who have a lot of different opinions and definitions for business architecture). Not too many people do business architecture, at least not in a comprehensive and definitive fashion (in my estimation)..."&lt;ref name="JAZ 2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;!--
=== Approaches ===
--&gt;

== Roots in various academic domains ==
Ideas and definitions about business architecture originate from different academic sub disciplines, where the concept of business architecture and methods and techniques are developing in numerous initiatives. A selection of related subfields:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
:* [[Organizational theory]] inspired by [[systems thinking]], [[cybernetics]], [[complexity science]], etc.
:* [[Systems analysis]] and [[Systems design|design]], [[system engineering]], [[business engineering]], [[business modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[business process management]], [[business process reengineering]]&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt; etc.
:* [[Software engineering]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[information technology management]], etc.
:* [[Enterprise architecture]], [[enterprise engineering]],&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; [[enterprise modeling]],&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; [[enterprise ontology]], [[enterprise resource planning]], etc.

== Field of practice ==
Guitarte (2013) stipulated, that also different types of organizations have been active, and created a so-called "business architecture vortex.” He listed four types:

:* Influencers: Academe, Various authors, [[Cutter Consortium|Cutter]], [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], Media, [[Gartner]], IIR
:* Third-party vendors: Metastorm, [[IBM]], [[Sparx Systems|Sparx]], [[Troux Technologies|Troux]], [[MEGA International Srl.|Mega]], BrainstormCentral, Pega, BAI, [[Business Process Management Initiative|BPMI]], Progress
:* Communities of practice: [[Business Architecture Guild]], Business Architecture Society, BAA, BizArchCommunity, BAA, IIBA, [[Project Management Institute|PMI]], AOGEA
:* Standards-setting bodies: [[ISO]], BPMN, [[Object Management Group|OMG]], MDA, BASIG, [[The Open Group]], [[TOGAF]], BPM/SOA, BEI&lt;ref name="AG 2013"&gt;Andrew Guitarte, "[http://www.buildingbusinesscapability.com/presentations/2013/1252.pdf Business Architecture Trends &amp; Methods]." (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Guitarte commented, that "influencers led followed by communities of practice and standards-setting bodies; vendors followed. Conflicting ideas provide opportunity to define the future of business architecture profession."&lt;ref name="AG 2013"/&gt;

== Management interests ==
Surveys have reported a growing interest of management in business architecture, as well as on universities:
* In 2004 [[Jaap Schekkerman]] already suggested that "Enterprise Architecture was ranked near the top of the list of most important issues considered by CEO’s and CIO’s."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaap Schekkerman]], ''How to Survive in the Jungle of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks: Creating Or Choosing an Enterprise Architecture Framework,'' 2004. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain '''Sir Ion Hamilton Benn, 1st Baronet''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Territorial Decoration|TD]] (31 March 1863 – 12 August 1961) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and businessman. He was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|member of parliament]] from 1910 to 1922.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Obituary: Captain Sir Ion Hamilton Benn. Public Life And The City |day_of_week=Monday |date=14 August 1961 |page_number=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, family and business career==
Benn was born in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. He was the third son of the Reverend J. W. Benn, [[Church of Ireland]] [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Carrigaline]] and [[Douglas, County Cork|Douglas]], and his wife Maria (née Hamilton).&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whowho"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U55123 |title=Benn, Captain Sir Ion Hamilton |date=December 2007 |work=[[Who Was Who]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] and then joined Price &amp; Pierce Ltd, a leading [[timber]] firm. He later became a director and then [[chairman]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

In 1885 he married Frances Charlotte Bridges, with whom he had two children.&lt;ref name="whowho" /&gt;

==Political career==
In 1900, he was elected to [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich Borough Council]] and served as [[mayor]] from 1901 to 1902.&lt;ref name="whowho" /&gt; He was a founder member of the [[Metropolitan Water Board (London)|Metropolitan Water Board]] in 1903. He was a [[Municipal Reform Party]] member of [[London County Council]] representing Greenwich from 1907 to 1910.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whowho" /&gt; At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]] he was chosen by the [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform]] faction in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to stand against [[Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood|Lord Hugh Cecil]] the sitting Conservative MP for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] who was in favour of [[free trade]]. While Benn succeeded in beating Cecil, the split in the Conservative vote allowed [[Richard Stephens Jackson]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to take the seat.&lt;ref name=ge1906&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The General Election |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=16 January 1906 |page_number=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the next [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|general election in January 1910]] he was the sole Conservative candidate in the constituency and was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]].&lt;ref name="whowho" /&gt; In parliament, he was a leading opponent of [[Irish Home Rule]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Military career==
On 26 May 1906 he was appointed [[Honorary Colonel]] of the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)|2nd Volunteer Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27916 |date=25 May 1906 |page=3662  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which on 1 April 1908 became the [[20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28181 |date=29 September 1908 |page=7018 |nolink=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zone spans from the western part of [[Urayasu, Chiba|Urayasu]] in the northeast to [[Futtsu, Chiba|Futtsu]] in the southeast of the region. The zone has no political or administrative status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Keiyō Industrial Zone | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314276/Keiyō-Industrial-Zone | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | year = 2012 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The name of the industrial zone is formed from two [[kanji]] characters. The first, {{linktext|京}}, means "[[capital city]]" and refers to Tokyo. The second, {{linktext|葉}}, meaning "[[leaf]]", is the second kanji in "Chiba" and refers to Chiba Prefecture, and the compound refers to the Tokyo-Chiba region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dijitaru daijisen |title=Keiyō |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-03-26 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The Keiyō Industrial Zone spans the coast of Tokyo Bay from Urayasu in the northeast, through [[Funabashi, Chiba|Funabashi]], [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba City]], [[Kisarazu, Chiba|Kisarazu]], [[Kimitsu, Chiba|Kimitsu]], [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]], [[Sodegaura, Chiba|Sodegaura]], and ends in [[Futtsu, Chiba|Futtsu]] to the southeast. Numerous small rivers empty into the industrial region, and provide a source of water to support industry. They include the [[Edo River]], the [[Yōrō River]], and the [[Koito River]].

==History==
[[File:Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works.jpg|thumb|left|Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works]]
Before industrialization the Keiyō region was originally home to ''[[nori]]'' [[seaweed]] collection, the [[shellfish]] industry, mixed small-scale fishing and agricultural villages, and [[seaside resort|beach resorts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Keiyō Industrial Zone | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314276/Keiyō-Industrial-Zone | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | year = 2012 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Keihin region]], spanning west from Tokyo to [[Yokohama, Kanagawa|Yokohama]], was developed after [[World War I]]. With the rapid development of the [[defense industry]] in Japan from the beginning of the [[Shōwa period]] in 1926, a plan for the [[decentralization]] of industry from the immediate Tokyo area was planned in 1935.
The Keiyō Industrial Region was fully developed after [[World War II]]. Some [[land reclamation]] had been carried out in coastal areas of Tokyo Bay as part of the industrialization of Japan in the early 20th century. Reclaimed land areas replaced traditional fishing areas and supported small factories. The construction of the [[Kawasaki Steel Corporation|Kawasaki]] [[Kawasaki Steel Works|Steel Works]] in Chiba City in 1953 marked the beginning of the large-scale construction of [[heavy industry]] infrastructure in the industrial zone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Chiba-ken Kikakubu Kenminka | title = Chiba-ken hyakunen no ayumi | publisher = Chiba-ken  | year = 1973  | pages = 38|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other industries soon followed. The [[deepwater port]]s of the Keiyō Industrial Zone were built starting in the 1950s. [[Thermal power]] [[Electric generator|generator]]s were built,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Keiyō Industrial Zone | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314276/Keiyō-Industrial-Zone | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | year = 2012 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large tracts of land were reclaimed from the bay for expansion of the Keiyō region. Keiyō was significantly expanded in the 1960s. [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metal]] and [[chemical industry|chemical production]] were among the highest in Japan by the 1970s.

==Industries==

The zone is a major base for the [[electric power generation]], [[petrochemical]], [[petroleum]], [[shipbuilding]], [[logistics]], [[shipping]], and [[steel]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Keiyō Industrial Region |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-12-19 |year=2012 |publisher=Netto Adobansusha |location=Tokyo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Port of Chiba]] is a major component to the Keiyō Industrial Region.

The German Banking Act '''Kreditwesengesetz''' ('''KWG''') literally means ''law of the [[banking system]]'', is the primary legally implementation of the [[Basel Accords]]. It is binding for banks and other institutes providing financial services (German: ''[[:de:Kreditinstitut]]e und [[:de:Finanzdienstleistungsinstitut]]e'') in Germany and effective since January 1935, but updated in 1962. 

== Purpose == 
The main goals of the KWG are:
* To guarantee and safeguard the functionality of banks (literally in German: ''Sicherung und Erhaltung der Funktionsfähigkeit der Kreditwirtschaft'')
* To safeguard the [[creditor]]s from losing their [[invested capital]], i.e. any kind of [[Share (finance)|share]] (literally in German: ''Schutz der Gläubiger von Kreditinstituten vor Verlust ihrer Einlagen'')

The Kreditwesengesetz imposes restriction on risk-related business activities and extends the duty of disclosure. It ensures competences of regulators and is the legal justification of the German Solvability Directive ([[SolvV]]) and [[MaRisk]], the corresponding regulation with more detailed definitions and requirements.

[[Image:Rampart Police Station.jpg|thumb|The New Rampart Police Station]]
The '''Rampart Division''' of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) serves communities to the west of [[Downtown Los Angeles]] (DTLA) including [[Silverlake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]], [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]], [[Pico-Union, Los Angeles, California|Pico-Union]] and [[Westlake, Los Angeles, California|Westlake]], all together designated as the Rampart patrol area. Its name is derived from Rampart Boulevard, one of the principal thoroughfares in its patrol area. The original station was located at 2710 West Temple Street. It has since moved southeast to a newer facility located at 1401 West 6th Street, the site of the former Emergency Receiving Hospital. With 164,961 residents occupying a {{convert|5.4|sqmi|km2|sing=on}} area, Rampart is one of [[Los Angeles]]'s most densely populated communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/lapd/later/streets.html |title=on the LAPD |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Rampart Division==
The Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) Rampart Division (#02) was created in October 1966.  It was formed from portions of LAPD’s Central, Wilshire, University (now Southwest), and Hollywood Areas. [[William H. Parker (police officer)|William H. Parker]] was the Chief of Police at the time, and he stated that the new Rampart Division was needed to decrease the span between the Metropolitan, Hollywood, and Wilshire Areas. Several locations for the original station were considered before the Rampart Heights area was finally chosen in 1961. In 1963, the property at the southwest corner of Temple St and Benton Way was obtained, and construction began in December 1964. The total cost of the site, design, construction, equipment and furnishings was $1,419,397.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laphs.org/ - personal communication&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAPD Rampart Division Station, located at 2710 West Temple Street officially opened on October 23, 1966 under the command of Captain R. O. Bradley. Rampart  Area spanned approximately 13.7 square miles and served approximately 200,000 citizens. Its borders at the time were: Normandie Ave on the west; Santa Monica Bl, Hyperion Ave, and the Los Angeles River to the North; the 110-Pasadena/Harbor Freeway to the east; and the 10-Santa Monica Freeway to the south. As the population grew and more personnel were needed to serve the area, space became an issue. Detective functions were eventually relocated to a separate building, located at 303 S. Union Avenue.

After 40 years of wear and tear, the time came to replace the original station on Temple St. A decision was made to build the new station on the site where the aging Central Receiving Hospital was currently located.The new Rampart Community Police Station, located at 1401 W. 6th St., opened its doors on July 25, 2008 under the command of Captain III John Egan and Captain I Paul Hernandez. It was assigned approximately 275 Police Officers, 55 Detectives, and 50 civilian personnel. The new station re-united Rampart Patrol and Detectives under one roof again, serving approximately 375,000 people in an 8 square mile area.

Soon after the new Rampart Station opened, the LAPD created a new Division, the Olympic Area (#20). On January 4, 2009, Olympic Community Police Station opened its doors and assumed responsibility for a portion of what was formerly the west side of Rampart Division, from Normandie to Hoover Street. Currently, Rampart Division has about 330 personnel that provide service to approximately 164,961 inhabitants in a compact 5.54 square mile area. The population density of the Rampart Area is similar to Manhattan Island. It serves the communities of Angelino Heights, [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], Silver Lake, Historic Filipinotown, Korea Town, Lafayette Park, [[MacArthur Park|Macarthur Park]], Pico-Union, Temple-Beaudry, Virgil Village, and Westlake.

==Rampart Community Police Advisory Board (C-PAB)==
The Rampart CPAB remains active with committees addressing specific issues such as traffic, crime, youth programs, and membership. Each member is independently active in the community and has the ability to relay information to thousands of community members. CPAB members provide an extremely valuable service to the Rampart Area as they are able to relay the pulse and sentiment of the community at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacp.org/CommissionLAPD/CommNews-2012.htm|title=Police Commission News - 2012 ... LA Community Policing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community-Police Advisory Boards (C-PABs) were created in 1993 to provide community members with an opportunity to provide information and advice to their respective Area and to take information from the police department back to the community. Each of the 21 geographic Areas (community police stations) throughout Los Angeles has its own C-PAB. These advisory groups meet monthly to discuss crime and quality of life issues. Each C-PAB has two co-chairs, one of the Area commanding officer while the second is a civilian member voted on by the membership. Recently, many C-PABs have formed subcommittees in addition to the general group to tackle specific crime and quality of life problems.

==Notable Events==

===November 9, 2004 - Hostage Taker at the Mexican Consulate===
On Tuesday, November 9, 2004, at approximately 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Los Angeles Police received a 911 call of a man with a gun attempting to take a hostage inside the Mexican Consulate at 2401 W. 6th Street. Rampart Division Patrol Officers responded, and while setting up a perimeter saw a male suspect leave the building with a woman he was holding hostage. The suspect was holding her tightly from behind, with his arm around her neck and was armed with what appeared to be a handgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/november_2004/news_view/20655|title=Officer Involved Shooting Incident at the Mexican Consulate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Hector Feliciano fired one round from his handgun, striking the suspect, who released the hostage and fell to the ground. The suspect was later identified as 19-year-old Manuel Jubenal Ortiz, and the gun he was carrying was determined to be a [[starting pistol|starter pistol]]. The victim, 31-year-old Dunia Gonzalez, who was pregnant and an employee of the Mexican Consulate, was not injured. She was taken safely away from the scene by another Rampart officer. The suspect, who was injured in the officer involved shooting, was taken by rescue ambulance to the University of Southern California Medical Center (USCMC), where he later died. The FBI was handling the criminal investigation with assistance from Robbery-Homicide Division. The drama unfolded on live TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6444309/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/la-hostage-taker-pronounced-dead/#.U6SlBRYxYZY|title=Mexican consulate Hostage-taker prounced dead - US news - Crime &amp; courts - NBC News|work=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Feliciano received the LAPD's Medal of Valor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/home/content_basic_view/33361|title=2006 Medal of Valor Recipients|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorable mention commendation at the TOP COPS Award Ceremony, by NAPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/10/07/E2072_saluting-sergeant-hector-r-feliciano/|title=Saluting Sergeant Hector R.

===September 11, 2012 - Pursuit and Shoot-out with Murder &amp; Carjack Suspect===
On September 11, 2012, Rampart officers observed a vehicle reported stolen at gunpoint earlier in the day from the North Hollywood Area. Officers attempted to pull it over about 6 p.m. near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Rosemont Avenue but the suspect refused, leading police on a pursuit through Echo Park, Silver Lake and downtown for more than an hour. During the pursuit officers recognized the suspect as a person wanted in connection with a homicide earlier in the year. The chase ended when the driver crashed into another vehicle at the intersection of South Bixel and West 7th streets. The suspect exited the stolen car with an assault rifle and engaged officers in shoot-out until he was wounded and taken into custody. No officers were hurt. The civilian from the car that the suspect crashed into was rescued by officers and led away to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/09/man-who-fired-assault-rifle-at-police-following-pursuit-is-identified.html|title=Man shot by police after pursuit and gun battle is identified|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their actions of bravery above and beyond the call of duty, officers from LAPD's Rampart, Olympic, and Metropolitan Divisions were recognized at a White House ceremony by President [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/05/11/president-obama-honors-nations-top-cops|title=President Obama Honors the Nations TOP COPS|work=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; and honored with the prestigious Top Cop Award by [[National Association of Police Organizations|NAPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policeone.com/police-heroes/articles/6263939-2013-Top-Cops-honored-in-DC-ceremony/|title=2013 ‘Top Cops’ honored in DC ceremony|work=PoliceOne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Rampart Scandal==
{{main|Rampart scandal}}
The [[Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums]] (CRASH) anti-[[gang]] program initiated under the direction of LAPD Chief [[Daryl F. Gates]] in the late 1970s had encountered some success in the Rampart Division.  However, in 1998–2000, graphic allegations of extreme police misconduct among Rampart's CRASH squad began to emerge.  This misconduct involved several officers and detectives, most notably [[Rafael Pérez (police officer)|Rafael Perez]]. Perez was suspected of being involved in a bank robbery committed by another Rampart Division officer, [[David Mack (police officer)|David Mack]]; he also stole 6 lbs. of cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker, which eventually led to his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0003/12/sm.01.html |title=CNN.com |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=2000-03-12 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most egregious act involved the shooting—and framing—of unarmed gang member [[Javier Ovando]]. Perez originally claimed that Ovando had opened fire at both Perez and another officer, [[Nino Durden]].  The two officers then returned fire, leaving Ovando paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/sep1999/lapd-s23.shtml |title=Ovando Shooting |publisher=Wsws.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/1999/091599javolv.html |title=StreetGangs.com |publisher=StreetGangs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perez and Durden then framed Ovando for the attack, and he was found guilty and sentenced to 23 years in prison (Ovando was released when Perez admitted to shooting and framing him).&lt;ref name="PBS Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/lapd/scandal/cron.html |title=PBS Timeline |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After several other incidents, the LAPD became suspicious of Perez and began to investigate him.  Perez later pleaded guilty to the cocaine theft in exchange for information about other corrupt officers within the Rampart Division.  In turn, Perez implicated approximately 70 officers of misconduct.

==Popular culture==

* ''Adam-12'' (TV series)
Although not set in the Rampart Division, the long-running television series ''[[Adam-12]]'' featured the Rampart Division station on Temple Street as the setting for the series.  However, according to the radio call sign of the unit "1-Adam 12", the station is actually the Central Division station (Division One), which serves [[Downtown Los Angeles]].

* ''Southland'' (TV series)
[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]] featured the new Rampart Division station at 1401 W. 6th St in roll call room and station scenes. The critically acclaimed series ran from 2009 to 2013. Southland takes a "raw and authentic look" at Los Angeles and the lives of the LAPD officers who police it. The show's first season centers on the experiences and interactions of LAPD patrol officers and detectives, and is more a character-driven drama than a police procedural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/reviews/2009/04/01/the-futons-first-look-southland-nbc-30876/20090401_southland/|title=Rants &amp; Reviews - The Futon's First Look: "Southland" (NBC) - TheFutonCritic.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the characters are rookie Officer Ben Sherman and his training officer, John Cooper who, unknown to most of his colleagues, is homosexual; Detective Lydia Adams, who must balance work with the responsibility of living with her mother; Officer Chickie Brown, who aspires to be the first woman on the LAPD's elite SWAT team; and Detective Sammy Bryant, whose home life interferes with his working life. After its first season on NBC, Southland moved to TNT network. The second season placed less emphasis on the ensemble cast, instead focusing more on the Adams, Sherman, Cooper and Bryant characters and their partners. Also, the weekly stories centered more on how crimes came together, with fewer serialized story lines.

* ''Colors'' (film)
The 1988 [[film]] ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]],'' starring Academy Award–winning actors [[Robert Duvall]] and [[Sean Penn]] (and directed by [[Dennis Hopper]]), attempted to realistically show police work by portraying the lives of a veteran and a rookie LAPD officer partnered together in a gang-infested part of Los Angeles. The film actually uses the real-life CRASH acronym as the division Duvall and Penn's characters are working under.

* ''Training Day'' (film)
The 2001 film ''[[Training Day]]'' starred Academy Award-winner [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] (and was directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]]). The film, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of a young LAPD officer, Jake Hoyt (Hawke), as he is subjected to a uniquely challenging evaluation by Alonzo Harris (Washington), a highly decorated detective with the LAPD narcotics division, to see if he has what it takes to be a "narc" (narcotics officer). The entire film takes place over a single intense 24-hour period in Los Angeles. It was partly based on and heavily influenced by the Rampart Division CRASH unit and [[Rampart scandal|the surrounding scandal]].

* ''Crash'' (film)
In the 2004 film, [[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]], an off-duty black police officer is shot by an off-duty white officer in a turn of events very similar to the shooting of Kevin Gaines. The said black officer is, later, found to be corrupt, just like in the case of Kevin Gaines. However, in the film the corrupt nature of the black officer is suppressed by the city district attorney in order to not lose the black vote.

* ''The Shield'' (TV series)
[[FX Networks|FX Networks']] hit series ''[[The Shield]]'' is inspired by Rampart's C.R.A.S.H. unit. Originally called "Rampart" when the first ads were run, the show's title was later changed at the request of the LAPD. By calling the show "Rampart", the LAPD claimed that the show's graphic content would portray them as corrupt. Consequently, the show was set up in the fictional Farmington Division ("the Farm") of Los Angeles (based on [[East Los Angeles (region)|East]] and [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]]), using a converted church ("the Barn") as their police station. The show primarily follows the activities of Detective [[Vic Mackey]] (portrayed by Emmy winner [[Michael Chiklis]]) and the corrupt detectives under his command, [[Shane Vendrell]], [[Curtis Lemansky]], and [[Ronnie Gardocki]], who make up the "Strike Team", a special experimental LAPD unit specializing in anti-gang activity and anti-drug and weapon trafficking.

* ''Dirty'' (film)
Another portrayal of the Rampart Scandal can be seen in the film ''[[Dirty (film)|Dirty]]'', which follows two corrupt members of an LAPD anti-gang unit (portrayed by [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]] and Academy Award winner [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]]) through a day at work, showing actions such as the killing of gang members, theft of narcotics evidence, and planting of evidence on shooting victims, and showing the eventual consequences of these actions.

* ''Echo Park'' (novel)
[[Echo Park (novel)|Echo Park]] is a novel by  [[Michael Connelly]]. A serendipitous traffic stop in L.A.'s Echo Park neighborhood nabs Reynard Waits, a man with body parts in his van on the floorboard in front of the front seat. Detective Freddy Olivas is working the case and Richard O'Shea is the prosecutor assigned. Soon Waits has confessed to a string of slayings involving prostitutes and runaways, as well as to two earlier murders: one of a pawnshop owner during the 1992 riots, the other of Marie Gesto.

* ''Faster'' (film)
In 2010, the crime drama movie [[Faster (2010 film)|Faster]] featured a police officer played by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] who is revealed to be a corrupt former Rampart CRASH officer.

* ''Rampart'' (film)
''[[Rampart (film)|Rampart]]'' is a 2011 feature film derived from the Rampart Scandal and starring [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Ben Foster]] and [[Ice Cube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;raquo; by tffhthewriter April 29, 2010, 11:06am |url=http://hiphopwired.com/2010/04/29/ice-cube-to-star-in-film-based-around-cops-with-alleged-ties-to-biggie-tupac/ |title=Ice Cube To Star In Film Based Around Cops With Alleged Ties To Biggie &amp; Tupac Murders |publisher=Hip-Hop Wired |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a [[James Ellroy]] screenplay that covers both the scandal and the LAPD [[C.R.A.S.H.]] units involved, the film was directed and co-written by [[Oren Moverman]]. Harrelson portrays Dave Brown, a personally and professionally conflicted LAPD officer caught up in the aftermath of the scandal which brings him to the attention of Kyle Timkins (Ice Cube) as an internal affairs investigator. Filming was completed in December, 2010 in LA.

* ''GTA San Andreas'' (Video Game)
The plot of [[Rockstar Games]]' controversial video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', set in 1992 in a fictional version of Los Angeles, involves two corrupt CRASH officers and one that disagrees with the others. The CRASH motto, "intimidate those who intimidate others", is spoken directly by one of these characters during the course of the game.

'''Legal tender''' is a medium of [[payment]] recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Legal tender refers to that form of money which has been approved by the government as a legal form of exchange and has been guaranteed by the government to have a legal status to repay debts or exchange against some good or commodity.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper [[currency]] and [[coin]]s are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different [[jurisdiction]]s. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal [[cheque]]s, [[credit card]]s, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. [[Coin]]s and [[banknote]]s are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a [[license]] to perform [[financial transaction]]s in a foreign currency.

Generally, designation of a particular form of money as legal tender means "that the designated money is valid payment for all debts unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Horvitz, ''Monetary Policy and the Financial System'', p. 14, Prentice-Hall, 3rd ed. (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, [[vending machine]]s and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as [[invitation to treat]].{{clarify|date=August 2018}} Under the law, United States money as identified above is a valid and legal offer of payment for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor. By contrast, federal statutes do not require that someone who is not a pre-existing creditor must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services. Private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise.&lt;ref name=LTSFAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name="FRBFAQ"/&gt;

The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective.

==Etymology==
The term "legal tender" is from Middle English ''tendren'', French ''tendre'' (verb form), meaning ''to offer''. The ''Latin'' root is ''tendere'' (to stretch out), and the sense of ''tender'' as an ''offer'' is related to the etymology of the English word "extend" (to hold outward).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender Definition of '''tender''' as verb, in Merriam-Webster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424175942/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender |date=24 April 2009 }}. Retrieved 13 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawal and replacement of legal tender==

===Demonetisation===
{{See also|Monetisation|Remonetisation|Withdrawal of low-denomination coins}}
Demonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. It occurs whenever there is a change of national currency: The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency.

The opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender.



Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same [[currency]] replace them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Bill|title=Dollar Default: How the Federal Reserve and the Government Betrayed Your Trust|year=2012|isbn=9781475261080|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this are:

*The United Kingdom, adopting [[decimalisation|decimal]] currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971, Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p – 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (½p, 1p, 2p – equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, and 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d&lt;!-- Precise here means an amount which could be made up by coins; there was no way of making 1¼p or 5/12p in coins which 3d and 1d would have been.--&gt; ( = 2½p), 1, and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed by exchanging them for legal tender currency with no time limits; but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*The [[successor state]]s of the [[Soviet Union]] replacing the [[Soviet ruble]] in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*Currencies used in the [[Eurozone]] before being replaced by the [[euro]] are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*[[2016 Indian banknote demonetisation|India demonetised its 500 and 1000 rupee notes on 8 November 2016.]] This action affected 86 percent of all cash in circulation. The demonetisation action was intended to curb [[Indian black money|black money]], the hoarding of unaccounted cash, and sponsorship of terrorism, but also led to long queues from [[bank run]]s, leaving more than 30 people dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-suicides-heart-attacks-and-even-a-murder-among-33-deaths-since-decision-4378135/|title=Demonetisation: 33 deaths since government scrapped Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes|author=|date=16 November 2016|website=indianexpress.com|accessdate=27 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230194940/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-suicides-heart-attacks-and-even-a-murder-among-33-deaths-since-decision-4378135/|archivedate=30 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old notes are now being replaced by new 500 and 2000 rupee notes.
*The Philippines has ceased 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of Flora and Fauna Series in 2000, due to overminting of the coins of BSP Series that has not included the 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of that series.

Individual coins or banknotes can be demonetised and cease to be legal tender (for example, the pre-decimal United Kingdom [[History of the farthing|farthing]] or the Bank of England 1 pound note), but the [[Bank of England]] does redeem all Bank of England banknotes by exchanging them for legal tender currency at its counters in London (or by post) regardless of how old they are. Banknotes issued by retail banks in the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) are not legal tender, but one of the criteria for legal protection under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act is that banknotes must be payable on demand, therefore withdrawn notes remain a liability of the issuing bank without any time limits.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In the case of the euro, coins and banknotes of former national currencies were in some cases considered legal tender from 1 January 1999 until 28 February 2002. Legally, those coins and banknotes were considered non-decimal sub-divisions of the euro.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

When the [[Iraqi Swiss dinar]] ceased to be legal tender in Iraq, it still circulated in the northern Kurdish regions, and despite lacking government backing, it had a stable market value for more than a decade. This example is often cited to demonstrate that the value of a currency is not derived purely from its legal status{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (but this currency would not be legal tender).

This is also true of the paper money issued by the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate currency]] became worthless by its own terms after the war, since it could only be redeemed a stated number of years after a peace treaty was signed between the Confederacy and the United States (which never happened, as [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|the Confederacy was defeated and dissolved]]).

Demonetisation is currently prohibited in the United States, and the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] applies to all US coins and currency regardless of age. The closest historical equivalent in the US, other than Confederate money, was from 1933 to 1974, when the government banned most private ownership of gold bullion, including gold coins held for non-[[numismatics|numismatic]] purposes. Now, however, even surviving pre-1933 gold coins are legal tender under the 1964 act.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Withdrawal from circulation===
Banknotes and coins may be withdrawn from circulation, but remain legal tender. United States banknotes issued at any date remain legal tender even after they are withdrawn from circulation. Canadian 1- and 2-dollar bills remain legal tender even if they have been withdrawn and replaced by coins, but Canadian $1,000 bills remain legal tender even if they are removed from circulation as they arrive at a bank. However, Bank of England notes that are withdrawn from circulation generally cease to be legal tender but remain redeemable for current currency at the Bank of England itself or by post. All paper and polymer issues of [[New Zealand]] banknotes issued from 1967 onwards (and 1- and 2-dollar notes until 1993) are still legal tender; however, 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins are no longer used in [[New Zealand]].

===Cashless society===
{{Main|Cashless society}}
A cashless society describes an economic state whereby [[financial transaction]]s are not conducted with money in the form of physical [[banknote]]s or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties.&lt;ref name="THE COST OF CASH IN THE UNITED STATES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CostofCash/~/media/Fletcher/Microsites/Cost%20of%20Cash/CostofCashStudyFinal.pdf|publisher=The Fletcher School Tufts University|title=THE COST OF CASH IN THE UNITED STATES|page=9|accessdate=17 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201110118/http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CostofCash/%7E/media/Fletcher/Microsites/Cost%20of%20Cash/CostofCashStudyFinal.pdf|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashless societies have existed, based on [[barter]] and other methods of exchange, and cashless transactions have also become possible using [[digital currencies]] such as [[bitcoin]]. However this article discusses{{fix|text=self-reference?|link=Wp:selfref|cat=[[category:articles containing self-references]]|date=August 2018}}and focuses on the term "cashless society" in the sense of a move towards, and implications of, a society where cash is replaced by its [[digital currency|digital equivalent]] – in other words, legal tender (money) exists, is recorded, and is exchanged only in electronic digital form.

==Commemorative issues==
Sometimes currency issues such as commemorative coins or transfer bills may be issued that are not intended for public circulation but are nonetheless legal tender. An example of such currency is [[Maundy money]]. Some currency issuers, particularly the Scottish banks, issue special commemorative banknotes which are intended for ordinary circulation (though no Scottish banknotes nor notes from Northern Ireland are legal tender in the United Kingdom). As well, some standard coins are minted on higher-quality dies as 'uncirculated' versions of the coin, for collectors to purchase at a premium; these coins are nevertheless legal tender. Some countries issue precious-metal coins which have a currency value indicated on them which is far below the value of the metal the coin contains: these coins are known as "[[non-circulating legal tender]]" or "NCLT".

==Status by country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the creation of legal tender, in the form of notes and [[base metal]] coins, is the exclusive right of the Commonwealth (Federal) Government. According to section 115 of the [[Australian Constitution]], "A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s115.html |title=COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTION ACT – SECT 115 States not to coin money |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111115818/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s115.html |archivedate=11 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this provision the [[Perth Mint]], owned by the [[Western Australia]]n Government, still produces gold and silver coins with legal tender status, the [[Australian Gold Nugget]] and [[Australian Silver Kookaburra]]. These, however, although having the status of legal tender, are almost never circulated or used in payment of debts, and are mostly considered [[bullion coin]]s.

Australian notes are legal tender for all amounts, as established by the ''Reserve Bank Act 1959''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A07384 Reserve Bank Act 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310015152/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A07384 |date=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the provisions of the ''Currency Act 1965'' Australian coins intended for general circulation, which are now produced at the [[Royal Australian Mint]] in [[Canberra]], are also legal tender, but only for the following amounts:
*not exceeding 20¢ if 1¢ and/or 2¢ coins are offered;
*not exceeding $5 if any of 5¢, 10¢, 20¢ and 50¢ coins are offered;
*not exceeding 10 times the face value if the coins offered are greater than 50¢ up to and including $10;
*to any value for coins of other denominations above $10.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1965120/ CURRENCY ACT 1965] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124538/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1965120/ |date=12 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one cent and two cent coins have been [[Withdrawal of low-denomination coins|withdrawn from circulation]] since February 1992 but remain legal tender.&lt;ref name=rbalegaltender /&gt;

Although the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Currency Act 1965 establishes that Australian banknotes and coins have legal tender status, Australian banknotes and coins do not necessarily have to be used in transactions and refusal to accept payment in legal tender is not unlawful. It appears that a provider of goods or services is at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place before the "contract" for supply of the goods or services is entered into.  If a provider of goods or services specifies other means of payment prior to the contract, then there is usually no obligation for legal tender to be accepted as payment. This is the case even when an existing debt is involved. However, refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings.&lt;ref name=rbalegaltender&gt;{{cite web |url=http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/legal/legal-tender/ |title=RBA Banknotes: Legal Tender |publisher=Rba.gov.au |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213015111/http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/legal/legal-tender/ |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rba.gov.au/ |title=Reserve Bank of Australia – Home Page |publisher=Rba.gov.au |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502014757/http://www.rba.gov.au/ |archivedate=2 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
In 1901, notes in circulation in [[Australia]] consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and Queensland Treasury notes. Bank notes circulated in all States except [[Queensland]], but were not legal tender except for a brief period in 1893 in [[New South Wales]]. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions for the protection of the public. Queensland Treasury notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the [[Commonwealth Parliament]] passed the ''Australian Notes Act 1910'' and the ''Bank Notes Tax Act 1910''. The ''Australian Notes Act 1910'' prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the ''Bank Notes Tax Act 1910'' imposed a tax of ten per cent, per annum, on "all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed".{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. ''The Reserve Bank Act 1959'' expressly prohibits persons and states from issuing "a bill or note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Canada===
In general, [[Canadian dollar]] banknotes issued by the [[Bank of Canada]] and coins issued under the authority of the [[Royal Canadian Mint Act]] are legal tender in [[Canada]].  However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, convenience stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them at risk of being [[counterfeit]] victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/count-contre/faq-eng.htm |title=Currency Counterfeiting – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322213713/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/count-contre/faq-eng.htm |archivedate=22 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As outlined in the Currency Act, there is a limit to the value of a transaction for which one may use only coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/index.html |title=Canada's currency act |accessdate=8 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616023437/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/index.html |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A payment in coins is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

#forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
#twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
#ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
#five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and
#twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

In the case of coins of a denomination greater than ten dollars, a payment is a legal tender for no more than the value of a single coin of that denomination. Where more than one amount is payable by one person to another on the same day under one or more obligations, the total of those amounts is deemed to be one amount due and payable on that day.

===China===
In the People's Republic of China, the official currency [[renminbi]] serves as the unlimited legal tender for all transactions. It is by law that any public institution or individual must not refuse using the currency to settle public or private domestic owing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 中华人民共和国人民币管理条例|url = http://www.pbc.gov.cn/rhwg/000101f.htm|website = www.pbc.gov.cn|access-date = 13 February 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151223142417/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/rhwg/000101f.htm|archivedate = 23 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurozone===
[[Euro]] [[euro coins|coins]] and [[euro banknotes|banknotes]] became legal tender in most countries of the [[Eurozone]] on 1 January 2002. Although one side of the coins is used for different national marks for each country, all coins and all banknotes are legal tender throughout the [[eurozone]]. Therefore, it is possible to find [[Irish euro coins]] in [[Greece]] and [[Finnish euro coins]] in [[Portugal]], for instance. Although some eurozone countries do not put 1 cent and 2 cent coins into general circulation (prices in those countries are by general understanding always [[cash rounding|rounded to whole multiples of 5 cent]]), 1 cent and 2 cent coins from other eurozone countries remain legal tender in those countries.

Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 limits the number of coins that can be offered for payment to fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=11 May 1998|title=Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro|journal=Official Journal of the European Communities|volume=41|issue=L 139|pages=1–5|issn=0378-6978|oclc=104948742|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:139:0001:0005:EN:PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments that issue the coins must establish the euro as the only legal tender. Due to variations on the legislative meaning of legal tender in various member states and the ability of contract law to overrule the status of legal tender, it is possible for merchants to choose to refuse to accept euro banknotes and coins within specific countries within the Eurozone (the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; National laws may also impose restrictions as to maximal amounts that can be settled by coins or notes.

===France===
Legal tender was enacted the first time for gold and silver coins in the [[French Penal Code]] of 1807 (art. 475, 11°). In 1870, legal tender was extended to all notes of the [[Banque de France]]. Anyone refusing such monies for their whole value would be prosecuted ([[French Penal Code]] art. R. 642-3).

===Republic of Ireland===
{{See also|Coinage of the Republic of Ireland}}
According to the ''Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998'' of the [[Republic of Ireland]] which replaced the legal tender provisions that had been re-enacted in Irish legislation from previous British enactments, "No person, other than the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] and such persons as may be designated by the Minister by order, shall be obliged to accept more than 50 coins denominated in euro or in cent in any single transaction."

====Irish history====
The ''Decimal Currency Act, 1970'' governed legal tender prior to the adoption of the euro and laid down the analogous provisions as in United Kingdom legislation (all inherited from previous [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]]), namely: coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.

===India===
The [[Indian rupee]] is the ''de facto'' legal tender currency in [[India]]. The Indian rupee is also legal tender in [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]], but the [[Nepalese rupee]] and [[Bhutanese ngultrum]] are not legal tender in India. Both the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are pegged with the Indian rupee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/bhutan/bt_glos.html |title=Area handbook Series/ Bhutan (Nepal and Bhutan) / Glossary |publisher=Country-data.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909072407/http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/bhutan/bt_glos.html |archivedate=9 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian rupee used to be an official currency of other countries, including the [[Straits Settlements]] (now [[Singapore]] and parts of [[Malaysia]]), [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], and the [[Trucial States]] (now the [[UAE]]).

In 1837, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency of the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as a part of India. In 1845, the British replaced the Indian rupee with the [[Straits dollar]] after administration of the Straits Settlements separated from India earlier in that same year.

[[File:RBI 5-rupee note, overprinted Government of Pakistan, 1947.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Indian rupees were stamped with Government of Pakistan to be used as legal tenders in the new state of Pakistan in 1947.]]
After [[Partition of India|partition of India and Pakistan in 1947]], the [[Pakistani rupee]] came into existence, initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with the word "Pakistan". New coins and banknotes were issued in 1948.

The Gulf rupee, also known as the [[Gulf rupee|Persian Gulf rupee]] (XPGR), was introduced by the [[Government of India]] as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the [[Reserve Bank of India]] Amendment Act of 1 May 1959. This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India's foreign reserves by gold smuggling.

Two states, Kuwait and Bahrain eventually replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies (the [[Kuwaiti dinar]] and the [[Bahraini dinar]]) after gaining independence from Britain in 1961 and 1965, respectively.

On 6 June 1966, India devalued the rupee. To avoid following this devaluation, several of the states using the rupee adopted their own currencies. Qatar and most of the Trucial States adopted the [[Qatari riyal|Qatar and Dubai riyal]], whilst Abu Dhabi adopted the [[Bahraini dinar]]. Only Oman continued to use the Gulf rupee until 1970, with the government backing the currency at its old peg to the pound. Oman later replaced the Gulf rupee with its own [[Omani rial|rial]] in 1970.

On 8 November 2016, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] announced that existing [[Indian 500 and 1000 rupee currency demonetisation|INR 500 and INR 1000 banknotes would no longer be accepted as legal tender]] with a view to curb counterfeiting, tax evasion and the [[black money|parallel economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/the-reputation-of-india-as-a-soft-state-is-over/|title=The reputation of India as a soft state is over|work=The Indian Express|first=Sudhanshu|last=Trivedi|date=6 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623083911/http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/the-reputation-of-india-as-a-soft-state-is-over/|archivedate=23 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reserve Bank of India outlined a scheme for holders of such banknotes to either deposit them into their bank accounts for full, unlimited value, or to exchange the banknotes for new, subject to a cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finmin.nic.in/172521.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109223029/http://finmin.nic.in/172521.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. 
The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in [[New Zealand]]. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].

The history of bank notes was considerably more complex. In 1840, the [[Union Bank of Australia]] started issuing bank notes under provisions of British law, but these were not automatically legal tender.

In 1844, ordinances were passed making the [[ANZ Bank New Zealand#History|Union Bank]] banknotes legal tender and authorising the government to issue debentures in small denominations, thus creating two sets of legal tender. These debentures were circulated but were traded at a discount to their face value because of distrust of the colonial government by the settler population. In 1845, the Ordinance was disallowed by the British Colonial office and they were recalled, not without first causing a panic among holders of the debentures.

In 1847, the [[Colonial Bank of Issue]] became the only issuer of legal tender. In 1856, however the [[Colonial Bank of Issue]] was disbanded and through the Paper Currency Act 1856, the Union Bank was confirmed once again as an issuer of legal tender. The Act also authorised the [[Oriental Bank]] to issue legal tender but this bank ceased operations in 1861.

Between 1861 and 1874, a number of other banks including the [[Bank of New Zealand]], [[Bank of New South Wales]], [[National Bank of New Zealand]] and [[Colonial Bank of New Zealand]] were created by Acts of Parliament and authorised to issue bank notes backed by gold, however these notes were not legal tender.

The 1893 Bank Note Issue Act allowed the government to declare a bank's right to issue legal tender. This enabled the government to make such a declaration to assist the [[Bank of New Zealand]] when in 1895 the bank encountered financial difficulties that could have led to its failure.

In 1914, the Banking Amendment Act gave legal tender status to bank notes from any issuer and removed the requirement that banks authorised to issue bank notes must redeem them on demand for gold (the [[gold standard]]).

In 1933, the Coinage Act created a specific New Zealand coinage and removed legal tender status from British coins. In the same year the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] was established. The bank was given a monopoly on the issue of legal tender. The Reserve Bank also provided a mechanism through which the other issuers of legal tender could phase out their bank notes. These banknotes were convertible into British legal tender on demand at the Reserve Bank and remained so until the 1938 Sterling Exchange Suspension Notice that suspended provisions of a 1936 amendment of the 1933 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act.

In 1964, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act restated that only notes issued by the Reserve Bank were legal tender. The Act also ended the right of individuals to redeem their bank notes for coin, effectively ending the distinction between coin and notes in New Zealand. The Act came into force in 1967 establishing as legal tender all [[New Zealand dollar]] five dollars banknotes and greater, all decimal coins, the pre-decimal sixpence, the [[shilling]], and the [[florin (New Zealand coin)|florin]]. Also passed in 1964 was the Decimal Currency Act, which created the basis for a decimal currency, introduced in 1967.

As of 2005, banknotes were legal tender for all payments, and $1 and $2 coins were legal tender for payments up to $100, and 10c, 20c, and 50c silver coins were legal tender for payments up to $5. These older style silver coins were legal tender until October 2006, after which only the new 10c, 20c and 50c coins, introduced in August 2006, are legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research/bulletin/2002_2006/2003mar66_1matthews.pdf |title=Reserve Bank of New Zealand: Bulletin Vol. 66 No. 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515010654/http://rbnz.govt.nz/research/bulletin/2002_2006/2003mar66_1matthews.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore and Brunei===
[[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]] have a Currency Interchangeability Agreement since 12 June 1967. Under the agreement, [[Singapore dollar]] and [[Brunei dollar]] are exchangeable at par without charge in both countries. As such, the currency of one country is accepted in the other country as "customary tender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency-interchangeability-agreement-with-brunei.aspx |title=Currency Interchangeability Agreement – Brunei Notes and Coins |publisher=[[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] |date= |accessdate=24 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qr3u1Feb?url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency-interchangeability-agreement-with-brunei.aspx |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth series of Swiss [[bank notes]] from 1976, recalled by the National Bank in 2000, is no longer legal tender, but can be exchanged in banks for current notes until April 2020.

The Swiss franc is also the legal tender of the Principality of [[Liechtenstein]], which is joined to Switzerland in a [[customs union]].

The Swiss franc is also the currency used for administrative and accounting purposes by most of the numerous international organisations that are headquartered in Switzerland.

===United Kingdom===
Legal tender is solely for the guaranteed settlement of debts and does not affect any party's right of refusal of service in any transaction.&lt;ref name="Royal Mint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/policies-and-guidelines/legal-tender-guidelines/|title=Legal Tender Guidelines|accessdate=9 March 2009|publisher=Royal Mint|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302223933/http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/policies-and-guidelines/legal-tender-guidelines|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, gold coins were legal tender to any amount, but silver coins were not legal tender for sums over 2 pounds nor bronze for sums over 1 [[shilling]]. This provision was retained in revised form at the introduction of [[decimal day|decimal currency]], and the [[decimal day|Coinage Act 1971]] laid down that coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, non-bronze coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.

Throughout the [[United Kingdom]], coins valued [[British one pound coin|1 pound]], [[British two pound coin|2 pounds]], and [[British five pound coin|5 pounds]] [[pound Sterling|Sterling]] are legal tender in unlimited amounts. [[twenty pence (British decimal coin)|Twenty pence pieces]] and [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|fifty pence pieces]] are legal tender in amounts up to 10 pounds; [[Five pence (British decimal coin)|five pence pieces]] and [[Ten pence (British decimal coin)|ten pence pieces]] are legal tender in amounts up to 5 pounds; and [[Penny (British decimal coin)|pennies]] and [[Two pence (British decimal coin)|two pence coins]] are legal tender in amounts up to 20 pence.&lt;ref name="Royal Mint"/&gt; In accordance with the Coinage Act 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Coinage Act 1971|path=ukpga/1971/24/contents|access-date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gold sovereign]]s are also legal tender for any amount. Although it is not specifically mentioned on them, the face values of gold coins are 50p; £1; £2; and £5, a mere fraction of their worth as bullion. Five pound coins, although legal tender, are intended as souvenirs and are almost never seen in circulation.

[[Royal Maundy#Maundy coinage|Maundy money]] is legal tender but may not be accepted by retailers and is worth much more than face value due to its rarity value and silver content.

[[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England notes]] are legal tender in [[England and Wales]] and are issued in the denominations of £5, £10, £20 and £50. They can always be redeemed at the Bank of England even if discontinued. Banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks are not legal tender anywhere but are widely accepted with agreement between parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes|title=Bank of England Bank Notes|publisher=Bank of England|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102231606/https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus legal tender in Scotland is limited to coin.

In a 1976 case, [[Miliangos v George Frank Ltd]], the [[House of Lords]] established that the [[Courts of England and Wales|English courts]] could order debts to be paid in currencies other than the pound sterling under certain circumstances, overturning two centuries of precedent.

===United States===
Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861 to 1865), silver coins were legal tender only up to the sum of $5. Before 1853, when U.S. silver coins were reduced in weight 7%, coins had exactly their value in metal (from 1830 to 1852). Two silver 50 cent coins had exactly $1 worth of silver. A gold U.S. dollar of 1849 had $1 worth of gold. With the flood of gold coming out of the California mines in the early 1850s, the price of silver rose (gold went down). Thus, 50 cent coins of 1840 to 1852 were worth 53 cents if melted down. The government could increase the value of the gold coins (expensive) or reduce the size of all U.S. silver coins. With the reduction of 1853, a 50-cent coin now had only 48 cents of silver. This is the reason for the $5 limit of silver coins as legal tender; paying somebody $100 in the new silver coins would be giving them $96 worth of silver. Most people preferred bank check or gold coins for large purchases.

During the early [[American Civil War]], the federal government first issued United States Notes (the first [[greenback (money)|greenback]] notes), which were not redeemable in gold and silver coins but could be used to pay "all dues" to the federal government. Since land purchases and duties on imports were payable only in gold or the new [[Demand Note]]s, the Demand Notes were bought by importers and land speculators for about 97 cents on the gold dollar and never lost value. 1862 greenbacks ([[United States Note|Legal Tender Notes]]) at first traded for 97 cents on the dollar but gained/lost value depending on fortunes of the Union army. The value of Legal Tender Greenbacks swung wildly but trading was from 85 to 33 cents on the gold dollar.

This resulted in a situation in which the greenback "Legal Tender" notes of 1862 were [[fiat money|fiat]], and so gold and silver were held and paper circulated at a discount because of [[Gresham's Law]]. The 1861 Demand Notes were a huge success but robbed the customs house of much needed gold coin (interest on most bonds back then was paid in gold). A money-strapped Congress, which had to pay for the war, eventually adopted the [[Legal Tender Cases#Legal Tender Act of 1862|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], issuing [[United States Notes]] backed only by treasury securities, and compelled the people to accept the new notes at a discount; prices rose except for those who had gold and/or silver coins.

Following the Civil War, paper currency was disputed as to if it must be accepted as payment. In 1869, Hepburn v. Griswold found that Henry Griswold would not have to accept paper currency because it could not truly be "legal tender" and was unconstitutional as a legally enforceable means to pay debts. This led to the Legal Tender Cases in 1870, which overturned the previous ruling and established the paper currency as constitutional and proper legal tender that must be accepted in all situations.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Bray. ''Banks and Politics in America''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991. pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 1884 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Juilliard v. Greenman]]'', the "Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the right to issue notes to be legal tender for the payment of public and private debt. Legal-tender notes are treasury notes or banknotes that, in the eyes of the law, must be accepted in the payment of debts."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Larry. ''The Encyclopedia of Money''. Santa Barbara: ABC CLIO, 2009. pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the [[Legal Tender Cases]] (which include ''Juilliard v. Greenman'') led later courts to "support the federal government's invalidation of gold clauses in private contracts in the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;Zywicki, Todd. "Article I, Section 8" in ''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution''. Regnery Publishing, 2014. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, coins made of gold or silver may not necessarily be legal tender, if they are not fiat money in the jurisdiction where they are proffered as payment. The [[Coinage Act of 1965]] states (in part):

{{quote|United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.|{{usc|31|5103}}}}

Contrary to common misconception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2017/04/18/what-is-a-legal-tender-law-and-is-it-a-problem |title=What Is A 'Legal Tender Law'?

Private businesses are free to create their own policies on whether or not they accept cash, unless there is a specific state law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores, and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency as a matter of policy or safety.&lt;ref name=LTSFAQ&gt;

The principal purpose of that statute is to ensure the nationwide acceptance of U.S. currency, consistent with constitutional language that reserves to Congress the power to create a uniform currency that holds the same value throughout the United States. While the statute provides that U.S. money is legal tender that may be accepted for the payment of debts, it does not require ''acceptance'' of cash payments, nor does it provide that restrictions cannot be imposed upon the acceptance of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Is it Legal to Refuse Cash Payment |url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/it-legal-refuse-cash-payment |website=Expert Law |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===

On 11 December 2016, the Venezuelan Government announced demonetisation following almost 500% inflation in the country. People of the country were given 3 days to get rid of the 100 Bolivar notes (most widely used currency) post the introduction of new note of higher denominations. As of 15 June 2017, there has been 7 extensions (one per month) of the legal use of the 100 bolivares bill notes. The 100 Bolivar notes are still legal tender up today 30 December 2017.

'''Louis Tikas''' (born 1886 in [[Loutra, Rethymno|Loutra]], [[Crete]] as Ηλίας Αναστασίου Σπαντιδάκης, ''Elias Anastasiou Spantidakis'' – April 20, 1914) was the main labor union organizer at the Ludlow camp during a 14-month coal [[Strike action|strike]] in southern [[Colorado]] from 1913–1914. He was shot and killed during the [[Ludlow Massacre]], the bloodiest event of the strike, on April 20, 1914.

== Biography ==
[[File:Louis Tikas Dedication Plaque 06 23 2018.jpg|thumb|This is the dedication plaque on the statue base]]
[[File:Tikas Statue Dedication Ceremony 06 23 2018.jpg|thumb|Ceremony dedicating the Tikas Bronze in Trinidad, Colorado on June 23, 2018]]
Tikas was born in Crete in 1886.
In 1910, the year Louis Tikas filed his [[citizenship]] papers in the United States, he was part owner of a Greek coffee house on Market Street in [[Denver]]. By the end of 1912 he was an organizer for the [[United Mine Workers of America]]. In between he worked as a miner-[[strikebreaker]] in Colorado’s Northern (Coal) Field but ended up leading a [[walkout]] by sixty-three fellow Greeks at the Frederick, Colorado mine.  Tikas was chased from the northern field, shot and wounded by [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin-Felts detectives]] as he escaped through the back door of a boarding house in [[Lafayette, Colorado]] in January 1910.

He was shot and killed during the [[Ludlow Massacre]], the bloodiest event of the strike, on April 20, 1914, the day after (Greek Orthodox) Easter. 19&amp;nbsp;people were killed during the massacre including 2 women and 11 children and one National Guardsman.

Tikas met with Major Pat Hamrock on the day of the massacre in response to allegations of a man being held against his will in the camp. The militia placed machine guns on the hills and Tikas, anticipating trouble, ran back to camp. But fighting broke out lasting all day. By 7:00 pm, the camp was aflame. Tikas remained in the camp the entire day and was there when the fire started. Lieutenant [[Karl Linderfelt]], a rival of Tikas' during much of the strike, broke the butt of his gun over Tikas' head. Tikas was later found shot to death, one bullet through his back, another in his hip, a third glancing off his hip and traveling vertically through his body; it was determined that he bled to death. The film "Palikari" honours his death.

A statue of Louis Tikas was dedicated at the Miner's Memorial on Mani Street in Trinidad, Colorado on June 23, 2018.

== Ludlow Massacre ==
{{story|date=January 2018}}
{{Main|Ludlow Massacre}}

On April 20, 1914, while the militia officer in charge of Company B and Tikas were meeting, a number of Company B troopers &amp;mdash; as instructed by superiors &amp;mdash; located themselves atop Water Tank Hill, just south of Ludlow. Many colonists spotted the militiamen, and, being quite concerned, armed themselves and moved to key points where they could closely watch activities atop the small hill. Other colonists feared something was awry and scurried about for cover. Suddenly the sound of rifle fire echoed through the nearby hills. Neither the militia nor the colonists knew who fired these shots, but an exchange of gunfire began, as both confused colonists and militiamen believed they were coming under attack.

The militia were badly outnumbered by the colonists, but had certain advantages, including a choice location and a machine gun. The spray from the gun drove armed strikers back toward the tents, and provided excellent coverage for guardsmen advancing toward the tents. Meanwhile, Company A reinforcements arrived with another machine gun to offer support to Company B. The colonists now faced two automatic weapons and about 150 guardsmen. Machine gun and rifle fire forced women and children colonists to take refuge in storage cellars beneath the tents. This offered some protection but advancing guardsmen eventually forced the cellars' occupants to abandon the underground shelters and to evacuate to the east of the colony site to some hills locally called the "Black Hills" for protection. By late afternoon, it was clear that the militia would overrun the colony site, and everyone would have to abandon the site and join those who had already fled to the Black Hills. Meanwhile, a deserted tent burst into flames and, within a short time, more tents began to burn. At the same time, the militiamen overran and took command of the colony site.

By early morning, April 21, 1914, the colony site &amp;mdash; previously covered by hundreds of tents &amp;mdash; revealed nothing more than charred rubble remains of the tents. The bodies of two women and 11 children- victims of asphyxiation- were found huddled within a cellar. Five strikers, 2 other youngsters, and at least 4 men associated with the militia also died. Though the Ludlow battle ended on the night of April 20, 1914, sporadic violence continued for days after. Battles that took place at various coal camps claimed many more lives. In late April, federal troops moved into southern Colorado, almost immediately restoring peace. The strike, however, continued through early December, finally coming to an end without resolution. Despite the heavy loss of lives and property, the strikers' efforts and losses weren't entirely in vain. The effects of the strike and the violence encouraged state and federal lawmakers to pass legislation that, in the long run, would help hasten improvements in conditions for working miners. Because of this, a remote southern Colorado prairie at Ludlow will always be deeply etched in the annals of coal mining history.

A memorial is located at Ludlow and the map above shows the mining communities involved in the infamous tragedy.

'''''Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die''''' is a book by brothers Chip and [[Dan Heath]] published by [[Random House]] on January 2, 2007. The book continues the idea of "stickiness" popularized by [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in ''[[The Tipping Point]]'', seeking to explain what makes an idea or concept memorable or interesting. A similar style to Gladwell's is used, with a number of stories and case studies followed by principles.

The stories range from [[urban legends]], such as the "Kidney Heist" in the introduction; to business stories, as with the story of [[Southwest Airlines]], "the low price airline"; to inspirational, personal stories such as that of Floyd Lee, a passionate mess hall manager. Each chapter includes a section entitled "Clinic", in which the principles of the chapter are applied to a specific case study or idea to demonstrate the principle's application.

==Overview==
The book's outline follows the acronym "SUCCES" (with the last ''s'' omitted). Each letter refers to a characteristic that can help make an idea "sticky":
* '''S'''imple – find the core of any idea
* '''U'''nexpected – grab people's attention by surprising them
* '''C'''oncrete – make sure an idea can be grasped and remembered later
* '''C'''redible – give an idea believability
* '''E'''motional – help people see the importance of an idea
* '''S'''tories – empower people to use an idea through narrative

The book then goes to mention examples like:
Simple: [[Southwest Airlines]], whose motto is "THE low fare airline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerguy.com/white-papers/made-to-stick.htm|publisher=engineerguy.com|title=Summary of Made to Stick: Why some ideas survive and others die by Chip Heath and Dan Heath (Random House, 2007)|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a steward proposed serving chicken salad in the Texas–Vegas route, thinking about that motto helps one decide that this is not a good idea. Other example: Proverbs, which encapsulate wisdom in short sentences. The book mentions many case studies of successful teachers and professionals around the world such as Diana Virgo of [[Loudoun Academy of Science]] as a mathematics teacher.

==Authors==
Chip Heath is a professor of [[organizational behavior]] at Graduate School of Business at [[Stanford University]]. Dan Heath, a former researcher at Harvard, is a consultant and developer of innovative textbooks.  They also write a regular feature for ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madetostick.com/theauthors/ Authors' profiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310010630/http://www.madetostick.com/theauthors/ |date=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was commercially successful, appearing on the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' bestseller lists, alongside a 24-month listing on ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' book listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2017/11/01/blockbuster-bestselling-authors-chip-and-dan-heath-explain-the-power-of-moments/#5aca9f3c7678|title=How To Create More Of the Magical Moments That Transform Life And Business|first=Micah|last=Solomon|work=Forbes|date=November 1, 2017|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', William Leith described it as a "smart, lively book" that is "fun to read" and will give readers "an insight into the power of bad ideas" as well as better ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Leith | first =William | title =Sticking points: Chip and Dan Heath's Made to Stick shows us that if you want your message to be memorable, keep it simple, says William Leith| newspaper =[[The Guardian]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =February 24, 2007 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/24/society1| accessdate =November 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review in the ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'', Judith Samuelson observed that "The Heath brothers have taught me that if anyone is going to 'get' my idea – need it, buy it, fund it, use it – I need to radically shorten my elevator pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Samuelson | first =Judith | title =Review: Made to Stick: Simplicity is the golden rule for getting messages across| newspaper =[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = Summer 2007| url =https://ssir.org/book_reviews/entry/review_made_to_stick | accessdate =November 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''BookPages'', Eliza McGraw wrote, "How do we make people care about our ideas?, the Heaths ask. We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =McGraw | first =Eliza | title =Made to Stick: The keys to staying power | newspaper =BookPage | location =[[Nashville]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =February 2007 | url =https://bookpage.com/reviews/5075-chip-heath-heath-made-to-stick#.WhtaJcuIbZE | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative Branch Reservations''' is an emerging phenomenon from [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt|Eliyahu Goldratt]]'s [[Theory of Constraints]]. A Negative Branch Reservation is a cause and effect analysis of a situation. This thinking skill is used to map out what can go wrong in a process of change and help to anticipate any negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Negative Branch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngman|first=K. J.|title=Dr|url=http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/|accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique uses these forms in its analysis [[Thinking Processes (Theory of Constraints)|Thinking Processes]] of the theory: [[Future Reality Tree]], [[Transition Tree]], or [[Prerequisite Tree]].

'''Nouthetic counseling''' (Greek: ''noutheteo'', to admonish) is a form of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[pastoral counseling]] based solely upon the Bible and focused on Christ.  It repudiates mainstream [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] as [[humanistic]], fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]], and radically [[secular]].   Its viewpoint was originally articulated by [[Jay E. Adams]], in ''Competent to Counsel'' (1970) and further books, and has led to the formation of a number of organizations and seminary courses promoting it.&lt;ref name = Collins /&gt; The viewpoint is opposed to those seeking to synthesize Christianity with secular psychological thought, but has failed to win them over to a purely Biblical approach.  Since 1993, the movement has renamed itself '''Biblical counseling''' to emphasize its central emphasis on the Bible.&lt;ref name = Collins&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Gary R | last1 = Collins | first2= Eric L | last2= Johnson| first3 = Stanton L | last3 = Jones | title = Psychology &amp; Christianity| publisher = InterVarsity Press | location = Downers Grove, IL, USA | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8308-2263-1 | pages = 36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling'' states that "The aim of Nouthetic Counseling is to effect change in the counselee by encouraging greater conformity to the principles of Scripture."{{Sfn | Benner | Hill | 1999 | p = 249}}

==Debate within the Christian community==
Nouthetic counseling has been criticized as narrowly conceived, with a confrontational focus upon [[sin]] and behavior, which fails to deal adequately with emotion, grief, and suffering, and which lacks understanding of complex human motivations.{{Sfn | Clinton | Ohlschlager | 2002 | p = 46}}

Clinton and Ohlschlager describe what they call the historic debate between nouthetic counselors and integrationists. Nouthetic counselors, they say, argue that truth can only be known as revealed in [[the Scriptures]]. According to an article published by the Spring Christian Counseling Center, secular counseling and psychology are primarily [[pseudoscience]]s which only can be [[Transformation (disambiguation)|transformed]]{{by whom?|date=May 2015}} into "true" sciences within the framework of faith-based Christian dialog.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Integrationists argue that God reveals his truth universally. This includes [[general revelation]], or what they define as truth known by scientific investigation, as well as truth known by [[special revelation]] in Christ. Clinton and Ohlschlager express their belief that "shrill criticism and rancorous debate" are ill-suited to the mission of uplifting Christ as the model for counseling.{{Sfn | Clinton | Ohlschlager | 2002 | pp = 52, 53}}

Christian counselor and psychologist, and leading proponent of the rival "community model",{{Sfn | Clinton | Ohlschlager | 2002 | p = 46}} [[Larry Crabb]], states that Adams compares behavior patterns "with his understanding of biblical behavior patterns, and commands change".  Crabb agrees with Adams that obedience to God's commands is "absolutely necessary for effective Christian living", but takes issue with what he sees as Adams' apparent belief that this is the "single key ingredient for spiritual growth". Crabb believes that this neglects what he refers to as the "'insides' of the behaving person", particularly "the person's assumption system and his evaluation of situations based on his assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Crabb | first = L | title = Effective Biblical Counseling: A Model for Helping Caring Christians Become Capable Counselors | publisher = Zondervan | year = 1977 | location = Grand Rapids, MI | pages = 150–51 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HOin3PV2c3gC&amp;pg=PA151 | isbn = 0-310-22570-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians also debate the causes of [[mental illness]] and the extent of [[Demonic possession | demonic influence]] on counselees. Three different views as to the origin of mental illness emphasize respectively:

# disease occurring in the natural realm,
# habitual sin, and/or
# influence by "demonic forces"&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{Cite book | last = Benner | first = David G | title = Encyclopedia of Psychology | publisher = Baker |date= July 1985 | isbn = 978-0-8010-0865-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, "[i]n the counseling field, many nouthetic counselors have said that Satan and his demons were bound, bruised, curtailed and restrained at the time of Christ's death and resurrection.  They assert that human beings today primarily struggle with their own sin natures rather than directly with Satan and his emissaries."&lt;ref name = Baker /&gt;

==Relationship to contemporary psychology==
[[Eric Johnson (theologian)|Eric Johnson]] points out that nouthetic counseling has tended to be "very skeptical of contemporary psychology" and "the efforts of [[Christian counseling|integrationist Christians]] who seek to combine their faith with that psychology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = 2009-06-01 | authorlink = Eric Johnson (theologian) | first = Eric | last = Johnson | title= A Momentous Evening Forum with ABC| url= http://christianpsych.org/wp_scp/2009/06/01/a-momentus-evening-forum-with-abc/ | publisher= Society for Christian Psychology| accessdate= 2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 800, The Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling describes Nouthetic Counselors as "zealous to return God and the Bible to positions of authority in the hearts and lives of people", but criticises them as “failing to see the validity in alternative approaches.”{{Sfn | Benner | Hill | 1999 | p = 800}}  Donn Arms, a Nouthetic Counselor and associate of [[Jay E. Adams]] wrote a response to the Encyclopedia's criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nouthetic.org/blog/?p=3669 | title = Nouthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouthetic counseling has been criticized for the way its "rational and certain approach can come across as impersonal, emotionally distant, and insensitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King|first=SD|title=Dictionary of pastoral care and counseling|year=2005|publisher=[[Abingdon Press]]|page=450 | editor-last =Hunter|editor-first=Rodney J | chapter =Fundamentalist Pastoral Care}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouthetic counseling is viewed as highly controversial by secular psychologists who believe that it is unethical to counsel that the Bible has the answers for all people of all backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://www.nanc.org/Resources/NANC-Library/General-Counseling/General-Cousenling-Documents/07biblical_counceling--rowe.aspx | publisher = NANC | last = Rowe | title = Biblical counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some counselors believe that nouthetic counseling can do considerable harm to patients. In addition to techniques which critics consider ineffective, patients who are not helped by nouthetic counseling often consider themselves to be "unfaithful" or religious failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Winfrey | first = David | title = Biblical Therapy | journal = [[The Christian Century]] | volume = 124 | issue = 2 | pages = 25–26 | date = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4383">The '''Ostwald process''' is a [[chemical process]] for making [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] developed the process, and he patented it in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |inventor-last=Ostwald |inventor-first=Wilhelm |inventorlink=Wilhelm Ostwald |title=Improvements in the Manufacture of Nitric Acid and Nitrogen Oxides |country-code=GB |patent-number=190200698 |description=|issue-date=March 20, 1902 |publication-date=January 9, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |inventor-last=Ostwald |inventor-first=Wilhelm |inventorlink=Wilhelm Ostwald |title=Improvements in and relating to the Manufacture of Nitric Acid and Oxides of Nitrogen |country-code=GB |patent-number=190208300 |description= |issue-date=February 26, 1903 |publication-date=December 18, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern [[chemical industry]], and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production.  Historically and practically, the Ostwald process is closely associated with the [[Haber process]], which provides the requisite raw material, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Description==
Ammonia is converted to nitric acid in 2 stages.  It is [[redox|oxidized]] by heating with [[oxygen]] in the presence of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] such as [[platinum]] with 10% [[rhodium]], to form [[nitric oxide|nitric oxide /nitrogen(ii)oxide]] and [[water|water/steam]].  This reaction is strongly [[exothermic reaction| exothermic]], making it a useful heat source once initiated:&lt;ref name="jones1"&gt;{{cite book

:4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 4 NO (g) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (g)  (ΔH = −905.2 kJ/mol)

Stage two encompasses two reactions and is carried out in an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] apparatus containing water. Initially nitric oxide is oxidized again to yield [[nitrogen dioxide|nitrogen dioxide/nitrogen(iv)oxide]].&lt;ref name="jones1" /&gt; This gas is then readily absorbed by the water, yielding the desired product (nitric acid, albeit in a dilute form), while [[redox|reducing]] a portion of it back to nitric oxide:&lt;ref name="jones1" /&gt;

:2 NO (g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)  (ΔH = &amp;minus;114 kJ/mol)
:3 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + NO (g) (ΔH = −117 kJ/mol)

The NO is recycled, and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by [[distillation]].

Alternatively, if the last step is carried out in air:

:4 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 4 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

Typical conditions for the first stage, which contribute to an overall [[Yield (chemical)|yield]] of about 98%, are:
* [[pressure]] is between {{convert|4-10|atm|kPa psi|||sigfig=2}} and
* [[temperature]] is about {{convert|870-1073|K|C F|sigfig=2}}.

A complication that needs to be taken into consideration involves a side-reaction in the first step that reverts the nitric oxide back to {{chem|N|2}}:

:4 {{chem|NH|3}} + 6 {{chem|NO}} → 5 {{chem|N|2}} + 6 {{chem|H|2|O}}

This is a secondary reaction that is minimised by reducing the time the gas mixtures are in contact with the catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Patrick Joseph''' "'''P. J.'''" '''Kennedy''' (January 14, 1858 – May 18, 1929) was an American businessman and politician. Kennedy was a major figure in the Democratic Party in Boston. He was the father of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] and the paternal grandfather of President [[John F. Kennedy]].

Kennedy was the only surviving male in the family after two outbreaks of cholera killed his father and brother. He started work at fourteen as a stevedore in the docks. Kennedy owned three saloons and a whisky import house, and eventually had major interests in coal and banking. He moved successfully into politics, as a sociable man able to mix comfortably with both the Catholic and the Protestant elite, and he sat in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and in the [[Massachusetts Senate]]. His particular talent was for the behind-the-scenes machinations for which Boston politics became so notorious.

==Early life==
[[File:Pj kennedy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Young P. J. Kennedy around the mid-to-late 1870s]]
Kennedy was the youngest of five children born to Irish Catholic immigrants Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) and Bridget Murphy (1824–1888), who were both from [[New Ross]], [[County Wexford]], and married in [[Boston]] on September 26, 1849. The couple's elder son, John, had died of [[cholera]] in infancy two years before Kennedy was born. Ten months after Kennedy's birth, his father Patrick also succumbed to the infectious cholera epidemic that infested the family's [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston neighborhood]]. As the only surviving male, Kennedy was the first family member to receive a formal education. His mother Bridget had purchased an East Boston stationery and notions store where she had worked. The business took off and expanded into a grocery and liquor store.

At the age of fourteen, Kennedy left school to work with his mother and three older sisters, Mary, Joanna, and Margaret, as a [[stevedore]] on the Boston Docks. In the 1880s, with money he had saved from his modest earnings, he launched a business career by buying a saloon in Haymarket Square downtown. In time, he bought a second establishment by the East Boston docks. Next, to capitalize on the social drinking of upper-class Boston, Kennedy purchased a third bar in an upscale East Boston hotel, the Maverick House. Before he was thirty, his growing prosperity allowed him to buy a whiskey-importing business.

By the time of his death in 1929, Kennedy held an interest in a coal company and a substantial amount of stock in a bank, the Columbia Trust Company. His wealth afforded his family of one son and two daughters an attractive home on Jeffries Point in East Boston.&lt;ref name=dallek&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.twbookmark.com/books/4/0316172383/chapter_excerpt17081.html |chapter=Beginnings |title=An unfinished life: John F.

==Political career==
[[File:Massachusetts Senator Patrick J Kennedy.png|left|thumb|upright|P. J. Kennedy in 1893 as a Massachusetts State Senator]]
Kennedy was "always ready to help less fortunate fellow Irishmen with a little cash and some sensible advice." He enjoyed the approval and respect of most folks in East Boston, living on the hill of a mixed Boston neighborhood of upscale Irish and Protestant elite. Beginning in 1884, he converted his popularity into five consecutive one-year terms in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], followed by three two-year terms in the [[Massachusetts Senate]]. Establishing himself as one of Boston's principal Democratic leaders, he was invited to give one of the seconding speeches for [[Grover Cleveland]] at the party's 1888 national convention in St. Louis. However, he found campaigning, speech making, and legislative maneuvering, to be less appealing than the behind-the-scenes machinations that characterized so much of Boston politics in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. After leaving the Senate in 1895, Kennedy spent his political career as an appointed elections commissioner, an appointed fire commissioner, as the backroom boss of Boston's Ward Two, and as a member of his party's unofficial Board of Strategy.&lt;ref name=dallek/&gt;

==Marriage and children==

On November 23, 1887, Kennedy married Mary Augusta Hickey (December 6, 1857 – May 6, 1923),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Augusta Hickey|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29044292|work=Find A Grave|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of James Hickey and Margaret Martha Field.&lt;ref name="Hickey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Hickey|url=http://www.hometoclare.com/clarepeople/michael-hickey|publisher=Home To Clare|accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children and remained married until Hickey’s death in May 1923.

[[Ted Kennedy]], youngest son of Joseph, named his younger son [[Patrick J. Kennedy|Patrick]] (born 1967) to honor P. J. Kennedy.

==Death==
In his later years, Kennedy developed degenerative liver disease. In April 1929, he was admitted to [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|Deaconess Hospital]] to receive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kennedy |first1=Joseph Patrick |authorlink1=Joseph Kennedy |editor1-last=Smith |editor1-first=Amanda |title=Hostage to Fortune: The Letters of Joseph P.

His funeral was held at St. John the Evangelist Church in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]] on May 21. The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that hundreds of mourners lined the streets to watch Kennedy’s funeral procession and businesses in East Boston closed to honor him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kearns Goodwin |first1=Doris |authorlink1=Doris Kearns Goodwin |title=The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys |date=1991 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-312-06354-7 |page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in [[Malden, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rachlin |first1=Harvey |title=The Kennedys: A Chronological History, 1823 to Present |date=1986 |publisher=World Almanac |isbn=0-345-33729-8 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1914, P.J. Kennedy's son Joseph married [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald]] (1890–1995), the eldest daughter of Boston Mayor [[John F. Fitzgerald]] (1863–1950). Joe and Rose had nine children, including World War II casualty [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]] (1915–1944), President [[John F. Kennedy]] (1917–1963), Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (1925–1968), and longtime Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (1932–2009).

The Patrick J. Kennedy School, named for him, is a public grammar school located in East Boston.

During his time on ''I'm A Celebrity'', Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant [[Katie Price]].

==Early life and music career==
Peter Andre was born on 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London, and is of [[Greek Cypriot]] descent. In 1979, as a six-year-old, Andre and his family relocated to [[Sydney]] before settling on [[Australia]]'s [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] at nine years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/peter-andre-learning-love-again-4404618 Peter Andre on learning to love again after the death of his brother]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, 16-year-old Andre became a contestant on Australian [[talent show]] [[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]] and as a result was offered a recording contract for $146,000. During this time, Andre lived in a beachside apartment in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] and attended [[Benowa State High School]] on the Gold Coast.

In the early 90s, Andre established himself on the Australian music scene. In 1992, Andre released his debut single, "[[Drive Me Crazy (song)|Drive Me Crazy]]", which peaked at #72 on the Australian singles chart. However, his musical breakthrough occurred with his second single, "[[Gimme Little Sign]]", which peaked at #3 and lasted a total of 31 weeks on the Australian charts.

On her father's side she is a member of the [[Greek Royal Family]] and the [[Danish Royal Family]]. Maria-Olympia's [[patrilineal]] great-great-grandfather, [[Constantine I of Greece]], was the son of [[George I of Greece]], whose father was [[Christian IX of Denmark]]. As a male-line descendant of Christian IX, she holds the title of Princess of Denmark.

Her mother is the daughter of American-born British billionaire [[Robert Warren Miller]] and his Ecuadorian wife, Marie Chantal Pesantes. Maria Olympia's maternal grandfather descends from passengers on the [[Mayflower]] and is connected to the British North American [[American gentry|colonial elite]]. His family claims to descend from [[Henry I of England]], [[Louis IV of France]], and [[William I of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="WARGS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reitwiesner|first1=William|last2=Otto|first2=Julie|title=Some ancestry of the Miller sisters|url=http://www.wargs.com/royal/miller.html|website=William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services|accessdate=30 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327201420/http://www.wargs.com/royal/miller.html|archivedate=27 March 2007|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantitative marketing research''' is the application of quantitative research techniques to the field of marketing. It has roots in both the [[positivism|positivist]] view of the world, and the modern marketing viewpoint that marketing is an interactive process in which both the buyer and seller reach a satisfying agreement on the "[[Marketing mix|four Ps]]" of marketing: Product, Price, Place (location) and Promotion.

As a [[social research]] method, it typically involves the construction of [[questionnaire]]s and [[scale (social sciences)|scales]]. People who respond (respondents) are asked to complete the [[statistical survey|survey]]. [[Marketing|Marketers]] use the information to obtain and understand the needs of individuals in the marketplace, and to create [[strategic planning|strategies]] and [[marketing plan]]s.

==Typical general procedure==
Simply put, there are five major and important steps involved in the research process:

#Defining the problem.
#[[Experimental design|Research design]].
#[[Data collection]].
#[[Data analysis]].
#[[Report writing]] &amp; presentation.

A brief discussion on these steps is:

# Problem audit and problem definition - What is the problem? What are the various aspects of the problem? What information is needed?
# Conceptualization and operationalization - How exactly do we define the concepts involved? How do we translate these concepts into observable and measurable behaviours?
# [[Hypothesis]] specification - What claim(s) do we want to test?
# Research design specification - What type of methodology to use? - examples: questionnaire, survey
# [[questionnaire construction|Question specification]] - What questions to ask? In what order?
# [[scale (social sciences)|Scale specification]] - How will preferences be rated?
# [[sampling (statistics)|Sampling design]] specification - What is the total population? What sample size is necessary for this population? What sampling method to use?- examples: '''Probability Sampling:-''' ([[cluster sampling]], [[stratified sampling]], [[simple random sampling]], [[multistage sampling]], [[systematic sampling]]) &amp; '''[[Nonprobability sampling]]:-''' (Convenience Sampling, Judgement Sampling, Purposive Sampling, Quota Sampling, Snowball Sampling, etc. )
# Data collection - Use mail, telephone, internet, mall intercepts
# Codification and re-specification - Make adjustments to the raw data so it is compatible with statistical techniques and with the objectives of the research - examples: assigning numbers, consistency checks, substitutions, deletions, weighting, dummy variables, scale transformations, scale standardization
# Statistical analysis - Perform various descriptive and inferential techniques (see below) on the raw data. Make inferences from the sample to the whole population. Test the results for statistical significance.
# Interpret and integrate findings - What do the results mean? What conclusions can be drawn? How do these findings relate to similar research?
# Write the research report - Report usually has headings such as: 1) executive summary; 2) objectives; 3) methodology; 4) main findings; 5) detailed charts and diagrams. Present the report to the client in a 10-minute presentation. Be prepared for questions.

The design step may involve a pilot study in order to discover any hidden issues. The codification and analysis steps are typically performed by computer, using [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].  The data collection steps, can in some instances be automated, but often require significant manpower to undertake.  Interpretation is a skill mastered only by experience.

==Statistical analysis==

The data acquired for quantitative marketing research can be analysed by almost any of the range of techniques of [[statistical analysis]], which can be broadly divided into [[descriptive statistics]] and [[statistical inference]]. An important set of techniques is that related to [[statistical survey]]s. In any instance, an appropriate type of statistical analysis should take account of the various types of error that may arise, as outlined below.

===Reliability and validity===

Research should be tested for [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], generalizability, and [[validity (psychometric)|validity]].

'''Generalizability''' is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population.

'''Reliability''' is the extent to which a measure will produce consistent results.
* ''Test-retest reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Stability over repeated measures is assessed with the Pearson coefficient.
* ''Alternative forms reliability'' checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms.
* ''Internal consistency reliability'' checks how well the individual measures included in the research are converted into a composite measure. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability). The value of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. A commonly used measure is [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Reliability may be improved by increasing the sample size.

'''Validity''' asks whether the research measured what it intended to.
* ''Content validation'' (also called face validity) checks how well the content of the research are related to the variables to be studied; it seeks to answer whether the research questions are representative of the variables being researched. It is a demonstration that the items of a test are drawn from the domain being measured.
* ''Criterion validation'' checks how meaningful the research criteria are relative to other possible criteria. When the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity.
* ''Construct validation'' checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity: ''convergent validity'' (how well the research relates to other measures of the same construct), ''discriminant validity'' (how poorly the research relates to measures of opposing constructs), and ''nomological validity'' (how well the research relates to other variables as required by theory).
* ''Internal validation'', used primarily in experimental research designs, checks the relation between the dependent and independent variables (i.e. Did the experimental manipulation of the independent variable actually cause the observed results?)
* ''External validation'' checks whether the experimental results can be generalized.

Validity implies reliability: A valid measure must be reliable. Reliability does not necessarily imply validity, however: A reliable measure does not imply that it is valid.

===Types of errors===

'''Random sampling errors:'''
*sample too small
*sample not representative
*inappropriate sampling method used
*[[errors and residuals in statistics|random errors]]
'''Research design errors:'''
*bias introduced
*measurement error
*data analysis error
*sampling frame error
*population definition error
*scaling error
*question construction error
'''Interviewer errors:'''
*recording errors
*cheating errors
*questioning errors
*respondent selection error
'''Respondent errors:'''
*non-response error
*inability error
*falsification error
'''Hypothesis errors:'''
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|type I error]] (also called alpha error)
**the study results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis even though it is actually true
*[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|type II error]] (also called beta error)
**the study results lead to the acceptance (non-rejection) of the null hypothesis even though it is actually false

Mara founded the charity Faces of Kibera, which aimed to provide housing, food, and medical care for orphans in [[Kibera]], a [[Nairobi, Kenya]] slum. The charity's goal was to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased.&lt;ref name="JournalNews"/&gt; The charity auctioned memorabilia from the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] and [[New York Giants|Giants]], as well as training camp events on [[eBay]] to raise money.&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette"/&gt; She visited the area as a volunteer in 2006 and was moved to help the orphans, many whose parents have died from AIDS and HIV-related illnesses. She began the charity due to her frustration with the growing number of nonprofits that are just business opportunities. "The people who need help aren’t really getting it. So I started my own", she told ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine in 2009.&lt;ref name="InterviewMag"/&gt; Mara later found it challenging to balance her charity work and acting career. "I need to do both; I can't just do acting," she stated to ''[[The Journal News]]''.&lt;ref name="JournalNews"/&gt; In January 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation which runs community-based empowerment programs in Kibera, including soccer leagues and after-school tutoring.

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2014}}
'''William Sidney "Sid" Hatfield''' (May 15, 1891 or 1893&lt;ref&gt;The 1893 date is usually given, and appears on his gravestone. However, according to the [https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-11396-7328-97?cc=1325221 1900 Census for Pike Co., KY, 0104 Magisterial District 5, Blackberry Precinct], he was born in 1891, and his sister Martha Alice in 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; – August 1, 1921), was Police Chief of [[Matewan, West Virginia|Matewan]], [[West Virginia]] during the [[Battle of Matewan]], a shootout that followed a series of evictions carried out by detectives from the [[Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;West Virginia "The History of An American State"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hatfield was born in Blackberry, [[Pike County, Kentucky]], the tenth of twelve children (of whom nine survived infancy) of Jacob Hatfield (c. 1843/45 – 1923), a tenant farmer, and his wife Rebecca Crabtree (b. circa 1856). His grandfather, Jeremiah Hatfield, was a half-brother to Valentine Hatfield (1789–1867), grandfather of [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield]], leader of the Hatfield family involved in the famous [[Hatfield-McCoy Feud]] (see [[Hatfield-McCoy Feud#Devil Anse Hatfield family tree|Hatfield Family Tree]]). According to the 1900 Census, two older brothers, Orison and Hereford, an older sister Chloe, and a younger sister and brother, Martha Alice and Freeland, were then still living at home with him and their parents. His eldest sister Vandalia or Vandella was already married by this time, and an older brother, Melvin, had left home.

As a child, Hatfield worked on his father's farm. He became a miner in his teens, and then worked as a blacksmith for several years. He received his nickname, "Smilin' Sid", because of the gold caps on several of his upper teeth. He seems to have had a reputation for hard living and fighting, and his appointment in 1919 to the post of Police Chief of Matewan, by the mayor, Cabell Cornelis Testerman (1882–1920), surprised some of the more "respectable" townsfolk.&lt;ref&gt;See interview with Dixie Accord in documentary [http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/media/11141 ''West Virginia: A Film History'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was a staunch supporter of the [[United Mine Workers of America]], as was Testerman: together, they were instrumental in leading the mining community's resistance to the Baldwin-Felts operatives. Operatives offered both men substantial bribes to allow them to station machine guns in the town. Hatfield and Testerman refused. The Battle of Matewan was precipitated by the Baldwin-Felts agents' attempts to evict the families of unionized miners.

On June 2, 1920, in Huntington, he married Jessie Lee Maynard (1894–1976), the widowed second wife of Testerman, who had been mortally wounded in the battle. The speed of the marriage led to an attempt at arrest and accusations by Thomas Felts and the Baldwin-Felts spy, [[Charles Everett Lively]], that he, not Albert Felts, had shot the Mayor because of his desire for Jessie. However, according to Jessie, her first husband, aware of the danger of their situation, had asked that his friend take care of her and their young son, Jackson (1915–2001), should he be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Lon Savage, ''Thunder in the Mountains: the West Virginia Mine War, 1920–21'', 1985, pp. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle had given Hatfield a degree of celebrity. He appeared in a short film, "Smilin' Sid", for the [[United Mine Workers]] (UMWA), and was photographed with other UMWA activists, including [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris "Mother" Jones]]. However, he was aware that his life was in danger from Felts, who sought vengeance for his brothers Albert and Lee. He was indicted on murder charges stemming from the Matewan shootout but was later acquitted by the jury. He was sent to stand trial with his friend and deputy, Edward Chambers, on conspiracy charges for another incident, in [[Welch, West Virginia|Welch]], [[West Virginia]]. 

The conspiracy charges were based on an incident in Mohawk, WV, located in McDowell County near the border of Mingo County. The mining camp of Mohawk was shot up, and according to the local mine guards, the perpetrators were Mingo County strikers led by Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers, intending to force the Mohawk miners to unionize. (p 65, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia) According to C.E. Lively's secret testimony(leading to Hatfield's indictment), Lively had persuaded miners in his restaurant--as well as Hatfield and Chambers--to do something drastic: he encouraged the miners to arm themselves and shoot up the nonunion tipple at Mohawk. At this location, the mine guards had a reception committee waiting for them, with bloodhounds and machine guns, while Lively made himself busy on the telephone.(When Miner's March, William Blizzard) The union leaders, on the other hand, argued that the shooting was done by McDowell County mine guards, and that they were attempting to falsely accuse Hatfield and Chambers of the offense in order to ambush them in McDowell County. (p 65, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia)

At the assurances of McDowell County sheriff Bill Hatfield, Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers were told that they would have the fullest protection of the sheriff's office. The day before the shooting, Sheriff Hatfield left the county for Craig Healing Springs in Virginia. (p 67, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia)

Both men arrived in Welch on August 1, 1921, unarmed and accompanied by their wives. Several Baldwin-Felts men shot them on the [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] Courthouse steps. Hit in the arm, and three or four times in the chest, Hatfield died instantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/vrr/va_view2.aspx?FilmNumber=1952971&amp;ImageNumber=1978 Death Certificate]. Mrs Hatfield's distress is suggested by her confusion over her father-in-law's name: the correct name, "Jake", has been struck out and overwritten with "Freeland", the name of Sid's younger brother.&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers was shot several more times, as his wife tried to defend him, and finished off with a bullet in the head by Charles Everett Lively.&lt;ref&gt;Both the film "Matewan" and Newsinger's review of it, "Matewan: film and working class struggle", mistakenly claim that it was Hatfield to whom Lively gave the coup-de-grace: Sallie Chambers' testimony and the injuries noted on the two men's death certificates make it clear, however, that it was Chambers.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the Baldwin-Felts detectives was ever convicted of Hatfield's assassination: they claimed they had acted "in self-defense."

There was an outpouring of grief for the fallen local heroes at the funeral, which was attended by at least 3,000 people, and conducted with full honors from the [[Odd Fellows]], [[Knights of Pythias]] and [[Improved Order of Red Men|Redmen]] (he was a member of all of these organizations).

==Legacy==
Director [[John Sayles]]' [[Academy Award]]-nominated 1987 film ''[[Matewan]]'' starred [[David Strathairn]] in the role of Hatfield.

''West Virginia: A Film History'' mistakenly identifies him as Albert Sidney Hatfield, as well as claiming that he was not related to "Devil Anse" Hatfield. This may be because of rumours that he was illegitimate, and so possibly not of Hatfield descent.&lt;ref&gt;Lon Savage, ''Thunder in the Mountains'', p. 10: however, the name Savage gives for Sid's putative father, Crabtree, is his mother's maiden name, and he gives no source for the claim.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Startup Weekend Recife - Recife - Pernambuco - Brasil.jpg|thumb|A Startup Weekend in Brazil in 2011.]]
'''Startup Weekend''' is a 54-hour weekend event, during which groups of developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing gurus, graphic artists and more pitch ideas for new startup companies, form teams around those ideas, and work to develop a working prototype, demo, or presentation by Sunday evening. Startup Weekend has grown into an organization with a global presence. As of December 2016, Startup Weekend has reached 135 countries, involving over 210,000 entrepreneurs. Startup Weekend is one of the Techstars Startup Programs, alongside Startup Week and Startup Digest.

==History==
Founded in July 2007 in [[Boulder, Colorado]] by Andrew Hyde,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feld |first=Brad |year=2012 |title=Startup Communities|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1118441541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Startup Weekend brought together 70 entrepreneurs to try to create a startup in just 54 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/07/07/startupweekend-70-founders-create-company-in-one-weekend/|title=StartupWeekend: 70 Founders Create Company In One Weekend – TechCrunch|last=Arrington|first=Michael|date=July 8, 2007|website=techcrunch.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810210643/https://techcrunch.com/2007/07/07/startupweekend-70-founders-create-company-in-one-weekend/|archive-date=August 10, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model quickly expanded to cities around the world. In January 2010, Marc Nager and Clint Nelsen took over full ownership and registered the organization as a not-for-profit, relocating to Seattle. As of the acquisition, Startup Weekend had organized approximately 80 events in the USA, England, Germany and Canada. In February 2010, Franck Nouyrigat joined as a Co-Director and CTO. In the fall of 2010, Startup Weekend gained 501c3 status and received a grant from the Kauffman Foundation. By December 2010, the organization was composed of 8 full-time employees, over 15 'Key Facilitators', and more than 100 local organizers. In 2011, Startup Weekend launched the StartUp Foundation Initiative in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pruitt|first=Barbara|title=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation|url=http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/startup-weekend-launches-startup-foundation-initiative-in-partnership-with-kauffman-foundation.aspx|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Startup Weekend opened its first regional offices in London and Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Kauffman2012Jun"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulte|first=Barb|title=Startup Weekend Expands Operations Globally, Opens Regional Offices in London and Mexico City|url=http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/startup-weekend-expands-operations-globally-opens-regional-offices-in-london-and-mexico-city.aspx|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, Startup Weekend events ran in over 1000 cities around the world.

==Event model==
Startup Weekend events span the course of a weekend (approximately 54 hours),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vrant|first=Andres|title=UP.CO features Startup Weekend Universidad Santiago de Cali|url= http://www.up.co/communities/colombia/cali/startup-weekend/9480

In addition to attendees (otherwise known as 'Weekend Warriors'), the event attracts speakers, coaches, panelists (generally well-respected members of the local startup community or notable names in the tech industry), and various sponsors and company representatives. A good share of teams end up working together beyond the startup weekend to build a fully operating startup and others take with them the bootcamp experience and a network of like minds.

==Global Startup Battle==
Startup Weekend launched the [[Global Startup Battle]] in 2011 during [[Global Entrepreneurship Week]]. The 2012 battle included 10,000+ participants, 1,200+ teams, taking place in 100+ cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Startup Battle|url=http://globalstartupbattle.org/|date=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global Startup Battle]] has three phases: First, the team must win the local Startup Weekend. Second, the team must win a [[Facebook]] popularity contest by receiving votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Win The Startup Weekend Popularity Contest|author=KissQuest Inc.|url=http://www.kissquestonline.com/winning-facebook|date=2012-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030422/http://www.kissquestonline.com/winning-facebook|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the top 15 teams move on to the final stage. The final stage is a judging panel. In 2016, Global Startup Battle, shifted to become Global Startup Weekend, a world-wide celebration of Startup Weekends.

'''''The Go Getter''''' is a 1937 film directed by [[Busby Berkeley]] and starring [[George Brent]], [[Anita Louise]], and [[Charles Winninger]]. A determined discharged US Navy veteran succeeds in the lumber business.

==Plot==
When the US Navy rigid [[airship]] ''Macon'' is damaged in a storm and crashes into the water (as the real {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|6}} did in 1935), helmsman Bill Austin stays with his commanding officer until the rest of the crew has gotten safely away. Bill loses a leg as a result of the crash and leaves the Navy.

He goes looking for employment, but jobs are scarce in [[San Francisco]]. He tries a lumber company run by Lloyd Skinner, interrupting a meeting between Skinner and his fiancee Margaret Ricks. Skinner orders him to leave his office. Matt Peasely, head of a shipping firm in the same building, is more polite, but the answer is still the same. Undeterred, Bill seeks out Cappy Ricks, the retired founder of both companies.

While waiting in the reception area, he encounters Margaret again. He assumes she is also a job seeker and makes a date with her, unaware she is Cappy's only offspring. She sees her father first, and asks him to give Bill a chance. Cappy, who is frustrated with the way Skinner and Peasely have been running the businesses he built up, is quite willing to countermand them. He and Skinner decide to give Bill the hardest task they can think of: selling a half million feet of unwanted [[Picea glauca|skunk spruce]] Cappy bought years ago as a favor to a friend. Not only does Bill sell all of the spruce, he also generates orders for all of the lumber the company has and more, all in a single business trip across the western United States, forcing Cappy to send him to Seattle to buy the shortfall from a hard-negotiating competitor.

Meanwhile, Bill and Margaret fall in love. With his commission from his trip, he buys an engagement ring. When he tells Cappy of his plans, however, the widowed Cappy is adamantly opposed to losing Margaret's company. He and Skinner go ahead with the "blue vase" test, a test everybody has failed, including Skinner. Cappy telephones Bill and tells him he saw a vase he liked, but could not spare the time to purchase it. He gives Bill instructions to buy it whatever the cost and bring it to him at the railway station by eight o'clock. Cappy and Skinner have pre-arranged all sorts of obstacles to make the task impossible, but Bill overcomes them all, and by hocking Margaret's ring to help pay the $1000 price of the vase and persuading a Navy pilot friend (on his honeymoon night, no less) to fly him ahead of the already departed train, he succeeds. Cappy is so impressed, he offers Bill a promotion to manager of his [[Shanghai]] office.

When Bill insists on marrying Margaret immediately so she can accompany him, Cappy does his best to stop him. He buys up all the staterooms in the ship Bill is to take, but Bill and Margaret get married and manage to sneak aboard the ship anyway. Then Cappy receives word that his men have gone on strike, and they trust and will only negotiate with Bill. Cappy sends him an urgent [[radiogram (message)|radiogram]]. When the captain of the ship refuses Bill's request to turn around, Bill jumps overboard. Margaret follows him, and the captain drops a lifeboat. Cappy finds them rowing back to land.

Bill negotiates an end to the strike, and Cappy decides to send Skinner to Shanghai instead. For Cappy's sake, the couple agree to live in his mansion.

'''Thomas Sivewright Catto, 1st Baron Catto''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (15 March 1879 – 23 August 1959) was a Scottish businessman and later [[Governor of the Bank of England]].

==Early life and education==
Catto was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to William and Isabella Catto. His father, a [[shipwright]], had moved to Newcastle to find work, but died less than a year after Thomas was born and the family returned to their hometown of [[Peterhead]], [[Aberdeenshire]]. They later moved back to Newcastle and Catto won a scholarship to Heaton School (later [[Rutherford College of Technology]]).

==Shipping==
At the age of fifteen, Catto joined the Gordon Steam Shipping Company as a clerk. In 1898 he became secretary to [[William Horwood Stuart]], managing partner of F. A. Mattievich &amp; Co, based in [[Batumi]] and [[Baku]], Russia.

In 1904 he was offered the management of the new London office of [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes]], an American firm with interests in the East, one of whose partners was David Forbes, a fellow Scot with whom he had become friendly in Baku. Catto became a member of the [[Baltic Exchange]]. In 1906 he went to [[İzmir|Smyrna]] as Forbes's deputy and travelled extensively in the [[Near East]] and Middle East. In 1909 he became a vice-president of the company at their New York office.

==First World War==
Too short to serve in the armed forces during the [[First World War]], he instead became involved in the transport of supplies to Russia and then served as the British [[Admiralty]] representative on the Russian Commission to the United States from 1915 to 1917. From 1917 to 1918 he served on the British Food Mission in the United States and in 1918 he was appointed chairman of the [[Allied Provisions Commission]] and head of the British [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] in North America.

==Inter-war years==
He did not return to McAndrews &amp; Forbes after the war; instead, in 1919, he became chairman of the vast [[Andrew Yule and Company Ltd.]] of [[Calcutta]], succeeding [[David Yule|Sir David Yule]].  This is now a private company 93.26% owned by the [[Government of India]]. Catto and Yule also formed Yule Catto &amp; Company Ltd, which is now known as [[Yule Catto|Yule Catto &amp; Co plc]] and is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].

In 1928 he returned to London as a partner in the investment bank [[Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co.]], remaining chairman of Andrew Yule &amp; Co and Yule Catto &amp; Co until 1940.

==Second World War and later life==
In April 1940 he was appointed Director-General of Equipment and Stores at the [[Ministry of Supply]] and a Director of the [[Bank of England]]. In July 1941 he moved to become Financial Adviser to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. In April 1944 he was elected [[Governor of the Bank of England]] and served until February 1949, and overseeing the [[nationalisation]] of the bank.

He suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] and died in [[Holmbury St Mary]], Surrey in 1959. His son [[Stephen Catto, 2nd Baron Catto|Stephen]] succeeded to his title.

==Honours==
For his services in the First World War, Catto was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30460 |date=4 January 1918 |page=368 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a [[baronet]] in the [[1921 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32346 |date=4 June 1921 |page=4530 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was created [[Baron Catto]], of Cairncatto, in 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34259 |date=25 February 1936 |page=1233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37977 |date=6 June 1947 |page=2571 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomás Dolz de Espejo Andreu Muñoz Serrano y Duforq-Salinis, 5th Count of La Florida''' (1879-1974) was a Spanish politician and businessman. For some 30 years he campaigned within [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]] and [[Carlism]]. Periodically he was holding regional party leadership jobs, though nationwide he remained rather in the back row. He is best known as member of the first Junta Política and [[National Council of the Movement|Consejo Nacional]], executive bodies of the newly created [[Francoism|Francoist]] state party, [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|Falange Española Tradicionalista]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Albarracín - Casa de los Dolz de Espejo - Portada.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Dolz de Espejo house, [[Albarracín]]]]
The Dolz lineage is related to Southern [[Aragón]]; its first representatives were noted in the late 12th century, once the successful [[Reconquista]] claimed [[Teruel]].&lt;ref&gt;Rocio Castellote Simón, ''El retablo de la Virgen del Pilar de la iglesia de San Bernardo abad de Gea de Albarracín'', Valencia 2016, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The family was initially linked to [[Albarracín]],&lt;ref&gt;Tomás Alamán Artigot, ''Gea en el tiempo'', [in:] ''GeaDeAlbarracín'' service, available [http://www.geadealbarracin.com/historia.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; over time spreading to neighboring counties.&lt;ref&gt;more details are scattered across different volumes of ''Linajes de Aragón. Revista quincenal ilustrada'', see for instance Gregorio García Ciprés, ''Los Sánchez-Muñoz de Teruel'', [in:] ''Linajes de Aragón'' 01.05.12, pp. 137-141&lt;/ref&gt; The Espejo lineage originated from Northern parts of [[Kingdom of Valencia]], resident in [[:es:Castelfabib|Castelfabib]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Fuertes de Gilbert Rojo, ''Albarracin: linajes y testimonios heraldicos'', [in:] José Antonio Salas Ausens (ed.), ''Tiempo de Derecho foral en el sur aragonés: los fueros de Teruel y Albarracín'', Zaragoza 2007, {{ISBN|9788489510814}}, pp. 55-106&lt;/ref&gt; The two families intermarried in the early 17th century, giving rise to the Dolz de Espejo branch.&lt;ref&gt;Castellote Simón 2016, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its members made their names in history of Spain; Tomás’ great-grandfather, Pedro Federico Dolz de Espejo, was awarded the title of Conde de la Florida in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in Fuertes de Gilbert Rojo 2007, pp. 55-106&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, the 2nd Count and the grandfather of Tomás, [[Pedro Pablo Dolz de Espejo]],&lt;ref&gt;some services confuse different members of the family, compare ''Pedro Pablo Dolz de Espejo, 2. conde de la Florida'' entry, [in:] ''Geneallnet'' service, available [http://geneall.net/es/name/1824586/pedro-pablo-dolz-de-espejo-2-conde-de-la-florida/ here], or ''Compactgen'' service, available [http://compactgen.com/es/f/flo.htm here]. Even the canonical lecture of Traditionalist history confuses the family members; Ferrer refers to "Pedro Manuel Dolz de Espejo y Martinez Serrano", who allegedly died 1882 in Madrid, [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'', vol. 28/2, Sevilla 1959. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished himself during the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic era]].

==Early political career (until 1919)==
[[File:Ramon Nocedal.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]]]]
With two generations of ancestors serving the legitimist cause Dolz seemed poised to follow suit, especially that also his mother came from a Traditionalist family.&lt;ref&gt;daughter of marqués de Ballestar, Moreno y Mórrison 1928, p. 885. The Ballestars supported the Carlists since the First Carlist War, Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza Gómez de Valugera, ''La nobleza carlista'', [in:] ''Nobleza y sociedad en la España moderna'' 2 (1997), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; However, during his youth Traditionalism was divided into mainstream Carlists and the breakaway [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]]. His brother, only 2 years senior, sided with the rebels; as a 16-year-old in 1893 he publicly voiced support for the [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Nocedalistas]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 14.03.93, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000170527&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In course of the 1890s Pedro Dolz de Espejo grew in the Integrist structures,&lt;ref&gt;''El Ancora'' 25.09.97, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2252841&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1900 rising to president of the [[Valencia (province)|Valencian]] Junta Provincial&lt;ref&gt;''El estandarte católico'' 14.09.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1025350&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La correspondencia de Valencia'' 16.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000238926&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1907 entering the executive of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian]] Junta Regional.&lt;ref&gt;rising to its vice-president, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 12.06.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000260348&amp;page=1 here], ''El Ebro'' 15.06.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=1026881&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the sources consulted confirms (or denies) that Tomás followed his older brother; until the early 1910s he is not recorded as engaged in politics.

Dolz was first noted in political milieu&lt;ref&gt;apart from non-political incidents, some of them awkward; in 1911 he engaged in a brawl, related to his borrowing and breaking of a camera, compare ''La Mañana'' 19.08.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026277183&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1911; he demonstrated support to Traditionalist deputies from both the Integrist and [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimist]] minorities, who in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in vain tried to block [[:es:Ley del Candado|Ley del Candado]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 06.01.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000294447&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 he was admitted to [[:es:Real Maestranza de Caballería de Zaragoza|Real Maestranza de Caballeria de Zaragoza]], a theoretically non-political but in fact highly conservative aristocratic organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuario de la nobleza de España'' 1911, p. 587, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=607&amp;path=1000179115&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following death of his older brother he became a somewhat prestigious figure in the Teruel realm and as such decided to join the electoral race: in [[Spanish general election, 1914|1914]] he ran to the Cortes from [[Mora de Rubielos]], a district in the [[Teruel (province)|Teruel province]]; it was also the first time he declared himself a Jaimista, member of Carlist branch supporting the claim of [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]].&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'' 04.03.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000187325&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt proved premature and he lost pathetically, gaining 10 times fewer votes than a victorious candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario Turolense'' 13.10.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2300504&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''El mercantil'' 09.03.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2303225&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defeat Florida is never confirmed to have renewed his bid for the parliament.

In the mid-1910s Florida, already referred to in the press as "rico propietario", was already fully engaged in the Jaimista structures. In 1915 he was rumored to be running in the [[Spanish general election, 1916|Cortes elections of the following year]] from the [[Latina (Madrid)|Madrid Latina district]];&lt;ref&gt;''Diario Turolense'' 07.10.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2301264&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the news eventually proved false, though in 1916 he was busy mounting an electoral alliance which would include even the Traditionalist arch-enemies, the [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Cronista de Teruel'' 21.03.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2304527&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he worked to seal an electoral union of the Jaimists, the Integrists, the [[Antonio Maura|Maurists]] and independent candidates, to be fielded in the [[Spanish general election, 1918|forthcoming electoral campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 21.11.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3049708&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to first secretary of the Madrid municipal Jaimist organization,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 06.05.17, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1917/05/06/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1918 growing to its jefe&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 23.09.17, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029778907&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and soon also jefe of the provincial Madrid structures,&lt;ref&gt;''El Porvenir'' 17.05.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2150876&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; though in general remained a back-row party figure.&lt;ref&gt;Florida is not a single time mentioned in an extensive study dealing with Carlist political history of the late 19th and early 20th history, see Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vázquez de Mella 3.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Vázquez de Mella|de Mella]] speaking, 1916]]
Though he seemed perfectly loyal to Don Jaime,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1918 he entertained Infanta Beatriz, sister of the claimant Don Jaime, ''El Debate'' 23.06.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2279721&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the new internal conflict within Carlism Florida tended rather to side with its key theorist, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]]. This was demonstrated not only by [[Mellismo|Mellista]]-typical penchant for right-wing alliances,&lt;ref&gt;one scholar defined Mellismo as a political strategy, aiming at building ultra-Right alliances centred around Traditionalism though with dynastic issues sidetracked or even ignored, Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by advocating neutralist stand in the [[First World War|Great War]], a strategy intended to counter pro-[[Entente Cordiale|Entente]] feelings and effectively supporting the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;1916 co-organized "conferencia neutralista", ''Heraldo Militar'' 28.10.16, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003417319&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Florida was not among chief protagonists of the strife and remained in the background; however, when in 1919 Vázquez de Mella broke away and set up his own party, Dolz de Espejo decided to join him.

Upon declaration of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] Florida tried to transfer his capital abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''El Telegrama del Rif'' 04.06.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000176172&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apprehended by the customs service he was detained and possibly suffered forfeiture of some of the assets smuggled.&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 30.05.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=10&amp;path=1000319232&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified time he returned to Carlist loyalty by entering [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]], which in 1932 re-joined the former Jaimistas, Integristas and Mellistas. In 1933 he was appointed its Jefe Regional of Castilla La Nueva.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento Alaves'' 12.08.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;path=1000032204&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite holding a theoretically prestigious position, Florida did not seem particularly active; he was seldom recorded as speaking at party meetings&lt;ref&gt;though at times he did, compare ''Tradición'' 15.01.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=27&amp;path=1000208691&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and historians almost do not mention his name when discussing Carlist activities during the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;1935 he co-founded a company Editorial Católica Gráfica, called up to issue a Madrid Catholic review ''Esto''; it is not clear whether this was part of the Carlist propaganda efforts, ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 13.02.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5049194&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what his position was on controversial question of alliances with other monarchist and Right-wing groupings or on internal leadership rivalry between [[Tomas Dominguez Arevalo|Conde de Rodezno]] and [[Manuel Fal Conde|Manuel Fal]]. In 1935 the latter triggered his nomination to Junta de Hacienda,&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'' vol. 30/2, Sevilla 1979, p. 57, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El carlisme català durant la Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; a body entrusted with organizing funds for the Comunión.

==Towards political climax (1936-1937)==
[[File:Tropas del bando nacional (14 de 16) - Fondo Marín-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|left|thumb|[[requetés]] (1936)]]
It is not clear whether Florida was engaged in Carlist preparations to the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|July 1936 coup]]; in particular there is no information whether he opted for unconditional alliance with the military or rather for negotiating terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, ''Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul'', Estella 2013, {{ISBN|9788423533657}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It is neither known where he was during the first days of the fighting. Later Francoist propaganda claimed that from the onset Florida acted as member of Junta Carlista de Guerra del Reino de León;&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 29.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3103206&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''Heraldo de Zamora'' 27.03.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2265890&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the first confirmed information is that in September he emerged in [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], busy organizing [[Requeté]];&lt;ref&gt;''Miróbriga'' 20.09.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000166257&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in October his [[León (historical region)|León]] efforts gained him a letter of thanks from the new Carlist regent, [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Zamora'' 14.10.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2257433&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though he is not listed as member of the national Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra,&lt;ref&gt;Florida is not listed among members of the Junta and heads of its agencies, compare Ricardo Ollaquindia Aguirre, ''La Oficina de Prensa y Propaganda Carlista de Pamplona al comienzo de la guerra de 1936'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 56 (1995), pp. 485-6&lt;/ref&gt; residing in [[Salamanca]] he started to take part in meetings of the Comunión leaders. For reasons which are not entirely clear his position grew; perhaps as a host Florida presided over a Carlist emergency meeting of December 1936, called to deal with Franco’s demand that Fal Conde leaves Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime del Burgo Torres, ''Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil española. La Real Academia Militar de Requetés y el destierro de Fal Conde'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 196 (1992), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what position he took; some historians discussing the day refer to him as "Rodezno’s ally", which suggests that Florida proposed that the ultimatum be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francisco Franco 1930.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]]]
Starting early 1937 the Carlists were facing a prospect of forced amalgamation into a state party; the claimant and the Falcondistas opted for intransigence, Rodezno and the [[Navarre]]se opted for negotiations. Florida was present at a February meeting in [[Insua]] and sided with the Rodeznistas,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; position maintained also in March.&lt;ref&gt;in March 1937 Consejo de la Tradicióñ decided to send a delegation to Franco informing him that Junta Nacional resigned and could be re-appointed according to his will; the envoys were Martinez Berasain, Marcelino Ulibarri and José María García Verde, Florida was not mentioned, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 42, 126&lt;/ref&gt; In early April he took part in a meeting of a somewhat rebellious Navarrese Junta Central; it adopted a Franco-addressed proposal suggesting a directorio, composed of Carlists, [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangists]] and caudillo’s appointees.&lt;ref&gt;the meeting took place on April 4, 1937. The 12-member directorio was to composed of 3 Carlists, 3 Falangists and 6 appointees of Franco, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|9788487863523}}, p. 262. It does not seem that at the time Florida took the unification threat very seriously, as on April 8, 1937 he was appointed president of jury to examin proposals for AET logotypes, ''Pensamiento Alaves'' 08.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000032217&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-April he was one of 4 Carlists summoned to [[Burgos]]; generalísimo informed them about forthcoming political unification.&lt;ref&gt;apart from Florida, they were Rodezno, Ulíbarri and Martínez Berasain, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why he was picked up by Franco; some suggest that Florida was among most "conspicuous" Carlists because of his Requeté recruitment activities.&lt;ref&gt;"con cargo preeminente en la dirección del Requeté", Maximiliano García Venero, ''Historia de la unificación'', Madrid 1970, p. 96. This argument does not seem convincing, since the man formally responsible for Requeté, [[Jose Luis Zamanillo Gonzalez-Camino|Jose Luis Zamanillo]], was actually ignored by the Franco headquarters. As to Rodezno, it seems that he and his entourage considered unification sort of a loose general alliance; he ensured his fellow partymen that unification means monarchy, regionalism and Catholicism. Some scholars are not sure whether Florida took part in the meeting, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 288, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time Franco and his aides were already considering personal composition of executive of the state party just to be announced. Florida was not among the Carlists initially marked; presented by Franco with shortlisted candidates,&lt;ref&gt;there were 3 Carlists on the original list of candidates: Conde de Rodezno, Marcelino Ulibarri and Luis Arellano, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Rodezno suggested that [[Marcelino Ulibarri]] is dropped and one more seat is reserved for the Carlists, coming with the names of Florida and [[José María Mazón]].&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was accepted and on April 22 Dolz found himself among 4 Carlists nominated to a 10-member&lt;ref&gt;some scholars say there were 9 members, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; "Secretariado o Junta Política"&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial de la Provincia de Soría'' 28.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=3027541&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; of Falange Española Tradicionalista.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Of all its members he was perhaps the least-known one; among press-published short notes about the appointees, his was the shortest one.&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 29.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3103206&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Terms of unification]] greatly disappointed many Carlists, including some of the Junta appointees;&lt;ref&gt;following publication of the Unification Decree some Carlists - Rodezno, Arellano, Ortigosa, Berasain - disgusted with its terms, visited Franco to voice their opinion; Florida was not among them, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the regent was furious. In June the Carlist junteros asked him to authorize their presence in the Junta, but to no avail;&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009 , p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; later on all were expulsed from Comunión for breach of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim they were expulsed on July 18, 1937 - Ana Marín Fidaldo, Manuel M. Burgueño, ''In memoriam. Manuel J. Fal Conde (1894-1975)'', Sevilla 1980, p. 45; some claim the correct date is December 3, 1937, Garcia Venero 1970, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive or figurehead (1937-1939)==
[[File:Bandera FE JONS.png|thumbnail|left|Falangist standard]]
Frustrated by lack of the Falangist give and take in the Junta, some Carlists complained to Franco; the result were October 1937 nominations to another party body, a 50-member Consejo Nacional.&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial de la Provincia de Soría'' 26.10.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3028380&amp;presentacion=pagina here], César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biografía política (1901-1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Florida found himself among 12 Carlist nominees&lt;ref&gt;the nominees were not listed alphabetically, but in a specific order; Florida was among the last Carlists ranked. The sequence was as follows: 2. Rodezno, 6. [[Esteban de Bilbao Eguía|Bilbao]], 8. Muñoz Aguilar, 12. [[Joaquin Baleztena Ascarate|Baleztena]], 14. [[María Rosa Urraca Pastor|Urraca]], 17. [[Jose Maria Valiente Soriano|Valiente]], 23. Fal, 27. [[Jose Luis de Oriol y Uriguen|Oriol]], 29. Mazón, 32. Florida, 47. Arellano, 49. Toledo&lt;/ref&gt; and was already firmly mounted among highest-positioned civilians of the Francoist Spain, sitting in two bodies directing the only political organization allowed in the state.&lt;ref&gt;none of the sources consulted provided any insight into a meteoric rise of Florida; from a local Carlist jefe, inactive and with no particular skills demonstrated so far, he turned into one of the highest-positioned civilians in the Francoist state&lt;/ref&gt; However, many historians agree that both executive structures were rather decorative and that the entire party was at that stage a nascent structure, called into being to ensure that power stays with Franco and yet to acquire its later dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;compare Stanley G. Payne, ''Fascism in Spain'', Madison 1999, {{ISBN|9780299165642}}, especially chapters ''Francisco Franco and the formation of the Falange Española Tradicionalista'', pp. 239-272, and ''The FET during the Civil War'', pp. 273-39&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Carlists were enraged to find that what they supposed to be an organization they could control or at least influence was increasingly turning into a new version of Falange, with syndicalist blue-shirts systematically gaining the upper hand. Following unification Carlist rank-and-file started to bombard their leaders in Junta and in Consejo with complaints about getting sidetracked, asking for support. As recipient of these notes and phone calls Florida is recorded as pledging support; it is not clear whether he indeed intervened, though it is clear that nothing changed.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Parejo Fernández, ''Falangistas y requetés: historia de una absorción violenta'', [in:] María Encarna Nicolás Marín, Carmen González Martínez (eds.), ''Ayeres en discusión: temas clave de Historia Contemporánea'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788483717721}}, pp. 12-14, 16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Entrevista entre Franco y el conde Ciano en San Sebastián en julio de 1939.jpg|thumb|160px|Francoism, 1939]]
Throughout most of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] in public Florida maintained a loyal Francoist stand.&lt;ref&gt;apparently he remained also on very good terms with the military of the Burgos headquarters, as he was in position to issue recommendations regarding handling of foreign vounteers; it was thanks to his support that in August 1937 colonel [[Antonio Barroso y Sánchez-Guerra]] directed a certain Andre Radzivill, referred to as "Principe de Estado de Ucraina (Polonia Rusa)", to enlist to the 6. Navarrese Brigade, Jan Stanisław Ciechanowski, ''Polscy ochotnicy po stronie narodowej'', [in:] Jan Kieniewicz (ed.), ''Studia polsko-hiszpańskie. Wiek XX'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|8392018028}}, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In newspapers he was quoted arguing in favor of the unification; according to him both Carlism and Falange were anti-democratic, anti-Liberal, anti-parliamentarian and Catholic, he claimed also that both supported monarchist solution, to be implemented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;''El Diario Palentino'' 28.02.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=2192141&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently he also tried to cultivate the Traditionalist format as much as he could, with some other FET executives attending sermons honoring Carlist kings [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]]&lt;ref&gt;''Azul'' 19.11.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=10&amp;path=2003792&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos]]&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Zamora'' 28.09.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=1000116311&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; or taking part in annual Carlist feast dedicated to Mártires de la Tradición, initially observed by the state party. On the other hand, he did not refrain from attending new-style events, like banquets in the [[Nazi]] headquarters in Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 30.11.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5048112&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he acted as FET Jefe Provincial in [[Salamanca (province)|Salamanca]],&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Zamora'' 28.03.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=2261949&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; typically one of the 3 most important civilian positions in every province;&lt;ref&gt;the other two were gobernador civil and alcalde of the province capital, Andreu Ginés i Sànchez, ''La instauració del franquisme al País Valencià'' [PhD thesis Universitat Pompeu Fabra], Barcelona 2008, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; it is not clear what exact dates of his term were.

Florida’s career at the top of the Francoist political strata came to the end in late summer of 1939. As late as in August he was still reported taking part in public events as consejero nacional,&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 13.07.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=3103656&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; but this changed in September; he did not find himself among appointees to the II Consejo Nacional and starting 1940 he was reported in the press simply as "Conde de la Florida".&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.03.40, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1940/03/12/012.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; None of the sources consulted offers any insight into his departure from the party executive, and specifically whether it was a fall from grace or a conscious decision to withdraw. It could have been resignation following disappointment with the syndicalist format of the new party; it could have been marginalization suffered as a result of an internal conflict, as it happened with [[Joaquín Bau]], another Carlist sidetracked by [[Ramón Serrano Suñer]],&lt;ref&gt;Joaquín Monserrat Cavaller, ''Joaquín Bau Nolla y la restauración de la Monarquía'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8487863949}}, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; especially that Florida publicly kept declaring inevitable restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;''El Diario Palentino'' 28.02.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=2192141&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political retirement and long senility (after 1939)==
[[File:RUMHE_logotype.jpg|thumb|left|RUMHE logotype]]
No longer in the top political flight, in the early 1940s Florida was still present in public life, e.g. taking part in Traditionalism-flavored feasts attended by some FET heavyweights.&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 12.03.40, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=3104332&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he was not appointed to the III Consejo Nacional&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 24.11.42, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1942/11/24/007.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his political career seemed definitely over. This might not have been exactly the case, as in 1944 he was reported among governmental officials, namely noted as subsecretario de industria.&lt;ref&gt;''Imperio'' 27.02.44, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000119252&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; This was, however, definitely the last of his Francoist episodes; afterwards he was no longer mentioned related either to the party or to the government. He did not accept an olive branch from Carlism; in 1942 Fal declared that all those stained by Falangism might be re-admitted given they abandon their state party links; the offer explicitly excluded from the scheme some of the leaders, but Florida was not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s he ventured to publicly demonstrate support for [[Ricardo Oreja]], his old-time fellow Mellista, when the latter succeeded in Madrid municipal elections.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 22.02.49, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1949/02/22/016.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though already at the retirement age, Florida remained active in a number of enterprises, mostly related to mineral resources and dependent businesses, like construction or pharmaceuticals; some of them, like RUMHE,&lt;ref&gt;RUMHE standing for Riqueza Urbana Madrileña Juan de Herrera, ''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 14.06.43, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=7148991&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; landed hefty contracts in prestigious locations, like the [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Madrid Gran Vía]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 15.05.44, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;path=7149381&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he regularly featured in societé columns, attending aristocratic feasts related and unrelated to his own family. His political engagements were almost inexistent, except that he kept attending the Mártires de la Tradición sermons.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 11.03.56, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1956/03/11/072.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; This changed abruptly in the mid-1950s. In 1956 Florida was awarded [[Order of Civil Merit|Gran Cruz del Mérito Civil]], a very prestigious Francoist honor.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 18.07.56, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1956/07/18/036.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he was among 70-odd Carlists who concluded their longtime rapprochement with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsist]] claimant, [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Don Juan]]. Satisfied that formal acceptance of Traditionalist principles rendered him fit for succession also from the Carlist perspective, they declared him the legitimate heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 139, Vallverdu 2014, p. 157, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Florida, one of the most distinguished of the so-called "Estorilos", entered the claimant’s Consejo Privado, the post retained until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 02.04.93, available [http://hemeroteca.sevilla.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1993/04/02/100.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as an octogenarian Florida kept attending social events, at times assuming unlikely roles; in 1962 he formed part of a jury at a female beauty contest.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 25.05.62, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1962/05/25/003.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained engaged in religious activities, in particular in ranks of Hermandad de Caballeros de San Juan Bautista y Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes;&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 16.12.63, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=18&amp;path=7150283&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally he presided over charity initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 10.02.64, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=19&amp;path=7150187&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Cautiously he kept admitting Traditionalist heritage; apart from cultural events like those dedicated to memory of Vázquez de Mella&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 27.02.58, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1958/02/27/041.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s he engaged in Hermandad de Cristo Rey de Requetés ex Combatientes, formally an organisation of Carlist Civil War combatants though in practice a Traditionalist bulwark in internal Carlist strife, aimed against a newly emergent [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|progressist faction]];&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 11.06.67, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1967/06/11/089.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; nothing indicates he was aware of the background and historians extensively discussing internal fragmentation of Carlism in the 1960s and 1970s do not mention his name.&lt;ref&gt;there are 3 PhD studies dealing with history of Carlism in the Francoist era, but except mentioning the 1957 Estoril episode, none of them mentions Florida, compare Martorell Pérez 2009, Ramón María Rodón Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962–1977'', Pamplona 1997; {{ISBN|9788431315641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late 1960s he kept cultivating the Juanista link;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 07.05.67, available [http://hemeroteca-paginas.lavanguardia.com/LVE07/HEM/1967/05/07/LVG19670507-021.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s he was noted only as attending weddings of his grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 07.06.72, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1972/06/07/057.html here], ''ABC'' 09.10.73, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1973/10/09/058.html here], ''ABC'' 25.10.73, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1973/10/25/055.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;
