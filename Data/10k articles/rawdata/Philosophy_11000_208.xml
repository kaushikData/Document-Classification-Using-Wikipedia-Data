'''Adam Bełcikowski''' (Belcikowski) (December 24, 1839 – January 13, 1909) was a Polish philosopher, historian of literature, poet and a [[dramaturg]]. He was born and died in [[Kraków]].

== Education ==

Belcikowski attended Saint Barbe school and Saint Ann Highschool. In 1859, he enrolled at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków as a philosophy student and obtained his doctorate in Philosophy in 1863.

== Career ==

In 1866, Belcikowski was appointed assistant in History of Polish Literature in [[Warsaw]]. In 1868, he left Warsaw and got back to [[Kraków]]. In 1869, he became professor in a junior high school in [[Lviv]]. In 1870 he was appointed professor of History of Polish Literature at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków alongside [[Stanisław Tarnowski]]. In 1876, he became "skryptor" of the Library of the Jagiellonian University, a title that would last till his death. There are two aspects in his works that are research and creation. He wrote novels, sort stories as well as dramas and comedies. Within a collective publication he published a series of critics and historical researches under the title "Ze stuyów nad literarurą polską". This publication was issued on the exact 25th year of his taking on writing. Adam Belcikowski was buried in [[Rakowicki Cemetery]] in Kraków.

Woods Professor of [[Philosophy]] and Professor of [[Classics]] (by courtesy) at [[Stanford University]], and also Professor [[Emeritus]] of Philosophy at [[UC Berkeley]]. He is a respected scholar of [[ancient Greek philosophy]], who has written a handful of important articles on Aristotle's metaphysics, science, and logic. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amacad.org/news/classlist2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Code did his BA, MA, and PhD at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], writing his dissertation under [[Terry Penner]]. Before taking up a position at Stanford in 2011, he was Board of Governors Professor of Philosophy at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/code-from-rutgers-to-stanford.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, he taught for many years at Berkeley, and also at the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Ohio State University]].

[[File:Domenico Beccafumi - The Annunciation - WGA01551.jpg|thumb|[[Domenico di Pace Beccafumi|Domenico Beccafumi]], 1545]]

The '''Annunciation''' has been one of the most frequent subjects of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' by Peter Murray and Linda Murray 1996 {{ISBN|0-19-866165-7}} page 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Images of the Mother of God:'' by Maria Vassilaki 2005 {{ISBN|0-7546-3603-8}} pages 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of the Annunciation go back to early Christianity, with the [[Priscilla catacomb]] in Rome including the oldest known fresco of the [[Annunciation]], dating to the 4th century.&lt;ref name=Pris&gt;''The Annunciation To Mary'' by Eugene LaVerdiere 2007 {{ISBN|1-56854-557-6}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes depicting the Annunciation represent the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] via the announcement by the [[Gabriel|angel Gabriel]] that Mary would conceive a child to be born the son of God.

The scene is an invariable one in cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]], and often included as the initial scene in those of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''. [[Fresco]]s depicting this scene have appeared in [[Roman Catholic Marian churches]] for centuries, and it has been a topic addressed by many artists in multiple media, ranging from [[stained glass]] to [[mosaic]], to [[relief]], to [[sculpture]] to oil painting.&lt;ref&gt;Annunciation Art, Phaidon Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7148-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==
Particularly popular during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], it appears in the work of almost all of the great masters. The figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[archangel Gabriel]], were favorite subjects of [[Roman Catholic Marian art]]. Works on the subject have been created by [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], and thousands of other artists. The mosaics of [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome (1291), the [[fresco]]s of [[Giotto]] in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] (1303), [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s fresco at the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]] (1486), and [[Donatello]]'s gilded sculpture at the church of [[Santa Croce, Florence]] (1435) are famous examples.

The composition of depictions is very consistent, with Gabriel, normally standing on the left, facing the Virgin, who is generally seated or kneeling, at least in later depictions. Typically Gabriel is shown in near-profile, while the Virgin faces more to the front.  She is usually shown indoors, or in a porch of some kind, in which case Gabriel may be outside the building entirely, in the Renaissance often in a garden, which refers to the [[hortus conclusus]], sometimes an explicit setting for ''Annunciations''.  The building is sometimes clearly the Virgin's home, but is also often intended to represent the [[Jerusalem Temple]], as some legendary accounts placed the scene there.  The Virgin may be shown reading, as medieval legend represented her as a considerable scholar, or engaged in a domestic task, often reflecting another legend that she was one of a number of virgins asked to weave a new [[Veil of the Temple]].  Late medieval commentators distinguished several phases of the Virgin's reaction to the appearance of Gabriel and the news, from initial alarm at the sudden vision, followed by reluctance to fulfill the role, to a final acceptance.  These are reflected in art by the Virgin's posture and expression.

In Late Medieval and Early Renaissance the impregnation of the Virgin by God may be indicated by rays falling on her, typically through a window, as light passing through a window was a frequent metaphor in devotional writing for her virginal conception of Jesus.  Sometimes a small figure of [[God the Father]] or the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove is seen in the air, as the source of the rays.  Less common examples feature other biblical figures in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;For an example, see Paris, Bibl. Mazarine, ms. 0412, f. 282v. "Annunciation avec le roi David." Musiconis Database. Université Paris-Sorbonne. http://musiconis.huma-num.fr/fiche/1298/fiche. Accessed January 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel, especially in northern Europe, is often shown wearing the [[vestment]]s of a [[deacon]] on a grand feast day, with a [[cope]] fastened at the centre with a large morse (brooch).  Especially in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], images may contain very complex programmes of visual references, with a number of domestic objects having significance in reinforcing the theology of the event.  Well-known examples are the [[Mérode Altarpiece]] of [[Robert Campin]], and the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' by Jan van Eyck in Washington]].

==Byzantine Rite==
[[Byzantine Rite]] [[icon]]s display, as is usual, even more consistent compositions than medieval Western images.  The Virgin is nearly always on the right, normally either standing or seated on a throne with a building behind her; there are also often buildings visible behind Gabriel. These styles were generally copied in the West until a surprisingly late date, around the 13th century; more varied Western depictions were slower to develop than with other standard religious subjects.

Because of the natural composition of the scene as two figures facing each other, the subject was often employed in the decoration of a [[diptych]] or [[tympaneum]] (decorated arch above a doorway). In churches of the Byzantine Rite, the Annunciation is typically depicted on the [[Holy Doors]] (decorative doorway leading from the [[nave]] into the [[sanctuary]]), and in the West the two figures are also found on different surfaces, in the outer panels of [[polyptych]]s that have an open and closed view, the doors of [[tabernacle]]s, or simply on facing pages in [[illuminated manuscripts]] or different compartments of large [[altarpiece]]s.

{{For|similar English terms|Voice of God}}
[[File:Ezekiel 1.jpeg|thumb|[[Ezekiel]] hears the voice, represented by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], [[Dura-Europos Synagogue]], 3rd century CE.]]
In Judaism '''''bat kol''''' or '''''bat ḳōl''''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''בּת קול''', literally "daughter of voice", "voice of God")  is a "heavenly or divine voice which proclaims God's will or judgment."&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]: ''[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2651-bat-kol#anchor12 BAT ḲOL]'': {{cite web|last1=Kohler|first1=Kaufmann|last2=Blau|first2=Ludwig|title=BAT ḲOL|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2651-bat-kol#anchor12|website=JewishEncyclopedia.com - The unedited full-text of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It signifies the [[Ruach HaKodesh|ruach ha-kodesh]] (רוח הקודש, "the spirit of holiness") or serves as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for God; "but it differed essentially from the [[Prophet#Judaism|Prophet]]s", though these were delegates or mouthpieces of ''ruaḥ ha-kodesh''.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

In art it is represented by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]].

== Jewish Bible  ==
The characteristic attributes of the voice of God are the invisibility of the speaker and a certain remarkable quality in the sound, regardless of its strength or weakness. A sound proceeding from some invisible source was considered a heavenly voice, since the [[Revelation#Mass revelation|mass revelation]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Sinai]] was given in that way in Deuteronomy 4:12: "Ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice". In this account, God reveals himself to man through his organs of hearing, not through those of sight. Even the prophet [[Ezekiel]], who sees many visions, "heard a voice of one that spoke" (Ezek 1:28); similarly, [[Elijah]] recognized God by a "still, small voice," and a voice addressed him (I Kings 19:12–13; compare Job 4:16); sometimes God's voice rang from the heights, from Jerusalem, from Zion (Ezek. 1:25; Jer 25:30; Joel 3:16–17; Amos 1:2, etc.); and God's voice was heard in the thunder and in the roar of the sea.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

== Talmud ==
In the period of the [[Tannaim]] (''c'' 100 BCE-200 CE) the term ''bath ḳōl'' was in very frequent use and was understood to signify not the direct voice of God, which was held to be supersensible, but the echo of the voice (the ''bath'' being somewhat arbitrarily taken to express the distinction). The rabbis held that ''bath ḳōl'' had been an occasional means of divine communication throughout the whole history of Israel and that since the cessation of the prophetic gift after the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] Era it was the sole means of Divine revelation. 

It is noteworthy that the rabbinical conception of ''bath ḳōl'' sprang up in the period of the decline of Jewish [[prophecy]] and flourished in the period of extreme traditionalism. Where the gift of prophecy was believed to be lacking – perhaps even because of this lack – there grew up an inordinate desire for special divine manifestations. Often a voice from heaven was looked for to clear up matters of doubt and even to decide between conflicting interpretations of the law. So strong had this tendency become that Rabbi Joshua (''c''. 100 CE) felt it to be necessary to oppose it and to insist upon the supremacy and the sufficiency of the written law.

The last [[nevi'im]] ("spokespersons", "prophets") mentioned in the [[Jewish Bible]] are [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]], all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year [[Babylonian captivity]]. The [[Talmud]] ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a) states that nowadays only the "Bath Kol" exists.

== Art ==
In Jewish art the ''Bat Ḳol'' was often represented by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], as in the [[Synagogue of Dura-Europas]].

== Literature ==
[[Josephus]] (Ant., XIII, x, 3) relates that [[John Hyrcanus]] (135–104 BCE) heard a voice while offering a [[burnt offering|burnt sacrifice]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]], which Josephus expressly interprets as the voice of God.&lt;ref name="ISBE"&gt;{{ISBE|article=Bath Kol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Hebrew]] traditions, [[Metatron]] − an archangel and [[God in Judaism|God]]'s celestial scribe − is called the "Voice of God".

'''Syed Abdullah Shah Qadri'''&lt;ref name="apnaorg"&gt;[http://www.apnaorg.com/poetry/bullahn/ The Life of Bulleh Shah]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|سید عبداللہ شاہ قادری}}}}), popularly known as '''Bulleh Shah'''  ({{Nastaliq|بلھے شاہ}}), was a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]-era [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and [[Sufi poet]]. His first spiritual teacher was [[Shah Inayat Qadiri]], a [[Sufi]] [[murshid]] of [[Lahore]].

== Poetry ==
Bulleh Shah lived after the [[Pashto]] Sufi poet [[Rahman Baba]] (1632–1706) and lived in the same period as [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] Sufi poet [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] (1689–1752). His lifespan also overlapped with the Punjabi poet [[Waris Shah]] (1722–1798), of ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' fame, and the Sindhi Sufi poet Abdul Wahab (1739–1829), better known by his pen name [[Sachal Sarmast]]. Amongst [[Urdu]] poets, Bulleh Shah lived 400 miles away from [[Mir Taqi Mir]] (1723–1810) of [[Agra]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Bulleh Shah practised the Sufi tradition of Punjabi poetry established by poets like [[Shah Hussain]] (1538–1599), [[Sultan Bahu]] (1629–1691), and [[Shah Sharaf]] (1640–1724).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The verse form Bulleh Shah primarily employed is the [[Kafi]], popular in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] poetry.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Many people have put his [[Kafi]]s to music, from humble street-singers to renowned Sufi singers like [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Pathanay Khan]], [[Abida Parveen]], the [[Waddali Brothers]] and [[Sain Zahoor]], from the synthesised techno [[qawwali]] remixes of UK-based Asian artists to the Pakistani rock band [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Modern renderings==

===Bands and albums===
In the 1990s, [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]], a rock band from Pakistan, rendered his poems "[[Bullah Ki Jaana]]" and "Aleph" ("Ilmon Bas Kareen O Yaar"). In 2004, [[Rabbi Shergill]] turned the abstruse metaphysical poem "Bullah Ki Jaana" into a rock/fusion song in his debut album ''[[Rabbi (album)|Rabbi]]''; the song was a chart-topper in 2005, helping the album to eventually sell over 10,000 copies and became immensely popular in India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050604/asp/calcutta/story_4806895.asp| title = Soundscape for the soul| author = Zeeshan Jawed| publisher = [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]| location = [[Calcutta]]| date = 4 June 2005| accessdate = 23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/04/11/stories/2005041100540100.htm| title = Urban balladeer| publisher = [[The Hindu]]| author = Bageshree S.| date = 26 March 2005| accessdate = 23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wadali brothers|Wadali Bandhu]], a Punjabi Sufi group from India, have also released a version of "Bullah Ki Jaana" in their album ''Aa Mil Yaar... Call of the Beloved''. Another version was performed by [[Lakhwinder Wadali]] and entitled "Bullah".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Dama Dam Mast Qalandar]], a [[qawwali]] composed in honour of [[Shahbaz Qalandar]], has been one of Bulleh Shah's most popular poems and has been frequently rendered by many Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi singers including [[Noor Jehan]], [[Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Abida Parveen]], [[Sabri Brothers]], [[Wadali brothers]], [[Reshman]] and [[Runa Laila]]. Other qawwali songs by Bulleh Shah, include "[[Sade Vehre Aya Kar]]" and "[[Mera Piya Ghar Aaya]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Also in 2016, a collaboration between two EDM artists ([[Headhunterz]] and Skytech) named "Kundalini" used words created by Bulleh Shah, as well as having the words Bulleh Shah in the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8zB7QKU87c&lt;/ref&gt; Bulleh Shah's verses have been an inspiration to painters as well, as in the two series of paintings (''Jogia Dhoop'' and ''Shah Shabad'') by an Indian painter [[Geeta Vadhera]] inspired by the poetry of Bulleh Shah and other Sufi poets and saints. In 2017, British Pakistani singer Yasir Akhtar used Bulleh Shah's poetry in his song "Araam Naal Kar - Take it Easy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l9kI5-aiGQ|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Yasir Akhtar | Araam Naal Kar - Take it Easy ft.Martay M'Kenzy (Official Video)&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=3 February 2017|accessdate=16 February 2017|via=YouTube|publisher=Yasir Akhtar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/130751-Yasir-Akhtar-the-singing-sensation-is-back-with-Aram-Nal-Kar|title=Yasir Akhtar, the singing sensation, is back with 'Aram Nal Kar'|date=11 February 2017|accessdate=16 February 2017|via=Geo News|publisher=Tanveer Khatana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Some of Bulleh Shah's verses, including "[[Tere Ishq Nachaya]]", have been adapted and used in [[Bollywood]] film songs including "[[Chaiyya Chaiyya]]" and "Thayya Thayya" in the 1998 film ''[[Dil Se..]]'', and "Ranjha Ranjha" in the 2010 film ''[[Raavan]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The 2007 Pakistani movie ''[[Khuda Kay Liye]]'' includes Bulleh Shah's poetry in the song "Bandeya Ho". The 2008 [[Bollywood]] film, ''A Wednesday'', included a song titled "Bulle Shah, O Yaar Mere". In 2014, [[Ali Zafar]] sung some of his verses as "[[Chal Bulleya|Chal Buleya]]" for Bollywood soundtrack album ''[[Total Siyapaa]]'', and the song was reprised by Zafar same year in ''[[Pakistan Idol]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The 2016 Bollywood films "[[Sultan (2016 film)|Sultan]]" and ''[[Ae Dil Hai Mushkil]]'' feature the song "Bulleya", sung by Papon and Amit Mishra respectively, which is short for Bulleh Shah. A song "Hun Kis Theen" based on his poetry was also featured in Punjabi animated film ''[[Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===[[Coke Studio (Pakistan)|''Coke Studio'']]===
In 2009, the second season of ''Coke Studio'' featured "Aik Alif" performed by [[Sain Zahoor]] and [[Noori]]. Ali Zafar also used some of Bulleh Shah and [[Shah Hussain]]'s verses in his "Dastan-e-Ishq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr8NGEGTK6Q|title=Dastaan-e-ishq, Ali Zafar - BTS, Coke Studio Pakistan, Season 2|date=23 June 2009|via=YouTube|publisher=Rohail Hyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the third season featured "Na Raindee Hai" and "Makke Gayaan Gal Mukdi Nahi" performed by Arieb Azhar. In 2012, Shah's poetry was featured with [[Hadiqa Kiani]] performing "Kamlee".&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/jm_qasim/kamlee-hd-hadiqa-kiani-coke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakium.com/2012/05/13/hadiqa-kiani-kamlee-coke-studio-season-5-episode-1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Ahmed Jahanzeb]] and [[Umair Jaswal]] performed "Khaki Banda";&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewsteller.com/showbiz/watch-coke-studio-9-episode-3-promo/38529/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rizwan Butt]] and [[Sara Haider]] performed "Meri Meri",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewsteller.com/showbiz/watch-coke-studio-9-episode-6/38744/&lt;/ref&gt; the songs were too based on Shah's verses.

'''Carlo Michelstaedter''' or '''Michelstädter''' (3 June 1887 – 17 October 1910) was an Italian philosopher, artist, poet and [[Intellectual|man of letters]].

== Life ==
Carlo Michelstaedter was born in [[Gorizia]], the capital of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[County of Gorizia and Gradisca]], as the youngest of four children of Albert and Emma Michelstaedter Coen Luzzatto. His older siblings were Gino (1877–1909), Elda (1879–1944), Paula (1885–1972). His full name was Carlo Raimondo (Gedaliah Ram). His father was the director of the local branch of the [[Trieste]]-based ''[[Assicurazioni Generali]]'' insurance company. The Michelstaedters were an Italian-speaking upper middle class [[Jewish]] family of [[Ashkenazi]] origin.

His sister Paula remembered him as a child fearful of the dark and heights, stubborn and not at all prepared to apologize for any misbehavior. In school, he was judged "not very suitable (''minder entsprechend'')" for having intentionally and frequently disturbed the lessons during the year.

His father was the chairman of the ''Gabinetto di Lettura Goriziano'', a local cultural association for the fostering of literary culture, and he pushed his son towards literary study. His mother Emma Luzzatto came from an old and renowned Jewish family of [[Italian irredentist]] leanings. Carlo was considered an introverted boy, but by the end of high school (completed in Gorizia), he developed into a brilliant, athletic, intelligent youth. He enrolled in the department of mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]], but soon moved to [[Florence]], a city he savored for its arts and language. There he formed friendships with other students, and in the end enrolled in the department of letters of the local ''Istituto di Studi Superiori''' (1905). He majored in Greek and Latin, and selected for his ''[[laurea]]'' thesis a philosophical study of ''persuasion and rhetoric'' in ancient philosophy. In 1909 he returned to Gorizia and set himself to work on the thesis.

By about the fall of 1910, he completed his work, finishing the appendices by 17 October. He was surely very tired, and that day he had a fight with his mother, who complained he had not wished her a happy birthday. Left alone, Carlo took a loaded pistol he had in the house and killed himself. So determined to end his life that he shoots himself not once but twice with his revolver, the reasoning behind his suicide has been of much debate, some see it as the natural conclusion to his philosophy, other's see it as a result of confusion. One of his friends from Florence, a Russian woman, had also committed suicide, and probably also a brother who lived in [[United States of America|America]]. Friends and relatives published his works and collected his writings, now in the ''Biblioteca Civica di Gorizia''.

He is buried in the Jewish cemetery in [[Rožna Dolina]] near [[Nova Gorica]], Slovenia.

== Thought ==
Tracing the development of Michelstaedter's ideas is difficult, : His philosophical vision seems to have formed suddenly, and his brief life did not allow for time to explore other directions. For him, common life is an absence of life, narrow and deluded as it is by the god of pleasure, which deceives man, promising pleasures and results that are not real, although man thinks they are. ''Rhetoric''—that is the conventions of the individual, the weak, and society—comprises social life, in which man overpowers nature and himself for his own pleasure. Only by living in the present as if every moment were the last can man free himself from the fear of death, and thus achieve ''Persuasion''; that is, self-possession. Resignation and adapting oneself to the world, for Michelstaedter, is the true death.

However, through his citations, numerous biographies we know : Heraclitus, Parmenides, Schopenhaur, Giacomo Leopardi as to be some of his influences. Leopardi of which he greatly admired, and considered to be a "Persuaded individual" for he had created a world of his own, a copy of Zibaldone was found in his residence with his personnel markings, sometime after his death. Schopenhaur, of which he was introduced to due to his social endeavors in his period of university.

== Philosophy ==
His thesis deals with many themes including language, existence, justice, salvation and the institutionalized.

" Their degeneration is called civil education, their hunger is the activity of progress, their fear is morality, their violence and egoistic hatred—the sword of justice "

[[File:Palaeography (Quaritch) plate15.jpg|300px|thumb|The author and the Priest of Venice, from an MS of the ''Confessio Amantis'' ca. 1399]]

'''''Confessio Amantis''''' ("The Lover's Confession") is a 33,000-line [[Middle English]] poem by [[John Gower]], which uses the [[Confession (religion)|confession]] made by an ageing lover to the chaplain of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] as a [[frame story]] for a collection of shorter narrative poems. According to its prologue, it was composed at the request of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. It stands with the works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[William Langland|Langland]], and the [[The Pearl Poet|Pearl poet]] as one of the great works of late 14th-century English literature. The Index of Middle English Verse shows that in the era before the printing press it was one of the most-often copied manuscripts (59 copies) along with ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (72 copies) and ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' (63 copies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dimev.net/ 
|title=Digital Edition of the Index of Middle English Verse |author1=Linne R. Mooney  |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In genre it is usually considered a poem of consolation, a medieval form inspired by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' and typified by works such as ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]''. Despite this, it is more usually studied alongside other tale collections with similar structures, such as the ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], and particularly Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'', with which the ''Confessio'' has several stories in common.

==Textual history==
Composition of the work probably began circa 1386, and the work was completed in 1390. The prologue of this first recension recounts that the work was commissioned by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] after a chance meeting with the [[royal barge]] on the River Thames; the epilogue dedicates the work to Richard and to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], as the "disciple and poete" of Venus. This version of the work saw widespread circulation, perhaps due to its royal connections (Peck 2000), and was the most popular of Gower's works, with at least 32 of the 49 surviving manuscripts of the ''Confessio'' containing this version.

The subsequent history is complicated and not entirely certain. Much revision took place, some of it by Gower and some probably by individual scribes. What follows is the conventional history as formulated by [[George Campbell Macaulay|Macaulay]] (1901:xxi). The true story is probably somewhat more complicated (see e.g. Watt 2003:11&amp;ndash;13 for an overview of recent work).

According to Macaulay (1901:xxii), a second recension was issued in about 1392, with some significant changes: most notably, most references to Richard are removed, as is the dedication to Chaucer, and these are replaced with a new dedication to Henry of Lancaster, the future [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]. It has naturally been commonly assumed that this reflects a shift in the poet's loyalties, and indeed there are signs that Gower was more attached to Henry's party from this period; but while he did attack Richard later in the decade, there is no evidence that these early changes indicate any particular hostility towards either Richard or Chaucer (Peck 2000), and it has been argued that the revision process was not politically motivated at all, but begun rather because Gower wished to improve the style of the work (Burrows 1971:32), with the dedications being altered as a purely secondary matter. Pearsall (2004:94) assigns a "dubious status" to Macaulay's ‘second recension’ and has other comments on Macaulay's account of the text.

A third and final recension was published in 1393, retaining the dedication to Henry. While only a few manuscripts of this version survive, it has been taken as representing Gower's final vision for the work, and is the best-known version, having served as the basis of all modern editions.

== Style==
Gower's previous works had been written in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] and [[Latin]]. It is not certain why he chose to write his third long poem in English; the only reason Gower himself gives is that "fewe men endite In oure englyssh" (prol.22&amp;ndash;23). It has been suggested that it was the influence of Chaucer, who had in part dedicated his ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' to Gower, that persuaded him that the [[vernacular]] was a suitable language for poetry, and the influence of Chaucer's ''[[The Legend of Good Women|Legend of Good Women]]'' has been detected in the ''Confessio'' (Macaulay 1908:sec 23).

With the exception of a 74{{nbsp}}line letter "unto cupid and to venus" in Book VIII, Gower did not adopt the new [[pentameter]] with which Chaucer had recently been experimenting, and which was in the 15th century to become the standard metre for English rhyme. He retained instead the [[octosyllabic]] line that had previously been the standard form for English poetry, and wrote it in couplets, rather than in the stanzas he had employed in his previous works. Gower characterised his verse in the Confessio as the plain style.

This decision has not always met with appreciation, the shorter lines being sometimes viewed as lending themselves to monotonous regularity, but Gower's handling of the metre has usually been praised. Macaulay (1901:xvi, 1908:sec 33) finds his style technically superior to Chaucer's, admiring "the metrical smoothness of his lines, attained without unnatural accent or forced order of words". The work's most enthusiastic advocate was [[C.S. Lewis]], who, though admitting that the work can be "prosaic" and "dull" in places, identifies a "sweetness and freshness" in the verse and praises its "memorable precision and weight" (Lewis 1936:201). Not all assessments have been so positive: Burrow (1971:31) describes it as "not so much plain as threadbare", and notes that the selective quotations of previous critics have served to draw attention to sections that are better poetry, but unrepresentative of the work as a whole.

== Language ==
Gower's language differs from the London dialect in which Chaucer wrote. Samuels and Smith (1988:15) observed that there are several ways in which his language differs from that of Chaucer.
One group suggests a Kentish influence:&lt;blockquote&gt;
# contracted 3rd person singular present indicative verbs, used to a far greater extent than in Chaucer, e.g.
# ''ie''-spellings as the reflex (modern form) of OE ''ē, ēo,'' and OF ''ē'' e.g. The principal area for these spellings is W Essex and W Kent.
# ''selver'' ‘silver’ a Southern and SW Midlands form.
# ''soster'' ’sister’ : primarily Kentish and South-Western.
# ''þerwhiles (þat)'', "while" : Kentish, with a narrow belt from there into the South Midlands, including earlier London texts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another group is definitely East Anglian:&lt;blockquote&gt;
# ''boþen'' ‘both’ found in Norfolk, Suffolk and an area in the W Midlands.
# ''ȝoue'' ‘given’: primarily an Eastern form.
#) -''h''- as in ''myhte, hyhe, yhen''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Gower's family owned land in SW Suffolk ([[Kentwell Hall]]) and had associations with NW Kent (Brabourne?&lt;ref&gt;Documentation about the poet's birthplace does not exist. Sir Robert Gower (uncle of John Gower) was buried at the church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin in [[Brabourne]]. {{ cite book 
 | title=Antient funeral monuments, of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the islands adjacent
 | author=Weever, John, 1576-1632; | publisher=Tooke, William | year=1767 | chapter=Braborne
 | url=https://archive.org/details/antientfuneralm00weevgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;).(Lee in DNB) Thus "Gower’s dialect is essentially based on the two regional dialects of Kent and Suffolk, not that of London, as Macaulay(1901:cxxx, 1908:sec 32) thought."

Some well known differences between Chaucer and Gower are explained by conclusion that Gower is associated with Kent and Suffolk.&lt;blockquote&gt;
# ''The treatment of reflexes of OE'' ỹ : Chaucer uses ''i, y'' normally but ''e'' occasionally in rhyme. Gower’s practice is the opposite -''e'' more commonly in mid-line, but ''i, y'' in rhyme. …
# ''The present participle:'' Gower’s form, ''-ende'', was a minor variant in Kent where the main form was ''-ynde'', and in the mid-fourteenth-century London dialect where the main form was ''-ande''. Chaucer, who must equally have grown up using some form in ''-nde (-ande ''or ''-ende)'', adopted the more progressive ''-ynge'', but Gower’s persistence with ''-ende'' can be explained only by reference to the Suffolk stratum in his language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Smith (2004:65) concludes that despite these regional features "Gower was evidently part of the linguistic community of late-fourteenth-century London." Gower's vocabulary is educated, with extensive use of French and Latin [[Loanword|loans]], some of them apparently original; for example, the ''Confessio'' is the earliest work in which the word "history" is attested in English (OED also Middle English Dictionary). That the work was aimed at a similarly educated audience is clear from the inclusion of Latin [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]s at the start of each major section.

== Structure and argument ==
The ''Confessio'' is divided into a prologue and eight books, which are divided thematically. The narrative structure is overlaid on this in three levels: the external matter, the [[frame story|narrative frame]], and the individual tales which make up the bulk of the work.

=== External matter ===
The external matter comprises the prologue, which spills over briefly into the start of Book 1, and an epilogue at the end of Book 8. Unlike the bulk of the ''Confessio'', these have much in common with Gower's previous works (Pearsall 1966:475). In the prologue he details at some length the numerous failings he identifies in the [[Estates of the realm|three estates]] (government, church, and people) of his time. This section ends with an account of the dream of [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] (which draws on a similar passage in the ''[[Vox Clamantis]]''), identifying the statue's feet of iron mixed with clay with the medieval world that Gower perceives as hopelessly divided and in danger of imminent collapse. Tens of thousands of lines later, the epilogue returns to these concerns, again touching on the matters Gower believes each estate needs most urgently to attend to.

In this context, the plan of the work given in the prologue is one of the most-quoted passages of the poem:
:''Bot for men sein, and soth it is,''
:''That who that al of wisdom writ''
:''It dulleth ofte a mannes wit''
:''To him that schal it aldai rede,''
:''For thilke cause, if that ye rede,''
:''I wolde go the middel weie''
:''And wryte a bok betwen the tweie,''
:''Somewhat of lust, somewhat of lore...''
::&lt;small&gt;(prol.12&amp;ndash;19)&lt;/small&gt;
This is essentially what he does; the external matter and parts of the narrative frame, together with some long digressions (most notably the whole of Book 7, discussed below) make up the "lore", while the majority of the tales are wholly concerned with "lust".

===Narrative frame===
The frame story as such is easily summarised. The narrator of this section, conventionally referred to as Amans or the Lover, wanders through a forest in May, as medieval lovers typically do, and despairs at his lack of success. He invokes [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Cupid]], who promptly appear and demand to know the reason for his sorrow. Upon being told that he is on the verge of dying from love, Venus insists that he be shriven, and summons her chaplain Genius to hear his [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. When at last Genius pronounces Amans [[absolution|absolved]] of all his sins against love, Venus cures him of his infatuation.

As the work's title implies, therefore, the bulk of the work is devoted to Amans' confession. This broadly follows the pattern of Christian confessions of the time. Genius leads Amans through the [[seven deadly sins]], interpreting them in the context of the [[courtly love]] tradition. He explains the various aspects of each one with exempla, and requires Amans to detail any ways in which he has committed them. The design is that each book of the poem shall be devoted to one sin, and the first six books follow the traditional order for the first six sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, and gluttony.

At this point, however, Gower breaks his form and digresses: at the end of Book 6 Amans requests that Genius give him a break from the confession and teach him wisdom instead, and Genius responds in Book 7 by discoursing at length on the education given by [[Aristotle]] to [[Alexander the Great]]. In Gower's hands this becomes a treatise on good kingship, and it is in this book that it is most obvious how the work is intended to answer the royal commission. This notwithstanding, the digression, and the consequent flaw in an otherwise strict plan, is the most frequently criticised aspect of the poem's structure (see e.g. Pearsall 1966:476).

Book 8 returns to the confession. According to the traditional system, the final sin should be lechery, but since this can hardly be considered a sin against Venus, the topic of the final book is narrowed to the single perversion of incest. Though this is one sin Amans is innocent of, Genius contrives to fill a book nonetheless by telling the longest and best-known story in the ''Confessio'', namely ''[[Apollonius of Tyre]]'' (VIII.271&amp;ndash;2008).

===The tales===
{{further|List of subjects and tales in Confessio Amantis}}

The treatment given to individual stories varies widely. The ''Apollonius'' is nearly 2,000 lines long, but at the other extreme, the distinction between tale and allusion is hard to define; for example, summaries of the story of Troilus and Criseide appear in three places (II.2456&amp;ndash;2458, IV.7597&amp;ndash;7602, VIII.2531&amp;ndash;2535), but none can really be described as a "tale". It follows that it is hard to produce a definite figure for the number of tales in the ''Confessio''. Even excluding the very shortest, however, there are over 100 individual stories (Macaulay 1908:sec 24), making them more numerous than the strict 100 of the ''[[Decameron]]'', and much more so than the ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' or the ''[[The Legend of Good Women|Legend of Good Women]]''.

None of Gower's tales are original. The source he relies on most is [[Ovid]], whose ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' was ever a popular source of exempla; others include the Bible and various other classical and medieval writers, of whom Macaulay (1908:sec 29) lists [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Statius]], [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] (the ''[[Roman de Troie]]''), [[Guido delle Colonne]] (''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]''), [[Godfrey of Viterbo]], [[Brunetto Latini]], [[Nicholas Trivet]], the ''[[Seven Wise Masters|Romans des sept sages]]'', the ''Vita Barlaam et Josaphat'', and the ''Historia Alexandri Magni''.

The best-known tales are those that have analogues in other English writers, since these are often studied for comparison. These include the ''Apollonius'', which served as a source for the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', and the tales shared with Chaucer, such as the tales of Constance (II.587&amp;ndash;1603, also told by the [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law]]) and Florent (I.1407&amp;ndash;1875, also told by the [[The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale|Wife of Bath]]).

==Reception==
The ''Confessio'' was apparently popular in its own time; its 49 surviving manuscripts suggest a popularity about halfway between Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (80 copies) and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' (16 copies). Macaulay (1900: vii) claims that it was the first English book to be translated into a foreign language.Nonetheless, Gower, perhaps more than any poet of his period, has suffered through his close association with Chaucer, who as the preeminent maker of the English Middle Ages overshadows his peers in the same way that Shakespeare dominates the turn of the 17th century. And despite this apparent popularity, critical reactions to the work have often been unfavourable.

In the fifteenth century, Gower and Chaucer were invariably regarded together as the founders of English poetry. John Lydgate praised "Gower Chaucers erthly goddes two", ''The Kings Quair'' was dedicated to "Gowere and chaucere, that on the steppis satt/ of rethorike", and [[George Ashby (poet)|George Ashby]] called Chaucer, Gower and Lydgate "premier poetes of this nacion" (quoted by Fisher, 1965: 3).

The first known criticism is an apparent reference in Chaucer's '[[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Prologue]]': the eponymous Man, praising Chaucer, observes that
:''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;no word ne writeth he''
:''Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee''
:''That loved hir owene brother synfully&amp;mdash;''
:''Of swiche cursed stories I say fy!&amp;mdash;''
:''Or ellis of Tyro Appollonius,''
:''How that the cursed kyng Antiochus''
:''Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede,''
:''That is so horrible a tale for to rede''
::&lt;small&gt;(''Canterbury Tales'', II.77&amp;ndash;84: Bradley et al. 1988)&lt;/small&gt;
Both these examples are references to the ''Confessio'' (''Canace'' is III.143&amp;ndash;336), and it has sometimes been thought that this passage was the direct cause of the removal of the dedication to Chaucer from the later editions of the work (see "Textual History" above). It should be noted that this veiled criticism of the ''Confessio''{{'}}s immoral stories is not necessarily inconsistent with Chaucer's famous dubbing of his friend "Moral Gower"; that passage, in Chaucer's ''Troilus'', was likely written before Gower even began the ''Confessio''.

Later generations have been equally unkind. The influential assessment of [[George Puttenham|Puttenham]] (1589:50) found Gower's English verse inadequate in every respect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Gower [...] had nothing in him highly to be commended, for his verse was homely and without good measure, his wordes strained much deale out of the French writers, his ryme wrested, and in his inuentions small subtilitie: the applications of his moralities are the best in him, and yet those many times very grossely bestowed, neither doth the substance of his workes sufficiently aunswere the subtiltie of his titles.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the 19th century, the ''Confessio'' was regarded by some as an established "monument of dulness and pedantry" (quoted by Coffman 1945:52). While Macaulay (1901:x-xxi, 1908:sec 28) was cautiously appreciative, his contemporary Crawshaw (1907:61) attributed to the work "a certain nervelessness or lack of vigor, and a fatal inability to understand when he had said enough". Even C.S. Lewis, who has been quoted above admiring the style of the work, was unconvinced by its structure, describing the epilogue as "a long and unsuccessful coda" (Lewis 1936:222).

Gower has also been given his share of appreciation. A 15th-century treatise printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]] describes "his bookes, called Confessionalle" as
:''Ful of sentence / set ful fructuosly''
:''That hym to rede / shal gyue you corage''
:''He is so ful of fruyt, sentence and langage''
::&lt;small&gt;(''Book of Curtesye'', 327&amp;ndash;329: Furnivall 1868)&lt;/small&gt;
In some cases he is praised and damned at once; [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] (1640) considers him dangerously attractive, and liable to damage young writers who might be tempted to imitate his style:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...beware of letting them taste ''Gower'', or ''Chaucer'' at first, lest falling too much in love with Antiquity, and not apprehending the weight, they grow rough and barren in language onely''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Russell Peck (scholar)|Peck]] (2000) interprets this as unambiguous praise. And even the structure of his work has been declared perfect by some: Coffman (1945:58) argues that
&lt;blockquote&gt;''[it] has a large integrity and unity based on a defense of [Gower's] ethical scheme for the universe... Gower tells in the Prologue exactly what he is going to do. He does it well. It is worth doing. And he recapitulates in the Epilogue.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Watt (2003:11) sums up the divided critical reactions as "reflecting ... the complexity of both the poem itself, which invites conflicting interpretations and contradictory reactions, and its textual history".

==Legacy==
To his contemporaries, Gower's work was generally as well known as the poetry of Chaucer: Caxton printed Gower's work alongside Chaucer's, and Gower became part of the early canon of English literature. But it was Chaucer's works which became the model for future poets, and the legacy of the ''Confessio'' has suffered as a result. It is hard to find works that show signs of direct influence: the only clear example is Shakespeare's ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', where the influence is conscious borrowing: the use of Gower's characteristic octosyllabic line for the character of Gower himself. The story of the [[brazen head]], here associated with [[Robert Grosseteste]], were later associated with his disciple [[Roger Bacon]].

While not of immense importance as a source for later works, the ''Confessio'' is nonetheless significant in its own right as one of the earliest poems written in a form of English that is clearly recognizable as a direct precursor to the modern standard, and, above all, as one of the handful of works that established the foundations of literary prestige on which modern English literature is built.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12015">A '''crime against peace''', in [[international law]], is "planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of [[War of aggression|wars of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing".&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of crimes against peace was first incorporated into the [[Nuremberg Principles]] and later included in the [[United Nations Charter]]. This definition would play a part in defining [[Aggression (war crime)|aggression as a crime against peace]]. It can also refer to the core international crimes set out in [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], ([[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]]) which adopted crimes negotiated previously in the Draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind.

An important exception to the foregoing are defensive military actions taken under [[Article 51]] of the UN Charter. Such defensive actions are subject to immediate [[Security Council]] review, but do not require UN permission to be legal within international law. "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations." (UN Charter, Article 51) The Security Council will determine if the action is legally the "right of individual or collective self-defence", or it may appoint another UN organ to do this.

==Definition==

{{Original research section|date=June 2008}}
No legal authority exists for the definition of the terms ''"[[territorial integrity]]"'', ''"[[independence|political independence]]"'' and ''"[[sovereignty]]"''. However, their [[face value]] would seem to disclose the following:

* The ''"territorial integrity"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent permanently to deprive a state of any part or parts of its territory, not excluding territories for the foreign affairs of which it is responsible;
* The ''"political independence"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent to deprive a state of the entirety of one or more of the prerequisites of statehood, namely: defined territory, permanent population, constitutionally independent government and the means of conducting relations with other States;
* The ''"sovereignty"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent to overthrow the government of a state or to impede its freedom to act unhindered, as it sees fit, throughout its jurisdiction.

This definition of the crime of aggression belongs to ''[[jus cogens]]'', which is supreme in the hierarchy of [[international law]] and, therefore, it cannot be modified by, or give way to, any rule of international law but one of the same rank. An arguable example is any rule imposing a conflicting obligation to prevent, interdict or vindicate crimes which also belong to ''jus cogens'', namely [[aggression]] itself, [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]], [[war crimes]], [[slavery]], [[torture]] and [[piracy]], so that a war waged consistent with the aim of repressing any of these crimes might not be illegal where the crime comes within the limit of [[Proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]] relative to [[war]] and its characteristic effects.

==Kellogg-Briand Pact==
In 1928, the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], known as the ''General Treaty for the Renunciation of War'', said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a nation does not register with the UN as recognizing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, even if the nation had signed it, the UN cannot hold a claimed violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to be a violation of international law (according to its own Charter, Article 102). The interpretation of Article 102 is reserved to the Security Council, so it is possible that a "crime against peace" might be found by the Security Council, regardless.

==Nuremberg Principles==

In 1945, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] defined three categories of crimes, including ''crimes against peace''. This definition was first used in [[Finland]] to prosecute the political leadership in the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland]]. The principles were later known as the [[Nuremberg Principles]].

In 1950, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] defined Crimes against Peace (in Principle VI.a, submitted to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]) as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances; 
(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939"

For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting [[World War II]].  One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or - it seems - the enforcement of the [[criminal law]] of ''[[jus cogens]]''. It has made formal [[declaration of war]] uncommon after 1945.

During the trial, the chief American prosecutor, [[Robert H. Jackson]], stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]] charged that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were guilty of "substituting power for principle" at Nuremberg. "I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled.", he wrote. "Law was created [[ex post facto]] to suit the passion and clamor of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson, Jr |first1=H. K.|last2=Strutz |first2=Henry|date= |title=Dönitz at Nuremberg: A Reappraisal |url= |location= |publisher=Torrance|page= |isbn=978-0939484058  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Charter==
The first article of the [[United Nations Charter]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Purposes of the [[United Nations]] are:

#To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the [[peace]], and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of [[justice]] and [[international law]], adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a [[breach of the peace]];
#To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of [[Civil rights|equal rights]] and [[self-determination]] of [[peoples]], and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interdiction of [[War of Aggression|aggressive war]] was confirmed and broadened by the United Nations' Charter, which states in article 2, paragraph 4 that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 33===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.

The [[Security Council]] shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 39===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Security Council]] shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 51===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the [[United Nations]], until the [[Security Council]] has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==U.S. laws of war==

The [[U.S. Army]]'s ''Law of Land Warfare'' (Field Manual 27-10) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
498. [[Crimes Under International Law]]

Any person, whether a member of the armed forces or a civilian, who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment. Such offenses in connection with war comprise:

:a. '''Crimes against peace.'''
:b. Crimes against humanity.
:c. War crimes.

Although this manual recognizes the criminal responsibility of individuals for those offenses which may comprise any of the foregoing types of crimes, members of the armed forces will normally be concerned, only with those offenses constituting "war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/27-10/Ch8.htm#s2 FM 27-10 Chptr 8 Remedies for Violation of International Law; War Crimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis added)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vietnam's Criminal Code==

[[Vietnam]]'s Criminal Code calls this crime as the crime of "Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter XXIV: CRIMES OF UNDERMINING PEACE, AGAINST HUMANITY AND WAR CRIMES

:Article 341. Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars

::Those who propagate and/or incite wars of aggression, or prepare, carry out or participate in wars of aggression against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country, shall be sentenced to between twelve years and twenty years of imprisonment, life imprisonment or capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/en/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=610 Vietnam's PENAL CODE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in his (1999) book, 'The Feeling of What Happens', [[Antonio Damasio]]'s three layered''' theory of [[consciousness]]''' is based on a hierarchy of stages, with each stage building upon the last. The most basic representation of the organism is referred to as the Protoself, next is Core Consciousness, and finally, Extended Consciousness. Damasio, who is an internationally recognized leader in [[neuroscience]], was educated at the [[University of Lisbon]] and currently directs the University of Southern California [[Brain and Creativity Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;"USC Neuroscience: Antonio Damasio." USC Neuroscience: Antonio Damasio. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Damasio's approach to explaining the development of consciousness relies on three notions: emotion, feeling, and feeling a feeling. [[Emotions]] are a collection of unconscious neural responses to [[qualia]].{{citation needed|reason=AFAIKDamasio doesn't use the term qualia which has no meaning.  Some philosophers may claim he is making the linkage, but this point requires support.|date=November 2015}}  These complex reactions to stimuli cause observable external changes in the organism. A feeling arises when the organism becomes aware of the changes it is experiencing as a result of external or internal stimuli.&lt;ref name="bosse"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosse | first1 = Tibor | last2 = Jonker | first2 = Catholijn M. | last3 = Treur | first3 = Jan | year = 2008 | title = Formalisation of Damasio's Theory of Emotion, Feeling and Core Consciousness | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000633 | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 94–113 | doi=10.1016/j.concog.2007.06.006| pmid = 17689980 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.77.4458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protoself==

Our most basic representation of self, as Damasio dubs it, is the Protoself.  A non conscious state, this level of self is shared by many species. This is the most basic level of awareness signified by a collection of neural patterns that are representative of the body's internal state. The function of this 'self' is to constantly detect and record, moment by moment, the internal physical changes that affect the [[homeostasis]] of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parvizi | first1 = Josef | last2 = Damasio | first2 = Antonio | year = 2001 | title = Consciousness and the Brainstem | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002770000127X | journal = Cognition | volume = 79 | issue = 1–2| pages = 135–60 | doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00127-X | pmid=11164026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protoself does not represent a traditional sense of self, rather, it is a pre-conscious state, which provides a reference for the core self and autobiographical self to build from. As Damasio puts it, "Protoself is a coherent collection of neural patterns, which map moment-by-moment the state of the physical structure of the organism" (Damasio 1999).&lt;ref name="bosse" /&gt;

Multiple brain areas are required for the Protoself to function.  Namely, the [[hypothalamus]], which controls the general homeostasis of the organism,  the [[brainstem|brain stem]], whose [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] map body signals, and the [[insular cortex]] whose function is linked to emotion. These brain areas work together to keep up with the constant process of collecting neural patterns to map the current status of the body’s responses to environmental changes.  The Protoself does not require language in order to function, moreover it is a direct report of one’s experience.

In this state, emotion begins to manifest itself as second-order neural patterns located in subcortical areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="bosse" /&gt;  Emotion acts as a neural object, from which a physical reaction can be drawn.  This reaction causes the organism to become aware of the changes that are affecting it.  From this realization, springs Damasio’s notion of “feeling”.  This occurs when the patterns contributing to emotion manifest as mental images, or brain movies.  When the body is modified by these neural objects, the second layer of self emerges.&lt;ref name="bosse" /&gt;  This is known as core consciousness.

==Core consciousness==

Sufficiently more evolved is the second layer of Damasio’s theory, Core Consciousness. This emergent process occurs when  an organism becomes consciously aware of feelings associated with changes occurring to its internal bodily state; it is able to recognize that his thoughts are his own, and that they are formulated in his own perspective.&lt;ref name="bosse" /&gt; It develops a momentary sense of self, as the brain continuously builds representative images, based on communications received from the Protoself.&lt;ref name="bosse" /&gt;  This level of consciousness is not exclusive to human beings and remains consistent and stable throughout the lifetime of the organism&lt;ref name="light"&gt;Damasio, Antonio R. "Stepping into the Light." Introduction. The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The image is a result of mental patterns which are caused by an interaction with internal or external stimulus.  A relationship is established, between the organism and the object it is observing as the brain continuously creates images to represent the organism’s experience of qualia.

Damasio’s definition of emotion is that of an unconscious reaction to any internal or external stimulus which activates neural patterns in the brain.&lt;ref name="bosse" /&gt;  ‘Feeling’ emerges as a still unconscious state which simply senses the changes affecting the Protoself due to the emotional state.  These patterns develop into mental images, which then float into the organism’s awareness. Put simply, consciousness is the feeling of knowing a feeling. When the organism becomes aware of the feeling that its bodily state (Protoself) is being affected by its experiences, or response to emotion, Core Consciousness is born. The brain continues to present nonverbal narrative sequence of images in the mind of the organism, based on its relationship to objects. An object in this context can be anything from a person, to a melody, to a neural image. Core consciousness is concerned only with the present moment, here and now. It does not require language or memory, nor can it reflect on past experiences or project itself into the future.

==Extended consciousness==

When consciousness moves beyond the here and now, Damasio’s  third and final layer emerges as Extended Consciousness.  This level could not exist without its predecessors, and, unlike them, requires a vast use of [[conventional memory]].  Therefore, an injury to a person’s memory center can cause damage to their extended consciousness, without hurting the other layers. The autobiographical self draws on memory of past experiences which involves use of higher thought.&lt;ref name="kasper"&gt;^ Damasio, Antonio, and Kasper Meyer. "Consciousness: An Overview of the Phenomenon and of Its Possible Neural Basis." THE NEUROLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology. N.p.: Academic, n.d. 4-12. Google Books. Web.7 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This autobiographical layer of self is developed gradually over time. Working memory is necessary for an extensive display of items to be recalled and referenced.  Linguistic areas of the brain are activated to enhance the organism's experience, however, contrary to the [[language of thought hypothesis]], language is not necessarily required.

'''[[Doves]]''', usually white in color, are used in a lot of settings as symbols of love, peace or as messengers. Doves appear in the symbolism of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Paganism]], and of both [[military]] and [[pacifist]] groups.

== Judaism==
[[File:Millais - Die Rückkehr der Taube zur Arche Noah.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Everett Millais|J. E. Millais]]: ''[[The Return of the Dove to the Ark]]'' (1851)]]

According to the [[Bible|biblical]] story ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:11), a dove was released by [[Noah]] after the [[Noah's Ark|flood]] in order to find land; it came back carrying a freshly plucked olive leaf (Hebrew: עלה זית ''alay zayit''),{{Bibleref2c|Gen|8:11}} a sign of life after the Flood and of God's bringing Noah, his family and the animals to land. [[Rabbi]]nic literature interpreted the olive leaf as "the young shoots of the Land of Israel"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n312/mode/1up [[Genesis Rabbah]]'', 33:6]&lt;/ref&gt; or the dove's preference for bitter food in God's service, rather than sweet food in the service of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_108.html#PARTb |title=Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 108b |publisher=Halakhah.com |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Eiruvin.pdf |title=Eruvin 18b |format=PDF |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tachash.org/texis/vtx/chverse/+JwwBmeuAz1ecXHxwwxFqrHnDn5o5qFqAgrwpBnGaX8mFqDeR8qxG5neWykDXWWeuxww/search2.html#hit1 |title=Rashi |publisher=Tachash.org |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Talmud]] compares [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|the spirit of God]]  to a dove that hovers over the face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf |title=Talmud, Tractate Moed, Hagiga 15a |format=PDF |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&amp;letter=H&amp;search=Holy%20Spirit#2294 |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://simply-franciscan.com/wklygospel/Gospel01-10-10.pdf Franciscan Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-biblical Judaism, souls are envisioned as bird-like ([[Bahir]] 119), a concept that may be derived from the Biblical notion that dead spirits "chirp" (Isa. 29:4). The [[Guf]], or Treasury of Souls, is sometimes described as a [[columbarium]], a dove cote. This connects it to a related legend: the "Palace of the Bird's Nest", the dwelling place of the Messiah's soul until his advent ([[Zohar]] II: 8a–9a). The [[Vilna Gaon]] explicitly declares that a dove is a symbol of the human soul (Commentary to Jonah, 1). The dove is also a symbol of the people Israel (Song of Songs Rabbah 2:14), an image frequently repeated in [[Midrash]].

==Christianity== 
[[File:Rom, Domitilla-Katakomben, Steintafel mit Taube und Ölzweig.jpg|thumb|left|Dove with an olive branch, [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of Domitilla|Catacombs of Domitilla]], [[Rome]]]]

The symbolism of the dove in Christianity is first found in the Old Testament Book of Genesis in the story of Noah’s Ark, “And the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.” {{Bibleverse|Genesis|8:11|KJV}} And, also, in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and Luke, both passages describe after the baptism of Jesus, respectively, as follows, “And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.” {{Bibleverse|Matthew|3:16|KJV}} and, “And the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” {{Bibleverse|Luke|3:22|KJV}}

The use of a dove and olive branch as a symbol of peace originated with the early Christians, who portrayed the act of [[Baptism in early Christianity|baptism]] accompanied by a dove holding an olive branch in its beak and also used the image on their [[sepulchre]]s.&lt;ref name=elmes&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iSWGTy2WeVsC&amp;pg=PT472&amp;lpg=PT472&amp;dq=pacifer+%2Bolive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=knWZF7ELCR&amp;sig=RgPVlfMRdnTqGbt_FIzGlUwgSJw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tE6kTLfWNZG7jAeb6ZCoDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=olive%20branch&amp;f=false James Elmes, ''A General and Bibliographical Dictionary of the Fine Arts'', London: [[Thomas Tegg]], 1826]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03417b.htm |title='&amp;#39;Catholic Encyclopedia'&amp;#39;, Roman Catacombs: Paintings |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 November 1908 |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Christians derived the symbol of the dove and olive branch from Greek thought, including its use of the symbol of the olive branch,&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, "The Interaction of Jews with Non-Jews in Rome", in Karl P. Donfreid and Peter Richardson, ''Judaism and Christianity in Early Rome'', Grand Rapids: Wm B. Ferdman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the story of [[Noah]] and the Flood. Although Jews never used the dove as a symbol of peace,  it acquired that meaning among early Christians, confirmed by St [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his book ''On Christian Doctrine'' and became well established.&lt;ref name=augustine&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=51dMXa3SmlgC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22augustine+of+hippo%22+%2B%22olive+branch%22#v=onepage&amp;q=olive%20branch&amp;f=false |title=Augustine of Hippo, '&amp;#39;On Christian Doctrine'&amp;#39; |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=21 February 2012|isbn=9781593774943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian [[Iconography]], a dove also symbolizes the [[Holy Spirit]], in reference to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 3:16 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 3:22 where the Holy Spirit is compared to a dove at the [[Baptism of Jesus]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt|3:16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05144b.htm |title='&amp;#39;Catholic Encyclopedia'&amp;#39;, Dove: As an artistic symbol |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 May 1909 |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christians in Rome incorporated into their funerary art the image of a dove carrying an olive branch, often accompanied by the word "Peace". It seems that they derived this image from the simile in the Gospels, combining it with the symbol of the olive branch, which had been used to represent peace by the Greeks and Romans. The dove and olive branch also appeared in Christian images of Noah's ark. The fourth century [[Vulgate]] translated the Hebrew ''alay zayit'' (leaf of olive) in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:11 as Latin ''ramum olivae'' (branch of olive).  By the fifth century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote in ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'' that "perpetual peace is indicated by the olive branch (''oleae ramusculo'') which the dove brought with it when it returned to the ark".

[[File:Baptism-christ.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Baptism of Christ'', by [[Piero della Francesca|Francesca]], 1449]]

In the earliest Christian art, the dove represented the peace of the soul rather than civil peace, but from the third century it began to appear in depictions of conflict in the Old Testament, such as Noah and the Ark, and in the [[Apocrypha]], such as [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and the lions, the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|three young men in the furnace]], and [[Susannah and the Elders]].&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;Graydon D.

Before the [[Peace of Constantine]] (313 AD), in which Rome ceased its persecution of Christians following Constantine's conversion, Noah was normally shown in an [[Orans|attitude of prayer]], a dove with an olive branch flying toward him or alighting on his outstretched hand. According to Graydon Snyder, "The Noah story afforded the early Christian community an opportunity to express piety and peace in a vessel that withstood the threatening environment" of Roman persecution.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; According to Ludwig Budde and Pierre Prigent, the dove referred to the descending of the Holy Spirit rather than the peace associated with Noah. After the Peace of Constantine, when persecution ceased, Noah appeared less frequently in Christian art.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt;

Medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s, such as the [[Holkham]] Bible, showed the dove returning to Noah with a branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/holkham_lg.html |title=British Library, '&amp;#39;The Holkham Bible'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bl.uk |date=30 November 2003 |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wycliffe's Bible]], which translated the Vulgate into English in the 14th century, uses "a braunche of olyue tre with greene leeuys" ("a branch of olive tree with green leaves") in Gen. 8:11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studylight.org/desk/?l=en&amp;query=Genesis+1&amp;section=2&amp;translation=wyc&amp;oq=ge%25201&amp;new=1&amp;nb=ge&amp;ngt=Go+To%3A&amp;ng=8&amp;ncc=1 |title=Wycliffe Bible, Gen 8:11 |publisher=Studylight.org |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, some Jewish illuminated manuscripts also showed Noah's dove with an olive branch, for example, the Golden [[Haggadah]] (about 1420).&lt;ref&gt;Narkiss, Bezalel, ''The Golden Haggadah'', London: The British Library, 1997, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/ttpbooks.html British Library, Online Gallery, Sacred Texts.] ''The Golden Haggadah'', p.3, lower left hand panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace and pacifism in politics==
[[File:Kruft St. Dionysius und Sebastian 2212.JPG|thumb|upright|White dove with olive branch, stained glass window in the [[Denis]] and [[Saint Sebastian]] church in [[Kruft]], Germany]]

Doves are often associated with the concept of peace and [[pacifism]]. They often appear in [[political cartoon]]s, on banners and signs at events promoting peace (such as the Olympic Games, at various anti-war/anti-violence protests, etc.), and in pacifist literature. A person who is a pacifist is sometimes referred to as a dove (similarly, in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]], a person who advocates the use of military resources as opposed to diplomacy can be referred to as a [[war hawk|hawk]]). [[Picasso]]'s lithograph, ''La Colombe'' (The Dove), a traditional, realistic picture of a pigeon, without an olive branch, was chosen as the emblem for the [[World Peace Council]] in Paris in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3ATA%3AE%3Aex4693&amp;page_number=96&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=Museum of Modern Art |publisher=Moma.org |date=1949-01-09 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dove became a symbol for the peace movement and the ideals of the [[Communist Party]] and was used in Communist demonstrations of the period. At the 1950 World Peace Congress in [[Sheffield]], Picasso said that his father had taught him to paint doves, concluding, "I stand for life against death; I stand for peace against war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=20858&amp;searchid=17036 |title=Tate Gallery |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone/modernmasters/virtual-exhibition/picasso/13-dove.shtml |title=BBC Modern Masters |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 1952 World Peace Congress in Berlin, Picasso's ''Dove'' was depicted in a banner above the stage.

The rock dove is, due to its relation to the [[homing pigeon]] and thus communications, the main image in the crest of the [[Tactical Communications Wing]], a body within the [[Royal Air Force]]. Below the crest is the wing's [[motto]], "Ubique Loquimur" or "We Speak Everywhere".

[[File:Flag of Bhutan.svg|right|thumb|The [[Flag of Bhutan]] features Druk]]
{{Contains Tibetan text}}
The '''Druk''' ({{lang-bo|འབྲུག}}, {{lang-dz|{{bo-textonly|འབྲུག}}་}}) is the "Thunder [[Dragon]]" of [[Tibetan mythology|Tibetan]] and [[Culture of Bhutan|Bhutanese mythology]] and a [[National symbols of Bhutan|Bhutanese national symbol]]. A druk appears on the [[flag of Bhutan]], holding jewels to represent wealth. In [[Dzongkha]], Bhutan is called ''Druk Yul'' "Land of Druk", and Bhutanese leaders are called [[Druk Gyalpo]], "Thunder Dragon Kings". During the [[Bhutanese National Assembly election, 2008#Mock_elections |Bhutanese mock election in 2007]], all four mock parties were called the ''Druk [colour] Party''.&lt;ref&gt;Every party had a separate colour representing its values.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[national anthem]] of Bhutan, [[Druk tsendhen]], translates into English as "Kingdom of Druk".

The druk (also known as a "duk" or "dug") was adopted as an emblem by the [[Drukpa Lineage]], which originated in [[Tibet]] and spread to Bhutan.  According to traditional accounts, when the sect's founder, [[Tsangpa Gyare]], 1st [[Gyalwang Drukpa]], began to build [[Ralung Monastery]], there was a violent storm.  Thunder, or the "Cloud-Voice," is seen as the roar of the dragon.&lt;ref name="Waddell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=Laurence |title=The Buddhism of Tibet Or Lamaism |year=1895 |pages=199 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PYwcfE_bLUC&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhutan%20thunder%20dug&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deciding that this was an omen, he named the monastery Drug-Ralung, adding the word "thunder dragon" to the name.

[[File:GBolland.jpg|thumb|Bolland]]
[[File:Leiden132.JPG|thumb|Büst of Bolland by Albert Termote&lt;br&gt;(Leiden University)]]
'''Gerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland''' (9 June 1854, [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] – 11 February 1922, [[Leiden]]), also known as '''G.J.P.J. Bolland''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] (self-taught man), linguist, philosopher, biblical scholar, and lecturer.  An excellent orator, he gave extremely well attended public lectures in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Delft, Groningen, Nijmegen and Belgium.

He became an expert in [[German idealism]], being especially interested in the works of [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Eduard von Hartmann]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].  He began researching the [[Early Christianity|formation of Christianity]] in 1891, and was extremely literate in religious history.  He was associated with the [[Radical Criticism|Dutch radical school]].

He effected a revival in [[Hegelianism]] in the Netherlands around 1900 by arranging a new edition of Hegel’s works, and stimulating a renewal of interest in philosophy in the Netherlands. He had a quirky style in his use of the Dutch language causing linguist [[Johan Andreas Dèr Mouw|J.A. Dèr Mouw]], among others, to criticise him sharply.

==Life==
Bolland was born into a simple Catholic family in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. He reached the position of professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] in 1896 after a career as a teacher in [[Katwijk aan Zee]] and as a teacher of English and German in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (Dutch East-Indies).

He published "Hegel: An Historical Investigation" ("''Hegel.  Eene Historische Studie''") in 1898, and a year later he started publishing Hegel’s most important works.  In 1904 he published "Pure Reason.  A book for the Friends of Wisdom" ("''Zuivere Rede.  Een boek voor vrienden der wijsheid''").

Bolland had a "charismatic and eccentric personality, (was) harshly critical to various social groups and institutions, thus making lots of decided enemies, but also adorers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egodeath.com/DeteringSummaryOfBolland.htm Klaus Schilling's translation and summary of Hermann Detering's overview of Gerardus Bolland]&lt;/ref&gt;". An antidemocratic conservative, he harboured a virulent hatred of [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and the working class. His statue was removed from the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] in 2003 because of a complaint by MP [[Ronald van Raak|Van Raak]] about Bolland's [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1774615/2003/09/03/Wijsgeer-Bolland-weg.dhtml "Wijsgeer Bolland weg"]. Trouw (September 3rd 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Bolland described himself as “mystic and a “desperate sceptical agnostic”.  Although critical of Christianity and [[clericalism]] he was a religious man.  After his death, Hegelians of the right formed the Bolland Association (''Bolland Genootschap'').

:"The unique position of Bolland in Dutch intellectual history was a paradox in that it was a climax and a fiasco at one and the same time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siebethissen.net/Wijsbegeerte_in_Nederland/1994_Dutch_Hegelianism_(english).htm  Harco Rutgers, "Dutch Hegelianism: The Cement Of Social Life", Section 3: Bolland: the 'self made philosopher', Rotterdam, 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929191816/http://www.siebethissen.net/Wijsbegeerte_in_Nederland/1994_Dutch_Hegelianism_(english).htm |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolland’s theory of early Christianity==

Bolland was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;McCown, Chester Charlton. (1940). ''The Search for the Real Jesus: A Century of Historical Study''. Scribner. p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He continued [[Bruno Bauer]]'s "concepts about [[Philo]], the Caesars, and their influence&lt;ref name="Drews"&gt;[http://www.egodeath.com/drewshistorymythiconlyjesus.htm#_Toc51777080 Arthur Drews, Dutch Radicalism section of "The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present", Karlsruhe, 1926]&lt;/ref&gt;" on the development of Christianity.  He believed that the basis for Christianity developed among strongly [[syncretism|syncretised]], [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] [[Jew]]s in [[Alexandria]] and Judeophile Greeks in the early [[Common Era]].  These early beliefs revolved around a mythical [[Chrestos]] figure, and were not connected to a nationalistic [[Messiah]] figure.  Among the influences in these circles were [[Gnosticism]] and [[Hermeticism]].  [[Philo]]’s writings were also a step in this development, especially the concept of the [[Logos]].

He believed the development of Christianity took place during the first century in the decades after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Second Temple’s fall]] when the mythic Chrestos figure became transformed into the legendary [[Jesus]].  Bolland states that the transformed Chrestos received the name of [[Moses]]’ successor, [[Joshua]] the son of [[Nun (Bible)|Nun]], who became "leader of the people of Israel, as Moses failed to complete the task to guide the people into the promised land".&lt;ref name="Drews"/&gt;

According to Bolland, the [[Gospel of Matthew]] is the oldest, followed by [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]’s and then [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]’s.

'''Hwang Jini''' or '''Hwang Jin-Yi''' ({{ko-hhrm|황진이}}; c. 1506 – c. 1560), also known by her [[gisaeng]] name Myeongwol ("bright moon", 명월), was one of the most famous [[gisaeng]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. She lived during the reign of [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]]. She was noted for her exceptional beauty, charming quick wit, extraordinary intellect, and her assertive and independent nature.&lt;ref name="osváth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konfuciuszintezet.hu/letoltesek/tkt/tkt_2009-1/pdf/06-Osvath_06-07.pdf|title=Hvang Dzsini sidzso versei (eredeti szövegek, nyers- és műfordítások)|author=Osváth Gábor|accessdate=2012-11-14|format=pdf|publisher=Konfuciusz Intézet|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spirit of Korean Cultural Roots 9 : Poetic World of Classic Korean Women Writers|url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=K17mLqrKA40C|pages=13-18|isbn=8973006029|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|year=2005|last1=Lee |first1=Hai-soon|first2= Hye-Sun|last2= Yi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_koreanstory_detail.htm??lang=e&amp;current_page=9&amp;No=22744|title=Best Female Poet in Korean Literature, Hwang Jini|publisher=[[KBS World]]|date=2010-12-24|accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has become an almost myth-like figure in modern [[Korea]], inspiring novels, operas, films, and television series.

==Works==
Only a handful of [[sijo]] (Korean [[verse form]]) and [[geomungo]] pieces exist today. They show skilled craftsmanship of words and of musical arrangement. Hwang's sijo often describe the beauty and sites of [[Gaeseong]] (such as the palace of [[Manwoldae]] and the Pakyon Falls in the [[Ahobiryong Mountains]]), the personal tragedy of her lost loves and responses to famous classic Chinese poems and literature (the majority of them reflecting on lost love).

Hwang appears to have been of noble birth. Her [[sijo]] are considered the most beautiful ever written. In the following poem, the term Hwang uses for her beloved (어론님) has two meanings, alluding to both her sweetheart and a person who has been frozen by the winter cold. The English phrase “frozen love” may help to illustrate this [[double entendre]] in translation.
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|ko|冬至 섯달 기나긴 밤을 한 허리를 잘라 내어
春風 이불 아래 서리서리 넣었다가
어론님 오신 날 밤이여든 구뷔구뷔 펴리라.}}
|
I will divide this long November night
  and coil by coil
  lay it under a warm spring blanket
  and roll by roll
when my frozen love returns
  I will unfold it to the night.&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Race" Bannon|David Bannon]], [https://sites.google.com/site/atakoreanlanguagedivision/kld-newsletter/Hangul%20Herald%20Fall%202008.pdf?attredirects=0 “Sijo Poetry of Korean Kisaeng,”]  ''Hangul Herald'', Fall 2008: 10-13. Excerpted and used with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this next poem, “Full Moon” is a play on Hwang’s pen name, Myeongwol (literally, “Bright Moon”; 명월 ). The poem was written to a man famed
for his virtue, Byok Kye Su, whom Hwang infamously seduced. “Green water” is a pun on Byok’s name (벽계수 碧溪水).
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|

Green water, do not boast
  of your rapid flow from the blue mountains.
  It is hard to return
  when you’ve reached the blue sea.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
In the late 20th century, Hwang Jini's story began to attract attention from both sides of the Korean divide and feature in a variety of novels, operas, films and television series. Novelizations of her life include a 2002 treatment by North Korean writer [[Hong Sok-jung]] (which became the first North Korean novel to win a literary award, the [[Manhae Prize]], in the South) and a 2004 bestseller by South Korean writer [[Jeon Gyeong-rin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,655483,00.html|title=A Literary Thaw in Korea|date=2004-06-21|publisher=Time|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imre George Vallyon''' (born 7 December 1940) is a [[New Zealand]] writer in the body, mind and spirit field.
 
Vallyon is the founder of the ''Foundation for Higher Learning'', an international spiritual school formed to help provide people with the opportunity to practise spiritual work within a group environment, with schools in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Hungary]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallyon|first1=Imre|title=Country Events - The FHL Org|url=http://www.thefhl.org/events/|website=The FHL Org|publisher=The FHL Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the director of Sounding-Light Publishing, which was founded in 2006.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Publishing|first1=Sounding-Light|title=Imre Vallyon - Sounding-Light Publishing|url=https://www.soundinglight.com/imre-vallyon/|website=Sounding-Light Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vallyon retired in late 2017.&lt;ref name="Imre Vallyon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallyon|first1=Imre|title=Imre Vallyon|url=http://www.imrevallyon.co.nz/|website=Imre Vallyon|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Early life==
Vallyon was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary, and was raised by his parents among extreme poverty and suffering.&lt;ref name="YTbg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallyon|first1=Imre|title=Red Rose|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ5AT5oGP4A|website=YouTube|publisher=Sounding Light|accessdate=7 June 2017|date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Europe was just recovering from World War II, and he was surrounded by that devastation.
 
Vallyon had his first mystical experience at the age of three. It was very dark outside, and he describes the memory as suddenly going "out of my body and into a very profound state of cosmic realization...the whole universe was vibrating like a heavenly choir."&lt;ref name="YTbg"/&gt;
 
In the midst of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Vallyon made the dangerous choice to leave the country; crossing the border at the time usually meant imprisonment or death. At the age of sixteen, he emigrated to New Zealand as a refugee.&lt;ref name="YTbg"/&gt; 
 
==Career==
After immersing himself in several spiritual movements, Vallyon founded the Foundation for Higher Learning, where he teaches the Spiritual Principles and the Divine Laws of Life to Humanity. His methods stem from different forms of eastern and western spirituality. His teaching is universal, not biased towards any particular religion or tradition, yet embraces all traditions and points beyond them all to the One Truth, One Life, One Reality.&lt;ref name="FHL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higher Learning|first1=The Foundation for|title=Imre Vallyon - The Founder - The FHL Org|url=http://www.thefhl.org/founder/|website=The FHL Org|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Mill''' (born '''James Milne''',&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james-mill/#Bio |title=James Mill |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University |date=19 June 2014|first=Terence |last=Ball|accessdate=4 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 April 1773 – 23 June 1836{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}) was a Scottish [[historian]], [[economist]], [[political theorist]], and [[philosopher]]. He is counted among the founders of the [[Ricardian economics|Ricardian school]] of economics.&lt;ref name="keynes11"&gt;{{cite book | title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money | first=John Maynard |last=Keynes|authorlink=John Maynard Keynes |chapter=The General Theory | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch01.htm|accessdate=4 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[John Stuart Mill]], was also a noted philosopher of [[liberalism]], [[utilitarianism]] and the civilizing mission of the [[British Empire]].

Although he never set foot in India at any time in his life, James Mill took upon himself the task of writing the monumental ''[[The History of British India|History of British India]]'', a classic of colonial self-congratulation which contains a complete denunciation and rejection of Indian culture and civilisation and which both exhorts and extolls the civilizing mission of the British in the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies, but which is seen in recent decades as being deeply problematic.

==Biography==
James Milne, later known as James Mill, was born at Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, [[Angus, Scotland]], the son of James Milne, a [[shoemaker]] and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the [[Jacobite risings|Stuart rising]]{{which|date=January 2018}}, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the [[Montrose Academy]], where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}

In October 1789, he was ordained as a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], but met with little success. According to John Stuart Mill's ''Autobiography'', his father though "educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/mill/auto/auto.c02.html&lt;/ref&gt; From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, England, in company with [[Sir John Stuart, 4th Baronet|Sir John Stuart]] of [[Fettercairn]], then member of parliament for [[Kincardineshire]], and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the ''Literary Journal'', which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the ''St James's Chronicle'', belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of ''An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther'', a [[Charles de Villers|C.F. Villers]]'s work  on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year he began his ''[[The History of British India]]'', which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}

In that year he also married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in [[Hoxton]]. He then took a house in [[Pentonville]], where his eldest son, [[John Stuart Mill]], was born in 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}

[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of No. 19, York Street (1848). In 1651 [[John Milton]] moved into a "pretty garden-house" in [[Petty France, London|Petty France]]. He lived there until the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to [[Jeremy Bentham]], was occupied successively by James Mill and [[William Hazlitt]], and finally demolished in 1877.{{sfn|Stephen|1894|p=32}}]]
In 1808, he became acquainted with [[Jeremy Bentham]], and was for many years his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'', the ''British Review'' and ''[[The Eclectic Review]]''; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the [[Edinburgh Review]], to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being "Money and Exchange." He also wrote on Spanish America, China, [[Francisco de Miranda]], the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and the Liberty of the Press. In the ''Annual Review'' for 1808 two articles of his are traced—a "Review of Fox's History", and an article on "Bentham's Law Reforms", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] (1770–1843), a [[Quaker]] and [[chemist]], in a periodical called the ''Philanthropist''. He contributed largely to every issue – his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's [[Panopticon]]). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the [[Monitorial System|Bell and Lancaster]] controversy, and took a  part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the [[University of London]] in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of [[utilitarianism]], for the supplement to the fifth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the most important being those on "Jurisprudence", "Prisons", "Government"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} and "Law of Nations".

In 1818, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published, and obtained a great and immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1817 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= The History of British India |volume= |edition=1 |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1817 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish1817mill#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought about a change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in ranks until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work, the ''Elements of Political Economy'', appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1821 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Elements of Political Economy |volume= |edition=First |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1821 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementsofpoliti00millrich#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed to the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', started as the organ of his party, a number of articles in which he attacked the ''[[Edinburgh Review|Edinburgh]]'' and ''[[Quarterly Review|Quarterly]]'' Reviews and ecclesiastical establishments. In 1829 appeared the ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind''. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of directors. For the ''[[Westminster Review#London and Westminster Review|London Review]]'', founded by [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]] in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled "The Church and its Reform", which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the ''Review''. Mill, himself was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/library/james-mill-laissez-faires-lenin&lt;/ref&gt; His last published book was the ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' (1835).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}

==Intellectual legacy==

===''The History of British India''===
{{Main|The History of British India}}

Mill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the [[Empiricism|empirical]] one common at the time. His best known literary work is his ''History of British India'', in which he describes the acquisition of the [[British India|Indian Empire]] by England and later the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's ''History of India'' by notable economist [[Amartya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Amartya Sen]]'s address given to the Millennium Session of the Indian History Congress [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/458/history-and-the-enterprise-of-knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Trautmann]], "James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) – most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters&amp;nbsp;– is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aryans and British India |pages=117 |first=Thomas R. |last=Trautmann |location=New Delhi |publisher=YODA Press |edition=2nd Indian |year=2006 |origyear=1997 |isbn=81-902272-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR_LPnEH3GsC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter titled General Reflections in "Of the Hindus", Mill wrote "under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of British India |first= James |last=Mill |publisher = Madden |year=1858 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfxAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, "the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and "in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were "dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were "disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves". Both were "cowardly and unfeeling". Both were "in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others". And, above all, both were "in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses".&lt;ref&gt;Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British politics===
Mill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called "[[Philosophical Radicals|philosophic radicalism]]". His writings on government and his personal influence among the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians of his time determined the change of view from the [[French Revolution]] theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the [[Reform Bill]] was fought and won. His ''Elements of Political Economy'' followed up the views of his friend [[David Ricardo]]. By 1911, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] described it as being of mainly historical interest, "an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Among the more important of its theses are:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}
# that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. § 2, art. 3)
# that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and
# that what is now known as the "[[unearned increment]]" of land is a proper object for taxation.

===Other areas===
By his ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' and his ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as then represented by [[Thomas Reid]], [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], but made a new start, due in part to [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the ''Analysis'' is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines.

'''Jean-Michel Oughourlian''' (born 20 August 1940) is a French [[neuropsychiatrist]] and [[psychologist]] as well as a writer and [[philosopher]] recognized both in France and the United States for his collaboration with [[René Girard]] and his work on the mimetic theory of desire. Since the early 1970s he has devoted both his clinical work and his research to applying and developing Girard's theories in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and psychopathology. He is the author of several books (see [[#Bibliography|below]]), in which he developed clinical points of view around mimetic theory of desire.

He is currently the President of the Association of Doctors of the American Hospital of Paris, as well as an honorary member of the Association Recherches Mimétiques, whose goal is to structure research linked to René Girard's mimetic theory and to make the theory more widely known in French-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Oughourlian, membre d’honneur de l’Association Recherches Mimétiques [http://www.arm.asso.fr/57_p_18948/membres-d-honneurs.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Oughourlian is Ambassador of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] to the Republic of [[Armenia]]. He is involved in the fight against poverty, exclusion, and sickness through the defense of the physical, psychological, and spiritual integrity of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;S.E.

== Life and career ==
Jean-Michel Oughourlian was born on 20 August 1940 in Beirut, Lebanon, to an Armenian father who fled the 1915-1922 genocide and a Colombian mother. He arrived in France at the age of ten.

His university studies covered multiple disciplines:
* Doctor of Medicine in June 1966
* Doctorate in Psychology from the University Paris-Descartes in June 1973.
* Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy from the Sorbonne in June 1975
* Doctorate in Letters and Human Sciences in April 1981
* University Professor in March 1993

Jean-Michel Oughourlian's teaching activities include:
* Psychology, Assistant in the Laboratory of Pathological Psychology at the Sorbonne from 1970 to 1974, then Head Assistant between 1975 and 1985, then Lecturer in Clinical Psychopathology at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Paris V between 1985 and 1993.
* Psychiatry, Certified Lecturer on Psychiatry, Hospital Psychiatrist in December 1972, Honorary Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the International College of Medicine and Surgery, which includes the American Hospital of Paris, Columbia University and Cornell University, since 1998.
* Psychopolitics, Adjunct Professor of Political Science at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1975 to 1977 and Professor at Stanford in collaboration with René Girard since 1981.

His clinical career unfolded over the following stages:
* Intern at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1966 to 1967
* Resident Doctor of the Psychiatric Hospitals of Paris from 1968 to 1970.
* Specialist of Electroencephalography in the Service of Functional Explorations of the Nervous System at the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]] from 1970 to 1990. 
* Attaché of the Hospitals of Paris from 1971 to 1975
* Psychiatrist in the Service of General Surgery of the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]] from 1972 to 1992.
* Head of Psychiatry at the American Hospital of Paris from 1981 to 2007.
* Neuro-psychiatrist of the American Hospital of Paris since 1974.

His work as a writer and [[philosopher]] includes:

* His first book, "La personne du toxicomane", published in 1974, was one of the first books published in France on drug addiction. He adopted the anthropology of mimetic desire developed by René Girard and used it to enrich his own work in psychiatry. In 1978 he co-authored Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World with René Girard. 
* In 1982, he wrote "Un mime nommé désir" (The Puppet of Desire), a book on the phenomena of trances, hysteria, and possession that broke with the Freudian currents of the time and created a new psychology based on mimetic desire as the motor of relationships and the foundation of the self. 
* From 2000 to 2006, he was particularly involved in studying manic-depression and bi-polarity and in encouraging people with these illnesses to seek treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Mars 2006. Interview de Jean-Michel Oughourlian dans Paris Match : Maniaco-depressifs. Osez vous faire traiter ![http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Sante/Actu/Maniaco-depressifs.-Osez-vous-faire-traiter-!-70359]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, he published "Genèse du désir" (The Genesis of Desire), which relates the psychotheraputic methods employed by the author for helping couples during his three decades at the American Hospital of Paris as head of psychiatry. 
* In 2010, he published "Psychopolitique", which analyzes current affairs from the perspective of Girardian theory and suggests a way out of the postmodern crisis by sketching the portrait of the leader of tomorrow.

==Oughourlian's thought==
Very early on, Jean-Michel Oughourlian's clinical research led him to become interested in the work of [[Milton Erickson]], Jay Haley, and Ernset Rossi, and the Phoenix Group, as well as in the work of Paul Watzlawick and the Palo Alto School. He then became interested in the anthropology of mimetic desire developed by [[René Girard]] and used it to enrich his own work in psychiatry. 
In all of these disciplines he has sought to track down the motivations of human behavior and the mechanisms of which men and women are unwittingly the plaything. His contribution to psychological and psychiatric theory consists in questioning the Freudian primacy of the unconscious and affirming that "the unconscious is the other", that is to say, the concrete other person, whose desire serves as a model for our desires, making us into conscious apprentices or blinded marionettes.

In ''The Puppet of Desire'', he explains the story of the Loudon possessions, which he deciphers with the help of the mimetic theory, showing that at bottom it is the mother superior of the convent, infatuated with a young prelate, who draws the other sisters along with her by transmitting her Madame Bovary-like desire to them, plunging all of them into a generalized hysteria. Neuroses and even psychoses are interpreted as being so many strategies of the self for hiding the truth about the reality of desire, whose fundamental alterity people refuse to recognize.

"The  clinical manifestation of mimetic desire is rivalry", says Oughourlian. Insofar as imitation is, of all human weaknesses, the one that people have the most trouble admitting, it never presents itself as such. The patient accuses his model of wanting to steal his job, wife, or identity, betraying against the grain the surreptitious alterity that moves through him. Pulling oneself out of the rivalrous impasse implies becoming fully conscious of one's proper dependency and admitting one's debt toward the other's desire. This is a difficult undertaking, which requires on the psychotherapist's part an acute understanding of psychology and psychopolitics and on the patient's part the gradual overcoming of his pride.&lt;ref&gt;Novembre 2007. Interview de Jean-Michel Oughourlian par Patrice van Eersel pour le Club du Livre Essentiel [http://www.nouvellescles.com/Dossiers-thematiques/Autres-regards/votre-cerveau-n-a-pas-fini-de-vous/article/vos-neurones-sont-des-miroirs-c]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avril 2008. Interview de Jean-Michel Oughourlian sur France Culture par Jacques Munier pour l'émission "A plus d'un titre"[http://www.franceculture.com/emission-première-partie-littérature-deuxième-partie-essais-avec-jean-michel-oughourlian-2008-04-21.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciated in the United States by psychologists and psychiatrists of the ¨relational¨ school, Jean-Michel Oughourlian has participated actively since it was founded in the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COVR), an association of researchers who are interested in René Girard's mimetic theory of founding [[violence]] and the [[scapegoat]] mechanism. He also has ties with the Association Recherches Mimétiques (ARM), for which he has led seminars. He participated in a work group organized by Dr. Scott Garrels of the Fuller School of Psychology (Pasadena, California) on [[imitation]] and the most recent discoveries in developmental psychology and neuroscience ([[mirror neurons]]). The group, which included Vittorio Gallese and Andre Meltzoff, met at Stanford University and in Paris at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) Paris rue d´Ulm.&lt;ref&gt;Mars 2010.

'''''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice''''' (1982; second edition 1998) is a book about political philosophy by [[Michael J. Sandel|Michael Sandel]].{{sfn|Sandel|1998|p=iv}} The work helped start the liberalism-communitarianism debate that dominated Anglo-American political philosophy in the 1980s.

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based primarily on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Sandel criticizes the social democratic liberals [[John Rawls]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]], arguing that their views rest on anti-liberal collectivist foundations and are incompatible with the elements of liberal individualism they espouse. He offers a communitarian critique of liberalism, arguing that individuals are constituted by their communities and the obligations that follow from being part of them.{{sfn|Boaz|1998|pp=449-450}} Sandel discusses and criticizes Rawls' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), examining Rawls' claim for the primacy of justice.{{sfn|Sandel|1998|p=15}} Partly inspired by [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' (1974), Sandel argues that Rawls bases his political philosophy on an untenable metaphysics of the self.{{sfn|Wolff|1991|pp=121}} In his view, Rawls' philosophy shares the metaphysical assumptions of [[Kantian ethics]], in which a purely noumenal self that is detached from all empirical constraints somehow retains motives that enable it to make choices.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pp=321, 411}}

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Will Kymlicka]] wrote that ''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice'' is Sandel's best-known book, and helped start the [[liberalism]]-[[communitarianism]] debate that dominated Anglo-American political philosophy in the 1980s.{{sfn|Kymlicka|1995|pp=788}} The philosopher [[Jonathan Wolff (philosopher)|Jonathan Wolff]] wrote that Sandel provides the fullest development of the argument, which other writers have also made, that Rawls bases his political philosophy on an untenable metaphysics of the self.{{sfn|Wolff|1991|pp=121}}

'''Mandeville's paradox''' is named after [[Bernard Mandeville]], who posits that actions which may be qualified as vicious with regard to individuals have benefits for society as a whole. This is alluded to in the subtitle of his most famous work, ''[[The Fable of The Bees]]'': ‘Private Vices, Public Benefits’. He states that "Fraud, Luxury, and Pride must live; Whilst we the Benefits receive.") (The Fable of the Bees, ‘The Moral’).

The [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] opposes this (although he defends a moderated version of this line of thought in his theory of the [[invisible hand]]), since Mandeville fails, in his opinion, to distinguish between vice and virtue (''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'', Part VII, Section II, Chapter 4 (‘Of licentious systems’)).

'''Manuel Polo y Peyrolón''' (1846 – 1918) was a Spanish [[novelist]], [[philosopher]], [[academic]] and a [[Carlist]] [[politician]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Vega del Tajo.JPG|thumbnail|left|Alto [[Maestrazgo]]]]
Manuel Polo y Peyrolón was born in Cañete, a village on the Western slopes of [[Montes Universales]], a southern ridge of [[Sistema Ibérico]]. Located in the Castillan [[Province of Cuenca]], the area bordered the regions of [[Aragón]] and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and formed part of what was once known as Alto [[Maestrazgo]]. He was descendant to a petty [[bourgeoisie]] family. His father, [[Domingo Polo]],&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Sanz Ponce, ''La Sierra de Albarracín y Polo y Peyroloñ: historia de una relación ascética'', [in:] ''Rehalda'' 13 (2010), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; originated from the Aragonese city of [[Belchite]]; during the [[First Carlist War]] he sided with the legitimists and served as a secretary of general [[José María Arévalo y Requeno]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Carlist defeat he had to abandon his job and settled in Cañete, practicing as a lawyer;&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of his life Domingo entered an uspecified religious order and became a friar.&lt;ref&gt;B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], ''Políticos del carlismo'', Barcelona 1912, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel's mother, María Peyrolón, was also Aragonese from [[Calomarde, Aragon|Calomarde]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Following her early death in 1853, Manuel and his younger brother were partially looked after by her sister Concepción.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 19, the aunt became his second mother, Javier Urcelay Alonso, ''Introducción'', [in:] ''Memorias políticas de M. Polo y Peyrolón (1870-1913)'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499405872}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Spending most of his childhood and youth with relatives in [[Gea de Albarracín]],&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; he considered himself a [[Teruel|turolense]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel was brought up in a fervently Catholic ambience,&lt;ref&gt;''Polo y Peyrolón, Manuel (1846 -1918)'' entry at mcnbiografias.com&lt;/ref&gt; politically strongly flavored by Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;his first childhood lectures were Carlist booklets and periodicals, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in filosofia y letras from [[:es:Universidad de Madrid|Universidad Central]] in [[Madrid]] and in derecho civil y canonico from [[University of Valencia|Universidad de Valencia]],&lt;ref&gt;mcnbiografias.com, see also cover of his works, available [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Polo_y_Peyrolon,_Elementos_de_etica,.jpg here]&lt;/ref&gt; guided by [[Miguel Vicente Almazán]]&lt;ref&gt;Carles Sirera Mirrales, ''Neocatolicismo y darwinismo en las aulas: el caso del instituto provincial de Valencia'', [in:]  ''Ayer'' 81 (2011), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; and obtaining later PhD laurels in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Polo y Peyrolon, ''Elementos etica o filosofia moral'', Valencia 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Following a brief and temporary episode as professor auxiliar of metafisica in Valencia in 1868-69,&lt;ref&gt;Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Aragón and successfully applied to Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de [[Teruel]], where he commenced teaching Psicología, Lógica y Ética in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 20, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Polo y Peyrolón has never married and had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novelist==
[[File:Los mayos, Polo y Peyrolon.jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|Los Mayos, 1885]]
Polo's first literary work, ''Realidad poética de mis montañas'', appeared in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;full title ''Realidad poética de mis montañas. Costumbres de la Sierra de Albarracín''&lt;/ref&gt; Except that it was a collection of short stories&lt;ref&gt;''Los Mellizos'', ''El sí de una serrana'', ''La tío Levítico'', ''Lo que puede una mujer'', Jose Manuel Vilar Pacheco, ''Breve noticia de obras literarias y escritores de la Sierra de Albarracín'' available [http://cecalbarracin.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/obras_literar_y_-escritores_sa_jm_villar.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of a [[novel]], it revealed characteristics marking his later works: traditional themes, simple plot and clear educational purpose, with narration set in provincial milieu of [[Sierra de Albarracín]], painted with attention to detail and with focus on local customs typical rather for an ethnographical study.&lt;ref&gt;actually, the volume contained also ''Vocabulario para la inteligencia de los provincialismos, palabras anticuadas, familiares ó poco conocidas y frases oscuras contenidas en estos Cuadros''&lt;/ref&gt; All these features were developed in Polo's first novel, ''Los Mayos'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;full title ''Los Mayos. Costumbres populares de la Sierra de Albarracín''&lt;/ref&gt; a rural love story intended as a praise of loyalty and fidelity&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and considered his best work,&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; translated into Italian and German.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Libros recibidos'' section of ''Revista de Aragon'', 20 (1879), available [http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/31/08/RevistaDeAragon1879-20.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The consecutive ones, ''Sacramento y concubinato'' (1884)&lt;ref&gt;full title ''Sacramento y concubinato. Novela original de costumbres aragonesas''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Quién mal anda, ¿cómo acaba?'' (1890) assumed a more militant tone, aimed against liberal and secular lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pacorro'' (1905)&lt;ref&gt;full title ''Pacorro. Novela de costumbres serranas''&lt;/ref&gt; confronted deeds of a young liberal with virtues of a young Carlist, cast against the background of a small town undergoing the turbulent period of 1868-1876.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The last of Polo's major literary works, ''El guerrillero'' (1906),&lt;ref&gt;full title ''El guerrillero. Novela tejida con retazos de la historia militar carlista''&lt;/ref&gt; revealed more threads of an adventure story; set during [[Third Carlist War]], it was heavily based on wartime recollections of his brother Florentino.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's shorter stories remain scaled down versions of his novels.&lt;ref&gt;like ''Seis novelas cortas'' (1891) or ''Alma y vida serrana, costumbres populares de la Sierra de Albarracín (serie de cuentos)'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his contemporaries Polo was appreciated usually by those sharing similar traditional outlook, like [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]]&lt;ref&gt;Jesus Bregante, ''Diccionario espasa. Literatura española'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|8467012722}} p. 753; relations between Polo and Baztan soured as she later accused him of plagiarism, see mcnbiografias.com&lt;/ref&gt; and his friends [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo|Marcelinó Menéndez y Pelayo]]&lt;ref&gt;Paula Lázaro Izquirerda, ''Lengua patria y dialectos regionales: una convivencia necesaria en el pensamiento de Manuel Polo y Peyrolon'', [in:] ''Rehalda'' 5 (2007), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and [[José María de Pereda]].&lt;ref&gt;see Jose Maria de Pereda, ''Cuarenta cartas ineditas a Manuel Polo y Peyrolon'', Santander 1990, {{ISBN|9788485429875}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conservative literary review ''[[:es:La Ilustración Católica|Ilustración Católica]]''&lt;ref&gt;he started to co-operate with the periodical in 1880, María del Carmen Servén Díez, ''La ilustración católica frente a la novela: 1877-1894'', [in:] ''Revista de literatura'' 127 (2002), p. 231;&lt;/ref&gt; identified him as a brilliant follower of [[Fernán Caballero]],&lt;ref&gt;Ulpiano Lada Ferreras ''La narrativa oral literaria: estudio pragmático'', Oviedo 2003, {{ISBN|3935004362}}, 9783935004367, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; classified his writings as "novela de familia" and hailed his prose as "restauradora de la novela castellana en los tiempos modernos".&lt;ref&gt;Servén Díez 2002, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for authenticity "which does not disfigure reality", his [[Realism (arts)|realism]] was appreciated as an antidote to [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] – the trend he consciously opposed&lt;ref&gt;compare his theoretical study ''El naturalismo ¿ es un signo de progreso ó de decadencia en la literatura?'', published in 1885&lt;/ref&gt; - and "the venom of [[Émile Zola|Zola]]".&lt;ref&gt;Servén Díez 2002, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; By favourably disposed contemporaries he was put next to Fernán Caballero, de Pereda, [[:es:Francisco Navarro Villoslada|Francisco Navarro Villoslada]], [[Julio Alarcón y Meléndez]], [[Juan Valera]] and [[Luis Coloma|padre Coloma]];&lt;ref&gt;Servén Díez 2002, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; critics dubbed him "mamarracho literario".&lt;ref&gt;loosely translatable as "literary clown", an insult cointed by [[Azorín|José Martinez Ruiz]] in the 1890s, quoted after Felipe Pedraza Jimenez, Milagros Rodriguez Caceres, ''Manual de literatura española'', vol. IX, Tafalla 1987, {{ISBN|8485511182}}, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cabecera de la revista La Ilustración Católica.jpg|thumbnail|280px|[[:es:La Ilustración Católica|''La Ilustración Católica'']]]]
Limited popularity of Polo's works hardly outlived their author. Even in the early 20th century he was only marginally mentioned by historians of Spanish literature;&lt;ref&gt;in his massive work ''Historia de la lengua y literatura castellana'', Julio Cejador y Frauca marginally mentions Polo y Peyrolón in volume IX (''Segundo periodo de la epoca realista''), Madrid 1918, but ignores him in volumes X/XI (''Epoca regional y modernista''), Madrid 1919&lt;/ref&gt; later on he went into oblivion,&lt;ref&gt;he is straightforwardly mentioned as a second-rate novelist by Santiago Sebastian, ''Aportación de Polo y Peyrolón a la Etnologia turolense'', [in:] ''Aragon'' 1958, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; though was occasionally acknowledged in anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;excerpts from his ''Historia de un ochavo moruno'' (1884) were placed in Jose Bergua (ed.), ''Las mil mejores paginas de la lengua castellana. Antologia de prosistas'', Madrid 1969, pp. 301-303&lt;/ref&gt; Today he is missing even in fairly detailed studies written either by Spanish&lt;ref&gt;Iris M. Zavala, ''Historia y critica de la literatura espanola'', vol. 5 (''Romanticismo y realismo''), Barcelona 1982, {{ISBN|847423185X}}, Juan Luis Alborg, ''Historia de la literatura española'', vol. 6 (''Realismo y naturalismo. La novela''), Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|8424917936}}&lt;/ref&gt; of foreign scholars,&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Shaw, ''Historia de la literatura española'', vol. 5 (''El siglo XIX''), Barcelona 1972, {{ISBN|8434483564}}&lt;/ref&gt; though mentioned by some dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;compare Ricardo Gullon (ed.), ''Diccionario de Literatura Española y Hispanoamericana'', vol. 2, Madrid 1993, {{ISBN|8420652482}}, p. 1312, or Bregante 2003, p. 753&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually situated in-between [[Romanticism]] and [[Literary realism|Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Mariano Baquero Goyanes, ''El cuento español: del romanticismo al realismo'', Madrid 2012, {{ISBN|9788400072131}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; falling into the [[costumbrismo]] (or "realismo costumbrista") trend,&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; also a good representative of "novelas de tesis".&lt;ref&gt;Bregante 2003, p. 753&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that his conventional, meager plots can hardly support the weight of nagging moralising objectives, especially given repetitive nature of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 22, [[Magdalena Aguinaga Alfonso]], ''El costumbrismo de Pereda: innovaciones y técnicas narrativas'', Oviedo 1996, {{ISBN|3930700816}}, 9783930700813, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his novels are appreciated as inexhaustible sources of pefectly captured anecdotes and customs, few readers admitting even some charm.&lt;ref&gt;''Polo y Perolón, Manuel'' entry on ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa'' online,  available [http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=10315 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from realism,&lt;ref&gt;occasionally Polo's realism also slipped into somewhat cruel naturalism, see Baquero 2012, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; he is credited for introducing new narrative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Baquero 2012, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; He is also among the best-known authors contributing to [[Carlism in literature]] from the legitimist perspective.

==Scholar and philosopher==
[[File:Polo y Peyrolon, Elementos de etica,.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|Polo's textbook, 1882]]
Polo taught Psicología, Lógica y Ética in the Teruel college for 9 years. Harassed for his pro-Carlist sympathies,&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to leave Aragon. Following a successful application and selection process,&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; he assumed the same chair in [[Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza]] in Valencia in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;most sources claim he moved in 1879; Sanz, however, notes (p. 14) that "Polo saca la cátedra del Instituto de Valencia [sic!] y traslada su residencia a la capital del Turia" in 1880&lt;/ref&gt; where he kept teaching until the early 20th century. Member of [[Asociación de Catedráticos Numerarios]],&lt;ref&gt;Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; he was active in a number of Spanish and foreign scholarly institutions.&lt;ref&gt;like [[Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País]], Comision de monumentos historicos y artisticos de la provincia de Valencia, Academia Filosofico-Medica de Santo Tomas de Aquino de Roma, Academia Cientifica de Bruselas, M. Polo y Peyrolon, Elementos de etica o filosofia moral, Valencia 1882&lt;/ref&gt; His career was crowned in 1908, when he joined [[Real Academia de la Historia]].&lt;ref&gt;mcnbiografias.com, see also Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Valencia tenure Polo wrote textbooks for students of philosophy: ''Elementos de psicología'' (1879), ''Elementos de lógica'' (1880), ''Elementos de Ética'' (1880); ''Elementos de Ética o Filosofía Moral'' (1882), ''Elementos de Filosofía Moral'' (1889), ''Lógica elemental'' ( 1902) and ''Ética elemental'' (1902),&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in use also in other scholarly centres across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 11, mcnbiografias.com&lt;/ref&gt; He did not develop any original philosophical contribution himself; apart from works on history and general overviews, Polo is known for confronting some trends forming the liberal educational mindset, especially [[krausism]] and [[Darwinism]]. His stance is classified as neotomismo or neocatolicismo in philosophy&lt;ref&gt;Sirera Mirrales 2011, pp. 251-2; some name him the follower of [[Jaime Balmes]], see Federico Martínez Roda, ''Valencia y las Valencias: su historia contemporánea (1800-1975)'', Valencia 1998, {{ISBN|8486792894}}, 9788486792893, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; and as regeneracionismo político-educativo in pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Polo's repudiation of krausism developed in course of the teaching career and stemmed from his growing interest in pedagogy and education in general.&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; During last decades of the 19th century krausism became a philosophical powerhouse of liberal Spanish politics, represented mostly by [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos|Francisco Giner del Rios]] and [[Instituto Libre de Enseñanza]].&lt;ref&gt;also by [[Francisco Pi y Margall]], [[Emilio Castelar]], [[:es:Manuel Pedregal y Canedo|Manuel Pedregal y Canedo]], [[Rafael Altamira y Crevea|Rafael Altamira]], Paweł Skibiński, ''Historia a siwadomosc nardowa. Próba analizy historiografii hiszpanskiej drugiej połowy XIX stulecia'', [in:] ''Przegląd Historyczny'' 91 (2000), pp. 225-230&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal intellectual antagonist was Menendez y Pelayo.&lt;ref&gt;Skibiński 2000, pp. 227-228&lt;/ref&gt; His friend Polo remained rather a proponent and did not construct an own anti-krausian theory, though his vehemence gained him the opinion of "grande enemigo de la barbarie krausista",&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Sanchez Reyes, ''Estudios y discursos de crítica histórica y literaria. Siglo XIX. Críticos y novelistas. Estudios regionales. hispanistas y literaturas extranjeras'', Madrid 1942, quoted after ''Biblioteca Virtual Menénded Pelayo'', available [http://www.larramendi.es/menendezpelayo/i18n/corpus/unidad.cmd?idUnidad=100174&amp;idCorpus=1000&amp;posicion=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; especially as Spanish krausism, initially avoiding direct confrontation with the Church, later assumed a decisively challenging tone.&lt;ref&gt;Skibinski 2000, pp. 228-229&lt;/ref&gt; Fiercely advocating Catholic integrity as a basis of public education,&lt;ref&gt;see for instance his 1913 defence of teaching [[Catechism]] in public schools, see Roberto Sanz Ponce, ''La enseñanza del Catecismo ayer y hoy: las reflexiones del senador Polo y Peyrolón'' at formacioncontinua.com (2013), available [http://formacioncontinua.ucv.es/congreso/wp-content/uploads/2013/i/La_ense%C3%B1anza_del_Catecismo-Roberto_sanz.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; he nevertheless recognized the necessity of incorporating elements from the liberal mainstream; some scholars even maintain that Polo was completely integrated in the liberal system of education.&lt;ref&gt;Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La serpiente y la lima, en La Ilustración Católica.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Anti-krausist cartoon, 1881]]
Another characteristic feature of Polo's outlook was his position towards [[evolutionism]],&lt;ref&gt;embodied in ''Contra Darwin: supuesto parentesco entre el hombre y el mono'', published in 1881; Emilia Pardo Bazán accused this work of plagiarism, see mcnbiografias.com&lt;/ref&gt; though opinions on his stance differ. Some view it as an exemplary obscurantist Catholic reaction to scientific progress,&lt;ref&gt;mcnbiografias.com&lt;/ref&gt; dismissed as "involucionismo, integrismo, tradicionalismo e ideario reaccionario".&lt;ref&gt;a contemporary student notes that "Polo's demons"  - liberals, krausists, darwinists and freemasons – were the same demons that haunted [[francisco Franco|Franco]], Lázaro Izquirerda 2007, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that his neotomism was not an abrupt rejection of advances produced by science,&lt;ref&gt;Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt; as Polo tried to work out a conciliatory approach.&lt;ref&gt;"Como muchos pensadores católicos, Peyrolón confiaba supeditar el empirismo científico a la fe católica de una forma conciliadora. Pero la dificultad de esta tarea se acrecentó con la difusión del darwinismo en el último tercio del siglo XIX por la intensa polémica intelectual que suscitó al tratarse de la primera controversia científica de alcance mundial que transcurrió, al mismo tiempo, ante los académicos versados en la materia y el público general", Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Though his stance on darwinism is portrayed as "aggressive and intolerant attack",&lt;ref&gt;see the opinion of José María López Piñero, quoted after Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; others consider it in line with scientific standards of the era, systematic and posing questions  - like those related to hereditary transmission or variability patterns  –  which remained unanswered until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Glick, ''Darwin en España'', Valencia 2010, {{ISBN|9788437078182}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed study suggests that Polo engaged in the discourse not so much to challenge the evolutionist theory,&lt;ref&gt;in Valencia Polo had to share the scholarly ambience with Emilio Ribera, one of the top naturalists, Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; but to confront secularism which used it as a ram against the Spanish Catholic outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Sirera Mirrales 2011, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politician==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
Polo commenced his political career in 1870, speaking at local meetings in Sierra de Albarracín.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During the Third Carlist War he supported the insurgents as an [[:es:ojalatero|ojalatero]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 22; Polo's younger brother Florentino served in Carlist troops as adjutant and secretary to general [[Manuel Marco y Rodrigo]]&lt;/ref&gt; placed under police surveillance with most of his property embargoed.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Facing restrictions and fearing for his life, he temporarily went into hiding;&lt;ref&gt;Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; even following the Carlist defeat in 1876 he was longtime harassed at his workplace in Teruel.&lt;ref&gt;he had to enter repetitive oposiciones a cátedra to get his contract prolonged, Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s he contributed to the legitimist cause mostly as a novelist, propagating Carlist virtues of his protagonists, and as a [[:es:Catedrático de Enseñanza Secundaria|catedratico]], lambasting liberal ideas&lt;ref&gt;his public activities were guided by 4 principles: fighting liberalism, especially its Catholic version embodied in the "unionistas", defending the Church against liberal secularisation attempts, fighting socialism and republicanism among the urban proletariat and the Carlist legitimism, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; disseminated by [[Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;Solange Hibbs-Lissorgues, ''Imágenes del judío y antisemitismo en la literatura y la prensa católicas del siglo XIX'', [in:] Lucienne Domergeu (ed.), ''Pueblo, nación y elites. España contemporánea'', Paris 1996,  pp. 167-188&lt;/ref&gt; and [[freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;see Polo's ''La masonería española'' lecture, delivered at 5t Congreso Católico Español in Burgos in 1899, Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; He lost in 1891&lt;ref&gt;''Archivo diplomático y consular de España'', Madrid, 24.08.92, n. 418, p. 1661, quoted after ''Manuel Polo y Peyrolón 1846-1918'' entry at filosofia.org, available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a005.htm here]. However, he is not listed as an official Carlist candidate by Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt; and 1893&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; campaigns to [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]], finally victorious in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;see official Cortes service available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2890450%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; In parliament he focused on education, opposing Liberal secularisation plans&lt;ref&gt;according to Polo, Canalejas did more for Carlism than dozens of meetings and leaflets, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and promoting local languages in schools.&lt;ref&gt;with the purpose to teach castellano, Lázaro Izquirerda 2007, p. 31; according to Polo the one who does not love his small patria does not love his big one (e.g. Spain) either&lt;/ref&gt; Following defeats in successive elections&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Polo y Peyrolón, ''Memorias políticas'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499405872}}, pp. 113-116&lt;/ref&gt; he resumed parliamentary career as a senator in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;voted in by the provincial Valencian deputies, Polo was one of 8 Carlist senators, see Cesar Alcala, ''100 ańos de Solidaridad Catalana'', [in:] ''Arbil'' 90 (2007). He ceded his role of the Carlist Valencian candidate for the House of Deputies to [[Rafaél Díaz Aguado Salaberry]], who lost the 1907 campaign&lt;/ref&gt; re-elected in 1910 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;see the official Senado service available [http://www.senado.es/web/conocersenado/senadohistoria/senado18341923/senadores/fichasenador/index.html?id1=2269 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the upper chamber he kept defending the position of Catholic church,&lt;ref&gt;he was awarded the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] order by [[Leo XIII]], Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12; Polo admired the Pope for ''Quod Apostolici'' and ''Rerum novarum'' encyclicae, condemning communism, socialism and anarchism, mcnbiografias.com&lt;/ref&gt; especially during the [[:es:Ley del candado|Ley del Candado]] crisis;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filosofia.org&lt;/ref&gt; he was sort of acknowledged as dangerous opponent by procedural gimmicks, employed by his adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Lambasting the others for compromising party line, he himself engaged in secret talks with the [[Liberal-Conservative Party (Spain)|conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s Polo emerged among the Valencian Carlist chieftains. He forged friendly relations with [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|marqués de Cerralbo]]&lt;ref&gt;compare correspondence between the two, repeatedly quoted by Fernández Escudero 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other national leaders, gradually becoming a pivotal figure.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 406; see also Polo's abundant correspondence with conde Melgar, [[Tirso Olazábal Lardizábal|Tirso Olazabal]], Sacanell, [[Matías Barrio y Mier|Barrio]] and others&lt;/ref&gt; Personally introduced to [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]],&lt;ref&gt;twice visiting the claimant in his [[Italy|Italian]] residences, Polo 2013, pp. 59-98&lt;/ref&gt; in 1901 he was considered a candidate for his personal secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Revealing interest in the emerging workers’ question&lt;ref&gt;see his ''El trabajo y el salario según la doctrina católica'', Santiago 1897&lt;/ref&gt; he contributed to [[Acta de Loredan]],&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 325-6&lt;/ref&gt; published official Carlist program&lt;ref&gt;''Credo y programa del Partido Carlista'', Valencia 1905, see [http://www.carlismo.es/librosElectronicos/PoloPeyrol%C3%B3n.CredoCarlista.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; and persuaded the claimant to re-organise the party, uniting military and civil command chain.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; Fully aware of the need to modernise [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]], he appreciated the role of efficient party structures,&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''Espacio propio, espacio publico. La sociabilidad carlista en la España de fines del siglo XIX y principos del siglo XX'', [in:] ''historiapolitica.com'' service, pp. 8, 14&lt;/ref&gt; building a dense network of circulos.&lt;ref&gt;in terms of number of circulos and juntas created in the 1890s, the province of Valencia was second only to Barcelona, far ahead of traditional Carlist strongholds like [[Navarre]] and [[Gipuzkoa]], see Francisco Javier Caspistegui, ''Historia por descubrir. Materiales para estudio del carlismo'', Estella 2012, {{ISBN|9788423532148}}, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Polo was nominated jefe of the Valencian branch.&lt;ref&gt;Polo 2013, pp. 159-166&lt;/ref&gt; Personally intransigent,&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 17; he was earlier at odds with [[José Corbató Chillida]], editor of the Valencian Traditionalist review ''Luz Católica''&lt;/ref&gt; he was resented by other [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] leaders, [[Manuel Simó Marín]] and [[Joaquín Lloréns Fernández de Cordoba|Joaquín Llorens Fernandez]].&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict, fuelled by strong personalities, Polo's adamant leadership style&lt;ref&gt;he applied double standards to the internal party discipline, depending whether he was or was not at office, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and discrepancies between legitimistas and posibilistas,&lt;ref&gt;though Carlism is typically viewed as fanatical, in fact it has always been plagued by division between those opting for "malminorismo" and those preferring to "echarse al monte"; Polo tended to side with the latter. His intransigence is credited for preventing the party from amalgamation into ''Union Católica'', ''Lliga'' or other collaborative structures, see Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; continuously plagued his Valencian tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the national scene, bedeviled by intrigues among Carlist pundits, Polo's relations deteriorated, including those with Carlos VII and especially his wife [[Berthe de Rohan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 307; in conflict with the widow, he decided not to take part in the funeral ceremonies of Carlos VII, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He considered his resignation, handed to the new Carlist king [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaime III]], a purely procedural gesture, and was shocked to see it accepted,&lt;ref&gt;Polo 2013, pp. 289-296&lt;/ref&gt; though as a senator he was appointed to national executive, [[Junta Nacional Tradicionalista]], in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;it was Simó representing the Valencia branch, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 443-4&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Manuel Polo y Peyrolon funeral.JPG|thumbnail|Polo's funeral, Valencia]]
With no close family,&lt;ref&gt;after the Third Carlist War his brother Manuel lived in Cuba and England, where he died following a horse accident in 1891, Artagan 1912, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded only by books, moths and butterflies,&lt;ref&gt;Polo was also amateur lepidopterist; since the childhood days in Sierra de Albarracín he was collecting moths and butterflies, donated later to Biblioteca del Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de Valencia, Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 19; Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12 claims it was Biblioteca del Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de Teruel. He donated his library to Biblioteca del Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de Teruel, Sanz Ponce 2010, p. 27; his private documentation, including massive correspondence, was donated to Real Academia de la Historia, Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 12 and is invaluable source of information on Carlism of the era&lt;/ref&gt; personally intolerant and sour up to acrimony, by the end of his life Polo grew into a misanthrope and passed into living memory as "grumpy old man".&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly pessimistic as to the future of Traditionalism, highly skeptical of its political leaders and the claimant himself.&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, pp. 16-17; according to Polo, "D. Jaime Borbón y Borbón, heredero de la Jefatura de esta gran Casa Real, de la legitimidad española y de la representación católico-monárquica de su augusto padre, le tenían sin cuidado los principios, base y fundamento de su posición y prestigio en el mundo", quoted after Javier Esteve Martí, ''El carlismo ante la reorganización de las derechas. De la Segunda Guerra Carlista a la Guerra Civil'' [in:] ''Pasado y Memoria. Revista de Historia Contemporánea'' 13 (2014), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; At one point he considered himself close to [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrism]],&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 17; this was a change compared to the 1890s, when he considered the Integrist secession a blessing for Carlism, see Jordi Canal, ''Las «muertes» y las «resurrecciones» del carlismo. Reflexiones sobre la escisión integrista de 1888'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 38 (2000), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; though until his death he remained loyal to the Carlist dynasty.

{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
The '''Mariology of the popes''' is the [[theology|theological]] study of the influence that the popes have had on the development, formulation and transformation of the Roman Catholic Church’s doctrines and devotions relating to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The development of Mariology over the centuries has been influenced by a number of factors, among which papal directives have often represented key milestones. Examples of papal influences include new Marian feast days, prayers, acceptance of new Marian congregations, indulgences, support for Marian apparitions (e.g. [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Lourdes]] and [[Our Lady of Fatima|Fatima]]) and declaration of Marian dogmas.

A number of popes have made Marian themes a key part of their papacy, e.g. [[Leo XIII]] issued a record eleven [[encyclical]]s on the rosary, [[Pius XII]] invoked the first (and to date only) case of ''[[ex cathedra]]'' [[papal infallibility]] to establish a Marian dogma and [[John Paul II]] built his personal [[coat of arms]] around the [[Marian Cross]].&lt;ref name="Mangan"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C|title=Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons|last=Mangan|first=Charles|publisher=Seat of Wisdom Books|year=2008|isbn=9781579183554|editor-last=Miravalle|editor-first=Mark I.|location=[[Goleta, California]]|pages=530–540|chapter=The Spiritual Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary|access-date=23 June 2016|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&amp;pg=PA507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popes have also highlighted the key Catholic [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological theme]] of the link between the study of Mary and the development of a full [[Christology]], e.g. as in Pius XII's ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' and John Paul II's ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''.

==Papal influences on Mariology==
Popes were highly important for the development of doctrine and the  veneration of the Blessed Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, William M. and Pinnock, Jill. ''Mary for Time and Eternity'', 2007 {{ISBN|0-85244-651-9}} pp. 65-67&lt;/ref&gt; They made decisions not only in the area of Marian beliefs ([[Mariology(RC)|Mariology]])  but also Marian practices and [[Catholic devotions|devotions]]. Popes promulgated Marian veneration and beliefs by authorizing: new Marian [[feast days]], Marian [[prayer]]s and initiatives, acceptance and support of Marian congregations, indulgences and special privileges, and support for Marian devotions.

The formal recognition of Marian [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] (such as at [[Lourdes]] and [[Fátima, Portugal|Fatima]]) has also been influential. Since [[Pope Leo XIII]], Popes have promoted Marian devotion through [[Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters|encyclicals, Apostolic Letters]] and with two [[dogma]]s ([[Immaculate Conception]] and [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]), the promulgation of  [[Marian year]]s ([[Pius XII]], [[John Paul II]]), visits to [[Marian shrine]]s ([[Benedict XVI]] in 2007) and by actively supporting the fathers of [[Vatican II]] as they highlighted the importance of Marian veneration ([[Pope John XXIII]] and [[Paul VI]]) in ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.

Popular views like the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] and the  [[Immaculate Conception]] developed into Papal teaching over time. Popes have also limited and cautioned against some devotional practices. In 1674 [[Pope Clement X]] (1670–1676) indexed books on Marian piety.&lt;ref&gt;such as Avvisi salutary della virgine ai suoi devoti indiscreti&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Council of Trent]],  ''Marian fraternities'' were founded, fostering Marian piety,&lt;ref&gt;often  on occupational lines (bakers, butchers etc)&lt;/ref&gt; not all of which were approved. Not all Popes took the same view on Marian beliefs and devotions.

==First millennium==

===Leo the Great===
[[File:greatleoone.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Pope [[Saint Leo I]].]]
To [[Leo the Great]], Mariology is determined by Christology. He defended the teaching that Christ has two natures, one divine and one human.
* ''The same eternal, only-begotten of the eternal begetter was born of the holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary. His birth in time in no way subtracts from or adds to that divine and eternal birth of his: but its whole purpose is to restore humanity, who had been deceived, so that it might defeat death and, by its power, destroy the devil who held the power of death. Overcoming the originator of sin and death would be beyond us, had not he whom sin could not defile, nor could death hold down, taken up our nature and made it his own. He was conceived from the holy Spirit inside the womb of the virgin mother. Her virginity was as untouched in giving him birth as it was in conceiving him.''

==13th to the 17th centuries==

===Clement IV===
[[Pope Clement IV]] (1265–1268) created a poem on the seven joys of Mary, which in its form is considered an early version of the Franciscan rosary &lt;ref name=Marienkunde&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUabjgEACAAJ|title=Lexikon der Marienkunde|last=|first=|publisher=F.

===Pius V===
On September 17, 1569 [[Pope Pius V]] issued the papal bull ''[[Consueverunt Romani Pontifices]]'' which substantially established the rosary's present configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/the-rosary-predated-st-dominic "The Rosary Predated St. Dominic", ''Zenit'', October 17, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 [[Pope Pius V]] requested to the people of Europe to pray the rosary. After the victory of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], he declared a commemorative feast that later became the [[Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Alban, ''Butler's Lives Of The Saints'', (April) (1999) {{ISBN|0-86012-253-0}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clement VIII ===
[[Pope Clement VIII]]  (1592–1605) considered Marian piety the basis for Church reforms and issued the bull ''[[Dominici gregis]]'' (February 3, 1603) to condemn negations of the virginity of Mary. He promulgated Marian congregations and supported the rosary culture with 19 [[Papal bull]]s.&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|1162}}

===Clement X===
[[Pope Clement X]] (1670–1676) furthered Marian piety with additional indulgences and privileges to religious orders and cities to celebrate special Marian feasts. He opposed the Marian piety of Louis de Montfort (canonized by [[Pope Pius XII]]) with a bull published on December 15, 1673 and outlawed some manifestations of Marian devotions. Several bulls supported the frequent citing of the rosary.&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|1163}}

==18th century==

===Clement XI===
[[Pope Clement XI]] (1700–1721) prepared the groundwork for the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. He permitted the title “Immaculate Conception” and instructed the Holy Office in 1712 not to persecute anyone invoking Mary using this title. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception, which existed only regionally, was prescribed for the whole Church. The Pope recommended the teachings and piety of Louis de Montfort and named him ''“Apostolic Missionary of France”''&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|1163}} On October 3, 1716, Clement XI extended the feast of [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] to the Universal Church.&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|1163}}

===Benedict XIII===
[[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) issued several indulgences in support of the rosary prayer, rosary processions and for praying the rosary on 15 ''“Marian Tuesdays”.''  He outlawed the Serafine rosary in 1727 and extended the feasts of [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Our Lady of Seven Sorrows]] and [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] to the whole Church.&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|672}}

===Clement XII===
[[Pope Clement XII]] (1758–1769) banned all Marian litanies except the [[Litany of Loreto]]. In 1770 he permitted Spain to have the Immaculata as the main patron of the country and in 1767, he granted Spain the privilege of adding Mater Immaculata to the litany.

===Benedict XIV===
[[Pope Benedict XIV]] wrote books about the feast days of Christ and Mary - ''De festis Christi at BMV''&lt;ref&gt;Opera Omnia Roma, 1747, 51&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the Marian congregations for the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] with the bull ''[[Gloriosae Dominae]]'', issued on September 27, 1748, and increased indulgences for all who pray the rosary.&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|672}}

===Clement XIV===
[[Pope Clement XIV]] (1769–1775) had to deal with popular unrest in Southern Italy regarding celebrations and processions of the Immaculate Conception. He granted a privilege to the [[Franciscan]]s in [[Palermo]], that only they may celebrate the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Later he extended the privilege to other orders for private masses only. He outlawed the brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception but confirmed a knightly order with the same name.  Allegedly, he had promised the King of Spain to dogmatize the IC.&lt;ref&gt;F Masson, Le Cardinal de Bernis depuis son minister Paris, 1884, 156, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==

===Pius IX===
[[File:Bartolomé Esteban Perez Murillo 021.jpg|thumb|right|Pius IX dogmatized the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1854. (Murillo 1660)]]
The Mariology of [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846–1878) represents a significant development of Roman Catholic theology, since it led to the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Catholic theology in the  19th century was dominated by the issue of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]]. During his pontificate petitions increased requesting the dogmatization of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. In 1848 Pius appointed a theological commission to analyze the possibility for a Marian dogma.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_o39ZwEACAAJ|title=Marienlexikon|last=Bäumer|first=Remigius|publisher=EOS-Verlag|year=1989|isbn=9783880968912|editor-last=Scheffczyk|editor-first=Leo|editor-link=Leo Scheffczyk|location=|pages=|language=German|trans-title=Marian Lexicon|access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245}}

In 1848 the Pope had to flee Rome, when a revolutionary movement took over the [[Papal States]] and city government. From his exile in [[Gaeta]] he issued the encyclical ''[[Ubi primum (Pius IX, 1849)|Ubi primum]]'', seeking the opinions of the bishops on the Immaculate Conception, a novel approach of collegiality in the history of the papacy. Over 90 per cent of the bishops requested the dogmatization.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|245}} Pius IX moved cautiously, on 10 May 1852 appointing a commission of twenty theologians to prepare a possible text of the dogma. Upon their completion, on 2 December 1852 he asked a commission of cardinals to finalize the text.

It also influenced the eventual promulgation of the dogma of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. Pius IX's approach of seeking collegial consensus was quoted by [[Pope Pius XII]], when in ''[[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]]'', he inquired of the bishops about a possible dogma of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.

====1854 proclamation of the Immaculation Conception====
It was not until 1854 that Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic [[Bishop]]s, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html The Holy Spirit Assists the Roman Pontiff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810000000/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|245}} During [[First Vatican Council]], some 108 council fathers requested to add the words "Immaculate Virgin" to the [[Hail Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;and to add the Immaculata to the [[Litany of Loreto]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the [[Creed]] of the Church, which was opposed by Pius IX.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|566}}

====Rejection of a dogma of the Assumption====
During the [[First Vatican Council]], nine [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] petitions favored a possible assumption dogma, but this was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially from [[Germany]]. On 8 May the fathers rejected a dogmatization at that time, a rejection shared by Pius IX. Council fathers highlighted the divine motherhood of Mary and called her the mother of all graces.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|566}}

Pius IX believed in the [[Assumption of Mary]], and recognized the close relation between the [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary and her being taken up into Heaven. He resisted attempts however, to issue a second Marian [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] within two decades. He attributed to Mary his narrow escape from [[Rome]] to [[Gaeta]] in 1848.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|245}}

===Leo XIII===
In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, [[Pope Leo XIII]] stresses Mary's role in the redemption of humanity. His mariology was greatly influenced by Thomas Aquinas, especially his view of Mary's role in the Annunciation.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|97}} Leo's emphasis on the path ''through Mary to Christ'' has been a key direction in Roman Catholic Mariology, with Mariology viewed as inherent in [[Christology]], and the rosary paving that path.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII ''Mystici corporis Christi''; John Henry Newman: ''Mariology is always christocentric'', in Michael Testa, Mary: The Virgin Mary in the Life and Writings of John Henry Newman 2001; ''Mariology Is Christology'' in Vittorio Messori, "The Mary Hypothesis" Rome, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LeoXIII1900.jpg|thumb|190px|Pope Leo XIII]]
[[Pope Leo XIII]] (1878–1903) issued a record number of encyclicals on the rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October, and created in 1883 the Feast of ''Queen of the Holy Rosary''. Leo XIII promulgated Marian devotions via eleven encyclicals on the rosary.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|41}} A centennial after his death, Leo XIII is often quoted, most recently by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and [[John Paul II]].

He applied the Marian analysis of Louis de Montfort to the analysis of the Church as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Köster 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Leo actively employed his papal authority to support the veneration of Mary in places of her apparitions. Upon the blessing and opening of the Church of our Lady in [[Lourdes]], he issued an apostolic writing, ''Parte humanae generi'' supporting pilgrimages to Lourdes and other Marian shrines.

Leo XIII declared the [[Virgin of Montserrat]] to be the patron of Catalonia, and instituted the Feast of the [[Miraculous Medal]] in 1894. He condemned heresies about the Immaculate Conception&lt;ref&gt;Rosmini&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed the relation of Saint Joseph to Mary in encyclical ''Quanquam Pluries'' (August 15, 1889).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lettresapostoliq02cath#page/250/mode/2up ''Epistola Encyclica De patrocinio Sancti Josephi una cum Virginis Deiparae pro temporum difficultate implorando''] in Lettres apostoliques de s.s. Léon XIII : encycliques, brefs etc, p. 250-261&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XIII explained the importance of the rosary as the one road to God, from the father to the Son,  to his Mother, and from her to the human race. The rosary is a vital means to participate in the life of Mary and to find the way to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclical Jucunda Semper 8.9.1894 quoted in Marienlexikon,Eos St. Ottilien, 1988  42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|Leo XIII was devoted to ''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'', and included her invocation in the [[Litany of Loreto]]. This image is by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], the original being in [[Genazzano]], near Rome. [[Pius XII]] also placed his pontificate under the maternal care of ''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' and composed a prayer to her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/olgc.html Univ of Dayton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608103323/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/olgc.html |date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''This Saint's for You'' by Thomas J. Craughwell 2007 {{ISBN|1-59474-184-0}} page 172&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Leo XIII was the first Pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[mediatrix]]. In his rosary encyclicals, he described the Virgin Mary as mediating all graces. In 1883 he wrote that nothing is as salvific and powerful as asking for the support of the Virgin, the mediator of peace with God and of heavenly graces.&lt;ref name=Graber&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Die marianischen Weltrundschreiben der Päpste in den letzten hundert Jahren|last=Graber|first=Rudolf|publisher=Echter-Verlag|year=1954|isbn=|location=[[Würzburg]], [[Germany]]|pages=|language=German|trans-title=Marian Encyclicals of Popes in the Last Hundred Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|30}} In his rosary encyclical ''Octobri Mense'', he stated, that Mary is administrator of graces on earth, part of a new salvation order.&lt;ref name=Graber/&gt;{{rp|48}}

In ''Dei Matris'' he noted, that Mary is mediator because Christ the Lord is also our brother&lt;ref name=Graber/&gt;{{rp|62}} And, in ''Jucunda Semper'', he stated, that the deepest reason, why Roman Catholics look for the protection of Mary through prayer, is most certainly her office as mediator of divine grace.&lt;ref name=Graber/&gt;{{rp|83}} In ''[[Augustissimae Virginis Mariae]]'', he wrote that calling on Mary is the best way to be heard by God, and to find his grace.&lt;ref name=Graber/&gt;{{rp|115}}

From [[Thomas Aquinas]] Leo borrows the notion that Mary, in the hour of [[Annunciation]], assumed the role of a helper in the mystery of redemption. Thus all Christians are born through Mary. With Jesus, Mary carried all in her womb. Therefore, all Christians are her children.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|96}}

====Scapulars====
More than any other pope, Leo XIII, who was himself a member of the Pious Union of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]], was deeply attached to Our Lady of Good Counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 515&lt;/ref&gt; The small ''[[Scapular]] of Our Lady of Good Counsel'' (the White Scapular) was presented by the [[Hermits of St. Augustine]] to Leo XIII who, in December 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences. On April 22, 1903, Leo XIII included the invocation "[[Mater boni consilii]]" in the [[Litany of Loreto]].

During predecessor [[Pope Pius IX|Pius]]'s reign, the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Ransom]] was yet approved in 1868.

==20th century==

===Pius X===
[[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]] (1903–1914) promoted daily communion.  In his 1904 encyclical ''[[Ad diem illum]]'', he views Mary in context of "restoring everything in Christ".  Spiritually we all are her children and she is the mother of us Therefore, she must be adored like a mother&lt;ref&gt;Ad diem illum 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Christ is  the Word made Flesh and  the Savior of mankind. He had a physical body like  every other man: and as Savior of the human family, he had a spiritual and mystical body,  the Church. This, the Pope argues, has consequences for our view of the  Blessed Virgin.

She  did not conceive the Eternal Son of God merely that He might be made man taking His human nature from her, but also, by giving him her human nature, that He might be the Redeemer of men. Mary, carrying the Savior within her, also carried all those whose life was contained in the life of the Savior. Therefore, all the faithful  united to Christ, are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones&lt;ref&gt;(Ephes. v., 30),&lt;/ref&gt;  from the womb of Mary like a body united to its head. Though  a spiritual and mystical fashion, all are  children of Mary, and she is their Mother. Mother, spiritually, but truly Mother of the members of Christ. (S. Aug. L. de S. Virginitate, c. 6).&lt;ref&gt;''Ad diem illum laetissimum'', 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benedict XV===

[[Pope Benedict XV]] (1914–1922)  was an ardent [[Roman Catholic Mariology|mariologist]], devoted to Marian veneration and open new theological perspectives.  He personally addressed in  numerous letters the pilgrims at Marian sanctuaries. He  named Mary, the Patron of Bavaria and permitted in Mexico the Feast of the IC of Guadaloupe. To underline his support for the [[mediatrix]] theology,  he authorized the Feast of Mary Mediator of all Graces.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1921, 345&lt;/ref&gt; He condemned the misuse of Marian statues and pictures, dressed in priestly robes, which he outlawed April 4, 1916.&lt;ref name=Marienkunde/&gt;{{rp|673}}&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1916, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]],  Benedict placed the world under the protection of the [[Blessed Virgin|Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)]] and added the invocation '' Mary Queen of Peace'' to the [[Litany of Loreto]]. He promoted [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Marian veneration]] throughout the world by elevating twenty well known Marian shrines such as [[Ettal Abbey]] in [[Bavaria]]  into [[Basilica Minor]]'s. He also promoted Marian devotions in the month of May in the spirit of [[St. Louis de Montfort|Grignon de Montfort]]&lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin 179-339&lt;/ref&gt; The dogmatic constitution on the Church issued by the [[Second Vatican Council]] quotes the Marian theology of Benedict XV.&lt;ref&gt;C VII, §50&lt;/ref&gt;

In his encyclical on [[Ephraim the Syrian]] he depicts Ephraim as a model of Marian devotion to our mother who uniquely was predestined by God. Pope Benedict did not issue a Marian encyclical but addressed the issue of [[Co-Redemptrix]] in his [[Apostolic Letter]], ''Inter Soldalica,'' issued March 22, 1918.&lt;ref name="AAS, 1918, 181"&gt;AAS, 1918, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''As the blessed Virgin Mary does not seem to participate in the public life  of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, she is not there without divine  intention. She suffers with her suffering and dying son, almost as if she would have died herself. For the salvation of mankind, she gave up her rights  as the mother of her son and sacrificed him for the reconciliation of divine justice, as far as she was permitted to do. Therefore, one can say, she redeemed with Christ the human race.''&lt;ref name="AAS, 1918, 181"/&gt;

===Pius XI===
[[Pope Pius XI]] ruled the Church from 1922 to 1939. During his pontificate, a possible dogma of the  assumption was being discussed. He granted France  the patron  “Our lady assumed into heaven patron”&lt;ref&gt;on March  22. 1922&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930, he sent a Papal delegate to the celebration of the house of Mary in Loreto, and in 1931, 1500 years after the Council of Ephesus, he issued a call to the separated Orthodox Church to venerate Mary together and to overcome the schism. In several apostolic writings he supported the rosary prayer. In 1931, he instituted the fest of motherhood of Mary. Pope Pius XI liked to quote Bernard of Clairvaux: “We have everything through Mary”.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Pius XII===
[[File:His Holiness Pope Pius XII.png|thumb|Pope Pius XII]]
[[Eugenio Pacelli]] was devoted to the [[Virgin Mary]] and as a young boy, two images in Rome received particular veneration: the [[Madonna Della Strada]], and [[Salus Populi Romani]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Jan Olav. ''Angelic shepherd: the life of Pope Pius XII'', 1950 Dodd, Mead Publishers, {{ASIN|B0007E1QT8}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Church at Prayer'' by Dalmais, Irénée Henri; Martimort, Aimé Georges; and Jounel, Pierre. 1985 {{ISBN|0-8146-1366-7}} page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Pius XII was called the most Marian pope in Church history.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt; He placed his pontificate under the protection of the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus.html Pope Pius XII, "Munificentissimus Deus" §42, November 1, 1950, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1943 encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis]]'', [[Pope Pius XII]] speaks to the 1854 dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] promulgated by [[Pius IX]] in 1854. Mary, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls,  "in the name of the whole human race" gave her consent "for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature.",&lt;ref name="Office for Holy Week"&gt;Office for Holy Week&lt;/ref&gt; thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our diviner redeemer should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost.&lt;ref name = "EMCC-110"&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Mystici corporis Christi, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  She is Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ, and reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory.&lt;ref name = "EMCC-110"/&gt;

Many of the saints canonized by Pius XII were deeply devoted to Mary, such as [[Peter Chanel]], [[Jeanne de Lestonnac]], [[Pope Pius X]], [[Catherine Labouré]], and [[Anthony Mary Claret]].

====Fatima====

Pacelli was consecrated archbishop in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Pope Benedict XV]] on May 13, 1917, the same day as the first purported apparition of [[Our Lady of Fatima]]. His Secretary of State, Cardinal Luigi Maglione would later say that the Pope had been deeply moved by the parallel of his episcopal consecration and the apparition in Fatima.&lt;ref&gt;Barthas, L. ''Il etait trios petit enfantes'', Paris, 1945, Freiburg, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his episcopal consecration Pope Pius said:

* ''At the same hour when the Lord placed the concern of the whole Church on our shoulders, at the mountain of Fatima appeared for the first time the White Queen of the Holy Rosary, as if the Mother of Mercy wanted to indicate,  that in the stormy times of our pontificate, in the midst of  the great crisis of human history, we will always have the  motherly and vigilant assistance of the great conqueress , who would protect and guide us.''&lt;ref&gt;Johannes M Höcht, Papst Pius XII und Fatima, Wien 1956, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Tedeschini, who was present at the consecration in 1917, added his view to the coincidence:  "The  pontificate of Pius XII is focused on Fatima, May 13.  It was our Lady of Fatima, who connected with  the person and future of Eugenio Pacelli, having him consecrated through the hands of Pope Benedict XV  to the fullness of priesthood at the very day and hour, in which the Most Blessed Virgin with her messages first descended  to Fatima. May 13 is engraved in all our hearts, how much more in the heart of this Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Höcht 317&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition and, silver jubilee of the Episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the Message and Secret of Fatima. In May 1946, he authorized his personal representative, Cardinal Masalla to preside over a canonical coronation of the image of Our Lady of Fatima, in Fatima, Portugal. ''The faithful virgin never disappointed the trust, put on her. She will transform into a fountain of graces, physical and spiritual graces, over all of Portugal, and from there, breaking all frontiers, over the whole Church and the entire world''&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1946 246.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On May 18, 1950, the Pope sent a message to the people of Portugal: "May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of Fatima, which, before anybody else she was blessed to hear. To keep Fatima in your heart and to translate Fatima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces”&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1951, 780&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marian year====
With the September 8, 1953 encyclical ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', Pius XII became the first Pope to call for a [[Marian year]], a practice continued by [[John Paul II]] in 1987. Set for 1954 [[Marian year]] included initiatives in the areas of mariology, cultural events,  charity and social gatherings&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|534}}

====Lourdes====
[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|220px|On April 1, 1899, Eugenio Pacelli said his first Holy Mass at the [[Salus Populi Romani]] fifty years later, he crowned this picture for the [[Marian year]] 1954 as shown here.]]

The encyclical ''[[Le pèlerinage de Lourdes]]'', was issued on July 2, 1957. The encyclical represents  the strongest pronouncement of the papal [[magisterium]] on [[Marian apparitions]] in the history of the Catholic Church. In it Pius recalls pleasant memories of the pilgrimage to Lourdes which he undertook while Papal delegate at the Eucharistic and Marian Celebrations in 1937.  The Pope reminds the faithful of France, that every Christian land is a Marian land and that” there is not one nation redeemed in the blood of Christ which does not glory in proclaiming Mary its Mother and Patroness”&lt;ref&gt;Pope Pius XII, ''[[Le pèlerinage de Lourdes]]'', §5&lt;/ref&gt;  He then recalls the history of Marian veneration,  the history of Lourdes and the contributions of the Popes to her veneration in Lourdes.

Christian families must remain faithful to their vital mission in society, and, consecrate themselves in this jubilee year to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. For married couples this consecration  will be a valuable aid in  their conjugal duties of chastity and faithfulness and  keep pure the atmosphere in which  children grow up.''{{sfn|''Le pèlerinage de Lourdes'', §54}}

Professional and civic affairs offer a vast field of Marian action. Gathered at the Virgin's feet, and open  to her teachings, self-searching  will  uproot any false judgments and selfish impulses. ...The quest for social and political peace among men is, above all, a moral problem, because  no reform can bear fruit, no agreement  lasting without a conversion and cleansing of heart. In this jubilee year the Virgin of Lourdes reminds all men of this truth{{sfn|''Le pèlerinage de Lourdes'', §55}}

Pius XII teaches, that Mary looks upon some of her children with a special affection,  the lowly, the poor, and the afflicted whom Jesus loved so much.

* ''Go to her, you who are crushed by material misery, defenseless against the hardships of life and the indifference of men. Go to her, you who are assailed by sorrows and moral trials. Go to her, beloved invalids and infirm, you who are sincerely welcomed and honored at Lourdes as the suffering members of our Lord. Go to her and receive peace of heart, strength for your daily duties, joy for the sacrifice you offer.''{{sfn|''Le pèlerinage de Lourdes'', §57}}

The Pontiff states, that the Immaculate Virgin  knows the secret ways by which grace operates in souls. She also  knows also the great price which God attaches to  sufferings,  united to those of the Savior. The encyclical closes with a quote of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux: "Amid dangers, difficulties, and doubts, think of Mary, invoke Mary's aid.... If you follow her, you will not stray; if you entreat her, you will not lose hope; if you reflect upon her, you will not err; if she supports you, you will not fall; if she protects you, you will not fear; if she leads you, you will not grow weary; if she is propitious, you will reach your goal."&lt;ref&gt;Second Homily on the Missus est: PL CLXXXIII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le pèlerinage de Lourdes'', 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ida10-1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pope Pius XII]] called ''Pastor Angelicus'', was the most Marian Pope in Church history.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;]] --&gt;

==== Consecration to the Immaculate Heart ====
{{See also|Consecration and entrustment to Mary}}
On October 31, 1942 [[Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Pius XII consecrated]] the human race and later Russia to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

On October 31, 1942, Pope Pius XII, in a radio address informed the people of Portugal about the apparitions of Fatima, consecrating the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin with specific mention of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1942, 313&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 1942, the Pontiff officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter Basilica in Rome.

The [[Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] took place on October 31, 1942 just before major turning points in World War Two. Pius XII consecrated to Mary not only the Church but the whole human race, as "Father of Christianity" as representative of Christ, to whom "All power is given ... in heaven and in earth.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:18|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2016}} The solemn consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was pronounced at a critical phase of&lt;ref&gt;World War Two&lt;/ref&gt; on October 31.&lt;ref&gt;1942&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, German troops under General Rommel had conquered strategic parts of North Africa and were advancing towards the [[Suez Canal]]. In the [[Pacific]], following [[Pearl Harbor]], the Imperial Japanese forces occupied ever increasing territories, and in [[Russia]] experienced an ever expanding  German invasion. In this situation, [[Pope Pius XII]], like his predecessors, put his trust in prayer. On October 31, 1942, he called for a prayer crusade to the ''Queen of Peace'', and dedicated the whole human race and especially [[Russia]] to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

In 1944, Pope Pius XII prescribed the Feast of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] for the whole Church in 1944 and placed his pontificate under the special patronage of the Virgin,&lt;ref&gt;Munificentissimus Deus 42&lt;/ref&gt; In his Apostolic Letter of 7 July 1952 [[Sacro Vergente]], Pius consecrated Russia to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.

On May 1, 1948, in ''[[Auspicia quaedam]]'', Pope Pius requested the consecration  to the Immaculate Heart of  every Catholic family, parish and dioceses. “It is our wish, consequently, that wherever the opportunity suggests itself, this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families."&lt;ref&gt;''Auspicia quaedam'', 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AAS 148, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mariology of Pius XII====
The 1854 dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] by [[Pius IX]]  defined the Virgin conceived without sin, as the mother of God and our mother.  Pope Pius XII  built on this  in ''[[Mystici corporis]]'', which summarizes his [[mariology]]: Maria, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls,  "''in the name of the whole human race''" gave her consent "for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature.",&lt;ref name="Office for Holy Week"/&gt; thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material.  She who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, became mother of all His members. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer,  should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost.&lt;ref name="EMCC-110"/&gt;  She is  Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ,  and  reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory.&lt;ref name = "EMCC-110"/&gt;

====Adoption of the dogma of the Assumption====
{{Main article|Munificentissimus  Deus}}
In 1950 Pius XII defined the [[Assumption of Mary]] as an article of faith for Roman Catholics. This was the first (and {{As of|2016|lc=y}} only) [[ex cathedra]] exercise of [[papal infallibility]] since [[Vatican I]].
On November 1, 1950, Pope Pius XII defined the dogma of the assumption:

:"By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Mother of God]], the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory."&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1950, 753&lt;/ref&gt;

The dogma of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary, is the crowning  of the theology of Pope Pius XII. In 1950 [[Pope Pius XII]] defined the [[Assumption of Mary]] as being an article of faith for Roman Catholics. This was the first (and to date only) [[ex cathedra]] exercise of [[papal infallibility]] since [[Vatican I]]. It was preceded by the 1946 encyclical [[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]],  which  requested  all  Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. In this dogmatic statement, the phrase ''"having completed the course of her earthly life, "'' leaves open the question of whether the Virgin  Mary died before her Assumption, or, whether she  was assumed before death; both possibilities are allowed. Mary's Assumption was a divine gift to Mary as [[Mother of God]]. As Mary completed her race as a shining example to the human race,  the perspective of the gift of assumption is offered to the whole human race.

====New Marian feasts====
Pope Pius XII instituted the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1944 to be celebrated on 22 August,&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional [[octave (liturgy)|octave]] day of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. (In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to the day, Saturday, immediately after the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.)

[[File:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Coronation of the [[Salus Populi Romani]] icon in [[Rome]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954, in association with his announcement of new Marian feast for the [[Queenship of Mary]].]]
In the October 11, 1954 encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'', he introduced a new Marian feast, the [[Queenship of Mary]]. 
In several encyclicals and apostolic letters to the people of Poland and other countries behind the Iron curtain, he expresses certainty, that the Blessed Virgin Mary will triumph over her enemies.&lt;ref name="add encyclicals"&gt;add encyclicals&lt;/ref&gt;

Assumed into heaven, so Pope Pius,  Mary is with Jesus Christ, her divine son.  Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her Divine [[Motherhood]] of [[Jesus Christ]], her only son, but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of our eternal salvation. The encyclical argues, that  Christ, because He redeemed us, is our Lord and king by a special title, so the Blessed Virgin also (is our queen), on account of the unique manner in which she assisted in our redemption, by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest in, our salvation."&lt;ref&gt;Ad caeli reginam, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as he closely associated the celebrations of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Queenship of Mary from 31 May to 22 August, bringing it into association with the feast of her Assumption.

====Mariological writings====
In several encyclicals and apostolic letters to the people of Poland and other countries behind the Iron curtain, he expressed certainty, that the Blessed Virgin Mary would triumph over her enemies.
On September 8, 1953, the encyclical ''[[Fulgens corona]]'' announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] .&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1953, 577&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Pius XII left open the [[Mediatrix]] question, the  role of the Virgin  in the salvation acts of her son Jesus Christ. In the encyclical [[Ad caeli reginam]] he promulgated the feast, [[Queenship of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954, 625&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pius XII]], who was consecrated  on May 13, 1917, the very day, [[Our Lady of Fatima]] is believed to have first appeared,  consecrated the world to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in 1942, in accordance with the second "secret" of Our Lady of Fatima. (His remains were to be buried  in the crypt of Saint Peter Basilica on the feast day  of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], October 13, 1958)

In 1950 and in 1958 he authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] (see below).  In 1953, Pope Pius ordered a [[Marian year]] for 1954, the first in Church history. The year was filled with Marian initiatives, in the areas of mariology, cultural events,  charity and social gatherings&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|534}} In his encyclical ''[[Fulgens corona]]'' and ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' he presented a synthesis of the mariology of the Church and warned against excesses  and timid under-representation of the Catholic faith.

====Mariological research====
Pius strongly supported Marian research with the foundation or enlargement of a number of research centers in Rome. 
In 1950 and in 1958 he authorized institutions for increased academic research into the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|veneration of Mary]].
Pope Pius supported or rewarded Mariological research of scholars like [[Gabriel Roschini]], Raimondo Spiazzi, Otto Faller and Sebastian Tromp. Roschini was named head of the [[Marianum]], Spiazzi and Tromp were asked to participate in his encyclicals, Faller received a papal medal for his work. He also promulgated  mariology …..within the circles associated with the [[Holy See]] took a major step forward between during the [[Holy Year]] in 1950 and in 1958 based on the actions of [[Pope Pius XII]] who authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].

* '''Academia  Mariana Salesiana''' He granted the foundation of the Academia Mariana Salesiana  which is a part of a papal university.  The Academy supports Salesian studies with the aim of furthering the veneration of the Blessed Virgin in the tradition of Saint [[John Bosco]].&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|534}}
* '''Centro Mariano Montfortano''' Also in 1950, the Centro Mariano Montfortano was moved from Bergamo to Rome. The Centro promulgates the teachings of Saint [[Louis de Montfort]], who was earlier canonized by Pius XII. It publishes the monthly Madre e Regina which promulgates the Marian orientation of Montfort.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|535}}
* ''' Marianum''' was created in 1950 and entrusted to the Order of Servites. It is authorized to grant all academic degrees including  a doctorate in theology. Since 1976, every two years the [[Marianum]] organizes international conferences to find modern formulations which approximate the mystery of Mary.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|535}}
* '''Collegamento Mariano Nazionale''' (1958) was the last Marian  initiative of Pope Pius XII. It coordinates activities of Marian centres in Italy, organizes Marian pilgrimages and Marian study weeks for priests. In addition it started Marian youth gatherings and publishes the Journal “Madonna”.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|534}}

Of these organizations, the [[Marianum]] is the most active marilogical centre in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;at Viale 30 Aprile- 6, 00153, [[Rome]]&lt;/ref&gt; This Pontifical Catholic institute was founded by Father [[Gabriel Roschini]] (who then directed it for several years) under the direction of Pope [[Pius XII]] in 1950. At the Marianum, one can get a master's degree in Mariology (2-year academic program) and one can also get a doctorate in Mariology. This Mariological facility has a library with more than 85,000 volumes on Mariology and a number of magazines and journals of theological and Mariological concern. [[Marianum]] is also the name of the prestigious journal of Marian theology, previously founded by Father [[Gabriel Roschini|Roschini]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|535}}

===Paul VI===

[[Pope Paul VI]] (1963–1978) made  extensive contributions to [[mariology]] (theological teaching and devotions) during his pontificate. He attempted to present the  Marian teachings  of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. In his inaugural encyclical ''Ecclesiam Suam'' (section below), the Pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. He regards “devotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel.”&lt;ref name="Ecclesiam Suam 58"&gt;Ecclesiam Suam 58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he writes that the Queen of Heaven is entrusted by God, as administrator of his compassion&lt;ref name="Mense Majo, 1965, 2"&gt;Mense Majo, 1965, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 encyclical ''Mense maio'' he described Mary as the way to Christ, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ likewise.&lt;ref name="Mense maio, 2"&gt;''Mense maio'', 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1966 encyclical ''[[Christi Matri]]'', he recommends the [[rosary]] in light of the  [[Vietnam War]] and the dangers of atomic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam War era: people and perspectives'' by Mitchell K. Hall 2009 {{ISBN|1-59884-129-7}} page 106&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended prayers to [[Queen of Peace]] and [[Mother of the Church]]:

* Nothing seems more appropriate and valuable  than to have the prayers of the whole Christian family rise to the Mother of God, who is invoked as the Queen of Peace, begging her to pour forth abundant gifts of her maternal goodness in midst of so many great trials and hardships. We want constant and devout prayers to be offered to her whom We declared Mother of the Church, its spiritual parent, during the celebration of the Second Vatican Council,&lt;ref name="Christi Matri 8"&gt;Christi Matri 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul VI taught that the rosary is a summary of gospel teachings.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}}  His new [[Missal]] includes all new Marian prayers. And in his 1974 exhortation [[Marialis Cultus]], he again promotes Marian devotions, highlighting the [[Angelus]] and [[Rosary]] prayers. Mary deserves the devotions because she is the mother of [[divine grace|grace]]s and because of her unique role in [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

On the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]] in [[Our Lady of Fatima|Fatima]], Paul VI made a pilgrimage there, the first ever by a Pope.  There, he linked the veneration of Mary to her role in the salvation of the human race&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}} ''Pope Paul VI was an engaged and engaging devotee of the Virgin Mary''&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

The Mariology of Pope Paul VI made extensive contributions to [[mariology|mariological]] teaching and devotions during his pontificate.

====Ecumenical orientation of Mariology====
He attempted to present the  Marian teachings  of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. In his inaugural encyclical ''Ecclesiam Suam'' (section below), the Pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. He regards “devotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel.”&lt;ref name="Ecclesiam Suam 58"/&gt;

====''Mense maio''====
The encyclical ''[[Mense maio]]'' from 29 April 1965 focused on the Virgin Mary, to whom traditionally  the  month of May is dedicated as the Mother of God. Paul VI writes that Mary is rightly to be regarded as the way by which people are led to Christ. Therefore, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''Mense maio'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he writes that the Queen of Heaven is entrusted by God, as administrator of his compassion&lt;ref name="Mense Majo, 1965, 2"/&gt; In his 1965 encyclical ''Mense maio'', he described Mary as the way  to Christ, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ likewise.&lt;ref name="Mense maio, 2"/&gt;

====''Christi Matri''====
In his 1966 [[encyclical]] ''[[Christi Matri]]'', he recommends the [[rosary]] in light of the [[Vietnam War]] and the dangers of atomic conflicts. The [[Queen of Peace]] and [[Mother of the Church]]  should be invoked:

{{quote|Nothing seems more appropriate and valuable  than to have the prayers of the whole Christian family rise to the Mother of God, who is invoked as the Queen of Peace, begging her to pour forth abundant gifts of her maternal goodness in midst of so many great trials and hardships.

====Role of the Rosary====
The rosary is a summary of gospel teaching.&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}} His new [[Missal]] includes all new Marian prayers. And in his 1974 exhortation [[Marialis Cultus]], he again promotes Marian devotions, highlighting the [[Angelus]] and [[Rosary]] prayers.

====Pilgrimage to Fatima====

There, he linked the veneration of Mary to her role in the salvation of the human race&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}} ''Pope Paul VI was a engaged and engaging devotee of the Virgin Mary''&lt;ref name="Bäumer"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

===John Paul II===
[[File:Pope John Paul II 11 06 1987 01edited.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Pope John Paul II]] made more Marian pilgrimages than any of his predecessors, stating: ''It is precisely in this pilgrimage through space and time, and even more through the history of souls, that Mary is present, sharing unlike any other creature in the mystery of Christ.''&lt;ref&gt;''Mary's Pope: John Paul II, Mary, and the Church Since Vatican II'' by Antoine Nachef 2000 {{ISBN|1-58051-077-9}} page 85&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ancient title ''Mary Mother of the Church'' was proclaimed then by [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In 1987, [[Pope John Paul II]] repeated this title  ''Mother of the Church'' in his encyclical ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]'' and at a general audience on September 17, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm63.htm Blessed Virgin Is Mother Of The Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclical is a long and eloquent summary of modern Mariology, making some novel points. According to John Paul, the Mother of the Redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation.

:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Church teaches that Mary appeared on the horizon of salvation history before Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Redemptoris Mater 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:&lt;blockquote&gt;If the greeting and the name "full of grace" say all this, in the context of the angel's announcement they refer first of all to the election of Mary as Mother of the Son of God. But at the same time the "fullness of grace" indicates all the supernatural munificence from which Mary benefits by being chosen and destined to be the Mother of Christ. If this election is fundamental for the accomplishment of God's salvific designs for humanity, and if the eternal choice in Christ and the vocation to the dignity of adopted children is the destiny of everyone, then the election of Mary is wholly exceptional and unique. Hence also the singularity and uniqueness of her place in the mystery of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Redemptoris Mater 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2002 [[apostolic letter]] ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]'' of [[Pope John Paul II]] on the [[Rosary]] further communicated his Marian focus as he explained how his personal motto "[[Totus Tuus]]" was inspired by St. [[Louis de Montfort]]'s doctrine on the excellence of [[Mariology|Marian devotion]] and total consecration. The Pope truly venerated the Virgin Mary, as expressed in this motto Totus Tuus.

In recent years, to emphasize the role of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church, in ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]'', [[Pope John Paul II]] quoted Saint [[Louis de Montfort]], and said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Our entire perfection consists in being conformed, united and consecrated to Jesus Christ. Hence the most perfect of all devotions is undoubtedly that which conforms, unites and consecrates us most perfectly to Jesus Christ. Now, since Mary is of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ, it follows that among all devotions that which most consecrates and conforms a soul to our Lord is devotion to Mary, his Holy Mother, and that the more a soul is consecrated to her the more will it be consecrated to Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]]'s Apostolic Letter ''Rosarium Virginis Mariae'' http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:John paul 2 coa.svg|thumb|140px|[[John Paul II]] Coat of arms with a [[Marian Cross]]]]As the pontiff observed, Saint [[Louis de Montfort]]'s approach to Mariology as presented in [[God Alone]] presents the logic of how an initially Christ centric view leads to total consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis de Montfort, ''God Alone: The Collected Writings of St. Louis Marie De Montfort'', Montfort Publications, 1995 {{ISBN|0-910984-55-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction of the Catholic Church during the last part of the 20th century was dominated by the views of [[Pope John Paul II]], whose perspective had a very strong Marian emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;''Mary's pope: John Paul II, Mary, and the church since Vatican II'' by Antoine Nachef 2000 {{ISBN|1-58051-077-9}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Vision of John Paul II: Assessing His Thought and Influence'' by Gerard Mannion 2008 {{ISBN|0-8146-5309-X}} pages 1 and 62&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated "Total Consecration to Mary" more than any of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=Miravalle164 &gt;Miravalle, Mark Introduction to Mary 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}}, pp 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; And he deliberately reflected his Marian views within the design of his [[coat of arms]] by using a [[Marian Cross]]. According to the [[L’Osservatore Romano]], the use of the Marian Cross on his coat of arms was a departure from traditional [[heraldry]] models and was intended to emphasize the presence of the Virgin Mary under the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Cross in Calvary]] and her special participation in the process of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;[[L’Osservatore Romano]], November 9, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/insigne/sp_ss_scv_stemma-bandiera-sigillo_en.html#Stemma%20di%20Sua%20Santità%20Giovanni%20Paolo%20II |title=Coat of Arms of His Holiness John Paul II (Vatican Press Office) |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope John Paul II issued a number of [[Marian papal encyclicals and Apostolic Letters|Marian encyclicals]] that shaped the Catholic views on Mary during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Miravalle164 /&gt;

Pope [[Benedict XVI]] continued the program of Pope [[John Paul II]] for a redirection of the whole Church to ensure an authentic approach to Christology via a return to the "whole truth about Mary".&lt;ref name=BurkeMariology&gt;Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). ''Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons'' {{ISBN|978-1-57918-355-4}} page xxi&lt;/ref&gt; As Cardinal Ratzinger, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is necessary to go back to Mary if we want to return to that "truth about Jesus Christ," "truth about the Church" and "truth about man".&lt;ref name="BurkeMariology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pope Francis===
In a homily, Francis compared Mary at the foot of the Cross with the mothers of prisoners he had met in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;en.radiovaticana.va 15/09/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''maternal bond''' is the [[personal relationship|relationship]] between a  [[mother]] and her child. While typically associated with [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]], a maternal bond may also develop in cases where the child is unrelated, such as an [[adoption]].

Both physical and emotional factors influence the mother-child [[Human bonding|bonding]] process. In [[separation anxiety disorder]] a child becomes fearful and nervous when away from a loved one, usually a parent or other caregiver. New mothers do not always experience instant love toward their child. Instead, the bond can strengthen over time. Bonds can take hours, days, weeks, or months to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jiří |last1=Winkler  |year=2000 |title=Utváření mateřského pouta v těhotenství |trans-title=Development of the maternal bond during pregnancy |language=Czech |journal=Časopis Lékařů Českých |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |pmid=10750284 |url=http://www.muni.cz/research/publications/314151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pregnancy==
The maternal bond between a [[woman]] and her biological child usually begins to develop during [[pregnancy]]. The pregnant female adapts her [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] to suit the needs of the developing [[infant]]. At around 18 to 25 weeks, the mother begins to feel the fetus moving. Similar to seeing her child for the first time in an [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasound scan]], this experience typically leads the mother to feel more attached to her child.

The developing fetus has some awareness of the mother's heartbeat and voice and has the ability to respond to touch or movement. By the seventh month of pregnancy, two-thirds of women report a strong maternal bond with their unborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Winkler J |title=[Development of the maternal bond during pregnancy] |language=Czech |journal=Cas. Lek. Cesk. |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10750284 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothers who [[unintended pregnancy|did not want the pregnancy]] typically do not have a close relationship with the child.&lt;ref name=HP2020FP&gt;{{cite web | title = Family Planning – Healthy People 2020 | url = http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=13 | accessdate = 2011-08-18 | quote = Which cites: }}

&lt;/ref&gt;  They are more likely to suffer from [[post-partum depression]] or other mental health problems and less likely to breast feed.&lt;ref name=HP2020FP/&gt;

==Childbirth==
[[Childbirth]] is an experience that can strengthen the mother and child bond. Factors such as a traumatic birth, the mother's childhood, medical stress, lack of support and the influence of a spouse or partner can weaken the bond.

Emotional ''bonding theory'' first appeared in the mid-1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spinner|first1=Miriam R.|title=Maternal-Infant Bonding|journal=Can Fam Physician|date=November 1978|volume=24|pages=1151–3|pmc=2379718|pmid=21301556}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1980s had become an accepted phenomenon. Soon, the process became analyzed and scrutinized to the point of creating another term – ''poor bonding''.

==Oxytocin==
Production of [[oxytocin]] during childbirth and [[lactation]] increases [[parasympathetic]] activity. Thus, [[anxiety]] is theoretically reduced. Maternal oxytocin circulation is said to predispose women to bond and show bonding behavior,&lt;ref name=Chi2012&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chiras | first1 = Daniel D. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Human Biology | date = 2012 | publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning | location = Sudbury, MA | isbn = 978-0-7637-8345-7 | page = 262 | edition = 7th | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=mqlY1n8Ez1oC&amp;pg=PA262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Human Evolutionary Biology | date = 2010 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-1-139-78900-4 | page = 282 | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=3NRf_8gwmO8C&amp;pg=PA282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fillod | first = Odile | contribution = Oxytocin as proximal cause of 'maternal instinct': weak science, post-feminism, and the hormones of mystique | editor-last1 = Schmitz | editor-first1 = Sigrid | editor-last2 = Höppner | editor-first2 = Grit |editor-link1=Sigrid Schmitz| title = Gendered neurocultures: feminist and queer perspectives on current brain discourses| publisher = Zaglossus | location = Wien | year = 2014 | isbn = 9783902902122 | series = challenge GENDER, 2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Breastfeeding]] is also strongly believed to foster the bond, via touch, response and mutual gazing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3749/is_200310/ai_n9302754 | title = Breastfeeding, bonding, and the mother-infant relationship | publisher = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | last = Else-Quest | first = NM | author2 = Hyde JS; Clark, R | date = 2003-10-01 | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral side effects===
A 2014 study claimed that [[oxytocin]] promotes dishonesty when the outcome favors the closely bonded groups to which an individual belongs.  A real-world example of this effect can be seen when parents [[Address fraud|lie about their address]] to gain admission to better schools for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shalvia | first1 = S. | last2 = De Dreu | first2 = C. K. W. | title = Oxytocin promotes group-serving dishonesty | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | volume = 111 | number = 15 | pages = 5503–5507 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400724111 | layurl = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26771703 | laysource = BBC News | laydate = 2 April 2014 | pmid=24706799 | date=Apr 2014 | pmc=3992689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maternal separation anxiety==
Beginning at 9–10 months of age when infants begin to crawl and then when they begin to walk around 12 months of age, they begin to develop capacities to physically explore the world away from their mother.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer HR (2004). Introducing Child Psychology. Oxford: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0-631-21627-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These capacities bring with them separation anxiety as the infant becomes more vulnerable away from mother.  This newly acquired motor development parallels infants' intellectual curiosity, cognitive and language development as they begin to point and name, and jointly attend with mothers to their environment beginning by 9–10 months.  Most parents welcome these explorations and this increased independence. However, in the context of maternal depression, trauma or disturbed bonding in her own early life, some mothers have significant difficulty in tolerating the exploration and-or the infant's anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Pelaez M, Virues-Ortega J, Field TM, Amir-Kisei Y, Schnerch G (2013). Social referencing in infants of mothers with symptoms of depression. Infant Behav Dev, 36(4): 548-56. doi : 0.1016/j.infbeh.2013.05.003. Epub 2013 Jun 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

This anxiety increases when infants and toddlers feel threatened or socially reference their mothers for reassurance. Research claimed out that mothers, for example, with histories of violence-exposure and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]] show less activity in the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], a brain area that helps to temper and contextualize fear responses, and thus are likely unable to extinguish their own fear response upon watching a videotaped mother-toddler separation scene in a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] scanner.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Moser DA, Paoloni-Giacobino A, Stenz A, Gex-Fabry M, Aue T, Adouan W, Cordero MI, Suardi F, Manini A, Sancho Rossignol A, Merminod G, Ansermet F, Dayer AG, Rusconi Serpa S (epub May 29, 2015).

Inevitably, children who have rarely been separated from their mother become anxious when separated for extended periods. This is most commonly experienced when starting to attend school. Every child suffers to some extent.

Later in life, this anxiety can reoccur if mothers have to leave their family unit to work. In both cases, the child's anxiety (and that of the parents) can be reduced by priming, i.e. preparing the child for the experience prior to its occurrence and by creating and maintaining dialogue and connection between the absent parent and child during the separation.

The Japanese and Korean term '''''mu''''' ({{CJKV|j=無|k=무}}) or Chinese '''''wu''''' ({{CJKV|t=無|s=无}}), meaning "not have; without", is a key word in [[Buddhism]], especially [[Zen]] traditions.

==The word==
The Chinese word ''wú'' 無 "not; nothing" was borrowed by [[East Asian languages]], particularly the [[Sino-Xenic]] "CJKV" languages of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese.

===Pronunciations===
The [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation ''wú'' historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] ''mju'', (c. 3rd century CE) Late Han Chinese ''muɑ'', and reconstructed (c. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]] *''ma''.&lt;ref name="Schuessler"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Schuessler|first=Axel|authorlink=Axel Schuessler|title=ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIvqAC7FNBQC|year=2007|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2975-9}}, p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[varieties of Chinese]] have differing pronunciations of {{zh|c=無}}. Compare [[Cantonese]] ''mou4''; and [[Southern Min]] {{IPA-all|bo˧˥}} ([[Quanzhou]]) and {{IPA-all|bə˧˥}} ([[Zhangzhou]]).

The common Chinese word ''wú'' 無 was adopted in the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]], and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] vocabularies. The Japanese ''[[kanji]]'' 無 has ''[[Kanji#On'yomi|on'yomi]]'' readings of ''mu'' or ''bu'', and a ''[[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi]]'' (Japanese reading) of ''na''. The Korean ''[[hanja]]'' 無 is read ''mu'' (in [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised]], [[McCune–Reischauer]], and [[Yale romanization of Korean|Yale]] romanization systems). The Vietnamese [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Hán-Việt]] pronunciation is ''vô'' or ''mô''.

===Meanings===
Some English translation equivalents of ''wú'' or ''mu'' 無 are:
*"no", "not", "nothing", or "without"&lt;ref name="baroni"&gt;Baroni, Helen Josephine. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;ots=ZKAxX8v0ho&amp;dq=joshu%20dog%20rinzai&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=joshu%20dog%20rinzai&amp;f=false The illustrated encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism]'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;
*nothing, not, nothingness, un-, is not, has not, not any&lt;ref name="shambhala"&gt;Fischer-Schreiber, I., Ehrhard, R. K. &amp; Diener, M. S. (1991). ''The Shambhala dictionary of Buddhism and Zen'' (M. H. Kohn, Trans.). Boston: Shambhala. P. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[1] Nonexistence; nonbeing; not having; a lack of, without. [2] A negative. [3] Caused to be nonexistent. [4] Impossible; lacking reason or cause. [5] Pure human awareness, prior to experience or knowledge. This meaning is used especially by the Chan school. [6] The 'original nonbeing' from which being is produced in the ''Daode jing''.&lt;ref name="無"&gt;[http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?71.xml+id('b7121') Muller, A. Charles, ed. ''Digital Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Edition of 2010 July 31) page: "''non-existent''"]. Note this quoted definition is abridged.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean it is commonly used in combination words as a prefix to indicate the absence of something, e.g., {{zh|c=无线|p=wúxiàn}} / {{Nihongo||無線|musen}} / ''museon'' (무선 ) for "wireless".&lt;ref&gt;[[WWWJDIC]]: 無; 无 【む】 (n) (1) nothing; naught; nought; nil; zero; (pref) (2) un-; non-&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Classical Chinese]], it is an [[impersonal verb|impersonal existential verb]] meaning "not have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outline of classical Chinese grammar |last=Pulleyblank |first=E.G. |authorlink=Edwin G. Pulleyblank |year=1995 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0541-4 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same character is also used in Classical Chinese as a [[imperative mood|prohibitive]] [[grammatical particle|particle]], though in this case it is more properly written {{zh|c=毋|p=wú}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outline of classical Chinese grammar |last=Pulleyblank |first=E.G. |authorlink=Edwin G. Pulleyblank |year=1995 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0541-4 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Old Chinese *''ma'' 無 is [[cognate]] with the [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|Proto-Tibeto-Burman]] *''ma'' "not". This reconstructed root is widely represented in [[Tibeto-Burman languages]]; for instance, ''ma'' means "not" in both Written Tibetan and Written Burmese.&lt;ref&gt;Schuesler, p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
In traditional [[Chinese character classification]], the uncommon class of [[Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|phonetic loan characters]] involved borrowing the character for one word to write another near-[[homophone]]. For instance, the character 其 originally depicted a ''ji'' "winnowing basket", and scribes used it as a graphic loan for ''qi'' 其 "his; her; its", which resulted in a new character ''ji'' 箕 (clarified with the [[Radical 118|bamboo radical]] ⺮) to specify the basket.

The character ''wu'' [[wikt:無|無]] originally meant "dance" and was later used as a graphic loan for ''wu'' "not". The earliest graphs for 無 pictured a person with outstretched arms holding something (possibly sleeves, tassels, ornaments) and represented the word ''wu'' "dance; dancer". After ''wu'' 無 "dance" was borrowed as a loan for ''wu'' "not; without", the original meaning was elucidated with the 舛 "[[Radical 136|opposite feet]]" at the bottom of ''wu'' [[wikt:舞|舞]] "dance".

==The Mu-koan==
''[[The Gateless Gate]]'', which is a 13th-century collection of Chan or Zen [[kōan]]s,  uses the word ''wu'' or ''mu'' in its title (''Wumenguan'' or ''Mumonkan'' 無門關) and first kōan case ("Zhao Zhou's Dog" 趙州狗子). Chinese Chan calls the word ''mu'' 無 "the gate to enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;Muller.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese [[Rinzai school]] classifies the Mu Kōan as ''hosshin'' [[wikt:発心|発心]] "resolve to attain enlightenment", that is, appropriate for beginners seeking ''[[kenshō]]'' "to see the Buddha-nature"'.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Case 1 of ''The Gateless Gate'' reads as follows:

|-

|-
| 趙州和尚、因僧問、狗子還有佛性也無。州云、無。
| A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen]], a Chinese Zen master (known as ''Jōshū'' in Japanese), "Has a dog [[Buddha-nature]] or not?"

The ''[[Book of Equanimity|Book of Serenity]]'' {{zh|c=從容録 |p=cóngrónglù}}, also known as the ''Book of Equanimity'' or more formally the ''Hóngzhì Chánshī Guǎnglù'' {{zh|c=宏智禪師廣錄}}, has a longer version of this koan, which adds the following to the start of the version given in the ''Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu''.

|}

===Origins===
In the original text, the question is used as a conventional beginning to a question-and-answer exchange ([[mondo (scripture)|mondo]]). The reference is to the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sitting with Koans: essential writings on Zen Koan introspection |last=Loori |first=J.D. |authorlink=John Daido Loori |year=2005 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=Somerville, MA |isbn=978-0-86171-369-1 |page=266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which says for example:
{{quote|In this light, the undisclosed store of the [[Tathāgata|Tathagata]] is proclaimed: "All beings have the Buddha-Nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webzoom.freewebs.com/nirvana-sutra/convenient/complete-sutra.html |title=Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Chapter 18 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Koan 363 in the ''Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu'' shares the same beginning question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Green |first=James, ed. and trans. |title=The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Joshu |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman Altamira |year=1998 |ISBN=978-0-7619-8985-1 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
This koan is one of several traditionally used by [[Rinzai school]] to initiate students into Zen study,&lt;ref name="baroni"/&gt; and interpretations of it vary widely.

[[Hakuun Yasutani]] of the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] maintained that
{{quote|The koan is not about whether a dog does or does not have a Buddha-nature because everything is Buddha-nature, and either a positive or negative answer is absurd because there is no particular thing called Buddha-nature.&lt;ref&gt;Grenard, Jerry L. "The Phenomenology of Koan Meditation in Zen Buddhism". ''Journal of Phenomenological Psychology'' 39 (2008) 151–188.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====One-sided interpretation====
The Japanese scholar [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki#Her research team in Kyoto|Iriya Yoshitaka]] made the following comment on the two versions of the koan:
{{quote|I have held doubts for some time even with regard to the way the so-called "Chao-chou's Word No" has been previously dealt with. To the question "Does a dog have the Buddha-nature?", on the one hand Monk Chao-chou replied affirmatively, but on the other hand he replied negatively. However, Zen adherents in Japan have rendered the koan exclusively in terms of his negative response, and completely ignored the affirmative one. Moreover, it has been the custom from the outset to reject the affirmative response as superficial compared to the negative one. It seems that the ''[[The Gateless Gate|Wu-men kuan]]'' is responsible for this peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Zen canon: understanding the classic texts |last=Heine |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Heine |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-19-515067-4 |page=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar critique has been given by Steven Heine:
{{quote|The common approach espoused [...] emphasizes a particular understanding of the role of the koan based on the “head-word” or “critical phrase” method developed by the prominent twelfth century Chinese master, [[Dahui Zonggao|Daie]]. This approach takes the “Mu” response in a non-literal way to express a transcendental negation that becomes the topic of an intensive contemplative experience, during which any and all thoughts or uses of reason and words are to be cut off and discarded for good rather than investigated for their expressive nuances and ramifications. Yet, historical studies demonstrate quite persuasively that an overemphasis on this single approach to one version of the kōan is somewhat misleading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oup.com/2012/04/four-myths-about-zen-buddhisms-mu-koan/ Steven Heine, ''Four myths about Zen Buddhism’s “Mu Koan”'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===="Unasking" the question====
The term is often used or translated to mean that the question itself must be "unasked": no answer can exist in the terms provided. Zhaozhou's answer, which literally means that dogs do not have Buddha nature, has been interpreted by [[Robert M. Pirsig|Robert Pirsig]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] to mean that such categorical thinking is a [[delusion]], that yes and no are both correct and incorrect.

==In popular culture==

In [[Robert M. Pirsig]]'s 1974 novel ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', ''mu'' is translated as "no thing", saying that it meant "unask the question". He offered the example of a [[electronic circuit|computer circuit]] using the [[binary numeral system]], in effect using ''mu'' to represent [[high impedance]]:
{{quote|For example, it's stated over and over again that computer circuits exhibit only two states, a voltage for "one" and a voltage for "zero." That's silly! Any computer-electronics technician knows otherwise. Try to find a voltage representing one or zero when the power is off! The circuits are in a ''mu'' state.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pirsig |first=Robert M. |authorlink=Robert M. Pirsig |title=Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values |location=New York
|publisher=Harper Perennial |id=First Perennial Classics edition |year=2000 |ISBN=0-06-095832-4 |page=328 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word features prominently with a similar meaning in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s 1979 book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''. It is used fancifully in discussions of [[First-order logic|symbolic logic]], particularly [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], to indicate a question whose "answer" is to
* un-ask the question,
* indicate the question is fundamentally flawed, or
* reject the premise that a [[non-dual|dualistic]] answer can or will be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hofstadter| first1 = Douglas R.  | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid  | publisher = Basic Books  | year = 1999  | origyear= 1979  | isbn = 0-465-02656-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mu" may be used similarly to "[[wikt:N/A|N/A]]" or "not applicable," a term often used to indicate the question cannot be answered because the conditions of the question do not match the reality. A layperson's example of this concept is often invoked by the [[loaded question]] "Have you stopped beating your wife?",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dstZTHdMn8U NBA Commish David Stern to Jim Rome "Do you still beat your wife?" – YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to which "mu" would be the only respectable response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/mu.html | title=mu | work=The New Hackers' Dictionary (Jargon File) | last=Raymond | first=Eric S. | authorlink=Eric S. Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this meaning, programming language [[Perl 6]] uses "Mu" for the root of its type hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.perl6.org/type/Mu class Mu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Japanese manga series, ''[[Death Note]]'', ends in a thematic conclusion which contains MU's usage as "not applicable": "All humans, without exception, will eventually die. The place they go after is '''MU''' ('''無''', Nothingness)".&lt;ref name="deathnote1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 12|year=2007|page=188|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-1327-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tsugumi Ohba]], the writer of ''Death Note'', explained in the postmortem follow-up volume that the meaning behind "MU after death" was that "the dead person should never come back to life, and it's cheating to revive dead characters as manga. So it became MU". Ohba further explained that "all humans die someday, and when we die, we can never come back to life, so let's do our best while we are at it" was the single most important theme Ohba wanted to express in writing the series.&lt;ref name="deathnote2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=68|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nguyễn Công Trứ''' (阮公著) also '''Hi Văn''' (Uy Viễn, [[Hà Tĩnh]] 1778–1858) was a Vietnamese poet and scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Woodside ''Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Comparative Study of Nguyen and Ch'ing Civil Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century. '' Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1971 - Page 217 "Nguyễn Công Trứ, the powerful official and famous poet of the Minh Mạng, Thiệu Trị, and early Tự Đức periods, has been accused by modern Vietnamese scholars of having had a "superiority complex" because of his family background.116 ...But after 1802, "mounting the elephant" (lên voi) in official life was difficult and ... Forced to battle for recognition on his own in the examination system, Trứ entered the 1813 examinations and was able to win merely the status of a licentiate."&lt;/ref&gt;

He came up against a lot of obstacles in academic field in which he was really successful only when he reached the age of 42. Nguyễn Công Trứ held a respectable position in military as a General. Nguyễn Công Trứ was a poet contributing to Vietnamese declamation’s foundation, namely the poem “Bài ca ngất ngưởng”

Nguyễn Công Trứ earned respect as a devoted Confucian scholar and elder statesman. While living in a corrupt [[Feudalism|feudal system]], Nguyễn Công Trứ was known to be honest and straightforward.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Nguyễn Công Trứ dedicated nearly all his life to his country and the welfare of its citizens. After his retirement, Nguyễn Công Trứ lived the rest of his life in his hometown and gave a hand with the restoration of pagodas and gave lectures in [[Buddhism]]’s belief.
He died 7 December 1858. At Nguyễn Công Trứ’s funeral came King [[Tự Đức]] as well as distinguished mourners.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Life==
Nguyễn Công Trứ was born into a poor family. But with diligence, Nguyễn Công Trứ graduated from high school in 1813 and came first in interprovincial Laureate contest in 1819.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Then, Nguyễn Công Trứ led a varied life as a mandarin in [[Nguyễn Dynasty]]. He held the highest position as Hai An’s Minister and [[Defence minister|Minister of Defence]] in 1836 ([[Quảng Ngãi Province]] with [[Hai Duong]] is Hai An in the past). In 1845, Nguyễn Công Trứ was demoted as a border guard.

When he was an officer in charge of farms (a General takes on agriculture owing to being ordered by the King), Nguyễn Công Trứ broke fresh ground to bring farmers 45.990 acres of enriched rice fields. [[Kim Son]] and Tien Hai were the most enriched ones. To give credit for his distinguished [[civil service]]s, the residents set up Nguyễn Công Trứ’s shrines. One is now in Tien Hai (founded in 1852) and the other is in Kim Son (founded in 1856). The king gave him valuables such as hundreds of ingots of silver, an agate sculpture of horse, a gong bearing a golden inscription “Lao năng khả tưởng” (the meaning: his credits and devotion to duty deserves rewarding).

Because Nguyễn Công Trứ was a righteous, honest and straightforward mandarin, many a dishonest official had an aversion to such individuality of his. Nguyễn Công Trứ was slandered 3 times, however, luckily enough, everything was brought to light and he was completely vindicated then. Furthermore, in the event of Kim Son’s and Tien Hai’s bumper crops, the residents invited the 75-year-old mandarin to join the harvest festival as a red-carpet treatment, and dishonest officials vilified him a rebel leader in Kim Son and Tien Hai but then he succeeded in justifying himself to King Tự Đức. Understandably, Nguyễn Công Trứ took the honor and dishonor for granted.

==Life as a poet and activist==
His poems, which have mostly been written in pictographic script of Vietnamese, show deep feeling. Some findings have shown that Nguyễn Công Trứ had over 1000 poems mainly of Tang prosody and declamation style of Vietnam. The majority of them is now missing. Approximately 150 of his works remain today. What people find remarkable for Nguyễn Công Trứ’s poems is the [[individualism]], which is truly of the freedom and the independence. Nguyễn Công Trứ made contributed to the growth of medieval [[Vietnamese literature]] as well as the variation of this language on the grounds that his works are mainly composed in pictographic script of Vietnamese.

The conception of morality in [[Medieval life|medieval society]] is '''“Lap duc- Lap cong- Lap ngon”''' ''(Lập đức–Lập công - Lập ngôn)'', which Nguyễn Công Trứ strove for. “Lap duc”, according to the feudal intelligentsia, is devoting to bring about the country’s prospect and the [[Quality of life|well-being]] of its citizens. “Lap cong” bears the meaning of fulfilling the missions assigned by the King. “Lap ngon” is to make a significant contribution to the arts.

Nguyễn Công Trứ led a full and varied life insofar as he was once promoted to the rank of General, but then demoted to the lowest rank as a [[border guard]]. Nguyễn Công Trứ experienced many ups and downs in his life and career Furthermore, Nguyễn Công Trứ earned a lot of respect as a devoted Confucian scholar and experienced statesman. Nguyễn Công Trứ dedicated nearly all his life to his country and the welfare of its citizens. After his retirement, Nguyễn Công Trứ lived the rest of his life in his hometown and gave a hand with the restoration of pagodas and gave lectures in Buddhism’s beliefs.

When French colonists invaded [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]] in 1858, Nguyễn Công Trứ was one of feudal intellectuals bravely fighting against the enemy’s deployment. Besides, he went unhesitatingly: “Should I be at my last gasp, I will fight tooth and nail for the country’s freedom and independence.” Nguyễn Công Trứ died on 7 December 1858. At Nguyễn Công Trứ’s funeral came King Tự Đức as well as distinguished mourners and The King himself gave the late statesman parallel sentences as an offering “tả hữu nghi văn nghi võ- tử sinh danh tướng, danh thần”. They bear the meaning of complimenting Nguyễn Công Trứ on his great talent for not only literature but also martial arts.

Many poems of Nguyễn Công Trứ’s is on Vietnamese high school curriculum, namely “BÀI CA NGẤT NGƯỞNG” and “NỢ NAM NHI”. [[Nguyễn Công Trứ High School]] was named after Nguyen Cong Tru in 1992.

'''''Non bis in idem''''', which translates literally from [[Latin]] as "not twice in the same [thing]", is a legal doctrine to the effect that no legal action can be instituted twice for the same cause of action. It is a legal concept originating in [[Roman law|Roman civil law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=W.W.|title=A Text-book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian|edition=3|date=1963|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge UP| pages=695–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is essentially the equivalent of the [[double jeopardy]] (''autrefois acquit'') doctrine found in [[common law]] jurisdictions.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] guarantees the right to be free from double jeopardy; however, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns&lt;ref&gt;For example, see A.P. v Italy, UN HRC CCPR/C/31/D/204/1986&lt;/ref&gt; (unless the relevant [[extradition treaty]] expresses a prohibition). The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] creates a different form of ''non bis in idem''.

==  Rome Statute and ''ad hoc'' UN tribunals ==

The [[Rome Statute]] establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) states that the ''non bis in idem'' principle has a peculiar meaning, especially in comparison to European supranational law. The ICC jurisdiction is complementary to national law, and Article 20 of the Rome Statute specifies that even if the principle remains in general terms, it cannot be taken in consideration if there is unwillingness or incapability of the existence of the supranational court's jurisdiction.
Article 10 of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] Statute and Article 9 of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|ICTR]] Statute both state that the principle can be enforced mainly to clarify that the ''ad hoc'' tribunal's sentences are "stronger" than the ones in domestic courts.

In other words, national courts cannot proceed against the responsible parties of crimes within the tribunal's jurisdiction if the international tribunal has already pronounced sentence for the same crimes.  However, the ICTY and the ICTR can judge alleged criminals already sentenced by national courts if both of the following occur:
*the sentence defined the crimes as "ordinary".
*the judiciary of the state is not considered impartial or the domestic trial is considered to be a pretense to protect the accused from the legal action of international justice or is considered to be unfair on some fundamental legal basis.

He studied at the [[London School of Economics]] and [[Harvard University]]. In 1967 he joined the Politics Department at Hull University. In 1992 he was given a personal chair in political philosophy at Hull.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/politics/staff/prof-noel-osullivan.aspx Profile] at The University of Hull website&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book on [[conservatism]] O'Sullivan argued that "No single unifying idea is to be found in the English conservative tradition, except perhaps a certain scepticism and a pragmatic emphasis".&lt;ref&gt;Noël O'Sullivan, ''Conservatism'' (London: Littlehampton, 1976), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Sullivan argued that [[fascism]] was one example of the new revolutionary style of modern politics, of which [[communism]] was also a manifestation. He also argued that fascism was an extreme example of the "activist" style of politics, which he defined as one that substitutes ideology for law, subordinates individuals to an all-embracing political order, has no intrinsic respect for constitutional forms, and rejects the existence of historic frontiers as a relevant determinant of its scope. &lt;ref&gt; Noël O'Sullivan, Fascism (1983), p.37. &lt;/ref&gt; This style of politics owed much, O'Sullivan claimed, to [[millenarianism]] and [[civic humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wilkinson, ‘Review: Fascism by Noel O'Sullivan’, ''International Affairs'', Vol. 60, No. 3 (Summer, 1984), p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Felix Bourdieu''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ʊər|ˈ|d|j|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|buʁdjø|lang}}; 1 August 1930 – 23 January 2002) was a French [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Anthropology|anthropologist]],&lt;ref name=practice&gt;{{cite web |last=Bourdieu|first= P. |title=Outline of a Theory of Practice |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521291644}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosopher]], and public [[intellectual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Douglas Johnson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/28/guardianobituaries.books |title=Obituary: Pierre Bourdieu &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu's work was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society, and especially the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and social order maintained within and across generations.  In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy, his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of [[Practice (social theory)|practice]] and embodiment in social dynamics.  Building upon the theories of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], and [[Marcel Mauss]] (among others), his research pioneered novel investigative frameworks and methods, and introduced such influential concepts as [[cultural capital|cultural]], [[social capital|social]], and [[symbolic capital|symbolic]] forms of [[Catherine Hakim|capital]] (as opposed to traditional economic forms of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]), the [[cultural reproduction]], the [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]], the [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]] or location, and [[symbolic violence]].   Another notable influence on Bourdieu was [[Blaise Pascal]], after whom Bourdieu titled his ''Pascalian Meditations''.  Bourdieu's major contributions to the sociology of education, the theory of sociology, and sociology of aesthetics have achieved wide influence in several related academic fields (e.g. anthropology, media and cultural studies, education), popular culture, and the arts.

Bourdieu's best known book is ''[[Distinction (1979 book)|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]]'' (1979). The book was judged the sixth most important sociological work of the twentieth century by the International Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISA -  Books of the Century|url = http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/|website = www.isa-sociology.org|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Bourdieu argues that judgments of taste are related to social position, or more precisely, are themselves acts of social positioning.  His argument is put forward by an original combination of social theory and data from quantitative surveys, photographs and interviews, in an attempt to reconcile difficulties such as how to understand the subject within objective structures. In the process, he tried to reconcile the influences of both external social structures and subjective experience on the individual (see [[structure and agency]]).

==Life and career==
Bourdieu was born in [[Denguin]] ([[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]), in southern France, to a postal worker and his wife. The household spoke [[Béarnese dialect|Béarnese]], a [[Gascon language|Gascon]] dialect. Bourdieu married Marie-Claire Brizard in 1962; the couple had three sons, Jérôme, [[Emmanuel Bourdieu|Emmanuel]], and Laurent.

Bourdieu was educated at the lycée in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] before moving to the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in [[Paris]]. From there he gained entrance to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS), also in Paris, where he studied [[philosophy]] alongside [[Louis Althusser]]. After getting his [[agrégation]], Bourdieu worked as a lycée teacher at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] for a year before his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] into the French Army in 1955.

His biographers write that he chose not to enter the Reserve Officer's College like many of his fellow ENS graduates as he wished to stay with people from his own modest social background.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vmVJbr6_0AoC&amp;pg=PA36 |title= Jane Goodman, 'Bourdieu in Algeria' (2009) pp. 8-9 |publisher= Books.google.ie |date= |accessdate= 2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deployed to Algeria in October 1955 during its [[Algerian War|war of independence]] from France, he served in a unit guarding military installations before being transferred to [[Clerk|clerical work]].&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt;

After his year-long military service, Bourdieu stayed on as a lecturer in Algiers.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2002&gt;{{cite web|author= Douglas Johnson |url= https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,640396,00.html |title= '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39; obituary, Douglas Johnson 28 January 2002 |publisher= Guardian |date= |accessdate= 2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Algerian War]] in 1958–1962, Bourdieu undertook [[ethnographic]] [[research]] into the clash through a study of the [[Kabyle people]]s of the [[Berber people|Berbers]], laying the groundwork for his [[anthropological]] reputation. &lt;!--no cite for serving in army only cite for studies, so took it out--&gt;The result was his first book, ''Sociologie de l'Algérie'' (''The Sociology of Algeria'', 1958), which became an immediate success in France and was published in America in 1962. He later drew heavily on this fieldwork in his 1972 book ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'', a strong intervention into anthropological theory.&lt;ref name=practice/&gt;

In 1960 Bourdieu returned to the [[University of Paris]] before gaining a teaching position at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]], where he remained until 1964. From 1964 onwards Bourdieu held the position of Professor (Directeur d'études) in the VIe section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études (the future [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]]), and from 1981 the Chair of Sociology at the [[Collège de France]] (held before him by [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Maurice Halbwachs]]). In 1968, Bourdieu took over the Centre de Sociologie Européenne, founded by Aron, which he directed until his death.

In 1975, with the research group he had formed at the Centre de Sociologie Européenne, he launched the interdisciplinary journal ''[[Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales]]'', with which he sought to transform the accepted canons of sociological production while buttressing the scientific rigor of sociology. In 1993 he was honored with the "Médaille d'or du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique" ([[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]]). In 1996 he received the Goffman Prize from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and in 2001 the Huxley Medal of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]].&lt;ref name=TNYT2002&gt;{{cite web|author= Alan Riding |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/pierre-bourdieu-71-french-thinker-and-globalization-critic.html |title= '&amp;#39;The New York Times'&amp;#39; obituary, Alan Riding 25 January 2002 |publisher= Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate= 2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu died of cancer at the age of 71.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2002 /&gt;

==Influences==
Bourdieu's work is influenced by much of traditional anthropology and sociology which he undertook to synthesize into his own theory. From [[Max Weber]] he retained the importance of [[Dominant species (ecology)|domination]] and [[symbolic systems]] in social life, as well as the idea of [[social orders]] which would ultimately be transformed by Bourdieu from a sociology of religion into a theory of fields.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, A., Trzebiatowska, M. &amp; Brittain, C. (2011). 'Bourdieu, Capital and Conflict in a Religious Field: The Case of the Anglican Communion'. Journal of Contemporary Religion, vol 26, no. 3, pp. 355-370. {{cite web |url=https://pure.abdn.ac.uk:8443/ws/files/47350542/Religiousfields_author_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032241/https://pure.abdn.ac.uk:8443/ws/files/47350542/Religiousfields_author_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Marx]] he gained his understanding of 'society' as the ensemble of [[social relation]]ships: "what exist in the social world are relations – not interactions between agents or intersubjective ties between individuals, but objective relations which exist 'independently of individual consciousness and will'."&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and L.J.D. Wacquant. 1992. ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''. Chicago and London: Univ of Chicago Press. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; (grounded in the mode and conditions of economic production), and of the need to dialectically develop social theory from social practice.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu, P 1977"&gt;Bourdieu, P. 1977. ''Outline of a Theory of Practice''. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The class-based nature of artistic taste had already been firmly established by [[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] in ''The Social History of Art'' (1951).

From [[Émile Durkheim]], through [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], Bourdieu inherited a certain [[structuralism|structuralist]] interpretation of the tendency of [[social structures]] to reproduce themselves, based on the analysis of symbolic structures and forms of classification. However, Bourdieu critically diverged from Durkheim in emphasizing the role of the social ''agent'' in enacting, through the embodiment of social structures, symbolic orders. He furthermore emphasized that the [[social reproduction|reproduction of social structures]] does not operate according to a [[structural functionalism|functionalist]] logic.

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and, through him, the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] played an essential part in the formulation of Bourdieu's focus on the body, action, and practical dispositions (which found their primary manifestation in Bourdieu's theory of ''habitus'').&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Dermot, [http://hdl.handle.net/10197/3848  "Edmund Husserl's Phenomenology of Habituality and Habitus"], ''Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology'', 42 (1) 2011-01, pp. 53–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu was also influenced by [[Wittgenstein]] (especially with regard to his work on rule-following) stating that "Wittgenstein is probably the philosopher who has helped me most at moments of difficulty. He's a kind of saviour for times of great intellectual distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/perloff/ladder.html

Bourdieu's work is built upon an attempt to transcend a series of oppositions which he thought characterized the social sciences ([[subjectivism]]/[[Moral universalism|objectivism]], micro/macro, freedom/determinism) of his time. His concepts of habitus, capital, and field were conceived with the intention of overcoming such oppositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Richard|title=Pierre Bourdieu|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pierre_Bourdieu.html?id=aPVaHgUx1f0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a public intellectual==

During the 1990s Bourdieu became more and more involved in political debate, becoming one of the most important public faces of intellectual life in France. While a fierce critic of [[neoliberalism]], Bourdieu was also critical of the "total intellectual" role played by [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], and he dismissed Sartre's attempts to intervene in French politics as "irresponsible" and "opportunistic."&lt;ref name=Swartz2003&gt;Swartz, D., Special Issue on the Sociology of Symbolic power: A Special Issue in Memory of Pierre Bourdieu, ''Theory and Society,'' Volume 32, Issue 5/6, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu saw [[sociology]] not as a form of "intellectual entertainment" but as a serious discipline of a scientific nature. There is an apparent contradiction between Bourdieu's earlier writings against using sociology for [[political activism]] and his later launch into the role of a public intellectual, with some highly "visible political statements".&lt;ref name=Swartz2003/&gt; Although much of his early work stressed the importance of treating sociology as a strict scientific discipline (« ''La sociologie est un sport de combat'' » — "Sociology is a martial art"), his later career saw him enter the less academic world of political debate in France, raising the issue of whether the sociologist has political responsibilities extending to the public domain.

Although Bourdieu earlier faulted public intellectuals such as Sartre, he had strong political views which influenced his sociology from the beginning. By the time of his later work his main concern had become the effect of globalisation and those who benefited least from it. His politics then became more overt and his role as public intellectual was born, from an "urgency to speak out against neoliberal discourse that had become so dominant within political debate."&lt;ref name=Swartz2003/&gt; Bourdieu developed a project to investigate the effects — particularly the harm — of neoliberal reforms in France. The most significant fruit of this project was the 1993 study 'The Weight of the World,' although his views are perhaps more candidly expressed in his articles.&lt;ref&gt;collected for example in Bourdieu 'Political Interventions,' Verso 2008 or Bourdieu 'Sociology as a Martial Art,' The New Press 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 'The Weight of the World' represented a heavyweight scientific challenge to the dominant trends in French politics. Since it was the work of a team of sociologists, it also shows Bourdieu's collaborative character, indicating that he was still in 1993 reluctant to accept being singled out with the category (he deplored the term 'role'&lt;ref&gt;see Bourdieu, 'Thinking About Limits,' Theory, Culture &amp; Society vol. 9 no. 1 pp41-3, SAGE 1992&lt;/ref&gt;) of public intellectual. Nevertheless, Bourdieu's activities as a critical sociologist prepared him for the public stage, fulfilling his "constructionist view of social life" as it relied upon the idea of social actors making change through collective struggles. His relationship with the media was improved through his very public action of organizing strikes and rallies that raised huge media interest in him and his many books became more popular through this new notoriety. One of the main differences between the critical sociologist and public intellectual is the ability to have a relationship with popular media resources outside the academic realm.&lt;ref name=Fuller2005&gt;Fuller, S., ''The Intellectual'', Ikon Books, Cambridge, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that in his later writings Bourdieu sounded cautionary notes about such individuals, describing them as "like the Trojan Horse&lt;ref&gt;see Bourdieu, On Television and Journalism p.59, Pluto 1998&lt;/ref&gt; " for the unwanted elements they may bring to the academic world. Again Bourdieu seems wary of accepting the description 'public intellectual,' worrying that it might be difficult to reconcile with science and scholarship. Research is needed on what conditions transform particular intellectuals into public intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Swartz2003/&gt;

==Work==
Bourdieu routinely sought to connect his theoretical ideas with [[empirical]] research and his work can be seen as [[sociology of culture]] or, as he described it, a "Theory of Practice". His contributions to sociology were both evidential and theoretical (that is, calculated through both systems). His key terms were [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]], ''capital'' and [[field (Bourdieu)|field]].

He extended the idea of [[capital (economics)|capital]] to categories such as [[social capital]], [[cultural capital]], financial capital, and [[symbolic capital]]. For Bourdieu each individual occupies a position in a multidimensional ''social space''; he or she is not defined only by [[social class]] membership, but by every single kind of capital he or she can articulate through social relations. That capital includes the value of social networks, which Bourdieu showed could be used to produce or reproduce inequality.

Ultimately, each relatively autonomous field of modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex of social relations where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as a ''sense of the game'', a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often ''acknowledge'', ''legitimate'' and ''reproduce'' the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.

Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the subjective structures of the ''habitus'' can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains the continuity of the social order through time. As the individual ''habitus'' is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.

Some examples of his empirical results include showing that, despite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their [[social position]]; and showing that subtleties of language such as [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], [[grammar]], [[spelling]] and style – all part of cultural capital – are a major factor in [[social mobility]] (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-[[social status|status]] job).

Pierre Bourdieu's work emphasized how [[social class]]es, especially the ruling and intellectual classes, preserve their social privileges across generations despite the myth that contemporary [[post-industrial society]] boasts equality of opportunity and high [[social mobility]], achieved through formal education.

Bourdieu was an extraordinarily prolific author, producing hundreds of articles and three dozen books, nearly all of which are now available in English.

==Theory of class distinction==

Bourdieu developed theories of [[social stratification]] based on [[aesthetic]] taste in his 1979 work ''[[Distinction (1979 book)|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]]'' (in French, ''[[La Distinction]]''), published by Harvard University Press. Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one's social space to the world — one's aesthetic dispositions — depicts one's status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that children internalize these dispositions at an early age and that such dispositions guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the behaviors that are suitable for them, and foster an aversion towards other behaviors.

Bourdieu theorizes that '''class fractions''' teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social, economic, and [[cultural capital]]. Society incorporates “symbolic goods, especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence, [...as] the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction.”&lt;ref name=Distinction1984&gt;''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste'', Bourdieu 1979/1984 p 66&lt;/ref&gt; Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that “differences in [[cultural capital]] mark the differences between the classes.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of aesthetic dispositions are very largely determined by social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time.  The acquisition of [[cultural capital]] depends heavily on “total, early, imperceptible learning, performed within the family from the earliest days of life.”&lt;ref name=Distinction1984/&gt; Bourdieu argues that, in the main, people inherit their cultural attitudes, the accepted “definitions that their elders offer them.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 477&lt;/ref&gt;

He asserts the primacy of social origin and cultural capital by claiming that [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]], though acquired cumulatively over time, depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that “one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are (statistically) associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 177&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bourdieu, tastes in food, culture and presentation are indicators of class because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual’s fit in society.&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 184&lt;/ref&gt; Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. A multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction “has its own artists and philosophers, newspapers and critics, just as it has its hairdresser, interior decorator, or tailor.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 pp 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bourdieu does not disregard the importance of [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]] in the formation of [[cultural capital]]. For example, the production of art and the ability to play an instrument “presuppose not only dispositions associated with long establishment in the world of art and culture but also economic means...and spare time.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 75&lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of one’s ability to act upon one’s preferences, Bourdieu specifies that “respondents are only required to express a status-induced familiarity with legitimate...culture.”&lt;ref name="Distinction, Bourdieu 1984 p 63"&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

“[Taste] functions as a sort of social orientation, a ‘sense of one’s place,’ guiding the occupants of a given...social space towards the social positions adjusted to their properties, and towards the practices or goods which befit the occupants of that position.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 466&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences.&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 65&lt;/ref&gt;

These “cognitive structures...are internalized, ‘embodied’ social structures,” becoming a natural entity to the individual (Bourdieu 468). Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected, resulting in “disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance (‘feeling sick’) of the tastes of others.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are “most marked in the ordinary choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing, or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying outside the scope of the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 77&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Bourdieu believes that “the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning” would probably be in the tastes of food.&lt;ref name="Distinction, Bourdieu 1984 p 79"&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are “an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in ‘showing off’ a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part).”&lt;ref name="Distinction, Bourdieu 1984 p 79"/&gt; The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.

Children from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose “heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap” in their dinner layouts, opting for “plentiful and good” meals as opposed to foods that are “original and exotic.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 177, 79&lt;/ref&gt; These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu’s “ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy,” that contrasts the “convivial indulgence” characteristic of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 179&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the social classes.

The degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and [[economic capital]]. Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of [[educational capital]], social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions.&lt;ref name="Distinction, Bourdieu 1984 p 63"/&gt; How one describes one’s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 78&lt;/ref&gt; Also, across the divisions of labor, “economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending.”&lt;ref&gt;''Distinction'', Bourdieu 1984 p 185&lt;/ref&gt; This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, consumption patterns remain stable.

==Theory of power and practice==
Bourdieu's sociological work emphasizes the importance of practices in the social world. Bourdieu was opposed to the intellectualist tradition and stressed that social domination and [[cultural reproduction]] were primarily focused on bodily know-how and competent practices in the society. Bourdieu fiercely opposed [[Rational Choice Theory]] because he believed it was a misunderstanding of how social agents operate. According to Bourdieu agents do not continuously calculate according to explicit rational and economic criteria. Rather, social agents operate according to an implicit practical logic—a practical sense—and bodily dispositions. Social agents act according to their "feel for the game" (the "feel" being, roughly, habitus, and the "game" being the field).

Bourdieu’s anthropological work was dominated by social hierarchy reproduction analysis. Bourdieu criticized the importance given to  economic factors in the analysis of social order and change. He stressed that the capacity of actors to impose their cultural reproductions and symbolic systems plays an essential role in the reproduction of dominate social structures. Symbolic violence is the self-interested capacity to ensure that the arbitrariness of the social order is either ignored, or argued as natural, thereby justifying the legitimacy of existing social structures. This concept plays an essential part in his sociological analysis.

For Bourdieu, the social world has gradually divided into what he calls ''[[field (Bourdieu)|fields]]''. For him, social activity differences led to various, relatively autonomous, social spaces in which competition centers around particular capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basis—with economic power usually governing—wherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of social actors trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of [[conflict theory]] like [[Marx]]. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu, P 1977"/&gt;

Pierre Bourdieu developed a theory of the action, around the concept of ''habitus'', which exerted a considerable influence in the social sciences. This theory seeks to show that social agents develop strategies which are adapted to the needs of the social worlds that they inhabit. These strategies are unconscious and act on the level of a bodily logic.

===Theory about media and cultural production===

Bourdieu’s most significant work on cultural production is available in two books: ''The Field of Cultural Production'' (1993) and ''The Rules of Art'' (1996).

Bourdieu builds his theory of cultural production using his own characteristic theoretical vocabulary of [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]], [[Cultural capital|capital]] and [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]].

David Hesmondhalgh writes that “by ‘Cultural production’ Bourdieu intends a very broad understanding of culture, in line with the tradition of classical sociology, including science (which in turn includes social science), law and religion, as well as expressive-aesthetic activities such as art, literature and music. However, his work on cultural production focuses overwhelmingly on two types of field or sub-field of cultural production (...): literature and art.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hesmondhalgh |first1=David |year=2006 |title=Bourdieu, the media and cultural production |journal=Media Culture &amp; Society |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=211–231 |publisher=SAGE Publications |doi=10.1177/0163443706061682 |url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/2/211 |accessdate=2011-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pierre Bourdieu “the principal obstacle to a rigorous science of the production of the value of cultural goods” is the “charismatic ideology of ‘creation’ “ which can be easily found in studies of art, literature and other cultural fields. In Bourdieu’s opinion charismatic ideology ‘directs the gaze towards the apparent producer and prevents us from asking who has created this “creator” and the magic power of transubstantiation with which the “creator” is endowed’.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu ''Rules of Art'', p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

For Bourdieu, a sociologically informed view of an artist ought to describe their influences, antagonisms, etc., i.e. their relations to the field of production; and also should describe their attitudes to their readers, enthusiasts or detractors, i.e. their relations to the field of consumption. Further, a work of literature, for example, may not adequately be analysed either as the product of the author's life and beliefs (a naively biographical account), or without any reference to the author's intentions (as [[Death of the Author|Barthes]] argued). In short, "the subject of a work is a ''habitus'' in relationship with a 'post', a position, that is, within a field." &lt;ref&gt;'But Who Created the Creators?', in Sociology In Question, p. 142, SAGE Publications, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bourdieu, cultural revolutions are always dependent on the possibilities present in the positions inscribed in the field.

===Field and habitus===

====Field====
{{refimprove section|date=August 2007}}
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2007}}
A field is a setting in which [[human agency|agents]] and their [[social position]]s are located. The position of each particular agent in the field is a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field, agent's [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and agent's capital ([[social capital|social]], [[economic capital|economic]] and [[cultural capital|cultural]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). ''Distinction: a social critique of the judgement of taste''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical: Most are subordinate to the larger field of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[social class|class]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840613509919|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of confining his analysis of social relations and change to voluntaristic agency or strictly in terms of class as a structural relation, Bourdieu uses the agency-structure bridging concept of ''field'': any historical, non-homogeneous social-spatial arena in which people maneuver and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources. Much of Bourdieu's work observes the semi-independent role of educational and cultural resources in the expression of agency. This makes his work amenable to liberal-conservative scholarship positing the fundamental cleavages of society as amongst disorderly factions of the working class, in need of disciplinary intervention where they have assumed excessive [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. Unsurprisingly given his historical and biographical location, however, Bourdieu was in practice both influenced by and sympathetic to the [[Marx]]ist identification of economic command as a principal component of power and agency within capitalist society,&lt;ref&gt;See: Bourdieu, Pierre. 2005. "The social structures of the economy"; Bourdieu, Pierre. 2003. "Acts of Resistance: Against the Tyranny of the Market"; Bourdieu, Pierre. 2003. "Firing Back: Against the Tyranny of the Market 2"; Bourdieu, Pierre et al. 2000. "The weight of the world."&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to some of his followers or the influential sociologist [[Max Weber]].

====Habitus====
Bourdieu's concept of habitus was inspired by Marcel Mauss's notion of body technique and hexis. The word itself can be found in the works of [[Norbert Elias]], Max Weber, Edmund Husserl and Erwin Panofsky as re-workings of the concept as it emerged in Aristotle's notion of [[Hexis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wacquant|first=Loïc|title=Habitus|url=http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/wacquant/wacquant_pdf/HABITUS-INTERNCYECOSOC.pdf&amp;pli=1|work=HABITUS-INTERNCYECOSOC|format=PDF|accessdate=21 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Bourdieu, habitus was essential in resolving a prominent [[antinomy]] of the human sciences: [[Moral universalism|objectivism]] and [[subjectivism]]. Habitus can be defined as a system of [[disposition]]s (lasting, acquired schemes of perception, thought and action).

The individual agent develops these dispositions in response to the objective conditions it encounters. In this way Bourdieu theorizes the inculcation of objective social structures into the subjective, mental experience of agents. For the objective social field places requirements on its participants for membership, so to speak, within the field. Having thereby absorbed objective social structure into a personal set of cognitive and somatic dispositions, and the subjective structures of action of the agent then being commensurate with the objective structures and extant exigencies of the social field, a doxic relationship emerges.

Habitus is somewhat reminiscent of preexisting sociological concepts such as socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function at the level of explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with [[Anthony Giddens]]' concept of practical consciousness.

====Habitus and doxa====
[[Doxa]] refers to the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, unconscious beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent's actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus, being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may be thought of as a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the 'subjective', internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state, the social world is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.

Bourdieu thus sees [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] as an important factor contributing to [[social reproduction]] because it is central to generating and regulating the practices that make up social life.  Individuals learn to want what conditions make possible for them, and not to aspire to what is not available to them. The conditions in which the individual lives generate dispositions compatible with these conditions (including tastes in art, literature, food, and music), and in a sense pre-adapted to their demands. The most improbable practices are therefore excluded, as unthinkable, by a kind of immediate submission to order that inclines agents to make a virtue of necessity, that is, to refuse what is categorically denied and to will the inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. (1990) Structures, habitus, practices. In P. Bourdieu, The logic of practice (pp. 52-79). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. Bourdieu, 1990, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconciling the objective (field) and the subjective (habitus)====
As mentioned above, Bourdieu used the methodological and theoretical concepts of habitus and field in order to make an [[epistemological rupture|epistemological break]] with the prominent objective-subjective antinomy of the social sciences. He wanted to effectively unite social [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[structuralism]]. Habitus and field are proposed to do so.

Bourdieu's ambition to unite these sociological traditions, which had been widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either '''social laws''' (structure) or the '''individual minds''' (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between those who argue that the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider '''dispositions''', he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.

Dispositions are also importantly public and hence observable. If I prefer brie to Camembert but keep this fact secret&amp;nbsp;— never showing my preference, scrupulously giving no evidence from which my preference may be observed or deduced — then the preference remains strictly private. It may be aptly called a preference, but it is not a disposition in Bourdieu's sense and arguably not in the everyday sense either. A disposition performs, enacts a preference; however trivial, even when disputing the relative merits of cheeses, a disposition is a public declaration of where one stands, what one's allegiances are.

Amongst any society of individuals, the constant performance of dispositions, trivial and grand, forms an observable range of preferences and allegiances, points and vectors. This spatial metaphor can be analysed by sociologists and realised in [[diagrammatic form]].&lt;ref&gt;as when Bourdieu plots "the space of the faculties" in French higher education — {{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Homo Academicus|year=1988|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-7456-0831-0|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, conceptualising social relations this way gives rise to an image of society as a web of interrelated spaces. These are the social fields.

For Bourdieu, habitus and field can only exist in relation to each other. Although a field is constituted by the various social agents participating in it (and thus their habitus), a habitus, in effect, represents the transposition of objective structures of the field into the subjective structures of action and thought of the agent.

The relationship between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists only insofar as social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata that are necessary to constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how that will allow them to constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.

Bourdieu attempts to use the concepts of habitus and field to remove the division between the subjective and the objective. Whether or not he successfully does so is open to debate. Bourdieu asserts that any research must be composed of two "minutes." The first an objective stage of research—where one looks at the relations of the social space and the structures of the field. The second stage must be a subjective analysis of social agents' dispositions to act and their categories of perception and understanding that result from their inhabiting the field. Proper research, he says, cannot do without these two together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-o4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=bourdieu+two+minutes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ocp3fDE_Rn&amp;sig=0zbTHZNjJNNYY0Mr9WunR9nRz0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqheCXqvbYAhWGq1MKHUliCHIQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=bourdieu%20two%20minutes&amp;f=false|title=The Science of Qualitative Research|last=Packer|first=Martin J.|date=2017-11-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108417129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species of capital and symbolic violence===

Bourdieu extended the notion of capital, defined as sums of money or assets put to productive use. For Bourdieu, these assets could take many forms which had not received much attention when he began writing. Bourdieu habitually refers to several principal forms of capital: economic, symbolic, cultural and social. Loic Waquant describes their status in Bourdieu's work in these terms: "Capital comes in 3 principal species: economic, cultural and social. A fourth species, symbolic capital, designates the effects of any form of capital when people do not perceive them as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wacquant |first= L. |year=2006 |title=Key Contemporary Thinkers, London and New York |publisher= Macmillan, new edition |page= 7 |url= http://www.umsl.edu/~keelr/3210/resources/PIERREBOURDIEU-KEYTHINK-REV2006.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu sees [[symbolic capital]] (e.g., prestige, honor, attention) as a crucial source of power.&lt;ref name="Cattani2014"&gt;Cattani, Gino, Ferriani, Simone, and Allison, Paul. 2014. "Insiders, Outsiders and the Struggle for Consecration in Cultural Fields: A Core-Periphery Perspective." ''American Sociological Review'', vol.78(3): pp.417-447.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlZm9LLW9adXRXMFE/edit?usp=sharing]&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic capital is any species of capital that is, in [[Loïc Wacquant]]'s terms "not perceived as such," but which is instead perceived through socially inculcated classificatory schemes. When a holder of symbolic capital uses the power this confers against an agent who holds less, and seeks thereby to alter their actions, they exercise ''[[symbolic violence]]''.

Symbolic violence is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who then take the social order to be just. It is the incorporation of unconscious structures that tend to perpetuate the structures of action of the dominant. The dominated then take their position to be "right." Symbolic violence is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes the spectre of legitimacy of the social order.

In his theoretical writings, Bourdieu employs some terminology used in [[economics]] to analyze the processes of [[cultural reproduction|social and cultural reproduction]], of how the various forms of capital tend to transfer from one generation to the next. For Bourdieu, formal education represents the key example of this process. Educational success, according to Bourdieu, entails a whole range of cultural behaviour, extending to ostensibly non-academic features like [[gait]], dress, or accent. Privileged children have learned this behaviour, as have their teachers. Children of unprivileged backgrounds have not. The children of privilege therefore fit the pattern of their teachers' expectations with apparent 'ease'; they are 'docile'. The unprivileged are found to be 'difficult', to present 'challenges'. Yet both behave as their upbringing dictates. Bourdieu regards this 'ease', or 'natural' ability—distinction—as in fact the product of a great social labour, largely on the part of the parents. It equips their children with the dispositions of manner as well as thought which ensure they are able to succeed within the educational system and can then reproduce their parents' class position in the wider [[social system]].

[[Cultural capital]] refers to assets, e.g., competencies, skills, qualifications, which enable holders to mobilise cultural authority and can also be a source of misrecognition and symbolic violence. For example, [[working class]] children can come to see the educational success of their [[middle-class]] peers as always legitimate, seeing what is often class-based inequality as instead the result of hard work or even 'natural' ability. A key part of this process is the transformation of people's symbolic or economic inheritance (e.g., accent or property) into cultural capital (e.g., university qualifications).

Bourdieu argues that cultural capital has developed in opposition to economic capital. Moreover, the conflict between those who mostly hold cultural capital and those who mostly hold economic capital finds expression in the opposed social fields of art and business. The field of art and related cultural fields are seen to have striven historically for autonomy, which in different times and places has been more or less achieved. The autonomous field of art is summed up as "an economic world turned upside down,"&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P 1996, The Rules of Art p.81, Polity&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the opposition between economic and cultural capital.

For Bourdieu, "social capital is the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing ''a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships'' of mutual acquaintance and recognition."&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and Loïc J. D. Wacquant. 1992. An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;In order for individuals to gain such capital, they must work for it constantly and it takes time according to Bourdieu. For some families, cultural capital is accumulated over a period of generations as they adopt cultural investment strategies and pass them on to their children. This gives children an opportunity to realize their potential through education and they pass on those same values to their children. Over time, individuals in such families gain cultural currency which gives them an inherent advantage over other groups of people, which is why there is such variation in academic achievement in children of different social classes. Having such cultural currency enables people to compensate for a lack of financial capital by giving them a certain level of respect and status in society. Bourdieu believes that cultural capital may play a role when individuals pursue power and status in society through politics or other means. Social and cultural capital along with economic capital contribute to the inequality we see in the world, according to Bourdieu's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chopra|first=Rohit|date=2010-10-22|title=NEOLIBERALISM AS DOXA: BOURDIEU'S THEORY OF THE STATE AND THE CONTEMPORARY INDIAN DISCOURSE ON GLOBALIZATION AND LIBERALIZATION|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950238032000083881|journal=Cultural Studies|volume=17|pages=419-444|via=Taylor Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflexivity===
Bourdieu insists on the importance of a [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] sociology in which sociologists must at all times conduct their research with conscious attention to the effects of their own position, their own set of internalized structures, and how these are likely to distort or prejudice their objectivity. The sociologist, according to Bourdieu, must engage in a "sociology of sociology" so as not to unwittingly attribute to the object of observation the characteristics of the subject. She/he ought to conduct their research with one eye continually reflecting back upon their own habitus, their dispositions learned through long social and institutional training.

It is only by maintaining such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot themselves in the act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Inheritors'', Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1979, pp.20-4; ''Academic Discourse'', Bourdieu ''et al'', 1994, pp. 8-10''; Homo Academicus, ''Bourdieu, 1988, pp.194-225''&lt;/ref&gt; Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.

Bourdieu also describes how the "scholastic point of view"&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Reason'', Bourdieu, 1998, pp. 127-140; ''Pascalian Meditations'', Bourdieu, 2000, pp. 49-84&lt;/ref&gt; unconsciously alters how scientists approach their objects of study. Because of the systematicity of their training and their mode of analysis, they tend to exaggerate the systematicity of the things they study. This inclines them to see agents following clear rules where in fact they use less determinate strategies; it makes it hard to theorise the 'fuzzy' logic of the social world, its practical and therefore mutable nature, poorly described by words like 'system', 'structure' and 'logic' which imply mechanisms, rigidity and omnipresence. The scholar can too easily find themselves mistaking "the things of logic for the logic of things" — a phrase of Marx's which Bourdieu is fond of quoting.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''In Other Words'', Bourdieu, 1990, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; Again, reflexivity is recommended as the key to discovering and correcting for such errors which would otherwise remain unseen, mistakes produced by an over-application of the virtues that produced also the truths within which the errors are embedded.&lt;ref&gt;''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology'', Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992, e.g. pp. 68-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and objectivity===
Bourdieu contended there is transcendental objectivity, only when certain necessary historical conditions are met. The scientific field is precisely that field in which objectivity may be acquired. Bourdieu's ideal scientific field is one that grants its participants an interest or investment in objectivity. Further, this ideal scientific field is one in which the field's degree of autonomy advances and, in a corresponding process, its "entrance fee" becomes increasingly strict. The scientific field entails rigorous intersubjective scrutinizing of theory and data.&lt;ref&gt;"The work of departicularization, universalization, that goes on in the [scientific] field, through the regulated confrontation of the competitors most inclined and most able to expose... any judgement aspiring to validation and, through this, to universal validity, is the reason why the truth regognized by the scientific field is irreducible to its historical and social conditions of production." Bourdieu, P. 2004 ''Science of Science and Reflexivity'' Polity pp. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt; This should make it difficult for those within the field to bring in, for example, political influence.

However, the autonomy of the scientific field cannot be taken for granted. An important part of Bourdieu's theory is that the historical development of a scientific field, sufficiently autonomous to be described as such and to produce objective work, is an achievement that requires continual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;"Autonomy is not a given, but a historical conquest, endlessly having to be undertaken anew." Bourdieu, P. 2004 ''Science of Science and Reflexivity'' Polity p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Having been achieved, it cannot be assumed to be secure. Bourdieu does not discount the possibility that the scientific field may lose its autonomy and therefore deteriorate, losing its defining characteristic as a producer of objective work. In this way, the conditions of possibility for the production of transcendental objectivity could arise and then disappear.&lt;ref&gt;see in particular Bourdieu, P. 1996 ''The Rules of Art'' Polity pp. 331-337: ''For a Corporatism of the Universal''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Bourdieu takes [[language]] to be not merely a method of communication, but also a mechanism of power. The language one uses is designated by one's relational position in a field or social space. Different uses of language tend to reiterate the respective positions of each participant. Linguistic interactions are manifestations of the participants' respective positions in social space and categories of understanding, and thus tend to reproduce the objective structures of the social field. This determines who has a "right" to be listened to, to interrupt, to ask questions, and to lecture, and to what degree.

The representation of identity in forms of language can be subdivided into language, dialect, and accent. For example, the use of different dialects in an area can represent a varied social status for individuals. A good example of this would be in the case of French. Until the French Revolution, the difference of dialects usage directly reflected ones social status. Peasants and lower class members spoke local dialects, while only nobles and higher class members were fluent with the official French language. Accents can reflect an area's inner conflict with classifications and authority within a population.

The reason language acts as a mechanism of power is through forms of mental representations it is acknowledged and noticed as objective representations: as a sign and/or symbol. These signs and symbols therefore transform language into an agency of power.&lt;ref name="Hup.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674510418 |title=Language and Symbolic Power — Pierre Bourdieu, John Thompson &amp;#124; Harvard University Press |publisher=Hup.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Bourdieu "was, for many, the leading intellectual of present-day France... a thinker in the same rank as [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]".&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2002/&gt; His works have been translated into two dozen languages and have affected the whole gamut of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities.  They have also been used in pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=Academic Capital, PostgraduateResearch and British Universities|journal=Discourse|date=2006|volume=6|pages=211–223|url=https://www.academia.edu/3426640/Academic_Capital_Postgraduate_Research_and_British_Universities_A_Bourdieu_Inspired_Reflection_Discourse_6_2006_211-223}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several works of his are considered classics, not only in sociology, but also in anthropology, education, and cultural studies. ''[[Distinction (1979 book)|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (''[[La Distinction]]'') was named as one of the 20th century's ten most important works of sociology by the [[International Sociological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/books/books10.htm |title=ISA - Books of the Century. ToP Ten |publisher=Isa-sociology.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010230113/http://www.isa-sociology.org/books/books10.htm |archivedate=2012-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rules of Art'' has significantly affected sociology, history, literature and aesthetics.

In France, Bourdieu was seen not as an [[ivory tower]] academic or "cloistered don" but as a passionate activist for those he believed to be subordinated by society. In 2001, a documentary film about Bourdieu – ''Sociology is a Martial Art'' – "became an unexpected hit in Paris. Its very title stressed how much of a politically engaged intellectual Bourdieu was, taking on the mantle of [[Émile Zola]] and Jean-Paul Sartre in French public life and slugging it out with politicians because he thought that was what people like him should do."&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2002/&gt;

For Bourdieu, sociology was a combative effort, exposing the un-thought structures beneath the physical (somatic) and thought practices of social agents. He saw sociology as a means of confronting symbolic violence and exposing those unseen areas where one could be free.

Bourdieu's work continues to be influential. His work is widely cited, and many sociologists and other social scientists work explicitly in a Bourdieusian framework. One example is Loïc Wacquant, who persistently applies the Bourdieusian theoretical and methodological principles to subjects such as boxing, employing what Bourdieu termed ''participant objectivation'' (''objectivation participante''), or what Wacquant calls "carnal sociology." In addition to publishing a book on Bourdieu's lasting influence, novelist [[Édouard Louis]] uses the legacy of Pierre Bourdieu as a literary device.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu also played a crucial role in the popularisation of [[correspondence analysis]] and particularly [[multiple correspondence analysis]]. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field," Bourdieu said, in the preface to ''The Craft of Sociology''.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre, Jean-Claude Chamboredon and Jean-Claude Passeron (1991) The Craft of Sociology. Berlin, Walter de Guyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Pranavananda''' ({{lang-bn|[[:bn:Swami Pranavananda|স্বামী প্রণবানন্দ]]}}) also known as Yugacharya Srimat Swami Pranavananda Ji Maharaj, (29 January 1896 – 8 February 1941)&lt;ref name="Delhi1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Library of Congress Office, New Delhi|title=Accessions List, South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HslVAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=14 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=E.G. Smith|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hindu]] [[yogi]] and [[saint]] who founded an organization known as the [[Bharat Sevashram Sangha]].&lt;ref name="Kapoor2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Subodh Kapoor|title=The Indian Encyclopaedia: Biographical, Historical, Religious, Administrative, Ethnological, Commercial and Scientific.

Swamiji was one of the greatest spiritual leaders of modern India. He is still revered very much for his message of universal love, compassion for all humanity and social reform without giving up the nationalist zeal, the love of mother land.

He was born on 29 January 1896, the auspicious day of [[Magha Purnima|Maghi Purnima]] (16th Magha, 1302), in [[Bajitpur]], a village in [[Faridpur District]] in undivided India (presently in [[Bangladesh]]). His parents Vishnu Charan Bhuia and Saradadevi were very pious and blessed by Lord [[Shiva]] to have a son for the mitigation of human suffering and universal emancipation. He was affectionately named Jaynath by his father at birth and later in his boyhood he was called Binode. Binode showed uncommon philosophical inclinations since childhood and often could be seen in deep contemplation at the village school. He was popular with the children of the locality because of his helpful nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Regeneration Bharat Sevashram Sangha, Hyderabad Branch - 1978 - Volume 8 - Page 67 "This child of Vishnu Charan Das and Sarada Devi was popularly called Vinod. But who could then assume that this Vinod would one day become Swami Pranavananda and materialize dreams of Swami Vivekananda? Yet it is strange that ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Inappropriate tone|date=December 2007}}
'''Projectivism''' in philosophy involves attributing ('projecting') qualities to an object as if those qualities actually belong to it.  It is a [[theory]] for how people interact with the world, and has been applied in both [[ethics]] and general philosophy. There are several forms of projectivism.

[[David Hume]] describes projectivism:

{{cquote|Tis a common observation, that the mind has a great propensity to spread itself on external objects, and to conjoin with them any internal impressions, which they occasion, and which always make their appearance at the same time that these objects discover themselves to the senses. ''(Hume, [[Treatise of Human Nature]], I. iii. XIV)''}}

==Projectivism in ethics and meta-ethics==

The origins of projectivism lie with Hume. He describes the view in Treatise on Human Nature. 

More recently, [[Simon Blackburn]] has been a major proponent of the view. Blackburn's projectivism is a version of meta-ethical anti-realism. Blackburn conveys anti-realism as the view that statements which express moral properties are our construction, and realism as the view that moral properties somehow exist independent of us, the moral agents. A further distinction should be made to understand Blackburn's projectivism: that between cognitivists and non-cognitivists. Cognitivists believe that moral claims are "[[truth-apt]]", that is capable of being true or false. Non-cognitivists, on the other hand, believe that moral claims are not truth-apt—not capable of being true or false.

As a non-cognitivist, the projectivist holds that ethical judgments are the product of conative, rather than cognitive psychological processes. A conative psychological process or state is something akin to a stance, attitude, or disposition.  These conative psychological processes should be contrasted with cognitive ones, which are what we typically think of when we talk about human beings “using their reason” or perhaps being rational (at least in the narrow sense). As highly social creatures whose success as a species has been due for the most part to our ability to communicate and cooperate, projectivism holds that the development of a moral interest has actually been in our prudential interest.

Blackburn’s projectivism, what he calls [[quasi-realism]], is based on the significance of the conative stances we hold. His idea is that these conative stances are the starting point for what the meta-ethical realist labels beliefs or even facts, like that you ought to feed your children, or that you have moral values—real values that exist out there in the world independent of you. Since these conative stances are essentially motivating, they can be called desires, and the realist may be tempted to see them as desires connected to true beliefs about things that exist independent of  mental construction. This temptation is not in any way ridiculous because as we grow and develop, our conative stances can become quite refined into a kind of moral sensibility. So for the projectivist, meta-ethical realists confuse moral sense and sensibility, as it were. The projectivist position holds that our moral sensibility can become very sophisticated as we age and mature. As we experience compassion, we come to value compassion; or with gratitude, we come to admire being gracious, and consider gratitude a virtue. But the projectivist is not committed to saying that our response to something wrong (i.e. sense) is what determines its rightness or wrongness. The view is that the wrong-making features of actions are external, and they play a role in the development of essentially motivating moral sentiments that guide conduct.

The view is vulnerable to a big worry for the ethical realist: projectivism may collapse into subjectivism or some variety of [[moral relativism]]. For example, it may seem that if Hitler truly felt the Holocaust was the right thing to do, the only possible projectivist response would to be that if Hitler truly thought he was doing the right thing, we might say he was wrong, but for him, it was right. But here, projectivism does not collapse into subjectivism. Where a subjectivist sees no moral disagreement (because he believes “X is right” just means “I approve of X”), the projectivist can allow for moral disagreement. 

A bigger vulnerability for the view is that it lacks explanatory power. The worry is that projectivism does not explain meta-ethics, it explains it away. Projectivism may stand to meta-ethics as particularism stands to ethics.

==Hume's projectivist theory of causation==

Suppose for example that somebody is hit by a hammer, and sometime later a bruise appears at the point of impact. The impact of the hammer is an observable event; the bruise too is observable. The causal connection between the two events, however, is not observed or experienced, at least according to Hume. Hume believed that whenever we can claim to know something about the world, that knowledge must be derived from experience (see [[Hume's fork]]).  We do not experience the causal connection between a hammer impact and the formation of a bruise.  All we observe are distinct events, occurring at the same place and time ([[Constant conjunction]]).  Because we observe events of this type, we are led by induction to suppose that like causes will result in like effects, and from this we have the notion of causation.  This does not mean Hume doubted that one material object was able to cause a change or movement in another material object.  It means that insofar as we talk about some cause resulting in some effect, it is not something we have learned of the world we are talking about because it is not derived from experience.  Rather, we are talking about a feature of our thinking which we are inclined to discuss as if it were a feature of the world.

In short: when we believe we have observed a causal connection all we have really experienced is a conjunction between two separate events.  We can only know about the world through experience, so causation as a feature of the world is something unknowable to a human being.

==The projectivist theory of probability==

What does it mean to say that the [[probability]] that a coin lands heads is ½? One might think that the coin will either land upward or it will not, the probability is not a feature of the world, but rather just a measure of our own ignorance.

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]] (see his collected papers, edited by [[D. H. Mellor]]) and [[Bruno de Finetti]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} developed projectivist theories of probability in the early twentieth century. To explain their theories, the concept of degree of belief must first be introduced.

Let us say that a person has a degree of belief of 1 in a particular proposition if he is completely convinced of its truth. For example, most people have a degree of belief of 1 in the proposition that 2+2=4. On the other hand, a person has a degree of belief 0 in a proposition if he is utterly convinced of its falsity; most people have a degree of belief of zero in the proposition that 2+2=5. Intermediate values are possible. A man who thinks that his dog has stolen the sausages, but is not completely sure, might have a degree of belief of 0.8 in the proposition that his dog stole the sausages.

For each person A, we can define a (partial) function CA mapping the set of propositions to the [[Interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] [0, 1] by stipulating that for a proposition P CA(P)=t if and only if C has a degree of belief t in the proposition P. Ramsey and de Finetti independently attempted to show that if A is rational, CA is a probability function: that is, CA satisfies the standard ([[Kolmogorov]]) probability axioms.

They supposed that when I describe an event as having probability P I am really voicing my degrees of belief. Probabilities are not real features of the world.

For example, when I say that the event that the coin lands heads up has probability ½, I do so because my degree of belief in the proposition that the coin will land heads up is ½. (This needs to be restated to show probability in a particular number of flips, not one coin flip, which DOES only have a probability of 1/2 since it only has two sides.)

'''Robert Hilary Kane''' (born 1938, [[Boston]]) is an American philosopher. He is Distinguished Teaching Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and is currently on phased retirement.

He is the author of ''Free Will and Values'' (1985), ''Through the Moral Maze'' (1994), and ''The Significance of Free Will'' (1996: awarded the 1996 Robert W. Hamilton Faculty Book Award).  He also edited the ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'' (2004) and has published many articles in the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[Philosophy of action|action]], [[ethics]], the theory of values and [[philosophy of religion]].

==Education==
Kane studied philosophy from 1956 to 1960 at [[Holy Cross College (Indiana)|Holy Cross College]] (B.A. 1960), from 1958 to 1959 at the [[University of Vienna]], and from 1960 to 1964 at [[Yale University]] (M.A. 1962, Ph.D. 1964).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, [http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rkane/vita.html ''Curriculum Vitae''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005032354/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rkane/vita.html |date=2013-10-05 }}. University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Causal indeterminism===
Kane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on [[free will]].&lt;ref name = "KaneFreeWill"&gt;Kane, R. (ed.) ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/kane/ Information Philosophers] "Robert Kane is the acknowledged dean of the libertarian philosophers writing actively on the free will problem."&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] freedom", Kane argues that "(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)".&lt;ref&gt;Kane (ed.): ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR).  Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will.  It is necessary that there be ([[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]ly) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control.  The control is found in "ultimate responsibility".

Ultimate responsibility entails that agents must be the ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers of their own ends and purposes.  There must be more than one way for a person's life to turn out (AP).  More importantly, whichever way it turns out must be based in the person's willing actions.  As Kane defines it,

{{Quotation|'''UR:''' ''An agent is ultimately responsible for some (event or state) E's occurring only if (R) the agent is personally responsible for E's occurring in a sense which entails that something the agent voluntarily (or willingly) did or omitted either was, or causally contributed to, E's occurrence and made a difference to whether or not E occurred; and (U) for every X and Y (where X and Y represent occurrences of events and/or states) if the agent is personally responsible for X and if Y is an ''arche'' (sufficient condition, cause or motive) for X, then the agent must also be personally responsible for Y.''|}}

In short, "an agent must be responsible for anything that is a sufficient and necessary reason (condition, cause or motive) for the action's occurring."&lt;ref&gt;Kane: "Free Will" in ''Free Will'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

What allows for ultimacy of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as "self-forming actions" or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills.  These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR.  UR does not require that ''every'' act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs.  These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action.  If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.

====Critique====
[[Randolph Clarke (philosopher)|Randolph Clarke]] objects that Kane's depiction of free will is not truly libertarian but rather a form of [[compatibilism]]. The objection asserts that although the outcome of an SFA is not determined, one's history up to the event ''is''; so the fact that an SFA will occur is also determined.  The outcome of the SFA is based on chance, and from that point on one's life is determined.  This kind of freedom, says Clarke, is no different than the kind of freedom argued for by compatibilists, who assert that even though our actions are determined, they are free because they are in accordance with our own wills, much like the outcome of an SFA.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Randolph Clarke|title=Libertarian Accounts of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V6n6-vobcIC|date=8 December 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530642-2|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane responds that the difference between causal indeterminism and compatibilism is "ultimate control — the originative control exercised by agents when it is 'up to them' which of a set of possible choices or actions will now occur, and up to no one and nothing else over which the agents themselves do not also have control".&lt;ref&gt;Kane: "Free Will" in ''Free Will'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  UR assures that the sufficient conditions for one's actions do not lie before one's own birth.

In his book defending [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilism]], ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', Daniel Dennett spends a chapter criticising Kane's theory.&lt;ref name = "FreedomEvolves"&gt;Dennett, D. ''Freedom Evolves.''Viking Books, February, 2003 {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially ''indetectable'' notion of free will to be incredible.

===Radical libertarianism===
Kane is one of several philosophers and scientists to propose a two-stage model of free will. The American philosopher [[William James]] was the first (in 1884). Others include the French mathematician and scientist [[Henri Poincaré]] (about 1906), the physicist [[Arthur Holly Compton]] (1931, 1955), the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] (1965, 1977), the physicist and philosopher [[Henry Margenau]] (1968, 1982), the philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] (1978), the classicists [[A. A. Long]] and [[David Sedley]] (1987), the philosopher Alfred Mele (1995), and most recently, the neurogeneticist and biologist [[Martin Heisenberg]] (2009), son of the physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], whose [[quantum indeterminacy]] principle lies at the foundation of indeterministic physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/two-stage_models.html Two-stage models of free will]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane's model goes beyond [[Daniel Dennett]]'s by trying to keep indeterminism as late as possible in the process of deliberation, indeed as late as the decision itself in the SFAs (Self-Forming Actions). Kane's followers, [[Laura Waddell Ekstrom]], [[Richard Double]], and [[Mark Balaguer]], as well as the philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]], agree that chance must be the direct cause of action. This makes them all [[Radical libertarianism|radical libertarians]], as opposed to those who limit [[Randomness|chance]] to the early deliberative stages of the decision process, such as James, Popper, Margenau, Doyle and Martin Heisenberg, who are conservative or modest libertarians, following the two-stage models proposed by Dennett and Mele.

In his 1985 book ''Free Will and Values'', aware of earlier proposals by neurobiologist [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]], Popper, and Dennett, but working independently, Kane proposed an ambitious [[amplifier]] model for a quantum randomizer in the brain - a spinning wheel of fortune with probability bubbles corresponding to [[Principle of alternative possibilities|alternative possibilities]], in the massive switch amplifier (MSA) tradition of Compton.

He says
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What I would like to do then, is to show how an MSA model, using Eccles' notion of critically poised neurons as a working hypothesis, might be adapted to the theory of practical, moral and prudential decision making.&lt;ref&gt;''Free Will and Values'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Kane was not satisfied with his solution. In the end he did not endorse it. He said it did not go far enough because it does not fully capture the notion of ultimate responsibility (UR) during rare "self-forming actions (SFAs). It is merely a "significant piece in the overall puzzle of a libertarian freedom." &lt;ref&gt;''Free Will and Values'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that the main reason for failure is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    "locating the master switch and the mechanism of amplification...We do not know if something similar goes on in the brains of cortically developed creatures like ourselves, but I suspect it must if libertarian theories are to succeed." &lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/location.html Where and When is Randomness Located? on Information Philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kane admits his basic failure is his location of indeterminism in the decision process itself. This makes chance the direct cause of action. He was actually quite bleak about the possibilities for a satisfactory libertarian model. He felt

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"that any construction which escaped confusion and emptiness was likely to fall short of some libertarian aspirations - aspirations that I believe cannot ultimately be fulfilled." &lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p.165&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Kane claims that the major criticism of all indeterminist libertarian models is explaining the power to choose or do otherwise in "exactly the same conditions," something he calls "dual rational self-control." Given that A was the rational choice, how can one defend doing B under exactly the same circumstances?" &lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Kane is concerned that such a "dual power" is arbitrary, capricious, and irrational.

Kane's latest suggestion for his occasional self-forming actions argues that the tension and uncertainty in our minds stirs up "chaos" that is sensitive to micro-indeterminacies at the neuronal level.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All free acts do not have to be undetermined on the libertarian view, but only those acts by which we made ourselves into the kinds of persons we are, namely the "will-setting" or "self-forming actions" (SFAs) that are required for ultimate responsibility.
&lt;ref&gt;''Four Views on Free Will'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now I believe these undetermined self-forming actions or SFAs occur at those difficult times of life when we are torn between competing visions of what we should do or become. Perhaps we are torn between doing the moral thing or acting from ambition, or between powerful present desires and long-term goals, or we are faced with difficult tasks for which we have aversions.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since he is primarily interested in cases of "[[liberty of indifference]]," the strong indeterminism he introduces raise the objection of loss of agent control, but Kane says the agent can beforehand decide to assume responsibility whichever way she randomly chose. This seems more like rationalization than reason, but Kane defends it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Suppose we were to say to such persons: 'But look, you didn't have sufficient or conclusive prior reasons for choosing as you did since you also had viable reasons for choosing the other way.' They might reply. 'True enough. But I did have good reasons for choosing as I did, which I'm willing to stand by and take responsibility for. If these reasons were not sufficient or conclusive reasons, that's because, like the heroine of the novel, I was not a fully formed person before I chose (and still am not, for that matter). Like the author of the novel, I am in the process of writing an unfinished story and forming an unfinished character who, in my case, is myself.'" &lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', pp. 41-2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The temple and its gardens are listed as one of the [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]], and as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==

The site of the temple was an estate of the [[Fujiwara clan]] in the 11th century.  The first temple, the ''Daiju-in'', and the still existing large pond were built in that century by Fujiwara Saneyoshi. In 1450, [[Hosokawa Katsumoto]], another powerful warlord, acquired the land where the temple stood. He built his residence there, and founded a Zen temple, Ryōan-ji. During the [[Ōnin War]] between the clans, the temple was destroyed. Hosokawa Katsumoto died in 1473. In 1488, his son, Hosokawa Matsumoto, rebuilt the temple.

The temple served as a mausoleum for several emperors. Their tombs are grouped together in what are today known as the "Seven Imperial Tombs" at Ryōan-ji. The burial places of these emperors—[[Emperor Uda|Uda]], [[Emperor Kazan|Kazan]], [[Emperor Ichijō|Ichijō]], [[Emperor Go-Suzaku|Go-Suzaku]], [[Emperor Go-Reizei|Go-Reizei]], [[Emperor Go-Sanjō|Go-Sanjō]], and [[Emperor Horikawa|Horikawa]]—would have been comparatively humble in the period after their deaths. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (''misasagi'') which were ordered by [[Emperor Meiji]].&lt;ref&gt;Moscher, G. (1978). ''Kyoto: A Contemplative Guide'', pp. 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is controversy over who built the garden and when. Most sources date the garden to the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins'', Nitschke, ''Le Jardin Japonais'', and Eliseeff. ''Jardins Japonais''&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, the garden was built by Hosokawa Katsumoto, the creator of the first temple of Ryōan-ji, between 1450 and 1473. Other sources say it was built by his son, Hosokawa Masamoto, in or around 1488.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, ''Le Jardin Japonais'', pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that the garden was built by the famous landscape painter and monk, [[Sōami]] (died 1525),&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Elisseeff, ''Jardins japonais'', pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is disputed by other authors.&lt;ref name="Young, pg. 108-109"&gt;Young and Young, ''The Art of the Japanese Garden'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say the garden was built in the first half of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Miyeko Murase, ''L'Art du Japon'', pg. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors say the garden was probably built much later, during the [[Edo period]], between 1618 and 1680.&lt;ref name="Young, pg. 108-109"/&gt; There is also controversy over whether the garden was built by monks, or by professional gardeners, called ''kawaramono'', or a combination of the two. One stone in the garden has the name of two ''kawaramono'' carved into it, Hirokojirō and Kotarō.

The conclusive history, though, based on documentary sources, is as follows: Hosokawa Katsumoto (1430–1473), deputy to the ''shōgun'', founded in 1450 the Ryōan-ji temple, but the complex was burnt down during the Ōnin War. His son Masamoto rebuilt the temple at the very end of the same century. It is not clear whether any garden was constructed at that time facing the main hall. First descriptions of a garden, clearly describing one in front of the main hall, date from 1680–1682. It is described as a composition of nine big stones laid out to represent Tiger Cubs Crossing the Water. As the garden has fifteen stones at present, it was clearly different from the garden that we see today. A great fire destroyed the buildings in 1779, and rubble of the burnt buildings was dumped in the garden. Garden writer and specialist Akisato Rito (died c. 1830) redid the garden completely on top of the rubble at the end of the eighteenth century and published a picture of his garden in his ''Celebrated Gardens and Sights of Kyoto'' (''Miyako rinsen meisho zue'') of 1799, showing the garden as it looks today. One big stone at the back was buried partly; it has two first names carved in it, probably names of untouchable stone workers, so called  ''kawaramono''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuitert, ''Themes, Scenes, and Taste, in the History of Japanese Garden Art'', pp. 114–124 and 293–295.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence of Zen monks having worked on the garden, apart from the raking of the sand.

==Zen garden==

[[File:Ryoan-ji-Garden-2018.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;
The temple's name is synonymous with the temple's famous Zen garden, the ''[[Zen garden|karesansui]]'' (dry landscape) [[Japanese rock garden|rock garden]], thought{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to have been built in the late 15th century.

The garden is a rectangle of {{convert|248|m2|ft2|adj=off|sp=us|abbr=off}}. Young and Young put the size at twenty-five meters by ten meters. Placed within it are fifteen stones of different sizes, carefully composed in five groups; one group of five stones, two groups of three, and two groups of two stones. The stones are surrounded by white gravel, which is carefully raked each day by the monks.  The only vegetation in the garden is some moss around the stones.

The garden is meant to be viewed from a seated position on the veranda of the ''hōjō'', the residence of the abbot of the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, ''Le Jardin Japonais'', pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stones are placed so that the entire composition cannot be seen at once from the veranda. They are also arranged so that when looking at the garden from any angle (other than from above) only fourteen of the boulders are visible at one time. It is traditionally said that only through attaining enlightenment would one be able to view the fifteenth boulder.

The wall behind the garden is an important element of the garden. It is made of clay, which has been stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones. In 1977, the tile roof of the wall was restored with tree bark to its original appearance.&lt;ref name="Young, pg. 108-109"/&gt;

When the garden was rebuilt in 1799, it came up higher than before and a view over the wall to the mountain scenery behind came about. At present this view is blocked by trees.&lt;ref&gt;Kuitert, ''Themes, Scenes, and Taste, in the History of Japanese Garden Art'', pp. 122, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden had particular significance for the composer [[John Cage]], who composed a series of works and made visual art works based on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last=Whittington |first=Stephen | url=https://www.academia.edu/7319210/Whittington_Digging_In_John_Cages_Garden|title= Digging in John Cage's Garden – Cage and Ryoanji | publisher=Malaysian Music Journal|date= |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of the garden===

Like any work of art, the artistic garden of Ryōan-ji is also open to interpretation, or scientific research into possible meanings. Many different theories have been put forward inside and outside Japan about what the garden is supposed to represent, from islands in a stream, to swimming baby tigers to the peaks of mountains rising above to theories about secrets of geometry or of the rules of equilibrium of odd numbers. Garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote: "The garden at Ryōan-ji does not symbolize anything, or more precisely, to avoid any misunderstanding, the garden of Ryōan-ji does not symbolize, nor does it have the value of reproducing a natural beauty that one can find in the real or mythical world. I consider it to be an abstract composition of 'natural' objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite meditation."&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke,  Le jardin Japonais", pg. 92. Translation of this citation from French by D. R. Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific analysis of the garden===

In an article published by the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Gert van Tonder and Michael Lyons analyze the rock garden by generating a model of [[shape analysis (digital geometry)|shape analysis]] ([[medial axis]]) in early visual processing.

Using this model, they show that the empty space of the garden is implicitly structured, and is aligned with the temple's [[architecture]]. According to the researchers, one critical [[axis of symmetry]] passes close to the centre of the main hall, which is the traditionally preferred viewing point. In essence, viewing the placement of the stones from a sightline along this point brings a shape from nature (a dichotomously branched tree with a mean branch length decreasing monotonically from the trunk to the tertiary level) in relief.

The researchers propose that the implicit structure of the garden is designed to appeal to the viewer's unconscious visual sensitivity to axial-symmetry skeletons of stimulus shapes. In support of their findings, they found that imposing a [[random]] perturbation of the locations of individual rock features destroyed the special characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Van Tonder | first = Gert J. | authorlink =  |author2=Michael J.

Centuries after its creation, the influences of the dry elements at Ryōan-ji continue to be reflected and re-examined in garden design—for example, in the ''Japangarten'' at the Art Museum at [[Wolfsburg]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstmuseum-wolfsburg.de/ Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg], [http://www.kunstmuseum-wolfsburg.de/special/8/ Japanese garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718011933/http://www.kunstmuseum-wolfsburg.de/special/8/ |date=2011-07-18 }}; Kazuhisa Kawamura, [http://www.kawa-mura.de/garten/kunstmuseumwolfsburg.html "''Japangarten im Hof des Kunstmuseums Wolfsburg''" (Japanese garden in the courtyard of the Museum of Art at Wolfsburg);] excerpt, "''Die Proportion, die Dimension und die Art der Gestaltung beider Gärten sind fast identisch.''" (The proportion, the dimension and nature of the design of both gardens are almost identical).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other gardens===
{{Speculation section}}{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
[[Image:Tsukubai2.JPG|thumb|upright|Ryōan-ji's ''[[tsukubai]]'', the basin provided for ritual washing of the hands and mouth]] 
While the rock garden is the best-known garden of Ryōan-ji, the temple also has a water garden; the Kyoyochi Pond, built in the 12th century as part of the Fujiwara estate. Cherry trees have recently been planted northwest of the pond.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Ryōan-ji also has a teahouse and tea garden, dating to the 17th century. Near the teahouse is a famous stone water basin, with water continually flowing for ritual purification. 
This is the Ryōan-ji ''[[tsukubai]]'', which translates as "crouch"; because of the low height of the basin, the user must bend over to use it, in a sign of reverence and humility.&lt;ref name="gustafson"&gt;Gustafson, Herb L. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=oGirDlmSIJwC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Tsukubai&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2o-eRkCuxYKY53911T78_T_BgRKA  ''The Art of Japanese Gardens: Designing &amp; Making Your Own Peaceful Space'', p. 78.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[kanji]] written on the surface of the stone basin, 五, 隹, 止, 矢,  are without significance when read alone. Though the water basin's frame is circular, the opening in the circular face is itself a square (口). If each of the four kanji is read in combination with 口 (the square-shaped [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] is pronounced ''kuchi'', meaning "mouth" or "aperture"), which the square opening is meant to represent, then the characters become 吾, 唯, 足, 知. This is read as "ware, tada taru (wo) shiru", which translates literally as "I only sufficiency know" (吾 = ware = I, 唯 = tada = merely, only, 足 = taru = be sufficient, suffice, be enough, be worth, deserve, 知 = shiru = know)&lt;ref name="gustafson"/&gt; or, more poetically, as "I know only satisfaction". Intended to reinforce Buddhist teachings regarding humility and the abundance within one's soul, the meaning is simple and clear: "one already has all one needs". Meanwhile, the positioning of the ''tsukubai'', lower than the veranda on which one stands to view it, compels one to bow respectfully (while listening to the endless trickle of replenishing water from the bamboo pipe) to fully appreciate its deeper philosophical significance.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The ''tsukubai'' also embodies a subtle form of Zen teaching using ironic [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]: while the ''shape'' mimics an ancient [[Chinese coin]], the ''sentiment'' is the opposite of [[materialism]]. Thus, over many centuries, the ''tsukubai'' has also served as a humorous visual [[koan]] for countless monks residing at the temple, gently reminding them daily of their [[vow of poverty]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Notwithstanding the exquisite ''kare sansui'' rock garden on the opposite side of the building, the less-photographed Ryōan-ji tea garden is one of the most sublime and ''valued'' cultural treasures the temple offers to the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Some scholars prefer the terms "'''sacred sex'''" or "'''sacred sexual rites'''" to "sacred prostitution" in cases where payment for services was not involved. 

==Ancient Near East==
[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] depicted wearing the ceremonial [[headdress]] of the [[high priestess]]]]
[[Ancient Near East]]ern societies along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers featured many shrines and temples or ''houses of heaven'' dedicated to various [[deities]]. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the [[Hellenistic Period]] and [[Late Antiquity]] suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in [[Babylonia]] and [[Cyprus]], but throughout the [[Near East]].

According to [[Herodotus]], the rites performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of [[Aphrodite]] and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.  But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, "I invite you in the name of [[Mylitta]]".  It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.199 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The British anthropologist [[James Frazer]] accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915),&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', abridged edition (1922), [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]; see also the more extensive treatment in the 3rd edition of ''The Golden Bough'', volumes 5 and 6 (published 1914). Frazer's argument and citations are reproduced in slightly clearer fashion by Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public [[defloration]] of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of [[Late Antiquity]] (i.e. 150–500 AD), not from the Classical or [[Hellenistic period]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] are the only sources mentioned by Frazer that were active prior to the 2nd century AD; his other sources include [[Deipnosophistae|Athenaeus]], [[De Dea Syria|pseudo-Lucian]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and the Christian church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople]].&lt;/ref&gt; This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did. 

The research of Daniel Arnaud, Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, Julia Assante, Stephanie Budin&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt; and others has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth—arguing that the practices described in the sources simply never existed. A more nuanced view, espoused by Pirenne-Delforge, suggests that ritual sex did exist in the Near East, but not in the Greek or Roman worlds in classical or Hellenistic times.&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt;

===Sacred marriage===

The practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any [[Ancient Near East]]ern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of ''sacred marriage'' rite or ''[[hieros gamos]]'' was staged between the king of a [[Sumer]]ian city-state and the High Priestess of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning ''house of heaven''&lt;ref&gt;é-an-na = sanctuary ('house' + 'Heaven'[='An'] + genitive) [John Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon v. 3.0 – see link below]&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Inanna]] in the Eanna District of [[Uruk]].&lt;ref&gt;Modern-day [[Warka (Iraq)|Warka]], Biblical [[Erech]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there may well have been some religious prostitution in the temples of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]], Assante suggests the concept of the 'sacred marriage' (''[[hieros gamos]]'') has been misunderstood. It was previously believed to have been a custom whereby the king coupled with the high priestess to represent the union of [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] with [[Inanna]] (later called [[Ishtar]]).&lt;ref name=Day_2004&gt;John Day, "Does the Old Testament Refer to Sacred Prostitution and Did it Actually Exist in Ancient Israel?", in ''Biblical and Near Eastern Essays: Studies in Honour of Kevin J. Cathcart'', eds. Carmel McCarthy &amp; John F Healey (Continuum International Publishing, 2004), 2–21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more likely that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Middle Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess [[Ishtar]] often speak of him as running 320 kilometres, offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god [[Utu]], and receiving a royal crown from [[Anu|An]], all in a single day. One scholar comments: "No one, to the best of my knowledge, has been so wooden-minded to propose that human actors played the role of Utu and An at the banquet."&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R.

Other modern historians argue that the temple did house priestesses of the goddess, but there is no evidence that they performed any kind of sexual services in any [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Budin, Stephanie Lynn, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Assante, Julia 1998.

===Code of Hammurabi===
In [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]], the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected.  The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;The Sacred Prostitute: Eternal Aspect of the Feminine By Nancy Qualls-Corbett&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew Bible===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] uses two different words for prostitute, ''zonah'' (זונה)&amp;lrm;&lt;ref name="zanah"&gt;Associated with the corresponding verb ''zanah''.{{cite web|title=Genesis 1:1 (KJV)|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h2181|website=[[Blue Letter Bible]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|language=en}} incorporating [[Strong's concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857). Also transliterated ''qĕdeshah'', ''q&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;deshah'', ''qědēšā'' ,''qedashah'', ''kadeshah'', ''kadesha'', ''qedesha'', ''kdesha''. A modern liturgical pronunciation would be ''k'deysha''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kedeshah'' (or ''qedesha'') (קדשה)&amp;lrm;.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; The word ''zonah'' simply meant an ordinary prostitute or ''loose woman''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; But the word ''kedeshah'' literally means ''consecrated'' (feminine form), from the Semitic root ''[[Q-D-Sh|q-d-sh]]'' (קדש)&amp;lrm; meaning ''holy'' or ''set apart''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; In spite of the cultic significance of a ''kedeshah'' to a follower of the [[Canaanite religion]], two verses makes it clear that cultic prostitution had no place within Yahweh's worship. {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17-18|NIV}}:

{{quote|None of the daughters of Israel shall be a ''kedeshah'', nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a ''kadesh''.

You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute (''zonah'') or the wages of a dog (''kelev'') into the house of the Lord your God to pay a vow, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God.}}

[[Stephen O. Murray]] writes that biblical passages ban ''qdeshim'' and link them with gods and "forms of worship detested by orthodox followers of Yahweh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Stephen O. |title=Homosexualities |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |page=295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCikDlcEHw8C|isbn=9780226551951 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Celia Brewer Sinclair has written that "the ethical demands of the covenant preclude worshiping Yahweh in licentious sexual rites (sacred sexual rites )".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sinclair |first1=Mashal |last2=Brewer |first2=Celia |title=A Guide Through the Old Testament |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1989 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NopUi53PC0YC|isbn=9780804201247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male priests who engaged in same-sex sacred prostitution were called ''kadesh'' or ''qadesh'' (literally: male ''holy one''); the word evolved semantically in ancient Hebrew to take on a similar meaning to ''sodomite''.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho1.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 1 The Ancient Hebrews|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}} The Hebrew word ''kelev'' (dog) in the next line may also signify a male dancer or prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h3611 Lexicon results for ''kelev'' (Strong's H3611)], incorporating [[Strong's Concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars see the injunctions against foreign worship, including male sacred prostitution, as possibly the original cause of what would later become Judaism's condemnation of sexual contact between men.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"/&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}}

The Law of Moses (Deuteronomy) was not universally observed in Hebrew culture under the rule of King David's dynasty, as recorded in Kings.  In fact Judah had lost "the Book of the Law".  During the reign of King Josiah, The high priest Hilkiah discovers it in "the House of the Lord" and realizes that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding Sacred Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 22:8&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Marvin A. King Josiah of Judah, Oxford University Press, 2001, p.137. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513324-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of male temple prostitution ("sodomites" [KJV, GNV]) being banned under King Josiah are recorded to have been commonplace since the reign of King Rehoboam of Judah (King Solomon's son). &lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 14:24, 1 Kings 15:12 and 2 Kings 23:7 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Modern bible translations refer to King Josiah's bans on "male temple prostitutes" [NRSV] or similarly "male shrine prostitutes" [NIV], where as older translations refer to the ban of "Sodomites" and "the Houses of the Sodomites" [KJV, GNV].  Under the polytheistic religious practices that were commonplace, homosexuality experienced a degree of cultural acceptance along with heterosexuality among the Hebrew tribes, but sacred prostitution was not allowed in conjunction with the worship of Yahweh, where these had been expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy, their sacred Book of Law under King Josiah.

In the [[Book of Ezekiel]], [[Oholah and Oholibah]] appear as the allegorical brides of God who represent [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and Jerusalem. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. The prophet Ezekiel condemns both as guilty of religious and political alliance with heathen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=OHOLIBAH|title=NETBible: Oholibah|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So within Hebrew cultures involving pagan religions, both homosexual and heterosexual pagan temple prostitution experienced periods of acceptance, and periods of banishment, as under King Josiah.

===Sumer===
According to the noted Assyriologist [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of [[Sumer]] established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival [[Akitu]].&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sacred Marriage Rite: Aspects of Faith, Myth and Ritual in Ancient Sumer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittites===
The [[Hittites]] practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.&lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr Singh, ''Divine Prostitution'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nYEdPoGAaz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 6], (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greece and Hellenistic World ==

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Greece#Temple prostitution in Corinth}}
In [[ancient Greece]], sacred prostitution was known in the city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] where the [[Temple of Aphrodite (Corinth)|Temple of Aphrodite]] employed a significant number of female servants, ''hetairai'', during [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Strabo|title=Geographica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/8F*.html|location=VIII.6.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''hierodoulos'' or ''hierodule'' has sometimes been taken to mean ''sacred holy woman'', but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be ''dedicated'' to a god.&lt;ref name = "Budin"&gt;Stephanie Budin, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009); more briefly the case that there was no sacred prostitution in Greco-Roman Ephesus by S.M. Baugh (1999) http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/42/42-3/42-3-pp443-460_JETS.pdf; see also the book review by Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-04-28.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review, April 28, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic world===
In the Greek-influenced and colonized world, "sacred prostitution" was known in [[Cyprus]] (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), [[Sicily]] (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] (8th century BC) and in [[Cappadocia]] (c. 330 BC hellenized).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Ancient Rome and late antiquity==

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome#Prostitution and religion}}

===Late antiquity===
The Roman emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] closed down a number of temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian [[Eusebius]] proudly noted.&lt;ref name="3.55" /&gt; [[Eusebius]] also claimed that the [[Phoenicia]]n cities of [[Afqa|Aphaca]] and [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] ([[Baalbek]]) continued to practise temple prostitution until the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===India===
In Southern [[India]] and the eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child hierodulic servitude?|url=http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm|website=[[Anti-Slavery Society]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102084104/http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm |archive-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt; The devadasis were originally seen as intercessors who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods. Though they did develop sexual relations with other men, they were not looked upon with lust. The system was criticised by British rulers, leading to decline in support for the system and the devadasis were forced into entering prostitution for survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fq5rDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=devadasi+sexual+relations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBsOfhq5HdAhWBeisKHbRCDSMQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=devadasi%20sexual%20relations&amp;f=false Women, Music, Culture: An Introduction] by Julie C. Dunbar, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have stated that the Hindu scriptures do not permit or mention the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vF5jDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT106&amp;dq=devadasi+hindu+scriptures&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5tYrir5HdAhXabSsKHZkZDp8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=devadasi%20hindu%20scriptures&amp;f=false Women and religion: Contemporary and future challenges in the Global Era] edited by Elisabetta Ruspini &amp; Glenda Tibe Bonifacio, Policy Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Various state governments in [[India]] enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

===Japan===
Sacred prostitution was once practised by the [[Miko]] within traditional [[Shinto]] in [[Japan]]. There were once Shinto beliefs that prostitution was sacred, and there used to be lodgings for the temple prostitutes on the shrine grounds. This traditional practise came to an end during the beginning of the [[Meiji era]], due to the encroachment of Western Christian morality, and the government implementing the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]''; which, among other things, drastically decreased the roles of the Miko, and modified Shinto beliefs until it became what is now colloquially referred to as [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuzoku-style-jp.com/history/shinto.html Ways of thinking that connect religion and prostitution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuly |first1=Lisa |title=Locating Transcendence in Japanese Minzoku Geinô : Yamabushi and Miko Kagura |journal=Ethnologies |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=198 |doi=10.7202/007130ar |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ethno/2003/v25/n1/007130ar.html |language=en |issn=1481-5974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, some religious cults practiced sacred prostitution as an instrument to recruit new converts.

In [[Ventura County]], California, Wilbur and [[Mary Ellen Tracy]] established their own temple, the ''Church Of The Most High Goddess'', in the wake of what they described as a divine revelation.

'''Shipping''', initially derived from the word [[wikt:relationship|relationship]], is the desire by fans for two or more people, either real-life people or fictional characters (in film, literature, television etc.) to be in a romantic relationship. It is considered a general term for fans' emotional involvement with the ongoing development of a relationship in a work of [[fiction]]. Shipping often takes the form of creative works, including [[fan fiction|fanfiction]] and [[fan art]], most often published on the [[internet]]. However, shipping can involve virtually any kind of relationship- from the well-known and established, through the ambiguous or those undergoing development, and even all the way to the highly improbable and the blatantly impossible.

==Etymology==
{{Original research section|date=June 2015}}
The activity of fans creating relationships for fictional characters far predates the term. The first "ship" that became widely popular and accepted was the characters Kirk and Spock from the television show ''[[Star Trek]]''. This began in the mid-1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf |title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan and Zine History, 1967-1987, 2nd edition |first=Joan Marie |last=Verba |year=2003 |pages=18–19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612150423/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf|archive-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was often referred to as [[Kirk/Spock]], and later "K/S". This is why relationships between two men are now often referred to as "slash".

The actual term "shipping" saw its origin around 1995 by internet fans of the TV show ''[[The X-Files]]'', who believed the two main characters, [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]], should be or were engaged in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shipper?s=t|title="shipper".

The oldest uses of the noun ''ship'' (according to this definition of the word) and the noun ''shipper'', as recorded by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], date back to 1996 postings on the [[Usenet]] group ''alt.tv.x-files''; ''shipping'' is first attested slightly later, in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|ship, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|shipper, n.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|shipping, n.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the verb ''to ship'' in 1998. &lt;ref&gt;{{OED|ship, v.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation and terminology==
"Ship" and its derivatives in this context have since come to be in wide and versatile use. "Shipping" refers to the phenomenon; a "ship" is the concept of a fictional couple; to "ship" a couple means to have an affinity for it in one way or another; a "shipper" or a "fangirl/boy" is somebody significantly involved with such an affinity; a "Shipping war" is when two ships contradict each other, causing fans of each ship to argue. A ship that a particular fan prefers over all others is called OTP for ''one true pairing''.
 
When discussing shipping, a ship that has been confirmed by its series is called a ''[[canon (fiction)|canon]] ship'' or ''sailed ship'', whereas a ''sunk ship'' is a ship that has been proven unable to exist in canon.

===Naming conventions===
Various naming conventions have developed in different online communities to refer to prospective couples, likely due to the ambiguity and cumbersomeness of the "Character 1 and Character 2" format. The first method deployed was using a slash, first used for Kirk/Spock. This is today mainly used for same-sex ships, fanfiction with these pairings is known as [[Slash fiction]], due to fame of slash, the standard for hetero ships in fan fiction became a plus sign (Harry+Hermione), but ! or x can also used be as separators in place of +. Other methods of identifying relationships between characters often create hybrid terms such as [[portmanteau]]s and [[clipped compound]]s to abbreviate character pairings. For example, Drarry forms a clipped compound, abbreviated from the complete names Draco and Harry. These combinations often follow systematic phonological principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=231–243|journal=Names: A Journal of Onomastics|author=DiGirolamo, Cara M.|publisher=American Name Society|year=2012|title=The Fandom Pairing Name: Blends and the Phonology Orthography Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fandom-specific variants exist and often use fandom-specific terminology. These often employ words that describe the relationship between characters in the context of the fictional universe and simply add the word "Shipping" to the end. Other terminology can be more vague, using codes and nicknames as a ship name.

==Non-conventional ships==
Shipping may defy classical social standards and be [[taboo]].

=== [[Same-sex relationship|Same-sex]] ===
{{Main article|Slash fiction}}
Within shipping, [[homosexual|same-sex]] pairings are popular; they are sometimes known as "[[Slash fiction|slash]] and [[femslash]]". Within the anime/manga fandom, borrowed Japanese terms such as [[yaoi]] and [[yuri (genre)|yuri]] may be used. A person who supports same-sex pairings and reads or writes [[slash fiction]] may be referred to as a "slasher".

The term "slash" predates the use of "shipping" by at least some 20 years. It was originally coined as a term to describe a pairing of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and [[Spock]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'', [[Kirk/Spock]] (or "K/S"; sometimes spoken "Kirk-slash-Spock", whence "slash") homosexual [[fan fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/02/1072908900255.html "Fanfic: is it right to write?"] from [http://www.theage.com.au/index.html The Age] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120011048/http://www.theage.com.au/index.html |date=November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time in the late 1970s and early 1980s, "K/S" was used to describe such fan fiction, regardless of whether or not they were related to ''Star Trek'', and eventually "slash" became a universal term to describe all homosexual themed fan works.

Parallel to this development, the term "slash" was also being used in some fandoms to denote fan fiction or other fan works depicting sexual acts with an implied rating of [[NC-17]], whether homosexual or heterosexual. It is likely that this is the same "slash" term born of the ''Star Trek'' fandom, but adapted to the pornographic focus that commonly dominates fanfiction and fan works in the Kirk/Spock ship, as well as the various ships of other same-sex couples. This caused the term to spread to heterosexual ships.

=== [[Polyamory]] ===
[[Love triangles]] are commonly used as a [[plot device]] to cause conflict in the story. The easy way around this is to pair all three together, or one member with both potential romantic partners. This is not to be confused with a [[Harem_(genre)|harem]], which is usually just a single character being sought out by many others. Situations such as that may be the one to ''cause'' a polyamory relationship. Polyamory is not always caused by love triangles, but those that don't tend to be less accepted by the fandom.

=== [[Interspecies friendship|Interspecies]] ===
Interspecies, which is usually displayed in fandoms of media consisting of animals of various species, is usually not controversial until a human is paired with a non-humanoid, sapient character. It is especially controversial when between a human and an animal or furry. Some consider such pairings [[zoophilia|bestiality]].

=== [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|Age difference]] ===
Controversial age differences have a wide range. An elderly adult with a young adult, anyone with an immortal or slowly-ageing being, teenagers with young adults, or pedophiliacs are all part of this category. However, in anime or manga like [[Hetalia: Axis Powers|Hetalia]] in which the characters are personified countries, there are large age gaps, sometimes of hundreds of years, then shipping between characters of many different ages is widely accepted in the [[fandom]]. Some shippers, of course, may be referring to the given "human" ages of the countries. Using these human ages gives way to a smaller age gap.

=== [[Love–hate relationship|Love-hate]] ===
Romances between two characters who canonically hate each other also occur. It is often interpreted that the characters share sexual tension between each other. An example would be pairing [[Daniel LaRusso]] and [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|his bully and rival Johnny]] from [[The Karate Kid]]. This is one of the most popular types of shipping.

Another example of non-conventional shipping is in the ''[[Homestuck fandom]]'', which introduced three new shipping categories: '''Kismesissitude''' or ''hate-love'' (a deep-rooted rivalry), '''Moirallegiance''' (a deep, very powerful [[platonic love|platonic]] friendship), and '''Auspisticism''' (a three-person relationship created between two would-be rivals and a peer mediator). Those in the ''[[Homestuck fandom]]'' refer to the usual romantic relationship as '''matespritship'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004293|title=MS Paint Adventures|author=|date=|website=www.mspaintadventures.com|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable fandoms==
&lt;!-- STOP. Do not automatically add a fandom here only because it's popular, or it happens to have ship debate in it, or you happen to have participated in it. Wikipedia is NOT an indiscriminate collection of information, and another subsection here followed by a list of ships a certain fandom has and a description of who is at the throat of whom does NOT benefit this article and will terribly clutter it in the long run. Before you add a fandom here, consider:

1. How is the shipping in this fandom unique/notable? Can you describe something that makes this particular fandom's ship conflicts stand out?

2. How do the particular aspects of this fandom better illuminate/flesh out the shipping phenomenon?

3. There is a HUGE importance to whether or not you can cite /author response/, the actual artist in question being aware and responding to the shipping conflict. This unequivocally establishes that shipping is not a fringe phenomenon that somebody just happened to start a fancruft wikipage of.

In general, unless a fandom happens to be an outstandingly strong example of something already described in the article or have some other unique non-trivial aspect to its shipping culture, there's no reason to adding it here. This article is called "shipping" and is here to inform about the phenomenon, not any particular fandom that happens to house it- at least not in and of itself. --&gt;

===''Daria'' fandom===
''[[Daria]]'' fandom was marked through its entire run by shipper debate. From the series' first season, the main conflict was over whether the title character, [[Daria Morgendorffer]], should have a relationship with Trent Lane, a slacker rock-band frontman, whom Daria met through his sister, Jane. A common argument against this possible outcome was that such a development would signal a turn away from the more subversive aspects of Daria's character, such as bitter criticism of romantic relationships, and thus the show.

The show's writers responded{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} by having Daria develop a crush on Trent. Trent, however, remained involved with his off-and-on girlfriend Monique, who immediately became a target of shipper ire. The crush ended in the third season's finale, "Jane's Addition", when Daria realized that Trent could never satisfy her in the long run.

That same episode introduced Tom Sloane, a charming and intellectual son of privilege. Although Tom became Jane's boyfriend, threatening Daria and Jane's friendship in the process, Daria and Tom warmed up to each other throughout the fourth season, leading up to its finale, "Dye! Dye! My Darling," broadcast August 2, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outpost-daria.com/ep413.html |title=Episode #413: "Dye! Dye! My Darling" |publisher=Outpost Daria |date=August 2, 2000 |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Jane and Tom's relationship in crisis, a heated argument between Daria and Tom led up to a kiss in Tom's car. In the TV movie ''Is it Fall Yet?'', Daria decided to begin a relationship with Tom, and Daria and Jane patched up their friendship.

This caused an instant uproar, and conversation now turned to whether Tom was more appropriate than Trent had been. The debate was satirized by the show's writers in a piece on MTV's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/daria/chapter2/guy.jhtml |title=DARIA Definitive Chapter 3 |publisher=MTV.com |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=July 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102140841/http://www.mtv.com/onair/daria/chapter2/guy.jhtml |archivedate=November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interviews done after the series' run, series co-creator [[Glenn Eichler]] revealed that "any viewer who really thought that Daria and Trent could (have) a relationship was just not watching the show we were making,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-wildone.com/dvdaria/glennanswers.html |title=DVDaria Petition&amp;nbsp;– Buy Daria DVDs! |publisher=The-wildone.com |date=March 16, 2005 |accessdate=July 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822210542/http://www.the-wildone.com/dvdaria/glennanswers.html |archivedate=August 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom came about because "going into our fourth year... I thought it was really pushing credibility for Daria to have only had one or two dates during her whole high school career," and "teaser" episodes like "Pierce Me" were "intended to provide some fun for that portion of the audience that was so invested in the romance angle. The fact that those moments were few and far between should have given some indication that the series was not about Daria's love life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-wildone.com/dvdaria/glennfollowup4.html |title=DVDaria Petition&amp;nbsp;– Buy Daria DVDs! |publisher=The-wildone.com |date=January 2, 2006 |accessdate=July 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225142030/http://www.the-wildone.com/dvdaria/glennfollowup4.html |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Potter'' fandom===
The ''Harry Potter'' series' most contentious ship debates came from supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]], supporters of Hermione having a romantic relationship with Draco Malfoy, a primary antagonist, and supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both Harry and Hermione. Author [[J.K. Rowling]] appeared to try to tamp down the possibility, stating at one point that Harry and Hermione "are very platonic friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=October 20, 1999 |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative was of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister, whose obvious crush on him served as a plot-line starting in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Hermione informs Harry that Ginny has "given up" on him. In the subsequent ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', however, Harry develops a crush on Ginny, convinced that he has missed his opportunity with her. In the end Ginny turns out to never have given up on Harry after all, but merely taken Hermione's advice to try to date other boys to boost her self-confidence. Though their romantic relationship becomes one of the few sources of comfort in Harry's difficult life, he makes a decision to end it for fear that Voldemort would learn of it and target Ginny. Rowling later commented that she had planned Ginny as Harry's "ideal girl" from the very beginning.

An interview with J.K. Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the release of ''Half-Blood Prince'' caused significant controversy within the fandom. In the interview, Spartz stated that Harry/Hermione fans were delusional, to which Rowling responded that they were "still valued members of her readership", but that there had been "anvil-sized hints" for future Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny relationships, and that Harry/Hermione shippers needed to re-read the books. This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers, some of whom announced that they would return their copies of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' and boycott future ''Harry Potter'' books, leveling criticism at Spartz, Anelli, and Rowling herself. The uproar was the subject of an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=If you’re an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn’t the problem. It’s Hermione versus Ginny. |author= |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= August 3, 2005|accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated. In that same interview, she stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=July 16, 2005 |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Well, you see, I'm a relative newcomer to the world of shipping, because for a long time, I didn't go on the net and look up Harry Potter. A long time. Occasionally I had to, because there were weird news stories or something that I would have to go and check, because I was supposed to have said something I hadn’t said. I had never gone and looked at fan sites, and then one day I did and oh&amp;nbsp;– my&amp;nbsp;– god. Five hours later or something, I get up from the computer shaking slightly [all laugh]. ‘What is going on?’ And it was during that first mammoth session that I met the shippers, and it was a most extraordinary thing. I had no idea there was this huge underworld seething beneath me.}}

The release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' in July 2007 saw an epilogue, nineteen years after the events at the focus of the series, where Harry and Ginny are married and have three children, Lily, James, and Albus, and Ron and Hermione are also married and have two, Rose and Hugo.

Rowling stated in an interview in February 2014 in ''Wonderland'' Magazine that she thought that realistically Hermione and Ron had "too much fundamental incompatibility". She stated that Hermione and Ron were written together "as a form of wish fulfillment" as way to reconcile a relationship she herself was once in. She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counseling Ron and Hermione would have been all right.&lt;ref&gt;West, Kelly.

Retrieved on October 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She also went on to say in a talk at Exeter University that Harry's love for Ginny is true,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filthysquib.tumblr.com/post/76130596653/ive-just-got-back-from-the-jk-rowling-lecture|title=I've just got back from the JK Rowling lecture and...|author=|date=|website=study like hermione|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby denying any potential canon relationship between Harry and Hermione.

===''Xena: Warrior Princess'' fandom===
The 1995–2001 action/fantasy TV series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' often saw "shipping wars" that turned especially intense due to spillover from real-life debates about [[homosexuality]] and [[gay rights]].

Shortly after the series' debut, fans started discussing the possibility of a relationship between [[Xena]] and her sidekick and best friend [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]]. Toward the end of the first season, the show's producers began to play to this perception by deliberately inserting usually humorous lesbian innuendo into some episodes. The show acquired a cult following in the lesbian community. However, Xena had a number of male love interests as well, and from the first season she had an adversarial but sexually charged dynamic with [[Ares (television character)|Ares]], the God of War, who frequently tried to win her over as his "Warrior Queen". Gabrielle herself had once had a male husband, and his death deeply affected her.

According to journalist [[Cathy Young]], the quarrel between online fans of the show about whether there should be a relationship between Xena and Gabrielle had a sociopolitical angle, in which some on the anti-relationship side were "undoubtedly driven by bona fide bigotry", while some on the pro-relationship side were lesbians who "approached the argument as a real-life gay rights struggle" in which "denying a sexual relationship between Xena and Gabrielle was tantamount to denying the reality of their own lives".&lt;ref name="what we owe xena"&gt;{{cite web|title=What we owe Xena |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2005/09/15/xena/index2.html |work=Salon |first=Cathy |last=Young |date=September 1, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206134719/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2005/09/15/xena/index2.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She added:

{{cquote|In a way, knowing that the staff paid attention to fan opinions may have made matters worse: There was an incentive for the rival groups to out-shout one another to make themselves heard. Many fans who had no appetite for these wars fled the online fandom. Storylines that were seen as betraying the subtext, particularly the Xena-Ares relationship in the fifth season, were met with intense hostility from a small but vocal group; at other times, non-subtext fans grumbled about what they saw as pandering to the pro-subtext fan base (such as several sixth-season episodes emphasizing Xena and Gabrielle's transcendent bond as soul mates).&lt;ref name="what we owe xena" /&gt;}}

In 2000, during the airing of the fifth season, the intensity and sometimes nastiness of the "shipping wars" in the Xena fandom was chronicled (from a non-subtexter's point of view) by Australian artist Nancy Lorenz in an article titled "The Discrimination in the Xenaverse" in the online ''Xena'' fan magazine ''Whoosh!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoosh.org/issue43/lorenz1.html|title=The Discrimination in the XenaVerse: News and Views from the Great Divide|author=|date=|website=www.whoosh.org|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in numerous letters in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whoosh.org/issue44/letter44.html|title=Whoosh! Letters to the Editor: Issue 44 Part 1/4|author=|date=|website=whoosh.org|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wars did not abate after the series came to an end in 2001. With no new material from the show itself, the debates were further fueled by various statements from the cast and crew. In January 2003, [[Lucy Lawless]], the show's star, told ''Lesbian News'' magazine that after watching the series finale (in which Gabrielle revived Xena with a mouth-to-mouth water transfer filmed to look like a full kiss) she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle's relationship was "definitely gay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucylawless.info/articles/lesnews03/index.html|title=AUSXIP Lucy Lawless - Lesbian News 2003|author=|date=|website=lucylawless.info|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the interviews and commentaries on the DVD sets released in 2003–2005, the actors, writers and producers continued to stress the ambiguity of the relationship, and in several interviews both Lawless and [[Renee O'Connor]], who played Gabrielle, spoke of Ares as a principal love interest for Xena. In the interview for the Season 6 episode "Coming Home", O'Connor commented, "If there was ever going to be one man in Xena's life, it would be Ares."

In March 2005, one-time ''Xena'' screenwriter [[Katherine Fugate]], an outspoken supporter of the Xena/Gabrielle pairing, posted a statement on her website appealing for tolerance in the fandom:

{{cquote|The show existed as it did, when it did. And it enabled many to be empowered on many levels, for many walks of life. So if one definition doesn't work for you, then discard it. If it does, hold it gently. But please, allow everyone the grace to take what they need from the show and make it theirs. Let them have what moved them&amp;nbsp;– be it that Xena was in love with Gabrielle or Xena was in love with Ares. Please stop the arguing and name-calling and need to be right, because in the end, the show worked, it healed, it changed lives, it created new friendships, new loves and new thought, and it was bloody fantastic. And that's what matters. That it simply lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katherinefugate.com/katresponds/katherineresponds30.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230022649/http://www.katherinefugate.com/katresponds/katherineresponds30.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Biography ==

Weinstein did his undergraduate work at [[Princeton University]], graduating with honours in Philosophy.  After several years of writing, recording, and performing music, he returned to academic work, obtaining his Ph.D. in Philosophy from [[Northwestern University]] in 1998, supervised by [[Arthur Fine]]. He is presently a professor in the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Waterloo]], with a cross-appointment in Physics.  He is also an Affiliate member of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]].

== Research ==

His research is in  the interpretation of quantum theory and the nature of space, time, and space-time.  He has explored the possibility of multiple time dimensions.  In a joint paper with Walter Craig, they gave the first well-posed initial value problem for the wave equation in more than one time dimension (the [[ultrahyperbolic equation]]).  He has written critically on anthropic reasoning in cosmology, and most recently was the co-recipient (along with [[George Francis Rayner Ellis]]) of the 2nd Prize in the [[Foundational Questions Institute]] (FQXi) essay contest on "Questioning the Foundations" for his paper Patterns in the fabric of nature, which proposes that non-local constraints may play a role in fundamental physics and may help explain both large-scale (cosmological) and small-scale (quantum) correlations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Questioning the Foundations of Physics: Which of Our Fundamental Assumptions Are Wrong?|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iOJnBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer|date = 2015-01-24|isbn = 9783319130453|language = en|first = Anthony|last = Aguirre|first2 = Brendan|last2 = Foster|first3 = Zeeya|last3 = Merali}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His work on multiple time dimensions was featured on [[Through the Wormhole]] with Morgan Freeman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/through-the-wormhole/videos/through-the-wormhole-2-string-theory.htm Steven Weinstein: "String Theory"] on ''Through the Wormhole (with Morgan Freeman)'', ''[[Science (TV network)]] Season 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''Technorealism''' is an attempt to expand the middle ground between [[techno-utopianism]] and [[Neo-Luddism]] by assessing the social and political implications of [[technology|technologies]] so that people might all have more control over the shape of their [[future]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy in the Digital Age: Challenges to Political Life in Cyberspace|last=Wilhelm|first=Anthony|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0203902548|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account cited that technorealism emerged in the early 1990s and was introduced by [[Douglas Rushkoff]] and [[Andrew L. Shapiro|Andrew Shapiro]]. In a manifesto released, which described the term as a new generation of cultural criticism, it was stated that the goal was not to promote or dismiss technology but to understand it so the application could be aligned with basic human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Religious Community Online: We are One in the Network|last=Campbell|first=Heidi|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2005|isbn=0820471054|location=New York|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technorealism suggests that a technology, however revolutionary it may seem, remains a continuation of similar revolutions throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds: Culture and Politics in the Age of Cybertechnology|last=Nayar|first=Pramod|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2004|isbn=0761932283|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
The technorealist approach involves a continuous critical examination of how technologies might help or hinder people in the struggle to improve the quality of their lives, their communities, and their economic, social, and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technorealism.org/ |title=Technorealism |accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, instead of policy wonks, experts, and the elite, it is the technology critic who assumes the center stage in the discourse of technology policy issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although technorealism began with a focus on U.S.-based concerns about [[information technology]], it has evolved into an international intellectual movement with a variety of interests such as [[biotechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Berkman Center for Internet and Society 1998"&gt;{{cite paper|author =Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|title = Conference on Technorealism: How should we think about technology|date = 1998 |url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/technorealism.html| accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''topic-prominent language''' is a language that organizes its [[syntax]] to emphasize the [[topic–comment]] structure of the sentence. The term is best known in American linguistics from Charles N. Li and [[Sandra Thompson (linguist)|Sandra Thompson]], who distinguished '''topic-prominent''' languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], from subject-prominent languages, such as [[English language|English]].

In Li and Thompson's (1976) view, topic-prominent languages have morphology or syntax that highlights the distinction between the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] and the comment (what is said about the topic). Topic–comment structure may be independent of the [[word order|syntactic ordering]] of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[verb]] and [[object (grammar)|object]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Common features==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
Many topic-prominent languages share several syntactic features that have arisen because the languages have sentences that are structured around topics, rather than subjects and objects:

*They tend to downplay the role of the [[grammatical voice|passive voice]], if a passive construction exists at all, since the main idea of passivization is to turn an object into a subject in languages whose subject is understood to be the topic by default.
*They rarely have [[syntactic expletive|expletive]]s or "dummy subjects" ([[dummy pronoun|pleonastic pronoun]]s) like English ''it'' in ''It's raining''.
*They often have sentences with so-called "double subjects", actually a topic plus a subject. For example, the following sentence patterns are common in topic prominent languages:
::&lt;small&gt;(Mandarin)&lt;/small&gt; ''Zhège rén gèzi hěn gāo''.
::這個人 個子 很高。
::'''这个人 个子 很高'''。
::"This person ''(topic)'' height ''(subject)'' tall."
::&lt;small&gt;(Japanese)&lt;/small&gt; ''Sono yashi-wa happa-ga ookii.''
::その　ヤシは　葉っぱが　大きい。
::"That palm tree ''(topic)'' leaves ''(subject)'' are big."
*They do not have [[article (grammar)|articles]], which are another way of indicating old vs. new information.
*The distinction between subject and object is not reliably marked.

The Lolo–Burmese language [[Lisu language|Lisu]] has been described as highly topic-prominent,&lt;ref name="Li &amp; Thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last = Li|first = Charles N.|last2 = Thompson|first2 = Sandra A.|chapter = Subject and Topic: A New Typology of Language|title = Subject and Topic|editor = Charles N. Li|location = New York|publisher = Academic Press|pages = 457–489|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0-12-447350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sara Rosen has demonstrated that "while every clause has an identifiable topic, it is often impossible to distinguish subject from direct object or agent from patient. There are no diagnostics that reliably identify subjects (or objects) in Lisu."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rosen | first=Sara Thomas | editor=Ramchand &amp; Reiss | title=The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Interfaces | chapter = Structured Events, Structured Discourse | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2007 | isbn = 978-0-19-924745-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ambiguity is demonstrated in the following example:&lt;ref name="Li &amp; Thompson"/&gt;

In [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), the topic of the sentence, that is the focus of the sentence, is put at the beginning.  For example, in translating the English phrase "We are going to the store tomorrow", some possible ASL sentences, literally translated, could be:
*"WE GO STORE TOMORROW."
*"TOMORROW, STORE WE GO." (Topicalization, TOMORROW is the focus) 
*"*STORE, WE GO TOMORROW." (Topicalization, STORE is the focus)

Proper ASL structure, though, uses the time indicator first, so the proper ASL form would be the second one:  "TOMORROW, STORE WE GO."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43924">{{Gnosticism}}
'''Valentinianism''' was one of the major [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christian movements. Founded by [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century AD]], its influence spread extremely widely, not just within Rome, but also from Northwest Africa to Egypt through to Asia Minor and Syria in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Green 1985, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the movement's history it broke into an Eastern and a Western school. Disciples of Valentinus continued to be active into the 4th century AD, after the [[Roman Empire]] was declared to be [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;Green 1985, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinus and the Gnostic movement that bore his name were considered threats to Christianity by church leaders and Christian scholars, not only because of their influence, but also because of their doctrine, practices and beliefs. Gnostics were condemned as heretics, and prominent [[Church fathers]] such as [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] wrote against Gnosticism. Most evidence for the Valentinian theory comes from its critics and detractors, most notably Irenaeus, since he was especially concerned with refuting Valentinianism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1958, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] was born in approximately 100 AD and died in [[Alexandria]] circa 180 AD.&lt;ref name="Holroyd 1994, 32"&gt;Holroyd 1994, 32&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christian scholar [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], he was born in [[Egypt]] and schooled in Alexandria. [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c.150{{snd}}c.215), another Christian scholar and teacher, reports that Valentinus was taught by [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], a disciple of the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Roukema 1998, 129"&gt;Roukema 1998, 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was reputed to be an extremely eloquent man who possessed a great deal of charisma and had an innate ability to attract people.&lt;ref&gt;Churton 1987, 53&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Rome]] some time between AD 136 and 140, in the time of [[Pope Hyginus]], and had risen to the peak of his teaching career between AD 150 and 155, during the time of [[Pope Pius I|Pius]].&lt;ref&gt;Filoramo 1990, 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinus is said to have been a very successful teacher, and for some time in the mid-2nd century he was even a prominent and well-respected member of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] community in Rome. At one point during his career he had even hoped to attain the office of bishop, and apparently it was after he was passed over for the position that he broke from the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Roukema 1998, 129"/&gt; Valentinus was said to have been a prolific writer; however, the only surviving remains of his work come from quotes that have been transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]]. Most scholars also believe that Valentinus wrote the [[Gospel of Truth]], one of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi text]]s.&lt;ref name="Holroyd 1994, 32"/&gt;

Notable Valentinians included [[Heracleon]] (fl. ca. 175), [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], Florinus, Axionicus and [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus]].

==The Valentinian System==

The theology that Irenaeus attributed to Valentinus is extremely complicated and difficult to follow. There is some skepticism among scholars that the system actually originated with him, and many believe that the system Irenaeus was counteracting was the construct of later Valentinians.

===Synopsis===
According to Irenaeus, the Valentinians believed that at the beginning there was a [[Pleroma]] (literally, a 'fullness'). At the centre of the Pleroma was the primal Father or ''[[Bythos]]'', the beginning of all things who, after ages of silence and contemplation, projected thirty ''[[Aeon]]s'', heavenly archetypes representing fifteen [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygies]] or sexually complementary pairs. Among them was ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]''. Sophia's weakness, curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Pleroma and the creation of the world and man, both of which are flawed. Valentinians identified the [[God]] of the [[Old Testament]] as the [[Demiurge]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002, 182&lt;/ref&gt; the imperfect creator of the material world. Man, the highest being in this material world, participates in both the spiritual and the material nature. The work of redemption consists in freeing the former from the latter. One needed to recognize the Father, the ''depth of all being'', as the true source of divine power in order to achieve ''gnosis'' (knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;Pagels 1979, 37&lt;/ref&gt; The Valentinians believed that the attainment of this knowledge by the human individual had positive consequences within the universal order and contributed to restoring that order,&lt;ref&gt;Holroyd 1994, 37&lt;/ref&gt; and that gnosis, not faith, was the key to salvation. Clement wrote that the Valentinians regarded Catholic Christians “as simple people to whom they attributed faith, while they think that gnosis is in themselves. Through the excellent seed that is to be found in them, they are by nature redeemed, and their gnosis is as far removed from faith as the spiritual from the physical”.&lt;ref&gt;Roukema 1998, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeons===
The superstructure of the celestial system, the celestial world of Aeons, is here developed in the most complicated way.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=853-854}} These Aeons belong to the purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the Pleroma. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in the female Aeon Sophia.

[[Image:aeons.png|600px|center|Scheme of the Aeons]]

[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] alleges that the Valentinians “set forth their thirty aeons in mythologic fashion, thinking that they conformed to the years of Jesus”.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1903, 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight celestial beings of the ''[[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]],'' four are peculiar to the Valentinian system. The third pair of Aeons, ''[[Logos]]'' and ''Zoe,'' occur only here, and the place of this pair is not firmly established, and occur sometimes before and sometimes after the fourth pair of Aeons, the ''Anthropos'' and the ''Ekklesia''. We cannot be far wrong in suspecting that Valentinus was influenced by the prologue of the [[fourth Gospel]] (we also find the probably [[Johannine]] names ''Monogenes'' and ''[[Paraclete|Parakletos]]'' in the series of Aeons).{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}

===Sophia===
In Valentinianism, Sophia always stands absolutely at the center of the system, and in some sense she seems to represent the supreme female principle.

Sophia is the youngest of the Aeons. Observing the multitude of Aeons and the power of begetting them, she hurries back into the depth of the Father, and seeks to emulate him by producing offspring without conjugal intercourse, but only projects an abortion, a formless substance. Upon this she is cast out of Pleroma and into the primal sub-stratum of matter.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus i. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In the Valentinian systems, the fall of Sophia appears in double guise. The higher Sophia still remains within the upper world after creating a disturbance, and after her expiation and repentance; but her premature offspring, ''Sophia Achamoth'', is removed from the Pleroma, and becomes the heroine of the rest of the drama.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} This fallen Sophia becomes a world creative power.

[[File:Valentinianpleroma-Matter.png|thumb|right|320px|Plérome de Valentin, from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II.]]
Sophia Achamoth, or “Lower Wisdom”, the daughter of “Higher Wisdom”, becomes the mother of the Demiurge, identified with the God of the Old Testament. &lt;!--She dwells in the eighth heaven, the ''Ogdoad''; above her stands the Pleroma; below in the [[Seventh Heaven|seven lower heavens]] of the ''Hebdomad'' reign the seven planetary, world-creating [[Archons]].--&gt;

The Gnostics are children of Sophia; from her the heavenly seed, the divine spark, descended into this lower world, subject to the [[Destiny|''Heimarmene'']] (destiny) and in the power of hostile spirits and powers; and all their [[sacraments]] and mysteries, their formulae and symbols, must be in order to find the way upwards, back to the highest heaven. This idea that the Gnostics know themselves to be in a hostile and evil world reacted in the same direction upon the conception of Sophia. She became likewise a fallen Aeon, who has sunk down into the material world and seeks to free herself from it, receiving her liberation at the hands of a heavenly Redeemer, exactly like the Gnostics.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}

The goddess who sinks down into the material may readily be identified with ''Ruach'' (רוח), the [[Spirit]] of God, who broods over Chaos, or even with the later ''[[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]]'', who was generally conceived of as a world-creating agent.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}

This system was very closely followed by Valentinus, who may have come to know these doctrines in [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{Quote|For the genesis of [[Apollo]] from Isis and [[Osiris]] that took place while the Gods were still in the womb of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], is an enigmatical way of stating that before this [sensible] cosmos became manifest, and Matter was perfected by Reason (''Logos''), ''Nature, proving herself imperfect, of herself brought forth her first birth.''

Wherefore also they say that that God was lame in the dark, and call him Elder [[Horus]]; for he was not cosmos, but a sort of image and phantasm of the world which was to be.|[http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm Plutarch, ''On the Worship of Isis and Osiris'', LIV, 5-6], in [http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm#fn_1153 Mead 1906, 334, note]}}

{{quote|If Plutarch is not mistaken, [[Isis]] was the same with the self-existent Divine Wisdom .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [[Apollo]], or the elder [[Horus]], born of Isis while yet in the womb of her mother Rhea, allegorises the ancient difficulty of accounting for the origin of matter, otherwise than by making it co-ordinate with the ideal forms that it should eventually take. This part of the Egyptian myth must certainly have suggested the idea of the Valentinian Demiurge; as Isis did of Sophia or Achamoth; ''mutatis nominibus'', the words of Plutarch very nearly express the Valentinian theory; τὸν Ὥρον, ὃν ἡ ῏Ισις εἰκόνα τοῦ νοητοῦ κόσμου αἰσθητὸν ὄντα γεννᾷ. Then again the terms in which Plutarch speaks of the functions of Isis, are suggestive of the Valentinian notion, where they are not Platonic. No doubt they may have received from him a deeper Platonic colouring, but it is impossible not to believe that the fundamental ideas of the Valentinian theory were received from the theosophy of ancient Egypt, when he says, "For Isis is the female principle of nature, the recipient of every Gnostic natural product, as ''the nurse and comprehensive principle'' (πανδεχής) in Plato. But by the many she is called ''the million-named'', for moulded (τρεπομένη f. l. τυπουμένη) by reason she embraces all forms and ideas. And congenital with her is Love of the first and mightiest of all, which is one and the same with the Good; this she desires and follows after, but she avoids and repels all participation with Evil, being to both indeed as space and matter, but inclining always of her own accord to the better principle, occasioning in it the procreative impulse of inseminating her with emanations and types in which she rejoices and exults, as impregnated with produce. For produce is the material image of Substance, and the contingent is an imitation of that which IS."|Harvey 1857, pp. 22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus characterizes the Gnostics as the ''pneumatici'' who have a perfect knowledge of God, and have been initiated into the mysteries of Achamoth.&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 6, 1"&gt;Irenaeus i. 6, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropos===
The chief influence at work here seems to have been the idea of the celestial ''[[Adam Kadmon|Anthropos]]'' (''i.e.'' the Primal Man) – of whom the myth originally relates that he has sunk into matter and then raised himself up from it again – which appears in its simple form in individual Gnostic systems, ''e.g.'' in [[Poimandres]] (in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'') and in [[Manichaeism]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}

According to Valentinus,&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 29, 30"&gt;Irenaeus i. 29, 30&lt;/ref&gt; the Anthropos  no longer appears as the world-creative power sinking down into the material world, but as a celestial Aeon of the upper world (or even as the supreme god), who stands in a clearly defined relationship to the fallen Aeon.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}} Adam was created in the name of Anthropos, and overawes the demons by the fear of the pre-existent man. This Anthropos is a cosmogonic element, pure mind as distinct from matter, mind conceived [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostatically]] as emanating from God and not yet darkened by contact with matter. This mind is considered as the reason of humanity, or humanity itself, as a personified idea, a category without corporeality, the human reason conceived as the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World-Soul]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is possible that the role of the Anthropos is here transferred to Sophia Achamoth.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}

It is also clear why the Ekklesia appears together with the Anthropos. With this is associated the community of the faithful and the redeemed, who are to share the same fate with him. Perfect ''gnosis'' (and thus the whole body of Gnostics) is connected with the Anthropos.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus i. 29, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christ===
Next to Sophia stands a male redeeming divinity. In the true Valentinian system, the Christ is the son of the fallen Sophia, who is thus conceived as an individual. Sophia conceives a passion for the First Father himself, or rather, under pretext of love she seeks to draw near to the unattainable Bythos, the Unknowable, and to comprehend his greatness. She brings forth, through her longing for that higher being, an Aeon who is higher and purer than herself, and at once rises into the celestial worlds. Christ has pity on the abortive substance born of Sophia and gives it essence and form, whereupon Sophia tries to rise again to the Father, but in vain. In the enigmatic figure of Christ we again find hidden the original conception of the Primal Man, who sinks down into matter but rises again.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}

In the fully developed Ptolemaean system we find a kindred conception, but with a slight difference. Here Christ and Sophia appear as brother and sister, with Christ representing the higher and Sophia the lower element. When this world has been born from Sophia in consequence of her passion, two Aeons, Nous (mind) and Aletheia (truth), by command of the Father, produce two new Aeons, Christ and the Holy Ghost; these restore order in the Pleroma, and in consequence all Aeons combine their best and most wonderful qualities to produce a new Aeon (Jesus, Logos, Soter, or Christ), the “[[First Fruits]]” whom they offer to the Father. And this celestial redeemer-Aeon now enters into a marriage with the fallen Aeon; they are the “bride and bridegroom”. It is boldly stated in the exposition in Hippolytus’ ''[[Refutation of all Heresies|Philosophumena]]'' that they produce between them 70 celestial [[angels]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=854-855}}

This myth can be connected with the historic [[Jesus of Nazareth]] by further relating that Christ, having been united to the Sophia, descends into the earthly Jesus, the son of Mary, at his baptism, and becomes the Saviour of men.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=853}}

=== Horos===
A figure entirely peculiar to Valentinian Gnosticism is that of ''Horos'' (the Limiter). The name is perhaps an echo of the Egyptian [[Horus]].{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}&lt;ref&gt;Horus, according to Francis Legge, generally appeared in [[Alexandria]] “with hawk’s head and human body dressed in the cuirass and boots of a Roman gendarme or [[Stationarius (Roman military)|stationarius]], which would be appropriate enough for a sentinel or guard.” Legge 1914, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The task of Horos is to separate the fallen Aeons from the upper world of Aeons. At the same time he becomes a kind of world-creative power, who in this capacity helps to construct an ordered world out of Sophia and her passions. He is also called '''Stauros''' ([[cross]]), and we frequently meet with references to the figure of Stauros. Speculations about the Stauros are older than Christianity, and a [[Platonism|Platonic]] conception may have been at work here. [[Plato]] had already [[Timaeus (dialogue)|stated]] that the World-Soul revealed itself in the form of the letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi (X)]], by which he meant that figure described in the heavens by the intersecting orbits of the [[sun]] and the planetary [[ecliptic]]. Since through this double orbit all the movements of the heavenly powers are determined, so all “becoming” and all life depend on it, and thus we can understand the statement that the World-Soul appears in the form of an X, or a cross.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}

The cross can also stand for the wondrous Aeon on whom depends the ordering and life of the world, and thus Horos-Stauros appears here as the first redeemer of Sophia from her passions, and as the orderer of the creation of the world which now begins. Naturally, then, the figure of Horos-Stauros was often assimilated to that of the Christian Redeemer.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} We possibly find echoes of this in the ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', where the [[True Cross|Cross]] itself is depicted as speaking and even floating out of the tomb.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Monism===
Peculiarly Valentinian is the above-mentioned derivation of the material world from the passions of Sophia. Whether this already formed part of the original system of Valentinus is questionable, but at any rate it plays a prominent part in the Valentinian school, and consequently appears with the most diverse variations in the account given by Irenaeus. By it is effected the comparative [[monism]] of the Valentinian system, and the dualism of the conception of two separate worlds of light and darkness is overcome:{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}
{{Quote|This collection [of passions] ... was the substance of the matter from which this world was formed. From [her desire of] returning [to him who gave her life], every soul belonging to this world, and that of the Demiurge himself, derived its origin. All other things owed their beginning to her terror and sorrow. For from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed; from her smile all that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity all the corporeal elements of the world.''&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus i. 4, 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Demiurge===
This derivation of the material world from the passions of the fallen Sophia is next affected by an older theory, which probably occupied an important place in the main Valentinian system. According to this theory the son of Sophia, whom she forms on the model of the Christ who has disappeared in the Pleroma, becomes the [[Demiurge]], who with his angels now appears as the real-world creative power.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}

According to the older conception, he was an evil and malicious offspring of his mother, who has already been deprived of any particle of light.&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 29, 30"/&gt;{{failed verification|reason=The chapters in question don't refer to Valentinians but to Barbelites, Borborites, Ophites and Sethians|date=April 2015}} In the Valentinian systems, the Demiurge was the offspring of a union of Sophia Achamoth with matter, and appears as the fruit of Sophia's repentance and conversion.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} But as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of Sophia, the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Supreme God. The Demiurge in creating this world out of Chaos was unconsciously influenced for good by Christ; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united Christ the Saviour, who redeemed men.

===Creation of Man===
With the doctrine of the creation of the world is connected the subject of the creation of man. According to it, the world-creating angels – not one, but many – create man, but the seed of the spirit comes into their creature without their knowledge, by the agency of a higher celestial Aeon, and they are then terrified by the faculty of speech by which their creature rises above them and try to destroy him.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}}

It is significant that Valentinus himself is credited with having written a treatise upon the threefold nature of man,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, ''A porien'', i. 292&lt;/ref&gt; who is represented as at once spiritual, psychical, and material. In accordance with this there also arise three classes of men: the ''pneumatici'', the ''psychici'', and the ''hylici''.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=854}} This doctrine dates at least as far back as Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

*The first, the material, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire.
*The second, or psychical, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (Pleroma) nor hell (matter).
*The third, the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body and soul.

We also find ideas that emphasize the distinction between the ''soma psychikon'' and the ''soma pneumatikon'':

{{Quote|Perfect redemption is the cognition itself of the ineffable greatness: for since through ignorance came about the defect ... the whole system springing from ignorance is dissolved in ''gnosis''. Therefore ''gnosis'' is the redemption of the inner man; and it is not of the body, for the body is corruptible; nor is it psychical, for even the soul is a product of the defect and it is a lodging to the spirit: pneumatic (spiritual) therefore also must be redemption itself. Through ''gnosis'', then, is redeemed the inner, spiritual man: so that to us suffices the ''gnosis'' of universal being: and this is the true redemption.''&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 21, 4"&gt;Irenaeus i. 21, 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Soteriology===
Salvation is not merely individual redemption of each human soul; it is a cosmic process. It is the return of all things to what they were before the flaw in the sphere of the Aeons brought matter into existence and imprisoned some part of the Divine Light into the evil ''Hyle'' ([[matter]]). This setting free of the light sparks is the process of salvation; when all light shall have left Hyle, it will be burnt up and destroyed.

In Valentinianism the process is extraordinarily elaborate, and we find here developed particularly clearly the myth of the heavenly marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus i. 30&lt;/ref&gt; This myth, as we shall see more fully below, and as may be mentioned here, is of great significance for the practical piety of the Valentinian Gnostics. It is the chief idea of their pious practices mystically to repeat the experience of this celestial union of the Saviour with Sophia. In this respect, consequently, the myth underwent yet wider development. Just as the Saviour is the bridegroom of Sophia, so the heavenly angels, who sometimes appear as the sons of the Saviour and Sophia, sometimes as the escort of the Saviour, are the males betrothed to the souls of the Gnostics, which are looked upon as feminine. Thus every Gnostic had her unfallen counterpart standing in the presence of God, and the object of a pious life was to bring about and experience this inner union with the celestial abstract personage. This leads us straight to the sacramental ideas of this branch of Gnosticism (see below). And it also explains the expression used of the Gnostics in Irenaeus,&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus i. 6, 4&lt;/ref&gt; that they always meditate upon the secret of the heavenly union (the Syzygia).{{sfn|Bousset|1911|pp=854-855}}

“The final consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by ''gnosis''.”&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 6, 1"/&gt;

===Gnosis===
The central point of the piety of Valentinus seems to have been that mystical contemplation of God; in a letter preserved in Clement of Alexandria,&lt;ref&gt;Clemens ''[[Stromata]]'' ii. 20, 114&lt;/ref&gt; he sets forth that the soul of man is like an inn, which is inhabited by many evil spirits.
{{Quote|But when the Father, who alone is good, looks down and around him, then the soul is hallowed and lies in full light, and so he who has such a heart as this is to be called happy, for he shall behold God.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}}}
But this contemplation of God, as Valentinus declares, closely and deliberately following the doctrines of the Church and with him the compiler of the Gospel of John, is accomplished through the revelation of the Son. This mystic also discusses a vision which is preserved in the ''Philosophumena'' of Hippolytus:{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}
{{Quote|Valentinus ... had seen an infant child lately born; and questioning (this child), he proceeded to inquire who it might be. And (the child) replied, saying that he himself is the Logos, and then subjoined a sort of tragic legend...''&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' 6, 37&lt;/ref&gt;}}
With celestial enthusiasm Valentinus here surveys and depicts the heavenly world of Aeons, and its connection with the lower world. Exalted joy of battle and a valiant courage breathe forth in the sermon in which Valentinus addresses the faithful:
{{Quote|Ye are from the beginning immortal and children of eternal life, and desire to divide death amongst you like a prey, in order to destroy it and utterly to annihilate it, that thus death may die in you and through you, for if ye dissolve the world, and are not yourselves dissolved, then are ye lords over creation and over all that passes away.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}&lt;ref&gt;Clemens iv. 13, 91&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sacraments==
The authorities for the sacramental practices of the Valentinians are preserved especially in the accounts of the [[Marcosians]] given in Irenaeus i. 13 and 20, and in the last section of Clement of Alexandria's ''Excerpta ex Theodoto''.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}

In almost all the sacramental prayers of the Gnostics handed down to us by Irenaeus, the Mother is the object of the invocation. There are moreover various figures in the fully developed system of the Valentinians who are in the Gnostic's mind when he calls upon the Mother; sometimes it is the fallen Achamoth, sometimes the higher Sophia abiding in the celestial world, sometimes ''Aletheia'', the consort of the supreme heavenly father, but it is always the same idea, the Mother, on whom the faith of the Gnostics is fixed. Thus a baptismal confession of faith of the Gnostics&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 21, 3"&gt;Irenaeus i. 21, 3&lt;/ref&gt; runs: 
{{Quote|In the name of the unknown Father of all, by Aletheia, the Mother of all, by the name which descended upon Jesus.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}}}}

===Bridal Chamber===
The chief sacrament of the Valentinians seems to have been that of the bridal chamber (''nymphon'').{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=855}} The ''[[Gospel of Philip]],'' a probable Valentinian text, reads:
{{Quote|There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west was called “The Holy”. Another, facing south, was called “The Holy of the Holy”. The third, facing east, was called “The Holy of the Holies”, the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is “the Holy” building. Redemption is the “Holy of the Holy”. “The Holy of the Holies” is the bridal chamber. Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber.''}}

As Sophia was united with the Saviour, her bridegroom, so the faithful would experience a union with their angel in the Pleroma (cf. the “[[Higher Self]]” or “[[Holy Guardian Angel]]”). The ritual of this sacrament is briefly indicated: “A few of them prepare a bridal chamber and in it go through a form of consecration, employing certain fixed formulae, which are repeated over the person to be initiated, and stating that a spiritual marriage is to be performed after the pattern of the higher Syzygia.”&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 21, 3"/&gt; Through a fortunate chance, a liturgical formula which was used at this sacrament appears to be preserved, though in a garbled form and in an entirely different connection, the author seeming to have been uncertain as to its original meaning. It runs:
{{Quote|I will confer my favor upon thee, for the father of all sees thine angel ever before his face ... we must now become as one; receive now this grace from me and through me; deck thyself as a bride who awaits her bridegroom, that thou mayest become as I am, and I as thou art. Let the seed of light descend into thy bridal chamber; receive the bridegroom and give place to him, and open thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon thee.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIII.|Irenaeus i. 23, 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other key features of the doctrine of the Bridal Chamber included the use of mirrors as part of the decor and the idea that those who had partaken in the rituals would be able to beget children in the world to come.

===Baptism===
Besides this the Gnostics already practiced [[baptism]], using the same form in all essentials as that of the Christian Church. The name given to baptism, at least among certain bodies, was ''apolytrosis'' (liberation); the baptismal formulae have been mentioned above.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}

The Gnostics are baptized in the mysterious name which also descended upon [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus at his baptism]].{{Clarification needed|date=November 2018}} The angels of the Gnostics have also had to be baptized in this name, in order to bring about redemption for themselves and the souls belonging to them.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}&lt;ref name="Excerpta ex Theodoto, 22"&gt;''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In the baptismal formulae the sacred name of the Redeemer is mentioned over and over again. In one of the formulae occur the words: “I would enjoy thy name, Saviour of Truth.” The concluding formula of the baptismal ceremony is: “Peace over all upon whom the Name rests.”&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 21, 3"/&gt; This name pronounced at baptism over the faithful has above all the significance that the name will protect the soul in its ascent through the heavens, conduct it safely through all hostile powers to the lower heavens, and procure it access to Horos, who frightens back the lower souls by his [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] word.&lt;ref name="Excerpta ex Theodoto, 22"/&gt; And for this life also baptism, in consequence of the pronouncing of the protecting name over the baptized person, accomplishes his liberation from the lower daemonic powers. Before baptism the ''Heimarmene'' is supreme, but after baptism the soul is free from her.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}&lt;ref&gt;''Excerpta ex Theodoto''. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
With baptism was also connected the anointing with oil, and hence we can also understand the death sacrament occurring among some Valentinians consisting in an anointing with a mixture of oil and water.&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 21, 4"/&gt; This death sacrament has naturally the express object of assuring the soul the way to the highest heaven “so that the soul may be intangible and invisible to the higher mights and powers”.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus ''loc. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection we also find a few formulae which are entrusted to the faithful, so that their souls may pronounce them on their journey upwards. One of these formulae runs:
{{Quote|I am a son from the Father – the Father who had a pre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others, although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself. For I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to my own place whence I went forth...''&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus i. 21, 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another formula is appended, in which there is a distinction in the invocation between the higher and lower Sophia. Another prayer of the same style is to be found in Irenaeus i. 13, and it is expressly stated that after prayer is pronounced the Mother throws the [[Cap of invisibility|Homeric helmet]] (cf. the ''[[Tarnhelm]]'') over the faithful soul, and so makes him invisible to the mights and powers which surround and attack him.{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}

===Reaction===
On the other hand, a reaction took place here and there against the sacramental rites. A pure piety, rising above mere sacramentalism, breathes in the words of the Gnostics preserved in ''Excerpta ex Theodoto'', 78, 2:
{{Quote|But not baptism alone sets us free, but knowledge (''gnosis''): who we were, what we have become, where we were, whither we have sunk, whither we hasten, whence we are redeemed, what is birth and what rebirth.''{{sfn|Bousset|1911|p=856}}}}

==Relationship with the Church==
The distinction between the human and divine Saviour was a major point of contention between the Valentinians and the Church. Valentinus separated Christ into three figures; the spiritual, the psychical and material. Each of the three Christ figures had its own meaning and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph 1977, 166&lt;/ref&gt; They acknowledged that Christ suffered and died, but believed that “in his incarnation, Christ transcended human nature so that he could prevail over death by divine power”.&lt;ref&gt;Pagels 1979, 96&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are what caused Irenaeus to say of the Valentinians, “Certainly they confess with their tongues the one Jesus Christ, but in their minds they divide him.”&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph 1977, 155&lt;/ref&gt; In one passage in the account of Irenaeus, it is directly stated that the redeemer assumed a psychical body to redeem the psychical, for the spiritual already belong by nature to the celestial world and no longer require any ''historical'' redemption, while the material is incapable of redemption,&lt;ref name="Irenaeus i. 6, 1"/&gt; as “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption”.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Valentinian traditions and practices also clashed with those of the Church. They often met at unauthorized gatherings and rejected ecclesiastical authority, based on their belief that they were all equal. Members of the movement took turns administering sacraments, as well as preaching.&lt;ref name="Holroyd 1994, 33"&gt;Holroyd 1994, 33&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Valentinians, women were considered to be equal, or at least nearly equal to men. There were female prophets, teachers, healers, evangelists and even priests, which was very different from the Church's view of women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pagels 1979, 60&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinians held normal jobs, got married and raised children just like Christians; however they regarded these pursuits as being less important than gnosis, which was to be achieved individually.&lt;ref&gt;Pagels 1979, 146&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs of the Valentinians were much more oriented towards the individual than the group, and [[salvation]] was not seen as being universal, as it was in the Church.

The main disagreements between the Valentinians and the Church were in the notions that God and the creator were two separate entities, the idea that the creator was flawed and formed man and Earth out of ignorance and confusion, and the separation of Christ's human form and divine form. Church authorities believed that Valentinian theology was “a wickedly casuistic way of subverting their authority and thereby threatening the ecclesiastical order with anarchy.”&lt;ref name="Holroyd 1994, 33"/&gt; The practices and rituals of the Valentinians were also different from those of the Christian Church; however they considered themselves to be Christians and not pagans or heretics. By referring to themselves as Christians they worsened their relationship with the Church, who viewed them not only as heretics, but as rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph 1977, 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Valentinians publicly professed their faith in one God, “in their own private meetings they insisted on discriminating between the popular image of God – as master, king, lord, creator, and judge – and what that image represented: God understood as the ultimate source of all being.”&lt;ref name="Pagels 1979, 32"&gt;Pagels 1979, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the Church fathers, however, “the majority of Christians did not recognize the followers of Valentinus as heretics. Most could not tell the difference between Valentinian and orthodox teaching.”&lt;ref name="Pagels 1979, 32"/&gt; This was partially because Valentinus used many books that now belong to the Old and New Testaments as a basis for interpretation in his own writing. He based his work on proto-orthodox Christian canon instead of on Gnostic scripture, and his style was similar to that of early Christian works. In this way, Valentinus tried to bridge the gap between Gnostic religion and early Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (ed.) 1987, xxii&lt;/ref&gt; By attempting to bridge this gap, however, Valentinus and his followers became the proverbial [[wolf in sheep's clothing|wolves in sheep's clothing]]. “The apparent similarity with orthodox teaching only made this heresy more dangerous – like poison disguised as milk.”&lt;ref name="Pagels 1979, 32"/&gt; Valentinian Gnosticism was “the most influential and sophisticated form of Gnostic teaching, and by far the most threatening to the church.”&lt;ref name="Pagels 1979, 32"/&gt;

[[History of Christianity#Early Christianity (c.33–325)|Early Christianity]] has been described as “a complex network of individual parties, groups, sects, or denominations.”&lt;ref&gt;Layton (ed.) 1987, xviii&lt;/ref&gt; This inconsistency made Gnostic sects such as Valentinianism threatening to the proto-orthodox sect.

==Texts==
Valentinian works are named in reference to the bishop and teacher Valentinius. Circa 153 AD, Valentinius developed a complex cosmology outside the Sethian tradition. At one point he was close to being appointed the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] of what is now the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Works attributed to his school are listed below, and fragmentary pieces directly linked to him are noted with an asterisk:
* ''The Divine Word Present in the Infant'' (Fragment A) *
* ''On the Three Natures'' (Fragment B) *
* ''Adam's Faculty of Speech'' (Fragment C) *
* ''To Agathopous: Jesus' Digestive System'' (Fragment D) *
* ''Annihilation of the Realm of Death'' (Fragment F) *
* ''On Friends: The Source of Common Wisdom'' (Fragment G) *
* ''Epistle on Attachments'' (Fragment H) *
* ''Summer Harvest''*

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2017}}
Badinter is the daughter of Sophie Vaillant and [[Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet]], founder of [[Publicis Groupe|Publicis]]. Sophie Vaillant was the granddaughter of [[Édouard Vaillant]], a French political leader and social activist. Sophie's mother was raised as a Roman Catholic in a middle class upbringing, and later converted to Judaism following her marriage.

Elisabeth and her two sisters were raised by parents who believed in the equality of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/badinter-elisabeth|title=Elisabeth Badinter profile|publisher=jwa.org|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her secondary education from ''L'école alsacienne'', a private school in Paris. During adolescence, Badinter read [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s [[the Second Sex]], which profoundly influenced her views, inspiring her pursuit of a doctorate in philosophy at [[University of Paris|Sorbonne University]].

After her studies, Badinter taught at the [[École Polytechnique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/12/france-feminism-elisabeth-badinter | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Lizzy | last=Davies | title=French philosopher says feminism under threat from 'good motherhood' | date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first book titled, ''L'Amour en plus,'' was published in 1980 and raises the question of whether maternal love is an exclusively natural instinct or a tendency reinforced in the cultural context, in which the behaviour of motherly affection is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2016/06/19/elisabeth-badinter-la-griffe-de-la-republique_4953637_3232.html|title=Elisabeth Badinter, la griffe de la République|last=Renterghem|first=Marion Van|date=19 June 2016|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|access-date=9 February 2017|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her critical work, ''L'un est l'autre'', published in 1987, Badinter reflects upon the complementarities of masculin and feminine traits in gendered identities and the conflicts that arise when these complementarities are subjected to oppression. Badinter concludes that a new era of gendered resemblances will lead to a change in gender identities and a revolution of moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collard|first=Chantal|year=1987|title="Anthropologie comme mythe d'origine du rapport entre les sexes."

Her 2003 treatise, ''La fausse route'', addresses misandry and victimisation of women by French contemporary feminists. "The systematic denial of women's power and violence, the constant portrayal of women as oppressed and therefore innocent is deepening the crevasses of a divided humanity: the victims of masculine oppression on one side and the almighty executioners on the other.
