An '''acequia''' ({{IPA-es|aˈθekja|lang}}) or '''séquia''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsɛkia|langva}}) is a community-operated [[watercourse]] used in [[Spain]] and former [[Spanish colonization of America|Spanish colonies in the Americas]] for [[irrigation]]. Particularly in Spain, the [[Andes]], northern [[Mexico]], and the modern-day [[American Southwest]], acequias are usually historically engineered [[canal]]s that carry [[surface runoff|snow runoff]] or river water to distant fields. It can also refer to the long central pool in a Moorish garden, such as the [[Generalife]] in the [[Alhambra]] in Southern [[Iberia]].

==Overview==
The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''acequia'' (and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''séquia'') comes from [[Classical Arabic]] "''as-sāqiya''", which has the double entendre of "the water conduit" or "one that bears water" and the "barmaid". The Romans brought the technology to [[Iberia]] during their [[Hispania|occupation]] of the [[Iberian peninsula]], then the Arabs extended their use although they are originally from [[Qanat|Persia]]. The technology was adopted later by the Spanish and Portuguese ([[levada]]s on Madeira Island), utilized throughout their conquered lands, except in e.g.  [[Mendoza, Argentina]] where acequias today run along both sides of all city streets but originally were dug all around by the indigenous [[Huarpe people|Huarpes]] long before the arrival of the Spanish.

In the United States, the oldest acequias were established more than 400 years ago; many continue to provide a primary source of water for farming and ranching ventures in areas of the [[United States]] once occupied by [[Spain]] or [[Mexico]] including the region of northern [[New Mexico]] and south central [[Colorado]] known as the Upper Rio Grande watershed or [[Rio Arriba]] (see Rivera 1998).

Acequias are [[Chute (gravity)|gravity chutes]], similar in concept to [[flume]]s. Some acequias are conveyed through pipes or [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], of modern fabrication or decades or centuries old (see [[transvasement]]).  The majority, however, are simple open ditches with dirt banks.  In many communities, the [[ditchbank]]s are important routes for non-motorized travel.

Researchers affiliated with the Rio Grande Bioregions Project at [[Colorado College]] initiated a pioneering collaborative, farmer-led, and interdisciplinary study of Colorado and New Mexico acequias in 1995-1999. Among the most significant findings of this study was that the acequia farms provide vital ecosystem and economic base services to the regions in which they are located. One study, as reported in Peña (2003), found that acequia agroecosystems promote soil conservation and soil formation, provide terrestrial wildlife habitat and movement corridors; protect water quality and fish habitat, promote the conservation of domesticated biodiversity of land race heirloom crops, and encourage the maintenance of a strong land and water ethic and sense of place, among other ecological and economic base values. This pioneering research on acequia [[ecosystem services]], led by environmental anthropologist Devon G. Peña, has more recently been confirmed in other studies (Fernald et al., 2007, 2010, 2015; Raheem et al., 2015).

Known among water users simply as ''the Acequia'', various legal entities embody the community associations, or acequia associations, that govern members' water usage, depending on local precedents and traditions.  An acequia organization often must include commissioners and a majordomo who administers usage of water from a ditch, regulating which holders of water rights can release water to their fields on which days. In [[New Mexico]], by state statute, acequias as registered bodies must have three commissioners and a mayordomo (see Rivera, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;59–60). Irrigation and conservation districts typically have their own version of mayordomos, usually referred to as "ditch riders" by members of the districts.

In recent years, acequias in New Mexico and Colorado have successfully developed and implemented changes in state water laws to accommodate the unique norms, customs, and practices of the acequia systems. The customary law of the acequia is older than and at variance with the [[Doctrine of Prior Appropriation]], and the statutes promulgating acequia water law represent a rare instance of water pluralism in the context of Western water law in the United States (see Hicks and Peña 2003). For example, the Doctrine of Prior Appropriation is based on the principle of "first in use, first in right," while acequia norms incorporate not just priority but principles of equity and fairness. This is evident in the fact that Prior Appropriation considers water to be a commodity owned by private individuals while acequia systems treat water as a community resource that irrigators have a shared right to use, manage, and protect. While Prior doctrines allow for water to be sold away from the basin of origin, the acequia system prohibits the transference of water from the watershed in which it is situated and thus considers water as an "asset-in-place". The Prior regime is based on a governance regime in which the members of a mutual ditch company will vote based on their proportional ownership of shares so that larger farmers have more votes. In contrast, the acequia system follows a "one farmer, one vote" system that has led researchers to consider this a form of "water democracy" (see Rivera 1998; Peña 2003). Acequia water law also requires that all persons with irrigation rights participate in the annual maintenance of the community ditch including the annual spring time ditch cleanup known as the ''limpieza y saca de acequia''.

In [[Wales]], an '''Act of the National Assembly for Wales''' ({{lang-cy|Deddf Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru}}) (informally, an '''Act of the Assembly''') is [[primary legislation]] that can be made by the [[National Assembly for Wales]] under part 4 of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]].&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/part/4 |title=Government of Wales Act 2006 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power to make Acts of the Assembly was conferred on the assembly following the [[2011 elections]] as a commencement order had been passed in the assembly by simple majority prior to dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-12639379 |title=BBC News - What happens next after the assembly powers referendum? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-03-05 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation of part 4 legislative powers was as a result of a "yes" vote in the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|2011 referendum]] held in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12482561 |title=BBC News - Wales Referendum 2011: Results in full |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the power to make Acts of the Assembly commenced, the assembly lost the ability to make [[Measure of the National Assembly for Wales|Measures]] under part 3 of the 2006 Act. Existing Measures will remain as law unless repealed.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt;

==How Acts of the Assembly are made==
[[File:Royal Badge of Wales (2008).svg|right|150px|thumb|The [[Royal Badge of Wales]] appears on the covers of Acts passed by the [[Welsh Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2012/2/introduction/enacted|title=Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Act 2012|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Consideration by the Assembly===
Bills may be introduced by [[Welsh Government]], a committee of the Assembly, the Assembly Commission or by individual Assembly Members. Ballots are held to select which individual assembly members may present bills. 

Once a bill is introduced, there are four stages that need to be completed prior to the bill being submitted for [[royal assent]]. The first stage involves consideration of the general principles of the bill by a committee of the assembly and then agreement of these principles by the assembly in plenary session. In the second stage, the bill is considered in detail by a bill committee. The third stage involves detailed consideration of the bill and any amendments by the assembly in plenary, this can be followed by a Report Stage where further amendments can be proposed. Finally, in the fourth stage, the assembly votes to pass the bill in its final form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.wales/en/bus-home/bus-legislation/bus-legislation-guidance/Pages/bus-legislation-guidance.aspx|title=Guide to the Legislative Process|author=|date=|website=assembly.wales|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of intimation and Royal Assent===
When a bill completes its passage through the assembly, it enters a four-week period of intimation, during which the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] or the [[Counsel General for Wales]] may refer the bill to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] if they consider that any provisions of the bill are outside the legislative competency of the assembly. The [[Secretary of State for Wales]] may also make an order prohibiting the Clerk to the Assembly from submitting the Bill for royal assent during this time. After the period of intimation expires, the Clerk may submit the bill for royal assent. The bill becomes an Act of the Assembly when [[Letters Patent]] under the [[Welsh Seal]] are made by the Queen to signify assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/part/4/crossheading/procedure |title=Government of Wales Act 2006 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/752/made |title=The National Assembly for Wales (Letters Patent) Order 2011 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Form of letters patent====
Royal assent to Acts of the Assembly is given by means of [[Letters Patent]] using the following wording:&lt;ref name="Wales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/752/pdfs/uksi_20110752_en.pdf|title=The National Assembly for Wales (Letters Patent) Order 2011|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=11 October 2016|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|''ELIZABETH THE SECOND by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Our other Realms and Territories Queen Head of the Commonwealth Defender of the Faith To Our Trusty and well beloved the members of the National Assembly for Wales GREETING:''&lt;br /&gt;
''FORASMUCH as one or more Bills have been passed by the National Assembly for Wales and have been submitted to Us for Our Royal Assent by the Clerk of the National Assembly for Wales in accordance with the Government of Wales Act 2006 the short Titles of which Bills are set forth in the Schedule hereto but those Bills by virtue of the Government of Wales Act 2006 do not become Acts of the National Assembly for Wales nor have effect in the Law without Our Royal Assent signified by Letters Patent under Our Welsh Seal signed with Our own hand We have therefore caused these Our Letters Patent to be made and have signed them and by them do give Our Royal Assent to those Bills which shall be taken and accepted as good and perfect Acts of the Assembly and be put in due execution accordingly COMMANDING ALSO the Keeper of Our Welsh Seal to seal these Our Letters with that Seal.''&lt;br /&gt;
''IN WITNESS WHEREOF we have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent.''&lt;br /&gt;
''WITNESS Ourself at ... the ... day of ... in the ... year of Our Reign.''&lt;br /&gt;

The company's major clients include [[ESPN]] (for its [[WatchESPN]] service), the NHL, [[HBO]] (for its [[HBO Now]] service), the [[PGA Tour]], [[Riot Games]] (for ''[[League of Legends]]'' [[e-sports]]), [[PlayStation Vue]], [[WWE Network]]&lt;ref name="variety-disneymaj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/hbo-cto-otto-berkes-resigns-as-network-enlists-mlb-to-build-ott-platform-1201375255/|title=HBO CTO Otto Berkes Resigns After Network Enlists MLB to Build OTT Platform|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=December 9, 2014|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|access-date=August 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TheBlaze]].

It was majority owned by MLB Advanced Media (which is, in turn, a consortium of MLB's [[List of Major League Baseball principal owners|principal team owners]]), with minority stakes held by the [[National Hockey League]] and other investors. Disney acquired a minority stake in the company in August 2016 for $1 billion, and the following year, announced its intent to increase its stake to a 75% controlling stake for $1.58 billion. The deal was approved by regulators in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.fiercecable.com/online-video/disney-gets-ok-from-ftc-for-1-58-billion-bamtech-buy|title=Disney gets OK from FTC for $1.58B BAMTech buy|last=Munson|first=Ben|date=September 20, 2017|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate= September 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/feds-ok-disneys-bamtech-buy/168773|title=Feds OK Disney's BAMTech Buy|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=September 20, 2017|newspaper=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|accessdate= September 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisition of BAMTech by Disney, the company began to develop two subscription streaming services aligned with Disney properties: the sports-oriented service [[ESPN+]], and the upcoming entertainment service [[Disney+]].

==History==
===BAMTech Media===
BAMTech was founded in February 2015 through [[MLB Advanced Media]], spinning-out its streaming technology business into a separate company with outside investors. The formation of the company was approved by MLB Advanced Media's board of directors on August 13, 2015.&lt;ref name="Ben Popper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9090897/mlb-bam-live-streaming-internet-tv-nhl-hbo-now-espn|title=The Change Up: How baseball’s tech team built the future of television|author=Ben Popper|publisher=Vox Media|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the plan, MLB-specific properties (such as MLB.com) would remain under league control.&lt;ref name=verge-mlbamspinoff&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB considers spinning off its powerful streaming business|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8092439/mlb-considers-mlbam-spinoff|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired a 1/3 stake in the company for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Rains |url=https://www.sporttechie.com/disney-prepares-to-adapt-to-cord-cutters-with-new-mlbam-deal/ |title=Disney Prepares To Adapt To Cord Cutters With New MLBAM Deal |publisher=Sporttechie.com |date=2016-07-01 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2016, BAMTech announced a partnership with [[Discovery Communications]] to form a European joint venture known as BAMTech Europe. Its first client is [[Eurosport]], the pan-European rightsholder of the [[Olympic Games]] beginning [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]].&lt;ref name="thr-bameurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery, MLB's Streaming Business Partner to Launch BAMTech Europe|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/discovery-mlbs-streaming-business-partner-launch-bamtech-europe-942862|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, [[Riot Games]] announced a deal with BAMTech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of [[League of Legends Championship Series|professional competitions]] in its multiplayer video game ''[[League of Legends]]'' through 2023. BAMTech will pay Riot at least $50 million per-year, and split advertising revenue.&lt;ref name="polygon-bamtechaol"&gt;{{cite web|title=League of Legends’ maker inks rich broadcast contract, with an eye on premium content|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/18/13998614/league-of-legends-premium-tv-service-mlb|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-lolmlb"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘League of Legends’ E-Sports Contests Lure Newest Fan: Major League Baseball|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/league-of-legends-e-sports-contests-lure-newest-fan-major-league-baseball-1481889603|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Berkeley school of political theory''' is a [[school of thought]] in [[political theory]] associated originally with the work of faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], some of whom formulated and popularized its ideas. The school of thought was founded by [[Sheldon Wolin]], [[Hanna Pitkin]],&lt;ref&gt;"In light of Pitkin's long association with Berkeley, it is no surprise that academic lore frequently connects her work to a 'Berkeley School' of political theory, said to have flourished in the 1960s and '70s.", Mathiowetz, 2016, p.5 of the PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Rogin]], [[John Schaar]], and [[Norman Jacobson]], among others, and has been carried on by theorists including [[Wilson Carey McWilliams]] and [[J. Peter Euben]].&lt;ref name="grimes-obit"&gt;William Grimes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/sheldon-s-wolin-theorist-who-shifted-political-science-back-to-politics-dies-at-93.html "Sheldon S. Wolin, Theorist Who Shifted Political Science Back to Politics, Dies at 93"] (obituary), ''[[New York Times]]'', Oct. 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mathiowetz-2017"&gt;Mathiowetz 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkeley school has been characterized as returning political theory back in the direction of politics and political action, and away from efforts to center "scientific" models such as economics, psychology, sociology, and the natural sciences, specifically [[behavioralism]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="mathiowetz-2016"&gt;Mathiowetz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes-obit" /&gt;

The '''Chanak Crisis''' ({{lang-tr|Çanakkale Krizi}}), also called the '''Chanak Affair''' and the '''Chanak Incident''', was a war scare in September 1922 between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and Turkey (the [[Government of the Grand National Assembly|Grand National Assembly]]). ''Chanak'' refers to [[Çanakkale]], a city at the [[Anatolia]]n side of the [[Dardanelles Strait]]. The crisis was caused by Turkish efforts to push the Greek armies out of Turkey and restore Turkish rule in the Allied occupied territories of Turkey, primarily in [[Istanbul|Constantinople (now Istanbul)]] and Eastern [[Thrace]]. Turkish troops marched against British and French positions in the [[Dardanelles]] neutral zone. For a time, war between Britain and Turkey seemed possible, but Canada refused to agree as did [[French Third Republic|France]] and Italy. British public opinion did not want a war. The British military did not either, and the top general on the scene, [[Charles Harington Harington|Sir Charles Harington]], refused to relay an ultimatum to the Turks because he counted on a negotiated settlement. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in Britain's coalition government refused to follow [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], who with [[Winston Churchill]] was calling for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A. J. P. Taylor|first=|title=English History 1914–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WuASzFGqsMC&amp;pg=PA190|year=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=190–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis quickly ended when Turkey, having overwhelmed the Greeks, agreed to a negotiated settlement that gave it the territory it wanted.  Lloyd George's mishandling of the crisis contributed to his downfall via the [[Carlton Club meeting]]. The crisis raised the issue of who decided on war for the British Empire, and was Canada's first assertion of diplomatic independence from London. Historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]] says the Chanak incident led to [[Arthur Balfour]]'s definition of Britain and the dominions as "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of the domestic or internal affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations."  In 1931 the UK Parliament enacted Balfour's formula into law through the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robert Blake|first=|title=The Decline of Power, 1915–1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-38krH-9XDMC&amp;pg=PT68|year=2013|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The events==
The [[Turkish Army|Turkish troops]] had recently [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|defeated Greek forces]] and recaptured [[İzmir]] (Smyrna) on 9 September and were advancing on Constantinople in the neutral zone. In an interview published on ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 15 September 1922, leader of the Turkish national movement [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] stated that: ''"Our demands remain the same after our recent victory as they were before. We ask for Asia Minor, Thrace up to the river Maritsa and Constantinople... We must have our capital and I should in that case be obliged to march on Constantinople with my army, which will be an affair of only a few days. I much prefer to obtain possession by negotiation, though naturally I cannot wait indefinitely."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1578/1/2002daleziouphd.pdf ELEFTHERIA DALEZIOU,  BRITAIN AND THE GREEK-TURKISH WAR AND  SETTLEMENT OF 1919–1923: THE PURSUIT OF  SECURITY BY 'PROXY' IN WESTERN ASIA  MINOR ]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[British Cabinet]] met in the same day and decided that British forces should maintain their positions. On the following day, in the absence of [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], certain Cabinet ministers issued a [[communiqué]] threatening Turkey with a declaration of war by Britain and the [[Dominion]]s, on the grounds that Turkey had violated the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. On 18 September, on his return to London, Curzon pointed out that this would enrage the [[Prime Minister of France]], [[Raymond Poincaré]], and left for Paris to attempt to smooth things over. Poincaré, however, had already ordered the withdrawal of the French detachment at Chanak but persuaded the Turks to respect the neutral zone. Curzon reached Paris on 20 September and, after several angry meetings with Poincaré, reached agreement to negotiate an armistice with the Turks.&lt;ref name="Macfie"&gt;Macfie, A. L. "The Chanak Affair (September–October 1922)", ''Balkan Studies'' 1979, Vol. 20 Issue 2, pp. 309–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Turkish population living in Constantinople were being organised for a possible offensive against the city by the Kemalist forces. For instance, [[Ernest Hemingway]], reporting for ''[[The Toronto Daily Star]]'' at the time as a war correspondent, wrote about a specific incident:
{{cquote|"Another night a destroyer... stopped a boatload of Turkish women who were crossing from Asia Minor...On being searched for arms it turned out all the women were men. They were all armed and later proved to be Kemalist officers sent over to organize the Turkish population in the suburbs in case of an attack on Constantinople"&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway on War, p 278 Simon and Schuster, 2012 {{ISBN|1476716048}},&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In British politics, Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, and the Conservative [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]] were pro-Greek and wanted war; all other Conservatives of the coalition in his government were pro-Turk and rejected war. Lloyd George's position as head of the coalition became untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alfred F. Havighurst|first=|title=Britain in Transition: The Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h4Tm6VRqZmMC&amp;pg=PA174|year=1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the British public were alarmed by the Chanak episode and the possibility of going to war again. It further undercut Lloyd George that he had not fully consulted the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Dominion]] prime ministers.

Unlike 1914, when [[World War I]] broke out, Canada in particular did not automatically consider itself active in the conflict. Instead, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Prime Minister Mackenzie King]] insisted that the [[Canadian Parliament]] should decide on the course of action the country would follow. King was offended by the telegram he received from Churchill asking for Canada to send troops to Chanak to support Britain, and sent back a telegram, which was couched in Canadian nationalist language, declaring that Canada would not automatically support Britain if it came to war with Turkey.&lt;ref name="Levine, Allen page 131"&gt;Levine, Allen ''William Lyon Mackenzie King : a Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny'' Toronto: Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2011 page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the majority of the MPs of King's Liberal Party were opposed to going to war with Turkey together with the Progressive MPs who were supporting King's minority government, it is likely that Canada would have declared neutrality if the crisis came to war. The Chanak issue badly divided Canadian public opinion with French-Canadians and  Canadian nationalists in English-Canada like professor [[Oscar D. Skelton|O.D. Skelton]] saying Canada should not issue "blank cheques" to Britain like that issued in 1914 and supporting King's implicit decision for neutrality.&lt;ref name="Levine, Allen page 131"/&gt; By contrast, the Conservative leader [[Arthur Meighen]] in a speech in Toronto criticized King and declared: "When Britain's message came, then Canada should have said, 'Ready, aye ready, we stand by you.'"&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Allen ''William Lyon Mackenzie King : a Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny'' Toronto: Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 2011 page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the issue had been debated in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], the threat at Chanak had passed. Nonetheless, King made his point: the Canadian Parliament would decide the role that Canada would play in external affairs and could diverge from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Robert Macgregor. ''William Lyon Mackenzie King: 1874–1923'' (1958) pp. 401–16.&lt;/ref&gt;   The other dominion prime ministers and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Kingdom of Romania]] gave no support.&lt;ref name="Macfie"/&gt;

On 23 September, the British cabinet decided to give [[East Thrace]] to the Turks, thus forcing Greeks to abandon it without a fight. This convinced Kemal to accept the opening of armistice talks and on 28 September he told the British that he had ordered his troops to avoid any incident at Chanak, nominating [[Mudanya]] as the venue for peace negotiations. The parties met there on 3 October and agreed to the terms of the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] on 11 October, two hours before British forces were due to attack.

==Consequences==
Lloyd George's rashness resulted in the calling of a [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|meeting of Conservative MPs]] at the [[Carlton Club]] on 19 October 1922, which passed a motion that the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] should fight the next general election as an independent party. This decision had dire ramifications for Lloyd George, as the Conservative Party made up the vast majority of the 1918–1922 post-war coalition. Indeed, they could have made up the majority government if it were not for the coalition.

Lloyd George also lost the support of the influential Curzon, who considered that the Prime Minister had been manoeuvring behind his back. Following the Carlton Club decision, the MPs voted 185 to 85 for ending the Coalition. Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister, never to return to cabinet level politics.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, J. G. "The Chanak Crisis and the British Cabinet", ''History'', Feb 1980, Vol. 65 Issue 213, pp 32–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservatives, under returned party leader [[Bonar Law]], subsequently won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|general election]] with an overall majority.

British and French forces were ultimately withdrawn from the neutral zone in summer 1923, following the ratification of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].

The Chanak crisis fundamentally challenged the assumption that the Dominions would automatically follow Britain into war. The crisis changed the relations between the Dominions and London, paving the way for the 1931 Statue of Westminster, which explicitly declared that the Dominions had the power to declare war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5296">'''Charitable immunity''' is a [[legal doctrine]] which holds that a [[charitable organization]] is not liable under [[tort]] law.  It originated in 19th-century [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://writ.news.findlaw.com/hamilton/20071129.html | title = How the Push for Religious Accommodation Can Go Too Far: Two Important Recent Examples | author = Marci Hamilton | date =  November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carters"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.carters.ca/pub/article/church/2000/cbrother.html | title = Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada - Charitable Immunity | work = carters.ca | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060625022856/http://www.carters.ca/pub/article/church/2000/cbrother.html | archivedate = 2006-06-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early form of charitable immunity in [[England]] did not provide [[immunity (disambiguation)#Law|immunity]] from [[lawsuit|suit]]; it only protected segregated funds held in a recognized equitable trust for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Feoffees of Heriot’s Hosp. V. Ross'', 8 Eng Rep 1508 (1846) (discussed in ''Callopy v. Newark Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary'', 141 A.2d at 278).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Heriot's Hospital'', plaintiff Ross brought an action against a charitable trust which had been established for a home for fatherless boys, contending that he had been excluded from the home even though he was fatherless and otherwise qualified for the charitable benefits.  By the time his case was determined, Ross was too old for admission, and the question was whether he was entitled to damages from the trust funds.  The House of Lords held that he was not. In the [[House of Lords]], [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Cottenham]], ''in dictum'', pronounced that an award of damages out of a trust fund "would not be to apply it to those objects which the author of the fund had in view, but would be to divert it to a completely different purpose". ''Heriot's Hospital'' was not a tort claim and did not address the issue whether a charity is liable to those whom it has wrongfully injured.  ''Heriot's Hospital'' repeated an earlier dictum from Lord Cottenham in ''Duncan v. Findlater'', 6 Cl. &amp; Fin. 894 (1839), which decided, unremarkably, that highway trustees, under a public road act, were not liable for the negligence of independent contractors.

A blanket waiver from suit for charities did not exist anywhere at common law until it was adopted in England in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;See, Holliday v. St. Leonard, Shoreditch'', 142 Eng Rep 769 (1861) (discussed in ''Callopy'').&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the concept of immunity had no sooner crept into English law than it was decisively repudiated. By 1866, the dictum of ''Duncan v. Findlater'' (and by implication that of ''Heriot's Hospital'') was overruled by ''Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs'', LR 1 HL 93, 11 Eng Rep 1500 (1866).&lt;ref&gt;''Georgetown College v. Hughes'', 130 F.2d 810, 816-17 (1942) (discussing history of doctrine).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1940s and 1992, almost every state in the United States had abrogated or limited the charitable immunity doctrine.&lt;ref name="Jerold2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Liability of Not-for-profit organizations and Insurance Coverage for Related Liability | url = http://www.icnl.org/knowledge/ijnl/vol4iss2_3/art_3.htm | author = Jerold Oshinsky and Gheiza M.

==Variations==
The doctrine has especially been relevant, or discussed, in the context of [[child sexual abuse]]&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbrother"/&gt; and [[medical malpractice]].&lt;ref name="canon"/&gt;

Under the charitable immunity doctrine, it was still possible to sue employees or volunteers of charitable institutions, so the doctrine's existence encouraged other legal arguments, such as the "[[captain of the ship doctrine|captain of the ship]]" argument that a surgeon is responsible for everything that happens in an operating room.&lt;ref name="Murphy2001"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = AORN J. |date=October 2001 | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 525–8 | title = "Captain of the ship" doctrine continues to take on water | author = Murphy EK | pmid = 11665386 | doi = 10.1016/S0001-2092(06)61686-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colombian nationality''' is typically obtained by birth in [[Colombia]] when one of the parents is either a Colombian citizen or a Colombian legal resident, by birth abroad when at least one parent was born in Colombia, or by naturalization, as defined by Article 96 of the [[Constitution of Colombia]] and the Law 43-1993 as modified by Legislative Act 1 of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language= spanish |url= http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=4574|title= Acto Legislativo 1 de 2002 |author= Congreso de Colombia |date=25 January 2002 |work= Diario Oficial 44693 del 31 de enero de 2002 |publisher=City of Bogotá |accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationality by birth ==
Colombia does not grant birthright citizenship. To obtain the Colombian citizenship at birth, one must have at least one parent a Colombian citizen or a Colombian legal resident.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/nacionalidad|title=citizenship|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A child born outside Colombia who has at least one Colombian parent can be registered as a Colombian national by birth, either upon returning to Colombia (for residents) or at a consulate abroad (for non-residents).&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;

== Nationality by naturalization ==
A person who has lived in Colombia as a legal permanent resident for five years may apply for naturalization with the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Colombia)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=spanish |url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0043_1993.html |title=Ley 43 de 1993 |publisher=Congreso de Colombia |date=1 February 1993 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are exceptions to the usual residence requirements in some cases, including:

* one year of residence for citizens of a [[Latin American]] or a [[Caribbean]] country;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/nacionalidad/adquisicion|title=How to become a Colombian citizen|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* two years residence for citizens of [[Spain]];&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* two years residence for a person married to a Colombian citizen or parent of child holding or eligible for a Colombian citizenship;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* five years residence for foreigners who are not Latin American, Caribbean or Spanish citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Pasaporte desde el 2015.jpg|thumb|Colombian nationality confers the right to acquire a [[Colombian passport]].]]

=== Tests ===
The person is also expected to pass a test related to Colombian history, geography and constitution. A Spanish-language aptitude test is also required for people who are not native Spanish-speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Those who have a bachelor's degree from a Colombian university or are over 65 years old are exempt from the tests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Dual nationality == 
Colombian nationality law acknowledges that a Colombian by birth or by [[naturalization]] as well can also have [[Multiple citizenship|other nationalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.procuraduria.gov.co/guiamp/media/file/Macroproceso%20Disciplinario/Constitucion_Politica_de_Colombia.htm|title=Constitution of Colombia|last=Article 96|first=|date=|website=Office of the Attorney General|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombians who acquired Colombian nationality by birth cannot be deprived of it under any circumstances, so acquiring another nationality does not in itself result in the loss of Colombian nationality. A person who renounced their Colombian nationality may recover it later.

Nevertheless, certain government positions are barred for those with dual citizenship. For example, career diplomats may not hold dual citizenship as per Colombian law, but an individual with dual citizenship might be appointed to a diplomatic position, but will not acquire career rights.

== Colombian citizenship ==
Colombia law differentiates between nationality and [[citizenship]]. Nationality is the attribute of the person in international law that describes his relationship to the State, whereas citizenship is given to those nationals (i.e. those that hold the Colombian nationality) that have certain rights and responsibilities to the State. The 98th article of the Colombian constitution establishes that Colombian citizens are those nationals that are 18 years of age or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=spanish |url=http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/Normativa/Documents/ConstitucionPoliticaColombia_20100810.pdf |title=Constitución Política de Colombia |publisher=Presidencia de Colombia |date=1991 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian citizens are allowed to vote on elections and exercise the public action of unconstitutionality.

== Renunciation of citizenship ==
Colombian citizens can renounce citizenship. The process of renunciation requires the citizen to appear at a Colombian embassy or consulate if the petitioner live outside of Colombia, or at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Colombia)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] if the petitioner reside in Colombia. To start the process to renounce the Colombian citizenship the petitioner must have another citizenship from a different country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/nacionalidad/renuncia|title=Renunciation of Colombian citizenship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative politics''' is a field in [[political science]], characterized by an [[empiricism|empirical]] approach based on the ''[[comparative method]]''. In other words, comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics, political institutions, and conflicts of countries. It often involves comparisons among countries and through time within single countries, emphasizing key patterns of similarity and difference. [[Arend Lijphart]] argues that comparative politics does not have a ''substantive'' focus in itself, but rather a ''methodological'' one: it focuses on "the ''how'' but does not specify the ''what'' of the analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|year=1971|title=Comparative politics and the comparative method|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=65|issue=3|pages=682–693|jstor=1955513|doi=10.2307/1955513}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, comparative politics is not defined by the object of its study, but rather by the method it applies to study political phenomena. [[Peter Mair]] and [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] advance a slightly different definition, arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a ''substantive'' focus on the study of countries' political systems and a ''method'' of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mair|first=Peter|title=A New Handbook of Political Science|editor=Goodin, Robert E.|editor2=Klingemann, Hans-Dieter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|pages=309–335|chapter=Comparative politics: An introduction to comparative.overview|isbn=0-19-829471-9|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215002/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=|access-date=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Richard|year=1991|title=Comparing forms of comparative analysis|journal=Political Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=446–462|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119347508/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1991.tb01622.x|last2=MacKenzie|first2=W. J. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose states that, on his definition: "The focus is explicitly or implicitly upon more than one country, thus following familiar political science usage in excluding within-nation comparison. Methodologically, comparison is distinguished by its use of concepts that are applicable in more than one country."&lt;ref name="Rose"/&gt;

When applied to specific fields of study, comparative politics may be referred to by other names, such as for example '''comparative government''' (the comparative study of forms of [[government]]) or '''comparative foreign policy''' (comparing the [[foreign policy|foreign policies]] of different States in order to establish general empirical connections between the characteristics of the State and the characteristics of its foreign policy).

Sometimes, especially in the United States, the term "comparative politics" is used to refer to "the politics of foreign countries." This usage of the term, however, is often considered incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)] "Comparative Methods", in Marsh, D. and G. Stoker (ed.) ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanBiezen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Biezen|first=Ingrid|authorlink=Ingrid van Biezen|author2=Caramani, Daniele|year=2006|title=(Non)comparative politics in Britain|journal=Politics|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29–37|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118602277/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2006.00248.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comparative political science" as a general term for an area of study, as opposed to a methodology of study, can be seen as redundant. The political only shows as political when either an overt or tacit comparison is being made.  A study of a single political entity, whether a society, subculture or period, would show the political as simple brute reality without comparison with another society, subculture, or period.

The highest award in the discipline of Comparative Politics is the [[Karl Deutsch]] award, awarded by the [[International Political Science Association]]. So far, it has been given to [[Juan Linz]] (2003), [[Charles Tilly]] (2006), [[Giovanni Sartori]] (2009), and [[Alfred Stepan]] (2012).

==Methodology==
The comparative method is – together with the [[experiment|experimental method]], the [[statistics|statistical method]] and the [[case study]] approach – one of the four fundamental [[scientific method]]s which can be used to test the validity of theoretical propositions, often with the use of empirical data i.e. to establish relationships among two or more empirical variables or concepts while all other variables are held constant.&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, A. (1971), cit., p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the comparative method is generally used when neither the experimental nor the statistical method can be employed: on the one hand, experiments can only rarely be conducted in political science;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)], cit., p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand the statistical method implies the mathematical manipulation of quantitative data about a large number of cases, while sometimes political research must be conducted by analyzing the behavior of qualitative variables in a small number of cases.&lt;ref&gt;As Lijphart points out in the article cited above, the experimental and statistical methods share the same logic as the comparative method: they all imply a comparison between cases which differ on the variable which is being studied, while remaining identical on all the other possible variables.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Comparative strategies===
Two major strategies are used in comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poli.haifa.ac.il/~levi/mlogic.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822123557/http://poli.haifa.ac.il/~levi/mlogic.html |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Most Similar Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Difference]]: it consists in comparing very similar cases which only differ in the ''dependent variable'', on the assumption that this would make it easier to find those ''independent variables'' which explain the presence/absence of the dependent variable. Most Similar Systems Design, or MSSD, is very helpful since it compares similar objects, it keeps many otherwise confusing and irrelevant variables in the research constant. In a basic sense, MSSD starts out with similar variables between subjects and tries to figure out why the outcome is different between the subjects.  The main shortcoming that is said about this method is that when comparing countries, since there are such a limited number of them, all potential factors of explanation can never be kept altogether constant.  As such, despite many possibilities of variables, there are only a limited number of cases to apply them to.  There are two methods of applying MSSD, the first being a stricter application and the second being a more loose application. The stricter application implies that a researcher would choose various countries that have a number of similar variables, also called control variables, and would only differ from each other by one single independent variable.  The looser application uses the same general concept, but the researcher chooses countries that have similar characteristics but those characteristics are not strictly matched to a set of control variables.  Because of the complications of so many variables but not enough cases, a second method was devolved to be used in conjunction with MSSD.&lt;ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"&gt;Anckar, Carsten. "On the Applicability of the Most Similar Systems Design and the Most Different Systems Design in Comparative Research." International Journal of Social Research Methodology 11.5 (2008): 389–401. Informaworld. Web. 20 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Most Different Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Similarity]]: it consists in comparing very different cases, all of which however have in common the same ''dependent variable'', so that any other circumstance which is present in all the cases can be regarded as the ''independent variable''.  Most Different Systems Design, or MDSD,  differs from MSSD with focus and the fact that it does not take a strict variable application.  MDSD uses differences between countries instead of similarities between countries as variables because social scientists have found that differences between countries do not explain their possible similarities if they have any.  A more basic idea of MDSD is it takes subjects with different variables within them and tries to figure out why the outcomes between them are similar in the end.  When using MDSD as a comparative research method, scientists look at changing interactions between systems in countries and then after all data is collected, the results are compared between the different systems. If the results obtained from this research differ between each other, the researcher must move up to the system level and switch to the MSSD method.  When using MSSD as a comparative research approach, there is the independent and depend variable that get introduced, specifically the dependent variable being something that is common in all the research subjects and the independent variable which would be the differing characteristic between the research subjects.  MSSD is more precise and strict at finding the differing point along with similarities, but MDSD does not have so many variables and only focuses on finding one similarity or difference between a wide selection of systems.&lt;ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"/&gt;

==Some major works in comparative politics==
*[[Aristotle]]
: In his work ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|The Politics]]'', Aristotle compares different "constitutions", by introducing a famous typology based on two criteria: the number of rulers (one, few, many) and the nature of the political regime (good or corrupt). Thus he distinguishes six different kinds of "constitutions": monarchy, aristocracy, and polity (good types), versus tyranny, oligarchy and democracy (corrupt types).
*[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]]
: In their work, ''The Civic Culture'', Almond and Verba embark on the first major cross-national survey of attitudes to determine the role of political culture in maintaining the stability of democratic regimes.
*[[Robert A. Dahl]]
: ''Polyarchy''
*[[Montesquieu]]
: ''The Spirit of the Laws''
*[[Barrington Moore]]
: In ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World'' (1966) Moore compares revolutions in countries like England, Russia and Japan (among others).  His thesis is that mass-led revolutions dispossess the landed elite and result in Communism, and that revolutions by the elite result in Fascism.  It is thus only revolutions by the bourgeoisie that result in democratic governance.  For the outlier case of India, practices of the Mogul Empire, British Imperial rule and the Caste System are cited.
*[[James C. Scott]]
: ''The Art of Not Being Governed''
*[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]
: ''Democracy in America'' and ''The Old Regime and the French Revolution''
*[[Samuel P. Huntington]]
: ''The Third Wave'' and ''Political Order in Changing Societies''
*[[Arend Lijphart]]

*[[Pippa Norris]]
: ''Critical citizens'' (1999)
*[[Robert D. Putnam]]
: ''Making Democracy Work'' (1993), a major work assessing why some democratic governments work and other fail, based on the study of the Italian regional governments.
*[[Theda Skocpol]]
: In ''States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China'' Theda Skocpol compares the major revolutions of France, Russia and China: three basically similar events which took place in three very different contexts. Skopcol's purpose is to find possible similarities which might help explain the phenomenon of political revolution. From this point of view, this work represents a good example of a research conducted according to the Most Different Systems Design.

The '''Council of Ministers''' is the collective institution of [[executive government]] in [[Jersey]]. The council co-ordinates policies and administration, especially policy affecting two or more ministers, prioritises executive and [[Law of Jersey#Sources of law|legislative proposals]], and presents a "Strategic Plan for Jersey" for approval by the [[States of Jersey]].

The council does not represent a parliamentary majority as [[Minister (government)|ministers]] may be elected on a variety of manifestos. The executive is prevented from constituting a majority of the 51 elected members by the States of Jersey Law 2005, which places a legal cap of 22 on the number of states' members who may hold office as chief minister, minister and assistant ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/States%20Assembly/States%20of%20Jersey%20Law%202005.pdf | title = States of Jersey Law 2005, Article 25 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Council of Ministers was established in December 2005.

== Constitution ==
The election for [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]] takes place as a majority vote in the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]]. The chief minister-elect then nominates nine people for the position of minister. Other candidates may be nominated from among the states members and a vote is taken for each ministerial post on a majority basis by the full membership of the [[States of Jersey]].

== Operation ==

The Chief Minister acts as president of the council and matters may be brought for discussion by any minister.

Legally ultimate responsibility for the policy decisions of a department rest solely with the minister, however in practice matters are decided by a unanimous or majority vote of the ten ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Senator Philip Ozouf, BBC Radio Jersey Talkback June 24th 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ian gorst in the royal square.JPG|thumb|100px|Senator Ian Gorst the Chief Minister of Jersey]]
Elections for ministerial posts were held on 17 and 18 November 2011. The chief minister's nominations were all contested; two of his nominations were defeated, and five ministerial posts were decided by margins of between 1 and 3 votes. The chief minister's nomination of Senator Ian Le Marquand to the Treasury was defeated, and so the chief minister amended his nomination for Home Affairs to retain Senator Le Marquand on the council, by withdrawing his nomination of Senator Lyndon Farnham. The chief minister's nomination of Connétable John Refault to Transport and Technical Services was defeated, with Deputy Kevin Lewis, a former Assistant Minister for Transport and Technical Services, being elected.&lt;ref name=Pryke&gt;{{cite news|title=Deputy Anne Pryke wins a four-way battle for Health|newspaper=[[Jersey Evening Post]]|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008-2011 ===
[[File:Senator Terry Le Sueur.jpg|thumb|100px|Former Senator Terry Le Sueur was Chief Minister of Jersey]]
Elections for ministerial posts were held on 11 and 12 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/content/articles/2008/12/10/ministerial_posts_08_feature.shtml |title= Inside the States - Council of Ministers election |first= |last= Anon |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nominees of the Chief Minister were successful with the exception of Senator Routier, proposed successively for Health and Social Services and Education, Sport and Culture. Three ministers subsequently resigned as ministers (but remained as States members) in the face of criticisms of their personal conduct: Senator Jim Perchard (2009), Deputy Terry Le Main (2010) and Deputy Sean Power (2011), triggering further elections. One minister, Senator Freddie Cohen, exchanged the role of Planning and Environment Minister for that of "foreign minister" in 2011.

*Chief Minister of Jersey: Senator [[Terry Le Sueur]]
*Treasury Minister:  Senator [[Philip Ozouf Jr|Philip Ozouf]] (elected with 38 votes; Deputy [[Geoff Southern]] received 13 votes)
*Economic Development Minister: Senator [[Alan J.H. Maclean|Alan Maclean]] (elected with 32 votes; Deputy Mike Higgins received 20 votes)
*Home Affairs Minister: Senator Ian Le Marquand (elected with 34 votes; Senator [[Stuart Syvret]] received 18 votes)
*Health and Social Services Minister: Deputy Anne Pryke (from April 2009). Her predecessor, Senator Jim Perchard  (elected in 2008 with 31 votes; Senator Paul Routier receiving 21 votes) resigned in April 2009 after controversy surrounding remarks he made in the chamber urging Senator [[Stuart Syvret]] to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/04/16/a-minister-falls-on-his-sword/ |title=A minister falls on his sword |first= |last= Editorial|work=thisisjersey.com |year=2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Education, Sport and Culture Minister: Deputy James Reed  (elected on the fourth round with 31 votes). Deputy Reed was the Chief Minister's initial candidate for the post. However, when his nomination of Senator Routier for Health and Social Services was defeated, he withdrew Deputy Reed's name and nominated Senator Routier in his place. Deputies Reed, Judy Martin and Roy Le Hérissier were also nominated. In the first round of voting Senator Routier received 16 votes, Deputy Reed 13 votes, Deputy Le Hérissier 12 votes and Deputy Martin 11 votes. With Deputy Martin eliminated, in the second round Deputy Le Hérissier received 20 votes while Senator Routier and Deputy Reed both received 16 votes. In the tie-breaking third round Deputy Reed received 29 votes and Senator Routier was eliminated with 23 votes. In the final round Deputy Reed was elected with 31 votes and Deputy Le Hérissier received 22 votes.
*Planning and Environment Minister: Deputy Rob Duhamel (from July 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/07/12/is-new-environment-minister/ |title=New Environment Minister elected |first= |last= Anon |work=thisisjersey.com |year=2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Freddie Cohen]], who was elected to the ministerial post unopposed in 2008, resigned in order to focus on his role as "foreign minister" (formally, as an assistant minister to the Chief Minister).

'''Dutch nationality law''' is based primarily on the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' and is governed by the [[Kingdom act|Kingdom Act]] on the Netherlands nationality ({{lang-nl|Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap}}), which was signed by the monarch on 19 December 1984 and officially publicised on 27 December 1984. Thus citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Dutch parent, irrespective of place of birth. Children born in the Netherlands to two foreign parents do not acquire Dutch citizenship at birth, unless special criteria are met.

Despite the existence of four different countries in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], only one category of citizen is distinguished in Dutch nationality law (''Nederlandse burgers''). The Kingdom Act on the Netherlands nationality was significantly amended with effect from 1 April 2003. A minor revision concerning people born before 1985 to a Dutch mother went into effect on 1 January 2011.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
===By descent or automatic acquisition of Dutch nationality===
A person born on or after 1 January 1985 to a Dutch father or mother (''afstamming'') is automatically a Dutch national at birth (''van rechtswege''). It is irrelevant where the child is born.

A child born to an unmarried Dutch father and a non-Dutch mother must be acknowledged by the Dutch father before birth, in order for the child to be a Dutch national at birth. Before 1 April 2003, an acknowledgement could be given after birth. Since then children who were not acknowledged before birth may nonetheless acquire Dutch citizenship through the option procedure, or through obtaining proof of paternity from a court. In the last case, the child gets Dutch nationality retroactively since the child's birth. 

From 1 January 1985 the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands nationality (Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap 19 December 1984, Stb. 628) permits children of either a Dutch father or mother to receive Dutch nationality by descent. Prior to that date Dutch nationality law (Wet op het Nederlanderschap en het ingezetenenschap (commonly abbreviated as WNI, 12 December 1892, Stb. 268) did not permit children to obtain Dutch nationality through descent from a Dutch mother (through matrilineal descent) and a non-Dutch father. Netherlands nationality was only passed through patrilineal (father) descent. Only if the father was not known or acknowledged did a child born to a Dutch mother receive Dutch nationality prior to 1 January 1985.

Between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1987 children born after 1 January 1964 but before 1 January 1985 of a Dutch mother and non-Dutch father and who had never been married could use the ‘option procedure’ to acquire Dutch nationality. This possibility was not widely known and many in this situation missed the temporary opportunity to register themselves or their children as Dutch nationals.&lt;ref name="Nee mevrouw, u bent te laat"&gt;Article: [http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1690026/2006/05/13/Nee-mevrouw-u-bent-te-laat.dhtml 'Nee mevrouw, u bent te laat'] by Karin Alfenaar, de Verdieping Trouw Nieuws, 13 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a number of these children of Dutch mothers and non-Dutch fathers (so-called "latent Dutch" or "latente Nederlanders") began to organise themselves in the hope of persuading the Dutch government that Article 27 of ''Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap'' condones the discrimination against women enshrined in the earlier Dutch Nationality Law (before its 1985 revision), and it should therefore be revoked. In 2005, several Dutch lawyers&lt;ref name="everaert" /&gt; agreed to take on the case and formalised the group into “Stichting Ne(e)derlanderschap Ja!”.&lt;ref&gt;Article: [http://www.rnw.nl/nl/caribiana/article/de-latente-nederlanders De latente Nederlanders.] Radio Netherlands World Emission, by Pieter-Bas van Wiechen, 23 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/news_focus/Equal-rights-for-latent-Dutch-citizens_80829.html Article: "Equal Rights for Latent Dutch citizens] Expatica Netherlands, 2 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative change was discussed by parliament in 2006,&lt;ref name="everaert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=mr.

In December 2008, a new proposal was presented to the House of Representatives,&lt;ref name="De latente Nederlanders"/&gt; and in January 2010 Legislative bill 31.831 (R1873) passed a majority vote amending the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands nationality to allow the so-called 'latent Dutch' to opt to receive Dutch nationality, regardless of their current age and marital status, and without requirement to renounce their original nationality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/nl/nederlands/article/kamer-akkoord-met-paspoort-latente-nederlanders Kamer voor paspoort latente Nederlanders] Radio Nederland Wereldomroep.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the Dutch Upper House approved the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/nederlands/article/einde-aan-het-tijdperk-van-latente-nederlanders Einde aan het tijdperk van latente Nederlanders] Radio Nederland Wereldomroep.&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law in July 2010 by Minister of Justice Mr Hirsch Ballin and H.M. the Queen, and published in the official Gazette issued by the Dutch Government (''Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden''),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2010-10196.html Staatscourant, published 30 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; with effect 1 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/nederlands/article/hoe-bepaal-je-je-een-latente-nederlander-bent Hoe bepaal je of je een latente Nederlander bent?] Radio Nederland Wereldomroep.&lt;/ref&gt; Latent Dutch now have the opportunity to receive Dutch nationality by option. Many latent Dutch regard themselves as having been Dutch since birth.&lt;ref name="Nee mevrouw, u bent te laat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article: [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1000/Nieuws/article/detail/435278/2009/10/06/Saskia-heeft-Nederlandse-moeder-maar-moet-land-uit.dhtml Saskia heeft Nederlandse moeder, maar moet land uit], AD Nieuws, 6 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while latent Dutch are by definition descended from a Dutch mother, nationality granted through the option procedure is not retroactive to the date of their birth. Under the law, these individuals are not considered to be Dutch since birth (''van rechtswege''), but rather are legally ‘Dutch by option’ from the date that the requirements of the ‘option procedure’ are fulfilled.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===By option===
The option procedure is a simpler and quicker way of acquiring Dutch citizenship compared to naturalisation. In effect, it is a form of simplified naturalisation.

In order to be eligible for the option procedure, it is necessary to hold a Dutch residence permit and to be any of the following:

* an adult who was born in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten and who has lived in any of these places continuously since birth.
* a person born in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten who has lived in any of these places for an uninterrupted period of at least three years and who has not acquired the citizenship of any other country (a stateless person).
* an adult who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten since he or she was four years old.
* an adult who used to be a Dutch national and who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for at least one year and whose residence is without any restriction as to length.
* someone who has been married to a Dutch national for at least three years and who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for an uninterrupted period of at least fifteen years.
* someone aged sixty-five years or over and who has been legally resident in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for an uninterrupted period of at least fifteen years.
* a minor who is acknowledged by a Dutch national who has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for an uninterrupted period of at least three years.
* a minor who, as a result of a Court decision or by law at the time of his or her birth, is under the joint custody of a non-Dutch parent and another person who is a Dutch national and who, since the start of this custody, has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for a period of at least three years during which the child has had his or her principal place of residence in the Netherlands.

Exception: Legislation 31.813 (R1873),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eerstekamer.nl/wetsvoorstel/31813_wijziging_rijkswet_op_het Legislation 31.813 (R1873)] amendments to the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands Nationality&lt;/ref&gt; ''inter alia'', amends the Kingdom of the Netherlands' nationality law to allow latent Dutch to opt to receive Dutch nationality, effective 1 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/nederlands/article/hoe-bepaal-je-je-een-latente-nederlander-bent Article: Hoe Bepaal je je wwn latente Nederlander Bent?] How do you determine whether you are Latent Dutch? Radio Nederland Wereldomroep (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions of eligibility through the 'option procedure' differ somewhat from those described above. Eligibility criteria for Dutch nationality as a latent Dutch person are that the:&lt;ref&gt;[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2010-10196.html Staatscourant, published 30 June 2010, Sections 6.1.i through 6.1.o]&lt;/ref&gt;
# applicant was born before 1 January 1985;
# mother was a Dutch national ''when the applicant was born'';
# father was not a Dutch national when the applicant was born;
# applicant did not obtain Dutch nationality between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 1987 through the option procedure and then subsequently lose that Dutch nationality; and
# applicant has no criminal record.
All five conditions must be met. If one or more of the conditions are not met the person is ineligible for nationality by this particular means under the recent changes to the option procedure affecting the latent Dutch. Residency in the Netherlands is ''not'' an eligibility requirement for latent Dutch applicants.

Applicants for Dutch citizenship through the option procedure are not required by Dutch law to renounce any foreign citizenship they might hold. However, the laws pertaining to their other citizenship may disagree.

===''Jus soli''===
''[[Jus soli]]'' is the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship of that state. Dutch law has no provisions for the automatic granting of the Dutch nationality based on the actual place of birth, however a child is Dutch if it was born to at least one parent, having his or her main residence in the Netherlands, Curaçao, Sint Maarten or Aruba (or the Netherlands Antilles) at the times of the births of that parent and of the child, provided the child itself has at birth its main residence in one of those countries too.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3(3) of the [http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=Rijkswet%20op%20het%20Nederlanderschap Netherlands Nationality Act].&lt;/ref&gt;  

A child found on Dutch territory (including ships and airplanes with Dutch nationality), whose parents are unknown, is considered Dutch by birth if within five years since being found it does not become apparent that the child had another citizenship by birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kennisbankburgerzaken.nl/algemeen/toonBijlage.asp?id=370&lt;/ref&gt;

===By naturalisation===
An application for Dutch citizenship by naturalisation must meet all the conditions below:

* Aged eighteen or over;
* Holder of a permanent resident permit or a valid residence permit with a non-temporary reason of stay (notably family formation or reunion ''gezinsvorming'' or ''gezinshereniging'');
* Five years of continuous residence in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten with a valid residence permit prior to the application date. Residency under a temporary reason of stay (notably study) is also counted in those five years. There are a number of exceptions to this rule.
* Sufficiently integrated in Dutch society and are able to read, write, speak and understand Dutch. This must normally be proven by taking a naturalisation test. Successful completion of an eligible integration course is an alternative. The ''[[Staatsexamen Nederlands als Tweede Taal]]'' diplomas NT2-I or NT2-II give their holder exemption from taking the naturalisation test. There are lots of other exemptions, see the Decision naturalisation test (Besluit naturalisatietoets) art. 3.
* In the five years preceding the application, the applicant has not been given any custodial sentence, training order, community service order or high monetary penalty.

Since 1 March 2009, anyone who requests naturalization must take an oath promising adherence to the values of the Dutch state: "I swear (declare) that I respect the constitutional order of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its freedoms and its rights, and I swear (promise) to faithfully fulfil the obligations due to my nationality. So help me God Almighty", or: "This is what I promise and declare."&lt;ref&gt;Law on introducing the declaration of allegiance and for adapting the rule of obtaining the Netherlands nationality after recognition, 27 June 2008, Art. 1.H.2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Art. 23.3. of the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands Nationality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0003738/geldigheidsdatum_20-03-2010#Hoofdstuk8 Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap] Art. 23 onder 3.&lt;/ref&gt; some categories of people are excepted from declaring their allegiance, through a general administrative measure. According to Art. 60a.6. of the Decree regarding the Obtention and Loss of the Netherlands Nationality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0013605/geldigheidsdatum_20-03-2010#HoofdstukIIIA Besluit verkrijging en verlies Nederlanderschap] Art. 60a onder 6.&lt;/ref&gt; persons with a physical or psychical handicap who are unable to state their allegiance are exempted from doing so.

====Exemptions to the residence requirement====
The five-year residence requirement may not apply where the applicant falls into any of the following categories:

* a person adopted after majority in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten by parents at least one of whom has Dutch nationality.
* married to or are the registered partner of a Dutch man or Dutch woman. If this is the case, the person can submit an application for naturalisation after three years of marriage or registered partnership and cohabitation. If the person has cohabited in the Netherlands with a Dutch man or Dutch woman (both partners unmarried) for an uninterrupted period of three years, an application may also be submitted. Note: this is true in respect to marriage, partnership or cohabitation if and only if in the last three years the applicant has continually lived together with the partner inside the Netherlands. As a rule of thumb, for each passed year, more than six months per year must have been spent under the same roof with that partner. There is an extra clause, namely that the couple has to remain living under the same roof for as long as the request for naturalization is being researched.
* the five-year term is reduced to a three-year term if the applicant is stateless.
* the five-year term is reduced to a three-year term if the applicant as a minor is acknowledged or legitimised by a Dutch national and has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for a period of 3 years.
* the five-year term is reduced to a two-year term if the applicant has legally lived in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten for a period of ten years, the last two of which uninterruptedly.
* a former Dutch national. In some cases the applicant will instead be able to use the option procedure.

====Exemptions to the requirement to renounce foreign citizenship====
An applicant for naturalisation does not have to give up his current nationality in the following cases:&lt;ref&gt;[https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Renouncing-your-current-nationality.aspx Exceptions] Ind.nl.&lt;/ref&gt;

* where the original nationality is automatically lost upon naturalisation as a Dutch national
* the legislation of the applicant's country does not allow renunciation of nationality.
* the person is married to or the registered partner of a Dutch national.
* recognised refugees.
* born in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten, and still living there at the time of application.
* where the applicant cannot be expected to contact the authorities in the country of which they are a national.
* where the applicant has "special and objectively assessable reasons" for not renouncing his existing nationality.
* where, in order to give up the current nationality, the applicant would have to fulfil military service obligations or pay for such military service instead of fulfilling it. This must be demonstrated in each case.
* where renunciation of the applicant's existing nationality would cause "serious financial losses" (for example, inheritance rights). This must be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;A peculiar case of "serious financial losses" is in the case where renunciation of the applicant's existing nationality would cost too much in respect to income. See the following footnote for explanations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* where, in order to give up the applicant's current nationality, the applicant must pay a large sum of money to the authorities in his or her country.&lt;ref&gt;This must be demonstrated with proof of income and proof of consular fees to be paid in case of renunciation, specific to the applicant's own case or with general specifications of such consular fees for every national of that country. Note: As a rule of thumb, if that sum of money is larger than twice the applicant's monthly income, they have a right to keep their nationality of origin. Loans do not count as income. A testimony of this process is shown at [[Commons:Image:RWN Exception 1 d.jpg]]. That document is a sworn Dutch translation of a proof of consular fees from the head of the Consular Section of the Romanian Embassy in the Hague. Since the sum of 515 Euro was greater than his income for two months (excluding a study loan from IB Groep), the national naturalized by the decision of Her Majesty the Queen was allowed to retain his Romanian nationality. Such exemption had to be explained in advance to the naturalization clerk of the municipality, who filled then the naturalization request papers accordingly.&lt;/ref&gt;

These exemptions do not hold for Austrian, Danish and Norwegian nationals, since these countries (together with the Netherlands) are parties to the Convention on the Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality and on Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple Nationality (see Chapter I, art. 1, paragraph 1).

This was also the case for Belgian nationals until 28 April 2008, since Belgium denounced Chapter 1 of this treaty on such date.&lt;ref name="minbuza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="declarations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=043&amp;CV=1&amp;NA=12&amp;PO=999&amp;CN=999&amp;VL=1&amp;CM=9&amp;CL=ENG|title=Search on States and International Organisations|author=|date=|website=Treaty Office|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, this was also the case for Luxembourgeois nationals until 10 July 2009.&lt;ref name="minbuza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="declarations"/&gt;

====Children====
Children aged under eighteen may be added to a parent's application for Dutch citizenship. Those aged sixteen and seventeen will only be naturalised if they give their active consent while those aged twelve through fifteen inclusive are given a chance to object.

===By resumption===
Former Dutch nationals who hold permanent resident permits and have resided in the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, or Sint Maarten) for at least one year may regain Dutch citizenship through the option procedure.

Where the person is not resident in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the person must have lost Dutch citizenship ''after'' reaching the age of majority and through the ''acquisition'' of another citizenship. In addition one of the following conditions must be satisfied:

* born in the country whose nationality was acquired and living there at the time of acquisition of the nationality of that country, or
* before turning eighteen, lived in the country whose nationality was acquired for an uninterrupted period of at least five years, or
* at the time of acquisition of the nationality of the other country, the person was married to someone who possessed that nationality.

These criteria are similar to the criteria for exemption from loss of Dutch citizenship in place since 1 April 2003. If a former Dutch national lost Dutch nationality prior to 31 March 2003 under one of the three conditions above, that individual may submit an application to regain Dutch nationality through option. The application opting for Dutch nationality may be submitted up to 31 March 2013 (i.e., ten years from the 2003 change in the law).

==Loss of Dutch citizenship==
Dutch nationals may lose their citizenship through long residence outside the Netherlands while having more than one nationality, or acquisition of a foreign nationality. In addition, in some cases it is possible to be deprived of Dutch citizenship.

===By residence outside the Netherlands===
The Dutch law has contained for many years provisions that removed Dutch citizenship from certain Dutch persons who held another nationality at birth and remained resident outside the Netherlands in adulthood.

====Prior to 1985====
Before 1 January 1985, Dutch nationals lost their nationality in cases where they were born outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands, lived for an uninterrupted period of ten years outside the Kingdom after reaching the age of majority (then twenty-one) and did not submit notification that they wished to retain their Dutch nationality before the period of ten years.

These provisions affected Dutch nationals born abroad before 1 January 1954.

====1985–2003====
Under the 1985 legislation, Dutch nationals born outside the Netherlands who also held the nationality of the country of their birth lost Dutch citizenship if they lived in the country of their birth for ten years after they turn 18 (and were still citizens or nationals of their country of birth).

Those who were issued a Dutch passport or proof of Dutch citizenship on or after 1 January 1990 are deemed never to have lost Dutch citizenship. This exemption was put in place on 1 February 2001.

Former nationals who were not issued a Dutch passport or proof of Dutch citizenship in 1990 or later were given a limited period of time to acquire Dutch citizenship by option, until 31 March 2005.

====Since 2003====
Since 1 April 2003, following an amendment to the Netherlands Nationality Act of 1985, Dutch nationals with dual nationality will lose their Dutch citizenship if they hold a foreign citizenship and reside outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands or the [[European Union]] for ten years.

In the case of Dutch nationals who possessed dual nationality on 1 April 2003 and who were then resident outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the European Union, the ten years started on 1 April 2003.

The amendment lets Dutch nationals who hold foreign citizenship and reside abroad keep their citizenship by either having a principal residence in the Netherlands or another EU member state for at least a year or applying for a Dutch passport or proof of Dutch nationality before 1 April 2013, the end of the ten years. A new period of ten years starts on the day that the person is issued with a passport or proof of Dutch nationality.

== Impact of UK departure from EU ==
The consequences of the UK’s departure from the EU ([[Brexit]]) will impact Dutch nationals in the UK and British nationals in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2018/04/brexit-and-dual-nationality-centre-stage-as-campaigners-meet-dutch-mps/&lt;/ref&gt;. This prospective loss of their original or dual nationality has encourage many to support the [[European Citizen’s Initiative]] for Permanent European Union Citizenship. &lt;ref&gt;https://eci.ec.europa.eu/002/public/#/initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

===By acquisition of another citizenship===
A person over the age of majority&lt;ref&gt;http://eudo-citizenship.eu/NationalDB/docs/NL%20Netherlands%20Nationality%20Act%20as%20of%201%20January%201985%20(refworld,%20English).pdf Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; who voluntarily acquired another citizenship before 1 April 2003 automatically lost Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref name="minbuza"/&gt;

From 1 April 2003, loss of Dutch citizenship upon naturalisation in another country is still automatic unless at least one of the following exemptions applies:&lt;ref name="minbuza"&gt;[http://www.minbuza.nl/en/services/consular-services/dutch-nationality/acquiring-a-different-nationality Acquiring a different nationality.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043820/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/services/consular-services/dutch-nationality/acquiring-a-different-nationality |date=2012-04-07 }} Dutch Department of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

* the person is born in the country of the other nationality and has a principal residence there at the time of acquisition of that nationality.
* if before turning 18, the person has had a principal residence in the country of the other nationality for an uninterrupted period of five years;
* if the person is married to a living person who possesses the nationality that the former person wishes to acquire.

If a person already lost Dutch nationality under these three exceptions prior to 1 April 2003, the final date to regain Dutch nationality under these three exceptions was 1 April 2013. Since then, it is no longer possible to reacquire Dutch nationality by option under these three exceptions if the person had already lost Dutch nationality prior to 1 April 2003. The only way to regain Dutch nationality is by naturalisation. These exemptions do not apply in the case of acquisition of Austrian, Norwegian or Danish citizenship. Before 28 April 2008, those exemptions did not apply to obtaining Belgian nationality.&lt;ref name="minbuza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="declarations"/&gt; Before 10 July 2009, these exemptions did not apply to getting the Luxembourgeois nationality.&lt;ref name="minbuza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="declarations"/&gt; This is due to the provisions of the ''Convention on the Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality'', to which the Netherlands became party in 1985. [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=043&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=01/02/2006&amp;CL=ENG]

Other exceptions also exist such as the one in which minors who naturalise independently from their parents will not lose their Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latentenederlanders.wikispaces.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627163811/http://latentenederlanders.wikispaces.com/ |archivedate=2010-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That was particularly helpful prior to 1985, when the age of majority was 21.

The exemptions lead to internal problems in the case of acquisition of Japanese or South Korean citizenship since neither [[Japan]] nor [[South Korea]] allows its nationals to hold foreign citizenships in their adult years.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Japanese nationality law|Japanese]] and [[South Korean nationality law]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; They are strictly Japanese or South Korean internal affairs and have to be solved by Japanese or South Korean citizens themselves, according to the laws of their own country. They are not problems of the Dutch state, and all that the Dutch laws say in this respect is that such Dutch nationals with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.&lt;ref name="haarlemmermeer"&gt;[http://www.haarlemmermeer.nl/Digitale_balie/Alle_producten_alfabetisch/K_t_m_O/Nederlandse_nationaliteit_afstand_doen Nederlandse nationaliteit, afstand doen.] Haarlemmermeer municipality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch nationals are not allowed to renounce their nationality if they become stateless&lt;ref name="haarlemmermeer"/&gt; so this renunciation has to occur while they have dual nationality, which is illegal in Japan and South Korea. Therefore, acquiring Japanese or South Korean nationality cannot be done by exempted Dutch nationals without breaking the laws of such countries. Each sovereign state decides for itself who are its citizens, and other states are not allowed to intercede on behalf of individuals in such internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationaljustice.rnw.nl/nederlands/article/ook-beatrix-heeft-dubbele-nationaliteit Ook Beatrix heeft dubbele nationaliteit.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821183845/http://internationaljustice.rnw.nl/nederlands/article/ook-beatrix-heeft-dubbele-nationaliteit |date=August 21, 2014 }} Radio Nederland Wereldomroep.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By deprivation===
Dutch citizenship by ''naturalization'' may be withdrawn if procured by fraud or if the naturalized Dutch national does not renounce a foreign citizenship as per the requirements for naturalization (if one did not have the right to be exempted from such requirement or if one did not claim one's right to such exemption before signing a paper wherein one agrees to renounce the original nationality). A similar requirement exists for citizens of Japan and South Korea (see above).

Dutch citizenship may also be revoked in the case of service in a foreign army at war with the Netherlands.

The possibility to reapply for lost Dutch nationality under those three exceptions expired on 31 March 2013.

===By joining jihadist groups===
On 29 August 2014, Dutch ministers, in their effort to discourage young [[Islam in the Netherlands|Dutch Muslims]] from joining terrorist organisations involved in a war with the Netherlands or one of its allies, planned to increase the options of withdrawing Dutch citizenship from dual nationals. This will be extended to the people who train in terrorist camps or work in them as instructors.

In addition, passports of people suspected of making plans to travel to a [[War|conflict zone]] and join a terrorist organisation like [[ISIL]] may be declared invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/08/dutch_government_outlines_plan.php|title=Dutch government outlines plans to tackle jihadis, radicalisation - DutchNews.nl|author=|date=29 August 2014|website=dutchnews.nl|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Although Dutch law restricts dual citizenship, it is possible for Dutch nationals to legally hold dual citizenship in a number of circumstances, including:

* those who acquire another citizenship at the time of birth (for example, a child born to Dutch parents in the [[United States]] would hold both [[United States nationality law#Birth within the United States|US]] and Dutch citizenship).
* persons who acquire Dutch citizenship through the option procedure (including former Dutch citizens resuming citizenship)
* persons who become naturalised Dutch nationals if they obtain an exemption from the requirement to renounce their foreign citizenship, such as those who are married to Dutch nationals.
* Dutch nationals who naturalise in another country who are exempted from the loss of nationality rule, such as those married to a national of that country.

===Dispute===
Dutch nationality law is an object of enduring dispute, dissension and debate, since the electoral campaign of [[Pim Fortuyn]] turned immigration into a hot issue in Dutch politics. Since the [[assassination of Pim Fortuyn]], anti-immigration politicians like [[Geert Wilders]] and [[Rita Verdonk]] have opposed dual citizenship.

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because the Netherlands forms part of the [[European Union]], Dutch citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Netherlands (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/netherlands/index_en.htm | title=Netherlands | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Dutch embassy, Dutch citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former territories==
Before independence, Dutch citizenship was held by many persons in [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. In general, those acquiring citizenship of these countries at independence have lost their Dutch citizenship, but a request for determination of citizenship status can be addressed to the Dutch authorities.

==Dutch citizenship statistics==
Figures from the Dutch government show that approximately 11,500 people were granted Dutch citizenship by naturalisation in the first six months of 2003. There were close to 20,000 applications. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010748/http://www.ind.nl/en/inbedrijf/nederlanderworden/Aantalnaturalisatieaanvragenblijftconstant.asp] 

According to the country's statistics office [https://web.archive.org/web/20061025160418/http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/2005-1829-wm.htm] , nearly 21,000 people were granted Dutch nationality through naturalisation in 2004 (13,000 adults and 8,000 children at the same time). This is 4,000 fewer than in 2003 and half the number in 2002.

==Travel freedom of Dutch citizens==
[[File:Visa requirements for Dutch citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Dutch citizens]] {{legend|#FDC421|Netherlands}}{{legend|#042E9B|Freedom of movement}}{{legend|#22B14C|Visa not required}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa on arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Visa available both on arrival or online}}{{legend|#A8ACAB|Visa required prior to arrival}}]]
{{Main|Visa requirements for Dutch citizens}}

Visa requirements for Dutch citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the [[Netherlands]]. In 2017, Dutch citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 173 countries and territories, ranking the Dutch nationality 4th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].

The Dutch nationality is ranked fourth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers in addition to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, human development as well.

'''ETA's 2006 "permanent ceasefire"''' was the period spanning between 24 March and 30 December 2006 during which, following an [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] communiqué, the Spanish government, led by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] on one side, and the militant group on the other, engaged in talks as a means to agree on a formula to voluntarily disband the latter. It was terminated as a result of the [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing]].

==Background and declaration==

At the time of ETA's declaration, the most recent to date of its killings had been committed on 30 May 2003, whereas its last proven assassination attempt occurred on 17 February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/4273231.stm |title='Eta cell' was planning attacks |work=BBC News |date=17 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA had been briefly blamed for the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]], but it soon became clear that the attack was the work of radical [[Islamism|Islamists]]. For the next two years, there had been some conjecture whether ETA was refraining from their previous level of violence out of weakness, out of a change of heart or tactics, or because the 11 March attacks had undercut support for violent political tactics.

On 22 March 2006 ETA sent a DVD message to the Basque Network [[Euskal Irrati-Telebista]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/effective-on-march-24-eta-cease-fire?itemId=D20829&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en  |title=ETA cease-fire |work=eitb24 |date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the journals ''[[Gara]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gara.net/idatzia/20060323/art156940.php |title=ETA declara un alto el fuego permanente para impulsar un proceso democrático ("ETA declares a permanent ceasefire to give impetus to a democratic process" |work=Gara |date=3 March 2006 |language=Spanish (text of announcement in Basque, Spanish and French)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Berria]] with a communiqué from the organization announcing what it called a "permanent ceasefire" that was broadcast over Spanish TV. According to the spokeswoman for the organisation, the "ceasefire" would begin on Friday 24 March. In their communiqué, they stated that the French and Spanish governments should cooperate and respond positively to this new situation. On 23 March, Gara published an extended version of the communiqué. The calculated ambiguity of the term "permanent" (which was a novelty when compared to previous "ceasefire" declarations) was widely discussed by most observers, even though it was mostly regarded as a positive sign of ETA's will to quit its violent activities.

==Reactions to the declaration==

Most political parties welcomed the news of a ceasefire on the part of ETA. The government (under the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) administration) displayed an optimistic and hopeful response to the announcement, although in official statements president Zapatero called for "prudence".

PP: The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (headed by Mariano Rajoy) showed pessimism with regards to this announcement and claimed that it was only a pause for ETA, probably in the same fashion as the previous truce (declared by ETA in 1998, under president Aznar's administration). Rajoy called on the government to continue "fighting terrorism" and reject negotiations.

[[Basque Government]]: [[Juan José Ibarretxe]] called for the establishment of a negotiation table "without exclusions" (i.e. involving all the concerned political sectors, i.e., Batasuna, which is currently illegal).

Batasuna's position evolved from a cautious optimism into increasingly serious warnings against what they considered "a lack of resolve on the part of the Spanish government" and what they believed was "a will not to solve the conflict but to erode the Nationalist Left". The harshest of such warnings was issued on 5 December 2005, when they gave a press conference denouncing "continued repression" (in reference to the detentions of ETA members by the police) and warning that the peace process could "hardly continue in such conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gara.euskalherria.com/idatzia/20061206/art192140.php |title=''Batasuna afirma que "el proceso es inviable en estas condiciones"'' |work=Gara daily |date=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Barajas bombing, Batasuna remained the only political party that considered that the "ceasefire" was still viable. An ETA communiqué released soon after the Barajas bombings stated the terrorist group's apparent will to continue negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/189753/0/ETA/comunicado/gara/ |title=''ETA comunica que "el alto el fuego sigue vigente" pero que responderá a "agresiones"'' |work=20 Minutos |date=9 January 2007&lt;!-- - 20:23h--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five months later, on 5 June 2007, ETA released a statement affirming it considered the "ceasefire" to be over, warning attacks would be resumed at midnight that same day.&lt;ref name=medianoche/&gt;

The 2006–2007 ETA "ceasefire" was a period of heightened political tension in Spain. The strategic interests of the concerned political parties and the mutual recriminations between Spanish politicians of acting with hidden agendas were often at the forefront of the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/03/22/espana/1174533048.html ''Políticos ante el alto el fuego de ETA: De la esperanza al desencuentro'' (El Mundo, martes 05/06/2007 08:29)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations and incidents during the "ceasefire"==
[[Image:ArmaTiroPumEtaMilikiliklik26 8.jpg|thumb|right|ETA members fire salvoes at [[Aritxulegi]]]]
On 23 September 2006 masked and armed ETA members took part in a political act in Aritxulegi ([[Gipuzkoa]]) and declared that the organization will "keep taking up arms" until achieving "independence and socialism in the Basque country". The militant claimed that "the fight is not a thing of the past. It is the present and the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/24/espana/1159091695.html |work=El Mundo |date=24 September 2006 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was regarded by some as intended to put pressure on the talks with the Spanish government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article1747147.ece |title=Eta to 'keep taking up arms' in secession war |first=Daniel |last=Woolls |work=The Independent |date=25 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were announced on 17 September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/media-ampldquoel-paisamprdquo-affirms-eta-and-spanish-government-?itemId=B24_10242&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en ETA and Spanish Government to initiate formal talks in a month], ''eitb24'', 17 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and by some other analysts as a declaration of ETA's ultimate intentions, making clear that the organization will not disarm until every single one of their goals have been completely achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5375834.stm |title=Basque militants refuse to disarm |work=BBC News |date=24 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish president [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] stressed in the Spanish Parliament that the Spanish Government would still keep its offer for talks despite the militant's statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/parliamentary-session-spanish-pm-stresses-basque-peace-process-st?itemId=B24_12467&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en Spanish PM stresses Basque peace process still on track], ''eitb24'', 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] announced that his government would begin negotiations with the ETA.

On 24 October 2006 a suspected ETA cell stole some 300 handguns, ammunition and spare parts in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.gara.net/idatzia/20061025/art186010.php La Policía sospecha que fue ETA quien robó anteayer 350 pistolas en Nimes] ("The police suspect that it was ETA who stole 350 guns yesterday in Nîmes"), ''Gara'', 25 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2006 Gara newspaper published excerpts of ETA's bulletin ''[[Zutabe]]'' no.111, in which the organization pondered that "if the Spanish government doesn't fulfill its compromises and there are no visible steps, the peace process will be broken". ETA also announced that they would "make a renewed effort towards the negotiations with the Spanish government". ETA "laments that in the time elapsed since the March declaration of ceasefire (…) precious time has been wasted". They demanded from Spanish president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero "to give a positive answer" to two central issues: (1) "to the specific demand of the fulfilment of the commitments he adopted on leaving aside repression and ceasing attacks" and (2) "he will have to commit clearly to respect the will for an [independence] process in [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Euskal Herria]], that is: the will of Basque citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://gara.euskalherria.com/idatzia/20061104/art187359.php ETA constata la crisis del proceso y anuncia «un nuevo esfuerzo»] ("ETA confirms the crisis of the process and announces 'a new effort'", ''Gara'', 4 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November, the Socialist Party admitted that the peace process was fraught with problems. Batasuna’s staunch refusal to condemn terrorism did not help. Also, the [[hunger strike]] of ETA activist [[Iñaki de Juana Chaos]] led to [[Kale Borroka]] actions by some youths liked to the [[abertzale left]]. On 14 December, [[Batasuna]]’s [[Pernando Barrena]] said that the peace process was “going nowhere.” He accused the Socialist Party of making excessive demands to [[Batasuna]].

==End of "ceasefire"==
[[Image:Atentado de ETA en el aeropuerto de Madrid Barajas4.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the T4 parking days after the bombing.]]
{{Main|2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing}}

On 30 December 2006, at 9:00 in the morning, after three confusing warning calls, ETA detonated a van bomb in a parking building at the [[Madrid]] Barajas international airport. The explosion caused the collapse of the building and killed two Ecuadorian immigrants who were napping inside their cars in the parking building.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}

In November 2006 ETA warned the Spanish government that the so-called "peace process" was "in crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Nov04/0,4670,SpainETACeasefire,00.html | work=Fox News | title=ETA: Peace Process Is in Crisis | first=Harold | last=Heckle | date=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concessions sought by ETA and its political supporters (which included the relocation of ETA inmates from jails all over Spain to penitentiaries located in the Basque region and the halting of arrests and trials of ETA suspects) had not been attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,240659,00.html |title=Ruling Spanish Socialists: Peace Process With Basques 'Dead' |work=FOXNews.com |date=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was reported&lt;!--commenting out dead link &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/20061231/nacional-terrorismo/banda-recordo-ejecutivo-precedente_200612310243.htm ABC.es]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; that, before the attack, ETA reminded Rodríguez Zapatero about the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] (as a way to pressure the government with the possibility of an attack before upcoming elections), even though the source also states that ETA 'had nothing to do' with the attack itself.

On 4–5 January 2007, the [[Ertzaintza]] found a cache of 350 pounds of explosives in Atxondo (Biscay). Out of these, 220 pounds were ready for immediate use (only lacking a detonator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501167.html |title=Spanish police find more explosives |work=Associated Press |first= Mar |last=Roman |date=5 January 2007 |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2007, newspaper [[Gara]] published a letter on behalf of ETA, claiming responsibility for the 30 December 2006 bomb at Barajas airport in Madrid. ETA also claimed that the ceasefire was still in place despite the bombing. ETA extended their solidarity to the "[[collateral damage]]" (the two Ecuadorian immigrants killed by the explosion), assuring that the "objective of this armed action was not to cause victims" and blamed the government for the dead, in view of the alleged lack of diligence evacuating the building. They also accused the Government and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] of creating obstacles for a democratic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/01/09/espana/1168348140.html?a=8820e184a520a8c89dc2a95e237ac798&amp;t=1168352723 |title=ETA dice que el alto el fuego sigue 'vigente' y que no quiso 'causar víctimas' en la T4 |date=9 January 2007 |work= elmundo.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/asume/autoria/atentado/Barajas/asegura/alto/fuego/continua/vigente/elpepuesp/20070109elpepunac_8/Tes |title=ETA asume la autoría del atentado de Barajas pero asegura que el alto el fuego continúa vigente |language=Spanish |work=ELPAÍS.com |date=9 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal ending, subsequent ETA attacks and reactions===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Que-6-june-07.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of Spanish [[free daily newspaper]] ''Qué!'' on 6 June 2007, with prominent headline condemning ETA]] --&gt;

Despite the fact that all political parties and analysts in Spain -including those in the Basque country- and abroad considered the "ceasefire" ended with the Barajas bombing (accordingly, the negotiation tables were not resumed ever since that date) it was only weeks after, on 5 June 2007, that ETA released a communiqué through the Berria newspaper's web site formally announcing the end of the "permanent ceasefire" by midnight. ETA also announced that it would "act in all fronts in defence of Euskal Herria".&lt;ref name=medianoche&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/da/finalizado/alto/fuego/partir/manana/elpepuesp/20070605elpepunac_2/Tes |title=ETA da por finalizado el alto el fuego a partir de medianoche |language=Spanish |work=ELPAÍS.com |date=5 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2007, Spanish police found 130&amp;nbsp;kg (285 pounds) of explosives in a car parked in the town of [[Ayamonte]], near the Southern Portuguese border.  The cache was suspected to belong to ETA, stoking fears that attacks would be imminent after the group announced the end of the "permanent ceasefire" on 5 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6229548.stm |work=BBC NEWS |title= Basque grievances nourish Eta |date=22 June 2007|first= Paul |last=Moss }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 2007, ETA members placed a bomb under the car of the bodyguard of a PSE-EE (Socialist Party of the Basque Country) council member of [[Galdakao]]. The bodyguard, Juan Carlos Domingo Galíndez, was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/hiere/Bilbao/escolta/concejal/PSE/bomba/lapa/situada/coche/elpepuesp/20071009elpepunac_5/Tes |title=ETA hiere en Bilbao al escolta de un concejal del PSE con una bomba lapa situada en su coche |language=Spanish |work= ELPAÍS.com |date=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2007, members of ETA shot dead two Spanish civil guards in Southern France. They are the first fatalities blamed on ETA in nearly a year. The two unarmed plainsclothes civil guard officers were in [[Capbreton]], France, to meet with French police about joint operations against ETA, which traditionally uses France as a base for its attacks in Spain. The civil guards entered a cafe for their breakfast where three ETA suspects were by chance. The suspects recognized them and ambushed them on the parking, fleeing then in a car, later leaving it to commandeer a second car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7123783.stm |date= 2 December 2007 |title=Spain buries murdered policeman |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2008, ETA said that it would base its calls for independence on the [[Kosovo status process|Kosovo status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=46703 |work=B92 |title=ETA to follow Kosovo example |date=5 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501175528/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=46703 |archivedate=1 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2008, two former ETA leaders, José Luis Álvarez Santacristina (previously responsible for ETA's political positions) and Kepa Pikabea (previously responsible for ETA's armed actions) both serving jail sentences at that time, released a joint note to the press stating that "ETA did not take into account the opinion of the majority of ETA inmates at the time of breaking the most recent truce" and that the "armed struggle is useless and an obstacle" for Basque nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Txelis/Pikabea/ETA/tuvo/cuenta/opinion/presos/romper/tregua/elpepuesp/20080222elpepunac_6/Tes |title='Txelis' y 'Pikabea': "ETA no tuvo en cuenta la opinión de los presos al romper la tregua" |language=Spanish |work=ELPAÍS.com |date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the note was released, they had both been expelled from the ETA inmates collective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5696">The '''European Convention on Information on Foreign Law''' is a 1968 [[Council of Europe]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] whereby states agree to procedures for the mandatory provision of information when a state requests information on the legal system of another state.

==Content==
States that ratify the Convention appoint a single body to receive requests from other state parties regarding information on the "law and procedure in civil and commercial fields as well as on their judicial organisation". When a request for such information is received from a judicial authority in another state party, the Convention makes it mandatory of the state to provide information in response to the request. States may by individual agreement or declaration expand the categories of information that must be provided.

==Creation and state parties==
The Convention was concluded in [[London]] on 7 June 1968 and entered into force 17 December 1969. As of 2014, 42 of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe have ratified the Convention; it has also been ratified by [[Belarus]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Mexico]], and [[Morocco]]. The five Council of Europe states that have not ratified the Convention are [[Andorra]], [[Armenia]], [[Ireland]], [[Monaco]], and [[San Marino]].

==Additional Protocol==
On 15 March 1978 the '''Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Information on Foreign Law''' was concluded in [[Strasbourg]]. The Additional Protocol expands the categories of information that must be provided to encompass "substantive and procedural law and judicial organisation in the criminal field, including prosecuting authorities, as well as on the law concerning the enforcement of penal measures".

The Additional Protocol entered into force on 31 August 1979. As of 2013, it has been ratified by 38 Council of Europe states plus [[Belarus]], [[Mexico]], and [[Morocco]].

'''Flammability diagrams''' show the control of flammability in mixtures of fuel, [[oxygen]] and an inert gas, typically [[nitrogen]].  Mixtures of the three gasses are usually depicted in a triangular diagram, known as a [[ternary plot]].  Such diagrams are available in the speciality literature.&lt;ref&gt;for instance in [[Michael George Zabetakis]]' 1965 work, which remains one of the most widely cited sources of flammability data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mashuga 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowl 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The same information can be depicted in a normal orthogonal diagram, showing only two substances, implicitly using the feature that the sum of all three components is 100 percent.  The diagrams below only concerns one fuel; the diagrams can be generalized to mixtures of fuels.

==Understanding flammability diagrams==
Triangular diagrams are not commonplace.  The easiest way to understand them is to briefly go through three basic steps in their construction.  
#Consider the first triangular diagram below, which shows all possible mixtures of methane, oxygen and nitrogen.  [[Air]] is a mixture of about 21 volume percent oxygen, and 79 volume percent inerts (nitrogen). Any mixture of methane and air will therefore lie on the straight line between pure methane and pure air - this is shown as the blue air-line.  The upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in air are located on this line, as shown.
#The [[stoichiometric]] combustion of methane is: CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The stoichiometric concentration of methane in oxygen is therefore 1/(1+2), which is 33 percent.  Any stoichiometric mixture of methane and oxygen will lie on the straight line between pure nitrogen (and zero percent methane) and 33 percent methane (and 67 percent oxygen) - this is shown as the red stoichiometric line.  The upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in oxygen are located on the methane axis, as shown.
#The actual envelope defining the flammability zone can only be determined based on experiments.  The envelope will pass through the upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in oxygen and in air, as shown.  The nose of the envelope defines the [[limiting oxygen concentration]] (LOC)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29616">{{Religious freedom |expanded=all}} 
Freedom of religion in [[Australia]] is allowed in practice and protected to varying degrees through the constitution and legislation at the [[Government of Australia|Federal]], [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Completed_Inquiries/jfadt/Religion/issues|title=Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Freedom of Religion and Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/submissions/religious-freedom-review-2018|title=Religious Freedom Review (2018)|last=ahrc.admin|first=|date=2018-02-14|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is a [[Secular state|secular country]] with legislated [[separation of church and state]] and with no [[state religion]]. The nation has over 13.5 million people who identify as religious and 7.1 million who identify as [[Irreligion in Australia|irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1266.02016?OpenDocument#Data|title=2016 Census - Cultural Diversity|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|first=|date=|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant legislation protecting religious freedoms include sections of the [[Constitution of Australia]], Federal anti-[[discrimination]] laws and State/Territory-based human rights acts and anti-discrimination laws. As these freedoms are not protected in a single piece of legislation, but rather appear as sections, clauses and exemptions in other acts or laws, legal religious freedom protections are often a source of great debate and difficult to discern in Australia.

== Religious freedom laws ==

=== Federal level ===
The [[Constitution of Australia]] prohibits the Commonwealth from establishing laws which create, force or prohibit any religion. It also restricts the Commonwealth from using religion as a qualifier or test in order to hold public office. [[Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 116]] of ''Chapter V. The States'' in the [[Australian Constitution]] reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/chapter5|title=Chapter V. The States.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The section is based on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The article does not prohibit the [[States and territories of Australia|States of Australia]] from implementing such laws, meaning legislation at the state level could provide for restriction or enforcement of religion.

=== State and Territory level ===
Two [[referendum]]s were held on whether to restrict the ability of states to legislate laws that may impede religious freedoms: the [[Australian Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights referendum, 1944]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988]]. Both failed to achieve a majority of support amongst the states and therefore did not pass into law. In theory, Australian State and Territory Governments can therefore pass laws impeding religious freedoms.

Some states and territories have implemented a bill or charter of rights which include freedom and protection for religion, such as ''Section 14: Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief'' in:

* ''[[Human Rights Act 2004]]'' ([[Australian Capital Territory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/act/consol_act/hra2004148/|title=HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 2004|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities|''Charter of Human Rights &amp; Responsibilities Act 2006'']] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cohrara2006433/|title=CHARTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT 2006|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These legislated acts are based on the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], to which Australia was a signatory in 1966 despite no direct legislation to permit these freedoms. These acts do not prevent the passing of laws that impede any rights mentioned (including religious freedoms), but they do create a process by which all legislation must be scrutinised for human rights implications, and must be accompanied by a statement of compatibility with human rights before they can be passed by the relevant Parliament. In cases where the legislation is not compatible, it may still be passed despite contradicting these human rights acts.

== Anti-discrimination laws ==
Anti-discrimination laws addressing unfair treatment on the basis of a range of attributes, including religion, also apply at the state and federal level. These laws contribute to religious freedoms by allowing Australians to practice religion without fear of consequence from the executive, organisations or individuals. This is achieved by prohibiting detrimental treatment as a result of an individual's religious appearance, beliefs or observances. Some argue these laws are inconsistent at the state level and may be limited at the federal level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Federal level ===
The ''[[Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986]]'' defines discrimination as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''(a)  any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, '''religion''', political opinion, national extraction or social origin that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation;''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00143|title=Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986|last=AG|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== State and Territory level ===
State and Territory legislation prohibits unfavourable treatment on the basis of an individual's personal characteristics, but to varying degrees and with varying detail.

Personal characteristics includes religious beliefs or activities in anti-discrimination legislation for the majority of states, and as such these laws may be seen to support religious freedom by prohibiting unfair treatment using religion as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/religious-freedom-should-be-protected-for-all-australians-20180519-p4zgc7.html|title=Religious freedom should be protected for all Australians|website=Canberra Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, anti-discrimination acts States where religious beliefs and activities are protected include:

*''Equal Opportunity Act 1984'' ([[Western Australia]])
*''Discrimination Act 1991'' (Australian Capital Territory)
*''[[Anti-Discrimination Act 1991]]'' ([[Queensland]])
*''Anti-Discrimination Act 1996'' ([[Northern Territory]])
*''Anti-Discrimination Act 1998'' ([[Tasmania]])
*''[[Equal Opportunity Act 2010]]'' (Victoria)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/quick-guide-australian-discrimination-laws|title=A quick guide to Australian discrimination laws|last=Kwan|first=Connie|date=2015-02-11|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other state acts apply narrower protection to '[[Religious clothing|religious appearance or dress]]' (''Equal Opportunity Act 1984'', [[South Australia]]) and '[[Ethnoreligious group|Ethno-religious]] or [[Nationality|national origin]]' (''[[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]]'', [[New South Wales]]). It has been suggested that both states update their laws in order to align to the rest of the States and Territories.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vac.org.au/site/assets/uploaded/9dcc87b5-vac_religious_freedom_review_final.pdf|title=Submission to the Religious Freedom Review|last=Victorian Aids Council|first=|date=|website=vac.org.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious exemptions ===
General religious exception or exemption clauses exist within the various federal and state human rights acts with the aim to ensuring religious activities or observances are not impacted or inhibited by the protections provided by each act. These exemptions therefore protect freedom of religion by permitting what would otherwise be considered discrimination if it is in the context of "an act or practice of a body established for religious purposes that conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of that religion or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious sensitivities of adherents of that religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/FOI/Documents/Commonwealth%20Anti-Discrimination%20Legislation.pdf|title=List of Exemptions in Commonwealth Anti-Discrimination Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=Attorney General of Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the ''Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986'', for example, an exemption is provided:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Discrimination ... does not include any distinction, exclusion or preference:''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; ''(d)  in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed, being a distinction, exclusion or preference made in good faith '''in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed.'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Varying groups have argued that existing religious exceptions and exemptions go too far and impede the rights of individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/yes-victors-seek-abolition-of-all-church-exemptions-to-anti-discrimination-laws-20180214-p4z0aj.html|title='Yes' victors seek abolition of all church exemptions to anti-discrimination laws|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=2018-02-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others argue the correct balance has been struck,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/07/labor-has-no-plans-to-change-law-allowing-religious-schools-to-fire-gay-teachers|title=Labor has 'no plans' to change law allowing religious schools to fire gay teachers|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-01-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet others petition for wider-reaching religious exemption clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acl.org.au/acl-contributes-to-the-australian-human-rights-commissions-religious-freedom-roundtable|title=ACL contributes to the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Religious Freedom Roundtable|work=Australian Christian Lobby|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgements and interpretations ==
{{See also|Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia}}
[[File:Court 2 at the High Court of Australia.jpg|thumb|Court 2 of the High Court of Australia, [[Canberra]]. The High Court has issued few judgements in direct relation to freedom of religion]]
There have been few tests involving religious freedom put before the [[High Court of Australia]]. Judgements from the Court are generally considered to interpret the primary piece of legislation relating to religious freedom, Section 116, narrowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Treading on Sacred Grounds: Places of Worship, Local Planning and Religious Freedom in Australia|last=Villaroman|first=Noel|publisher=Brill Nijhoff|year=2015|isbn=978-90-04-28933-8|edition=12|location=Boston|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) ===
In the 1983 judgment of the High Court in ''Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)'', the court was primarily concerned with whether [[Scientology]] was a religion (and therefore deserved [[tax exemption]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t status). In judgement, the Court found that [[Scientology]] was a religion and argued that the definition of religion must be flexible, but also remain sceptical of false claims. Justices [[Ronald Wilson]] and [[William Deane]] set out five "[[wikt:indicia|indicia]]" of a religion:&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) That the collection of ideas and practices involved a belief in the supernatural (being something that could not be perceived by the senses); (ii) That 'the ideas relate to man's nature and place in the universe and his relation to things supernatural' ; (iii) That the adherents accept certain ideas as requiring them or encouraging them to observe particular codes of conduct or specific practices having some supernatural significance; (iv) The adherents themselves form an identifiable group or groups; (v) The adherents themselves see the collection of ideas, beliefs and practices as constituting a religion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jade.io/article/67076|title=CHURCH OF THE NEW FAITH v. COMMISSIONER OF PAY-ROLL TAX (VICT.) 1983, 154 CLR 120|last=HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA|first=|date=27 October 1983|website=Jade|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this judgement Section 116 was interpreted more broadly than in previous cases. The justices argued that Section 116 provides fundamental guarantees to freedom of religion:&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of the law towards complete religious liberty and religious equality... would be subverted and the guarantees in s. 116 of the Constitution would lose their character as a bastion of freedom if religion were so defined as to exclude from its ambit minority religions out of the main streams of religious thought.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1941 the Commonwealth Government declared [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] to be a risk to national security, indicating they were believed to be "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth" and the "efficient prosecution of the [[World War II|war]]" due to their following ideals of another Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/legislating-religious-freedom-will-be-a-minefield-for-morrison-20181002-p50798.html|title=Legislating religious freedom will be a minefield for Morrison|last=Hull|first=Crispin|date=2018-10-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police occupied premises of the religious group, prompting a lawsuit heard by the High Court in which Jehovah's Witnesses argued their rights granted under Section 116 of the Constitution were infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lawandreligionaustralia.blog/tag/jehovahs-witness-case/|title=Jehovah’s Witness case – Law and Religion Australia|website=lawandreligionaustralia.blog|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held that the ''National Security (Subversive Organisations) Regulations'' 1940, under which the Government had taken action, did not infringe against Section 116, but that the government had exceeded their "defence power" in [[Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution|section 51(vi)]] of the Constitution. Jehovah's Witnesses have since continued to practice in Australia unabated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLeish|first=Stephen|date=1992|title=MAKING SENSE OF RELIGION AND THE CONSTITUTION: A FRESH START FOR SECTION 116|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/1992/10.pdf|journal=Monash University Law Review|volume=|pages=207-236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and status quo ==

The absence of a Federal [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] (or Human Rights Act) which provide a guarantee of religious and other freedoms in almost all other western democracies, has been noted as a primary failure to solidify the current ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' rights to freedom of religion in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/comment-australia-needs-a-bill-of-rights|title=Comment: Australia needs a Bill of Rights|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] has criticised the lack of protections for religious freedom alongside other ''de facto'' freedoms and has recommended the introduction of a Bill of Rights to formally protect the rights of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/freedom-thought-conscience-and-religion-or-belief|title=Freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief|last=David.Mason|date=2013-05-01|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have highlighted that religion and religious freedoms are already well-protected, including with exemptions to anti-discrimination legislation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Frequently highlighted examples include [[religious school]]s having rights not extended to other institutions, including the ability to fire teachers who do not align with the institution's religious beliefs for any reason. This occurred in the case of the Perth South Coast Baptist College and teacher Craig Campbell who was sacked for coming out as homosexual in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/mocked-in-class-this-teacher-revealed-he-was-gay-he-lost-his-job/news-story/c1209c28127019613da5cc7ddfe4d700|title=Perth teacher loses his job after telling school he is gay|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ruddock Review ==
[[File:Philip Ruddock.jpg|left|thumb|Philip Ruddock, chair of the Religious Freedom Review]]

=== Report commission ===
Following the passage of [[same-sex marriage]] [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|legislation in Australia]] in 2017, a federal review was commissioned by the [[Second Turnbull Ministry|Turnbull Government]] to examine the suitability of current religious freedom protections, specifically within the context of the new [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmc.gov.au/domestic-policy/religious-freedom-review|title=Religious Freedom Review|last=Cabinet|first=Prime Minister and|date=2017-12-12|website=www.pmc.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Religious Freedom Review was chaired by [[Philip Ruddock]], the former [[Attorney-General for Australia]] at the time same-sex marriage was [[Marriage Amendment Act 2004|banned]] by the [[Third Howard Ministry|Howard Government]] in 2004, and had no associated terms of reference.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/ruddock-review-next-big-battle-for-gay-community-lgbtiq-council-chair-says-20171208-h01e6t.html|title=Ruddock review next big battle for gay community, LGBTIQ council chair says|last=Burgess|first=Katie|website=Canberra Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review panel was composed of Ruddock alongside [[Jesuit]] priest [[Frank Brennan (priest)|Frank Brennan]], former judge [[Annabelle Bennett]], Human Rights Commission president [[Ros Croucher]] and constitutional lawyer Nicholas Aroney. The expert review panel first met on 10 January 2018, and on 18 May the final review was handed to the Turnbull Government. The Government has declined to release the review in full pending cabinet discussion on its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://junkee.com/ruddock-religious-freedom-review/159126|title=The Government Has Received The "Religious Freedom" Report, But We Can't See It|date=2018-05-18|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruddock review has been interpreted as a way to allow the speedy passage of Dean Smith's marriage bill and to postpone discussions of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koziol|first1=Michael|title=Philip Ruddock review into religious freedom fails to deter conservative MPs from attack on marriage bill|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/philip-ruddock-review-into-religious-freedom-fails-to-deter-conservative-mps-from-attack-on-marriage-bill-20171122-gzqbt2.html|accessdate=11 March 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the Ruddock Review argue it is necessary to ensure that religious freedoms are upheld in the wake of religious objection to same-sex marriage, whilst opponents highlight that further protections for religion are not necessary and will occur at the expense of an individual's right to be free from discrimination (particularly in the case of same-sex marriages).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/don-t-change-discrimination-laws-architect-tells-religious-freedom-review-20180330-p4z74c.html|title=Don't change discrimination laws, architect tells religious freedom review|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=2018-03-30|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as the [[Victorian Aids Council]] and Australian Human Rights Commission have argued that a comprehensive Bill of Rights -rather than an exclusive religious freedoms law- should be implemented as this would also give full effect to Australia's obligations and commitments under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] by enshrining all fundamental rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Government response ===
Turnbull's government indicated it would not release the report received in May 2018 until it had been considered in full by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://junkee.com/ruddock-religious-freedom-review/159126|title=The Government Has Received The "Religious Freedom" Report, But We Can't See It|date=2018-05-18|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the deposition of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, his replacement [[Scott Morrison]] indicated his government would not release the report or form a full response to it before the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/morrison-eyes-law-to-protect-religion-as-greens-call-for-exemption-rollback|title=Morrison eyes law to protect religion as Greens call for exemption rollback|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew criticism from [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] and [[Kerryn Phelps]] given the timing of the [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|Wentworth by-election]], as voters would not have an understanding of any changes to religious law potentially instituted by Australia's first [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/04/michael-kirby-attacks-coalition-for-failure-to-release-ruddock-religious-freedom-report|title=Michael Kirby attacks Coalition for failure to release Ruddock religious freedom report|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/26/kerryn-phelps-urges-pm-to-release-ruddock-religious-freedom-review-before-byelection|title=Kerryn Phelps urges PM to release Ruddock religious freedom review before byelection|last=Murphy|first=Katharine|date=2018-09-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite a senate motion ordering its release ahead of the by-election, the government refused to comply, claiming that a release would "harm the public interest" and interfere in cabinet consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/release-religious-freedom-report-senators|title=Release religious freedom report: senators|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.outinperth.com/morrison-government-refuses-release-religious-freedom-report/|title=Morrison government refuses to release religious freedom report {{!}} OUTInPerth – LGBTIQ News and Culture|website=www.outinperth.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]] suggested in an [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]] interview that the Ruddock review had recommended that people of different religions have the same protections as other attributes such as gender and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/morrison-eyes-law-to-protect-religion-as-greens-call-for-exemption-rollback|title=Morrison eyes law to protect religion as Greens call for exemption rollback|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaks and media coverage ===
On 9 October 2018, extracts of the review were leaked to [[Fairfax Media]], which reported that schools affiliated with a religion "would be guaranteed the right to turn away gay students and teachers under changes to federal anti-discrimination laws" recommended by the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Topsfield |first1=Jewel |title=Religious freedom review enshrines right of schools to turn away gay children and teachers |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/religious-freedom-review-enshrines-right-of-schools-to-turn-away-gay-children-and-teachers-20181009-p508o7.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister initially defended this, but stated that the media coverage of the leaked report was "confused".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/gay-students-could-be-rejected-by-religious-schools-under-new-laws-report-claims|title=Gay students could be rejected by religious schools under new laws, report claims|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|date=9 October 2018|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious schools have held the right to discriminate against teachers and students on the basis of their gender or sexual orientation since 2013, however the Ruddock report recommended that schools additionally be required to hold a publicly-available policy and put the best interests of the child first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/ruddock-report-constrains-not-expands-federal-religious-exemptions-96347|title=Ruddock report constrains, not expands, federal religious exemptions|last1=Elphick|first1=Liam|last2=Maguire|first2=Amy|date=11 October 2018|website=The Conversation|language=en|accessdate=12 October 2018|last3=Hilkemeijer|first3=Anja}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following further media coverage and public pressure, the Labor opposition announced their support would be lent to the government should it seek to repeal the discrimination law exemptions already in existence which allow religious schools to ban students based on their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/12/labor-offers-support-if-morrison-acts-to-stop-schools-from-expelling-gay-students|title=Labor offers support if Morrison acts to stop schools from expelling gay students|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Morrison Government]] subsequently agreed to introduce a bill to parliament with that aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/13/morrison-caves-to-labor-on-gay-students-in-discrimination-law-reform-push|title=Scott Morrison will change the law to ban religious schools expelling gay students|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/bipartisan-backflip-on-queer-bigotry-20181013-p509hr.html|title=Bipartisan backflip on queer bigotry|date=2018-10-13|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Greens]] and Labor opposition have further committed to revoking discrimination exemptions that also allow discrimination against teachers based on their sexual orientation, however the government has so far not indicated its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/protect-gay-teachers-now-labor|title=Protect gay teachers now: Labor|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full recommendations of the review were subsequently leaked to Fairfax and reported on 12 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/read-the-full-20-recommendations-from-the-religious-freedom-review-20181011-p50918.html|title=Read the full 20 recommendations from the religious freedom review|date=2018-10-11|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, it became common for women to head that ministry.&lt;ref name="Badran"/&gt; An avowed advocate of [[Nasserism]],&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"&gt;[[#Gol00|Goldschmidt 2000]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p3J6IS8t74QC&amp;pg=PA14 p. 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Zayd has had a major impact on Egyptian law and policy in the areas of [[Social work|social affairs]] and [[Social insurance|insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&amp;pg=PA69 p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in the village of Shaykh Daud, located near the city of [[Cusae|al-Qusiyya]] in [[Asyut Governorate]], Abu Zayd grew up in a [[Egyptian nationalism|nationalist]] household. Her father's job at the [[Egyptian National Railways|Egyptian State Railways]] meant that he was assigned to many stations and was constantly on the move. Although her mother was illiterate, Abu Zayd was encouraged to read and was given access to her father's large library.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt;

Abu Zayd received an advanced education. After completing her [[secondary education]] at the Helwan Girls School, she obtained a [[Licentiate (degree)|licence]] in history from [[Cairo University]] (then named Fuad I University) in 1940. She progressed further in her academic studies by receiving a teaching certificate in 1941, a [[Master of Arts]] in education in 1950 from the [[University of St Andrews]], and finally a [[doctorate]] in [[educational psychology]] from the [[University of London]] in 1957. She taught in the Women's College of [[Ain Shams University]] from 1955 to 1964, before being promoted to the rank of [[Professor#Egypt|professor]] at Cairo University in 1965.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt;

==Tenure as minister==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HikmatAbu Zayd.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Minister Hekmat Abu Zaid after being appointed as a minister of social affairs in 1962]] --&gt;
In 1962, Abu Zayd sat on the preparatory committee for the [[National Congress of Popular Forces]]. During her membership of the committee, she expressed her disagreement with [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] over some sections in the [[Charter of National Action]].

Abu Zayd was part of a new female leadership that shared the same [[lower middle class]] background of Nasser and his fellow [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]].&lt;ref name="Talhami"&gt;[[#Tal96|Talhami 1996]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1vjXmi5emY4C&amp;pg=PA19 pp. 19–20]&lt;/ref&gt; Her appointment by Nasser was made in the context of his new socialist program, which put emphasis on broadening access to education and employment for all people, regardless of gender or social class.&lt;ref name="Badran"&gt;[[#Bad96|Badran 1996]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vrw8WGOmscAC&amp;pg=PA188 p. 188]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s and especially the 1960s were a time of increased female emancipation in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polygyny]] was on the decline, and women were increasingly holding key posts in government, industry and academia.&lt;ref name="Gazette 1963"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Egypt's Women Most Emancipated in Region |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DJMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CZ4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7248,4152464|agency=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|date=21 October 1963|page=10|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's first two female parliamentarians, [[Rawya Ateya]] and [[Amina Shukri]], were elected in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&amp;pg=PA39 p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karimah al-Sa'id]] became the deputy minister of education in the 1960s. Such high-level appointments of a few well-qualified women were showcased by the government, while the majority of Egyptian women remained stuck in the lower echelons of society.&lt;ref name="Badran"/&gt;

Nasser's appointment of Abu Zayd was a politically significant move. Including a woman in the cabinet was a way for him to co-opt female-run charitable organizations into the [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] (ASU), the country's newly formed [[One-party state|sole political party]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rus04|Russell 2004]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=NDEOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=co-opt p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations were headed by women from prominent families and were protective of their independence, which Nasser found objectionable. His regime targeted women's organizations in the early 1960s and moved to take over most of their functions as state responsibilities, thereby depriving the associations of their momentum and autonomy. Abu Zayd implemented these policies, which were aimed at benefiting female workers and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Social Affairs which she headed was increasingly specializing in women's issues.&lt;ref name="Talhami"/&gt; In 1963, it organized a general and wide-ranging women's conference to discuss, among other things, ways to increase female economic [[productivity]], working women's leading role in spreading [[family planning]], as well as the rise of family income through the employment of female members. Abu Zayd was named to preside over the conference, thereby cementing her status as leader of the [[Feminism in Egypt|women's movement in Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Talhami"/&gt; She became coordinator for women's activities within the Arab Socialist Union in 1963,&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; at a time when the party had nearly 250,000 female members.&lt;ref name="Gazette 1963"/&gt;

During her time in office, Abu Zayd worked on several different social issues. She strongly supported a law that prohibited [[Divorce (Islamic)|Islamic oral repudiation]] and made it mandatory for a husband to go to court to be able to divorce his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Egypt's Divorce Law May Be Changed |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KGQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5YYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3989,4125145|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|newspaper=[[Tri-City Herald]]|date=29 January 1964|page=20|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to combat [[Begging|mendicity]], she imposed prison terms on recidivist beggars who returned to begging after they had received state-sponsored training in handicrafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Prison Eyed for Beggars |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ltxXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5OgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3156,3756081 |agency=[[Reuters]] |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=29 November 1964|page=16 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to registering [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and expanding their development activities, she launched projects aimed at improving the status of rural women.&lt;ref name="Noureddine"/&gt; One of the most sensitive tasks assigned to Abu Zayd was the relocation of thousands of [[Nubian people|Nubians]], displaced by the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], to newly built villages. Her management of the resettlement process led to her being [[nickname]]d the "Merciful Heart of the Revolution" by Nasser.&lt;ref name="Turki"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Nubians' [[Development-induced displacement|forced displacement]] remains controversial in Egypt to this day, with some blaming Nasser for the neglectful conditions in which the relocated Nubians have been living since then.&lt;ref name="Noureddine"/&gt;

On a personal level, Abu Zayd faced domestic problems during her tenure as minister. Her husband was resentful of her responsibility-laden role and of the amount of time she spent outside the house. Their previously modest lifestyle changed considerably as she hired a 12-year-old [[houseboy]] and was provided a [[Take-home vehicle|chauffeur-driven car]] by the government.&lt;ref name="Gazette 1962"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wife's Job Has Spouse Resentful|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMAtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Cp4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6000,3285101 |agency=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|date=16 November 1962|page=9|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile in Libya==
Following Nasser's death in 1970 and [[Anwar Sadat]]'s ascension to the presidency, Abu Zayd's career progression was blocked. She moved to [[Libya]] with her husband in 1974.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; Her Nasserist convictions were in line with the [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]], [[anti-Zionism]] and [[pan-Arabism]] of Libya's leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name="Turki"/&gt; Abu Zayd spent nearly two decades in Libya, during which time she taught [[political science]] at [[Al Fateh University]] in [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="Noureddine"/&gt; She also penned articles and made speeches denouncing the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hekmat Abu Zaid...jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dr. Hekmat Abu Zaid visit the women faculty she founded with her collagues in Ain Shams University in 1963 after being appointed as the minister of social affairs.]] --&gt;
Abu Zayd began criticizing President Sadat in the mid-1970s. She became a leader of the [[Egyptian National Front]], which was set up in [[Damascus]] in 1980 by General [[Saad El Shazly]]. The organization called for the overthrow of Sadat's government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&amp;pg=PA120 p. 120]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her opposition to Sadat's peace overture to [[Israel]], Abu Zayd was accused of [[high treason]], [[terrorism]] and [[spying]], and was consequently deprived of her Egyptian nationality.&lt;ref name="Turki"/&gt; This turned her into a [[Statelessness|stateless]] political [[refugee]].&lt;ref name="Noureddine"/&gt; A long legal battle ensued, which was finally resolved in late 1991 when a judge ruled that Abu Zayd and her husband were entitled to their [[Egyptian passport]]s.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; She was also acquitted of the charges of high treason and terrorism.&lt;ref name="Turki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noureddine"/&gt;

==Later years and death==
After having recovered their nationality, Abu Zayd and her husband came back to Egypt in March 1992.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; She was treated as a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] upon her return, and rushed to visit Nasser's [[mausoleum]].&lt;ref name="Turki"/&gt; During the 1990s, she opposed the [[Gulf War]], the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Peace Conference]], as well as Israeli and [[American imperialism]]. She wrote articles for ''[[al-Osboa]]'' newspaper in 1998 dealing with the issues of Western imperialism and Arab unity.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt"/&gt; In late 2010, she was hospitalized at the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo to receive treatment for her [[bone fracture]]s.&lt;ref name="Noureddine"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noureddine|first=Sarah|date=8 December 2010|title=المصري اليوم حاورتها على فراش المرض حكمت أبوزيد أول وزيرة مصرية: معظم الحركات السياسية الموجودة الآن سطحية.. وتعارض باندفاع غير مسؤول|trans-title=Almasry Alyoum interviewed her on her sickbed – Hikmat Abu Zayd, the first Egyptian female minister: Most current political movements are "superficial" and oppose with an "irresponsible" impulsiveness|journal=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|issue=2369|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011|url=http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=280252|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707115102/http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=280252|archivedate=7 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farkhonda Hassan]] visited her there on behalf of then First Lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=6 December 2010|title=قومي المرأة يطمئن على صحة د. حكمت أبوزيد|trans-title=National Council for Women reassured about Dr. Hikmat Abu Zayd's health condition|journal=[[Al Gomhuria]]|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011|url=http://www.gom.com.eg/index.php?action=news&amp;id=76169|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720131213/http://www.gom.com.eg/index.php?action=news&amp;id=76169|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her stay at the hospital, Abu Zayd granted an interview to ''[[Almasry Alyoum]]'' newspaper in which she defended Nasser's legacy and lamented the loss of tolerance in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Noureddine"/&gt;

==Awards==
Abu Zayd received the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] in December 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shu84|Shukri 1984]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=xF5mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=February+1974 p. 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''income in respect of a decedent (IRD) asset''' is part of [[inheritance]] which consists of [[taxable income]] to which the deceased person was entitled to, but failed to receive before their death. A typical case is the last [[paycheck]], which may be left not received.

Most of [[inheritance|inherited]] [[property]] is not included in an [[heir]]’s taxable income, but IRD assets do.

While the tax basis of most of a decedent's assets are "[[step-up in basis|stepped up]]" for income tax purposes, IRD assets are not eligible for a "step-up" in basis, and hence may lead to [[double taxation]], and an income tax and [[estate tax]].

*[http://www.leismaninsurance.com/2004%20April%20IRD%20article.html "Income in Respect of a Decedent (IRD)"]

 The following are considered IRD Income:

• Uncollected salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, vacation pay, and sick pay.

• Certain deferred compensation and stock option plans.

• Qualified pension plans, profit sharing plans, SEP, Keogh, and IRA except nondeductible contributions.

• Accounts receivable of a cash basis sole proprietor.

• Interest and dividends accrued but unpaid at death of cash basis decedent.

• Rents and royalties accrued before death of cash basis taxpayer.

• Gain from the sale of property if the sale is deemed to occur before death, but proceeds are not collected until after death.

• Difference between the face amount and the decedent’s basis in an installment sales obligation.

• Interest accrued through the date of death on Series EE bonds, unless (1) decedent elected to report interest annually, or (2) the interest was reported on the decedent’s final Form 1040.

• Annuity payments in excess of decedent's investment in the contract

'''Interval Research Corporation''' was founded in 1992 by [[Paul Allen]] and [[David Liddle]]. It was a [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] laboratory and [[technology incubator]] focusing on consumer product applications and services with a focus on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= WTO Board Bio: David Liddle | url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/WTO/people/board/liddle.shtml | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070311150631/http://www.stanford.edu/group/WTO/people/board/liddle.shtml | archivedate= 2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 version of the company's web page described itself as ''"a research setting seeking to define the issues, map out the concepts and create the technology that will be important in the future.... [pursuing] basic innovations in a number of early-stage technologies and [seeking] to foster industries around them – sparking opportunity for entrepreneurs and highlighting a new approach to research."''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19971012120741/http://www.interval.com/about/ Interval Research Corporation – About] – Page (From:13-November-1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] article based on a memo from Paul Allen described the company as under fire from Allen to produce "less R and more D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/interval.html|title=Think Tanked|last=Bass|first=Thomas A.|date=Dec 1999|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interval Research Corporation officially closed its doors in April 2000, while a small group of former employees were kept on to form '''Interval Media''' to continue a few specific projects. Interval Media was closed in June, 2006.

'''Jural rights''' is a doctrine of [[Kentucky]] law that prevents the [[legislature]] (and presumably the [[judiciary]] as well) from eliminating [[common law]] [[causes of action]] that existed at the time the current [[Kentucky Constitution]] was instituted.

==Constitutional basis of the doctrine==
The doctrine of jural rights is based on a concerted reading of the following sections of the Kentucky Constitution:

*14: All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.
*54: The General Assembly shall have no power to limit the amount to be recovered for injuries resulting in death, or for injuries to person or property.
*241: Whenever the death of a person shall result from an injury inflicted by negligence or wrongful act, then, in every such case, damages may be recovered for such death...

==Application of the doctrine==
The doctrine was announced in ''Ludwig v. Johnson'', 49 S.W.2d 347 (Ky 1932). In ''Ludwig'', a statute prohibiting a non-paying passenger from suing the operator for [[negligence]] was found unconstitutional. The doctrine has been upheld several times since then, but remains the subject of criticism that it is a judicial fiction.

The doctrine was reaffirmed in ''Williams v. Wilson'', 972 S.W.2d 260 (Ky 1998), where the court invalidated a statute requiring a finding of intent for punitive damages to be available. The court reasoned that [[punitive damages]] were available for gross negligence in 1891 (when the Constitution took effect), and that the [[Malice (law)|malice]] requirement of the statute in question effectively banned a cause of action based on negligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3557">The parchment codex called '''''Littera Florentina''''' is the closest survivor to an official version of the [[Pandects]], the digest of [[Roman law]] promulgated by [[Justinian I]] in 530&amp;ndash;533. 

The codex, of 907 leaves, is written in the Byzantine-Ravenna [[uncial]]s characteristic of [[Constantinople]], but which has recently been recognized in legal and literary texts produced in Alexandria and the Levant as well. [[Elias Avery Lowe|E.A. Lowe]] refers to this script as "b-r uncial". Close scrutiny dates the manuscript between the official issuance in 533 and the issuance of 557 that included Justinian's recent enactments, the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones]]'', "New Constitutions", making it an all-but contemporary and all-but official source.

Marginal notes suggest that the codex was in [[Amalfi]]&amp;mdash;part of the Byzantine territory in Italy governed by the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] in the 6th century&amp;mdash;and that it passed to [[Pisa]] in the 12th century; thus, during the Middle Ages the codex was known as the ''Littera Pisana'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Hoeflich and Jasonne M. Grabher, "The establishment of normative legal texts: the beginnings of the ''Ius communis''", in Wilfried Hartmann and Kenneth Pennington, eds. ''The history of medieval Canon law in the Classical period, 1140-1234'', 2008:5 and note 21.&lt;/ref&gt; until the codex formed part of the war booty removed from Pisa to Florence after the war of 1406.

The manuscript became one of Florence's most treasured possessions. It was only shown to very important persons. Scholarly access was difficult. It took more than three centuries before a reliable edition of the ''Littera Florentina'' was finally made available. Nowadays two facsimile editions are at the disposal of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''Iustiniani Augusti Digestorum seu Pandectarum Codex Florentinus olim Pisanus phototypice expressus'', I-X, (Rome, 1902-1910).  ''Justiniani Augusti pandectarum codex Florentinus'', Curaverunt A. Corbino &amp; B. Santalucia, (Firenze: Olschki, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the manuscript lies in the fact that is an almost unique witness of the original Justinianian Digest. Most medieval manuscripts of the Digest have a substantially different text. Its sudden reappearance in the late eleventh or early twelfth century has been much debated by legal historians.

In [[philosophy]], '''meta-rights''' are the [[entitlement]]s of individuals to their [[rights]], including the possibility to [[waive]], transfer or sell their rights. When we talk of the rights of individuals, we do not always distinguish between rights which can be waived or sold and rights which are non-negotiable. Yet that distinction and often the distinction is made implicitly. When we say a person has a right to her house, we usually mean that she also has the meta right to sell the right. On the other hand, when we say a person has the right to his body parts, we usually assume this comes without the accompanying meta right to sell these rights. Economic efficiency usually comes with having rights which come together with the meta right to sell the right. It is arguable that we should be much more explicit about when rights come together with meta rights and when without, and the moral basis that accompany these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaushik Basu |title=The right to give up rights |journal=Economica |volume=51 |year=1984|doi=10.2307/2554226 |jstor=2554226 |pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/basic-rights-and-meta-rights#axzz2SSpJJAeL&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Defense Act of 1935''' ('''Commonwealth Act № 1''') was passed by the [[Philippine National Assembly]] on December 21, 1935. The purpose of this act was to create an independent [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine Army]], a move interrupted by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].

==Provisions==
This act provided for the creation, by 1946, via an annual [[Appropriation (Law)|appropriation]] of 16,000,000 [[Philippine peso|pesos]], of the following forces:

*A [[regular army]] force of 10,000 troops (formed largely from the [[Philippine Scouts]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]])
*A [[reserve army]] of 400,000
*The [[Offshore Patrol]], which was to possess 36 [[torpedo boat]]s
*A [[Philippine Army Air Corps]] of 100 [[tactical bomber]]s

==Office of the Military Advisor==
The National Assembly was guided by the [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government (Philippines)|Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government]] under the [[United States|U.S.]] [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]].

==Military Districts==
The act divided the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] into ten [[Military district|military districts]], similar to the prewar [[Corps area|corps areas]] within the [[United States|US]]. Each district had a roughly equal population and each was to initially provide 1 reserve [[Division (military)|division]], and ultimately three.

*[[Luzon]], [[Mindoro]], [[Palawan]], and [[Masbate]] contained 5 military districts
*[[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] constituted 1 district
*The [[Visayas]] contained 4 districts

==Reserve Training==
The Act provided for the [[Conscription in the Philippines|drafting]] of Filipino men, between the ages of 21 and 50, into the 30 reserve divisions. This force was to be raised through 2 training camps, of 20,000 men each, lasting 22 weeks. The camps would be staffed by members of the regular army.

The first group of 20,000 troops was drafted on January 1, 1937, and there were 4,800 [[commissioned officer|officers]] and 104,000 enlisted men in the reserves by 1939.

==Officer Training==
For the training of junior officers, the Act provided that a military academy be established with a [[Cadet Corps]] strength not to exceed 350 at any one time. As graduates could not be expected until they had completed 4 years of training, selected reservists were selected for training as [[noncommissioned officer]]s. The best of these were then given basic office training and commissioned as [[Lieutenant|3rd Lieutenant]]s. Officers were also created through senior-level [[ROTC]] courses in [[college]]s and [[university|universities]].

==Training Locations==
*[[Infantry]] training—various locations
*[[artillery|Field Artillery]] training—Fort Dau and specialized training conducted at [[Fort William McKinley]]
*[[artillery|Coastal Artillery]] training -- [[Fort Mills]], [[Fort Stotsenburg]], and [[Fort Wint]]
*signal and medical training -- [[Fort William McKinley]]
*quartermaster motor transport school—port area of [[Manila]]
*government organizational training—various locations

Established in 1951, it was originally housed in the secretariat of [[Ministry of Education (Pakistan)|Ministry of Education]] (MoEd) and amalgamated with the [[Liaquat National Memorial Library|Liaquat National Library]] (LNL); it was shifting in [[Islamabad]] in 1965 with [[Ministry of Education (Pakistan)|MoEd]]'s secretariat serving its purpose.&lt;ref name="National Library of Pakistan Press, History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=et. al.|title=History of the National Library|url=http://www.nlp.gov.pk/about_nlp.html|publisher=National Library of Pakistan Press, History|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the Library received the right of transference of all [[copyrighted]] works to have two copies deposited of [[book]]s, [[map]]s, [[illustration]]s and [[diagram]]s printed in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="National Library of Pakistan Press, History"/&gt; It gained more significance in 1992 with the promulgation of copyright (amendment) act 1992.&lt;ref name="National Library of Pakistan Press, History"/&gt;  During the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|1971 war]], the library was thinned with the creation of [[Bangladesh]] with key material transferring to [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Dekker"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Supplement 7|title=International Encyclopedia of Information and Library Science |editor-first=John |editor-last=Feather |editor-first2=Paul |editor-last2=Sturges |date=1987|publisher=Dekker|location=New York |isbn=0824720423|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0vL9QQT0sC&amp;pg=PA596}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of slow growth in its reconstruction, the library began to enlarge its size and importance in the country.&lt;ref name="National Library of Pakistan Press, History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dekker"/&gt;  Development culminated in 1980s of an expensive and separated national library building within the vicinity of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan library|Supreme Court's library]].&lt;ref name="google maps services"&gt;{{cite web|title=Address and location of the National Library of Pakistan|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@33.726249,73.10195,17z|publisher=google maps services|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Authorization for a national library can be traced back to 1949, although it did not gain any physical infrastructure until it was merged with the existing Liaquat Memorial Library in Karachi and renamed the Liaquat National Library.  In 1967 the library began receiving copies of works published in Pakistan as part of its mandate as a copyright repository per the 1962 copyright ordinance.  1968 saw the separation of the Liaquat and National libraries, with the latter relocated to Islamabad along with Pakistan's capitol.  The library was housed in a series of rented structures until construction of a permanent building was completed in 1988.  The formal opening took place on 24 August 1993.  Scholar Syed Jalaluddin Haider dates the library's existence later, to April 1999, when the 100,000-volume collection housed by the Department of Libraries was moved into the new building.&lt;ref name=Ahmad2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haider2006/&gt;

[[File:National Service memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|National Service (1939–1960) memorial at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]]]]

The '''National Service Act 1948''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] which extended the [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|British conscription]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]] long after the war-time need for it had expired, in the form of "[[National Service in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]]". After a bill with the same purpose had been approved in 1947, expected to be implemented 1 January 1949, the [[Cold War]] and the [[Malayan Emergency]] caused a revised and extended version of the new legislation to be approved in December 1948, only days before the new arrangements came into force.&lt;ref name=veterans&gt;{{cite web|title=National Service – History|publisher=British Armed Forces and National Service|url=http://www.britisharmedforces.org/ns/nat_history.htm|date=February 14, 2011|access-date=1 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721065147/http://www.britisharmedforces.org/ns/nat_history.htm|archivedate=21 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act had much in common with the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939|National Service Act]] of September 1939, which it superseded, but its aim was to continue National Service even at times when the country was not at war. The National Service Act of September 1939 had not addressed this issue.

The National Service Act 1948 applied to all healthy young men (women did not have to do National Service) who were not registered as [[conscientious objector]]s. It did not affect the exemption from service of registered conscientious objectors, nor the procedure for registration.

==Background==
In 1948, the British post-war government realised the need for an armed forces larger than that which voluntary recruitment could provide. Discussions were soon started in parliament on a new National Service Act with a first such act being approved in July 1947.&lt;ref name=veterans/&gt; This first version was to come into force on 1 January 1949 and established the period of National Service to 12 months. However, financial crises, the advent of the Cold War and the Malayan Emergency caused the act to be amended before coming into force. The amendment was approved in December 1948, with the date in which it would come into force still being 1 January 1949.&lt;ref name=veterans/&gt;

==Differences to the previous act==
The act changed the age range from 18–41 to 17–21, and increased the period of service required from 6 to 18 months. As with previous acts, men who completed the service remained on the reserve list for the number of years in the age-range (four years) which started being counted from the moment they finished serving. However, men on the reserve list could only be called for periods of up to 20 days (previous acts allowed the period to be indefinite), and could not be called more than three times.

The act also changed the trades considered [[reserved occupation|essential services]] to the merchant navy, farming and coal mining (previously, essential services were coal mining, shipbuilding, engineering-related trades and—to a limited extent—medicine). Young men working in the essential services were exempted from National Service for a period of eight years. If they stopped working in these industries before this period of eight years ended (that is, before turning 25), they could be called up for National Service.

==Korean War modifications of the act==
In October 1950, in response to the British involvement in the [[Korean War]], the service period was extended to two years. To compensate the reserve period was reduced by six months.

==Ending in 1963==
National Service ended gradually from 1960. In November 1960 the last men entered service, as call-ups formally ended on 31 December 1960, and the last National Servicemen left the armed forces in May 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1272 |title=What was National Service? |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |access-date=4 April 2013 |work=archive.iwm.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Support for reintroduction==
In 2015 [[Prince Harry]] made a call for bringing back the National Service. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3084790/Harry-happy-warrior-Bring-national-service-says-Prince-reveals-encourage-George-Charlotte-join-Armed-Forces.html/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-harry/11610690/Prince-Harry-calls-to-bring-back-National-Service.html/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/prince-harry-throws-his-support-behind-national-service-and-reveals-he-is-happy-being-single/news-story/e6bd94dcb07f9f11b528330318802481/&lt;/ref&gt; Following the launch of his 2009 film ''[[Harry Brown (film)|Harry Brown]]'',  English actor [[Michael Caine]] called for the reintroduction of [[national service]] in the UK to give young people "a sense of belonging rather than a sense of violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/738277/put-young-people-in-the-army-says-caine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929153937/http://news.sky.com/story/738277/put-young-people-in-the-army-says-caine|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-29|title=Put Young People In The Army, Says Caine|date=2013-09-29|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olive oil regulation and adulteration''' are complex issues overseen and studied by various governmental bodies, non-governmental organizations, and private researchers across the world.

==Background==
The [[International Olive Council]] (IOC) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], with 16 member states plus the [[European Union]]. It promotes [[olive oil]] around the world by tracking production, defining quality standards, and monitoring authenticity. More than 98 percent of the world's olives are grown in IOC member nations.&lt;ref&gt;International Olive Council [http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/web/aa-ingles/corp/institution/aa-institution-ini.html International Olive Council]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] is not a member of the IOC, and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] does not legally recognize its classifications (such as extra-virgin olive oil). On October 25, 2011, the United States adopted new olive oil standards, a revision of those that have been in place since 1948, which affect importers and domestic growers and producers by ensuring conformity with the benchmarks commonly accepted in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-basics/olive-oil-grades/usda-olive-oil-standards-begin/8087 "New U.S. Olive Oil Standards in Effect Today"] ''Olive Oil Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC officially governs 95 per cent of international production and holds great influence over the rest. IOC terminology is precise, but it can lead to confusion between the words that describe production and the words used on retail labels. Olive oil is classified by how it was produced, by its [[chemistry]], and by its flavor. All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste. This paste is then [[malaxation|malaxed]] to allow the microscopic oil droplets to concentrate. The oil is extracted by means of pressure (traditional method) or [[centrifuge|centrifugation]] (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called [[pomace]], still contains a small quantity of oil.

The EU regulates the use of different [[protected designation of origin]] labels for olive oils.

US Customs regulations on "country of origin" state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, John. US Customs Department, Director Commercial Rulings Division [http://rulings.customs.gov/index.asp?ru=561712&amp;qu=%22HQ+561712%22&amp;vw=detail Country of origin marking of imported olive oil; 19 CFR 134.46; "imported by" language] 2000-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States International Trade Commission Rulings [http://www.faqs.org/rulings/rulings2006HQ967925.html See reference to HQ 560944 ruling of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on April 27, 1998, "''blending of Spanish olive oil with Italian olive oil in Italy does not result in a substantial transformation of the Spanish product''"] 2006-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet most major US brands continue to put "imported from Italy" on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print. These products are a mixture of olive oil from more than one nation and it is not clear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin. This practice makes it difficult for high quality, lower cost producers outside of Italy to enter the US market, and for genuine Italian producers to compete.

== Investigations, incidents, and recalls ==
With [[Italy|Italian]] extra-virgin [[olive oil]] in high demand with concomitant high prices, adulterated olive oil has become the biggest source of agricultural fraud problems in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12571726 Olive Oil Fraud Rampant as Demand Skyrockets], ''[[National Public Radio]]'', August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  While less than 10% of world olive oil production meets the criteria for labeling as extra-virgin, it has been estimated that up to 50% of retail oil is labeled "extra-virgin".&lt;ref name=Bogle&gt;Deborah Bogle. [http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/oils-ant-oils/story-e6frea83-1226351980512 Oils ain't oils in the olive grove]. [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] May 12, 2012, pp. 11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Some oil labeled "extra-virgin" is diluted with cheaper olive oils or other vegetable oils. In some cases, [[lampante]], or "lamp oil," which is made from spoiled olives fallen from trees, is used, even though it can't legally be sold as food. One fraud ring is accused of coloring low-grade [[soy oil]] and [[canola oil]] with industrial [[chlorophyll]], and flavoring it with [[beta-carotene]].&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) doesn't routinely test imported olive oil for adulteration, and some products are difficult to test.

An article by Tom Mueller in the August 13, 2007, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' states that major Italian shippers routinely adulterate olive oil and that only about 40% of olive oil sold as "extra virgin" actually meets the specification.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Tom.

In 1993, the FDA ordered a recall of Rubino U.S.A. Inc., (Cincinnati, Ohio) olive oils which were nothing more than [[canola oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ENFORCE/ENF00237.html |title=Recalls on Rubino Olive Oil |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119124739/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ENFORCE/ENF00237.html |archivedate=January 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] began conducting tests on 100 oils that claimed to be 100% olive oil and in 1999 the CFIA concluded that 20 per cent of the oils were fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/food/oliveoil/index.html |title=CFIA Oil Authenticity |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418055344/http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/food/oliveoil/index.html |archivedate=April 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, "Figures released at the [IOC's] Workshop on Olive Oil Authentication, held in Madrid June 10–11, show that one in four olive oils sampled in Spain, and nearly one in three in Canada, failed recent official fraud tests."&lt;ref name=Butler2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Julie|title=Scientists Pool Expertise in Fight Against Fake Olive Oils|url=http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-basics/madrid-meeting-olive-oil-authentication|publisher=Olive Oil Times|accessdate=22 October 2013|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted "Operation Golden Oil", arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a large-scale scheme to relabel oils from other [[Mediterranean]] nations as Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/05/witaly105.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Italian police crack down on olive oil fraud | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | date=2008-03-05 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding [[chlorophyll]] to [[Sunflower oil|sunflower]] and [[soybean oil]] and selling it as extra virgin olive oil, both in Italy and abroad. 25,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Forty-arrested-in-new-39fake39.4005000.jp |title=Forty arrested in new 'fake' olive oil scam - Scotsman.com News |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109171716/http://news.scotsman.com/world/Forty-arrested-in-new-39fake39.4005000.jp |archivedate=January 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2008, the [[Guardia Civil]] in [[La Rioja (Spain)]] warned about the possible sale of adulterated olive oil in the area. This warning came after 550 litres of oil was found in a large container labelled "Astispumante 1510" in [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rincón de Soto]] and after the theft of 1,750 litres of oil was reported in the area on December 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olives101.com/2008/12/22/spain-adulterated-olive-oil-warning-in-la-roija/ |title=Spain: Adulterated olive oil warning in La Roija |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first week of March 2010, researchers at the University of California at Davis' Olive Center purchased three bottles each of 14 imported olive oils and five California oils at retail stores in three different regions of California (Sacramento County, San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles County). All of the oils were labeled "extra-virgin olive oil." Samples were shipped to the Australian Oils Research Laboratory in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and were analyzed by their laboratory (which is recognized by the IOC to provide chemical analysis of olive oil) and tested by their sensory panel (which is recognized by the IOC as qualified to perform olive oil sensory analysis). Duplicate testing was performed at the UC Davis olive oil research project laboratories. Sixty-nine percent of the imported olive oils and 10% of the California oils failed to meet the IOC/USDA taste standards for extra-virgin olive oil. Samples that failed had a median of up to 3.5 IOC-standardized sensory defects (such as rancid, fusty, and musty). The standard IOC/USDA chemical tests only identified 31% of the failed oils as defective, primarily by exceeding the IOC/USDA limit for ultraviolet absorbance of late oxidation products (K232 and K268); two more recently introduced German chemical tests (now incorporated into the Australian extra-virgin standard) were each more than twice as effective at detection of defective oils.&lt;ref name=Frankel2010&gt;{{cite web|author1=Frankel, E.N. |author2=Mailer, R.

The IOC stated that the study contained "[an] evident undercurrent of aggressive, inexplicable criticism of imported olive oil quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Davis Study of Imported Olive Oils Flawed By Across-the-Board Bias|url=http://naooa.org/page-913042/570547|website=North American Olive Oil Association|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2011, the Florence, Italy prosecutor’s office, working in conjunction with the forestry department, indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli, one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS (which recently changed its name to Deoleo) and Pietro Coricelli. The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that "the case is based on an irregularity in the documents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-business/details-expected-thursday-investigations-deodorized-olive-oils/14291 Investigations Into Deodorized Olive Oils] Olive Oil Times. 2011-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2017 the Italian Antitrust Authority (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato), found them guilty of unfair business practices regarding their olive oil brands and imposed fines on them and the discount supermarket chain Lidl, amounting to nearly €1 million. According to independent testing, oil from the brands Carapelli, Bertolli, Sasso, Primadonna and Coricelli labelled as "extra virgin" was in fact only "virgin." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-business/europe/italian-antitrust-authority-fines-lidl-deoleo-coricelli/51896] Olive Oil Times. 2017-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Standards Australia]] has adopted a code of practice for the testing of olive oils; however, while allowing oils to be certified as being genuine extra-virgin, the code regarding labeling is voluntary. The Australian Olive Association (AOA) is campaigning to have the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] force supermarkets to adhere to the code.  After testing by AOA in 2012, every imported brand of extra-virgin olive oil fell below the standard that would be required for AOA certification.&lt;ref name=Bogle /&gt;

Adulterated oil is usually no more serious than passing off inferior, but safe, product as superior olive oil, but there are no guarantees. Almost 700 people died, it is believed, as a consequence of consuming [[rapeseed oil|rapeseed]] (canola) oil adulterated with [[aniline]] intended for use as an industrial lubricant, but sold in 1981 as olive oil in Spain (see [[toxic oil syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DC1630F932A15756C0A96F948260|title=Trial in Spain on Toxic Cooking Oil Ends in Uproar|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1989-05-21|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=H.

== Testing for purity ==
[[File:Valentina Domenici 2015.jpg|thumb|left|200px|UV-Vis spectrscopy analysis of olive oil samples in an Italian laboratory]]
The detection of olive oil adulteration is often complicated with no single test that can accomplish the task. A battery of tests is employed to determine Olive oil authenticity and identity of the adulterant. Included in this testing regime is the determination of [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], [[peroxide value]], UV extinction, fatty acid composition, sterol composition, triglyceride composition, wax content, steroidal hydrocarbons, and the [[Bellier test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.2740610409/abstract|title=Olive Oil Composition Evaluation|accessdate=2 September 2012 | doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740610409|volume=61|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|pages=435–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods employing chromatography/mass spectrometry and spectroscopy are often used to detect adulteration of olive oil &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gromadzka, J. |author2=Wardencki, W. |title= Trends in edible vegetable oils analysis.

Test results are measured against the International Olive Council trade standard to identify abnormalities. Each test provides key information which allows a decision to be made with respect to the grade of Olive oil and the identity of any adulterants. However, the International Olive Council does not test for deodorisation which makes up the bulk of fake extra-virgin oils. Soft column deodorisation is the process where steam is forced through a tank of inferior oil which removes all taste, colour and nutrients, colouring is then added before the tank is topped up with real extra-virgin oil to add flavour.&lt;ref name=Bogle/&gt;

A test published in 1887 described the detection of olive oil adulterated with [[mineral oil]] by a simple [[titration]] of the [[carboxylic acid]] moieties present in natural vegetable oils.  The procedure involved boiling 10 [[milliliters]] of olive oil with 40 milliliters of approximately 1 [[molar concentration|molar]] [[potassium hydroxide]] in 95% [[ethanol]], adding water to 100&amp;nbsp;grams to dissolve the [[saponified]] lipids, and titrating against a normal [[sulfuric acid]] solution using [[phenolphthalein]] as a [[pH indicator dye]].  The base stock solution was titrated to neutralize an equal quantity of the acid, so without the presence of vegetable oil it would require 40 milliliters of acid to cause a color change, but in the pure oils tested ([[almond]], [[benne]], [[cottonseed]], [[cod liver oil]], [[linseed oil]], and olive oil, only 6 milliliters were required.  In accordance with this, olive oil adulterated with 10% mineral oil required 8 milliliters, and with 20% 11 milliliters.  The adulterated oil tested in 1887 required 14 to 17 milliliters to neutralize, so it might have been 30-40% mineral oil.&lt;ref&gt;Pharm. Zeitsch. f. Russl., 1887, 65 ''translated in'' {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4m0CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq="olive+oil"+"adulterated+with+mineral+oil"|title=Proceedings of the American Pharmaceutical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olive oil DNA analysis methods, based on the use of PCR (e.g. DNA fingerprinting), have been use for determining counterfeit. These techniques requires extensive sample preparation, which needs specific optimization to ensure extraction of sufficient DNA, and that PCR inhibitors are not affecting the analysis. To date, there is no DNA extraction method applicable to any sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Woolfe, M. |author2=Primrose, S. |title= Food Forensics: Using DNA Technology To Combat Misdescription and Fraud|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779904000848|year=2004|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.010|volume=22|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|pages=222–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method against olive oil adulteration, making use of articial, sub-micrometer-sized DNA barcodes, has recently been developed. The barcodes consist of magnetically recoverable silica particles containing synthetic DNA sequences, which are added to the oil in very small amount (down to 1 ppb) and can be retrieved at any time for authenticity test by PCR/sequencing. The advantages of this method, compared to conventional techniques, are that it is low-cost, sample preparation is minimal and requires minute volumes, and the method is universal, since it can be applied to any oil type/sample without specific procedure optimization.&lt;ref name=Puddu&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn4063853|title=Magnetically Recoverable, Thermostable, Hydrophobic DNA/Silica Encapsulates and Their Application as Invisible Oil Tags|author1=Puddu, M. |author2=Paunescu, D. |author3=Stark, W.

=== Certifications of Quality ===

The North American Olive Oil Association offers a Quality Seal Program to guarantee authenticity of olive oil. Members of the association agree to have their oils tested twice a year to ensure the oil meets or exceeds the International Olive Council (IOC) standards. The testing includes both sensory (taste/smell) and chemical tests for purity. Samples are purchased from the retail marketplace to ensure that the products tested are the same as the ones purchased by consumers.  The test samples are not selected and submitted by olive oil producers.  Brands pay for the testing through a yearly licensing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAOOA Certified Quality Seal Program|url=http://www.aboutoliveoil.org/qualityseal.html|website=About Olive Oil|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Olive Oil Council tests samples of olive oil submitted by producers for extra virgin quality. The samples are provided by the producers. The testing is primarily sensory with some chemical tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olive Oil Quality Seals? Take Your Pick|url=http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-basics/olive-oil-quality-seals/34742|website=Olive Oil Times|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Extra Virgin Alliance offers the EVA Mark of Quality and Authenticity. Auditors purchase oils from retail sources and test the oils against standards set by the EVA. The testing consists of sensory analysis and focuses on detection of defects.

=== Simple home tests ===

==== Refrigeration ====
There is a persistent mistaken belief that when genuine [[olive oil]] (or, in some versions, [[Olive oil#Retail grades in IOC member nations|extra virgin]] olive oil specifically) is refrigerated, it will solidify or become much more [[viscous]]. This mistaken belief is based on the fact that olive oil is composed mainly of the [[monounsaturated fat]] [[oleic acid]], and pure oleic acid ([[triolein]]) has a melting point of 5˚C, which is slightly above the high end of proper refrigerator temperature. Thus, if olive oil were pure triolein, it would solidify in a properly set refrigerator. However, olive oil is a complex mixture with significant variability in its fatty acid structure, and can be anywhere from 55% to 83% [[oleic acid]],&lt;ref name=oos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oliveoilsource.com/page/chemical-characteristics |title=Olive Oil : Chemical Characteristics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beltran2004&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hera.ugr.es/doi/15058025.pdf |title=Influence of Harvest Date and Crop Yield on the Fatty Acid Composition of Virgin Olive Oils from Cv. Picual |author=Beltran|year=2004 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder a mixture of [[polyunsaturated fat]] and [[saturated fat]], as well as containing [[waxes]], [[phytosterols]], and other compounds that affect its melting temperature. Thus, in practice, many olive oils have significantly lower melting temperatures.&lt;ref name=Gawel2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Gawel|first=Richard|title=The 'Home Fridge Test' for Authenticity of Extra Virgin Olive Oil – The Reasons why it doesn’t work|url=http://www.aromadictionary.com/EVOO_blog/?p=550|work=Slick Extra Virgin|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NAOOA2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth – the Extra Virgin Olive Oil Fridge Test|url=http://www.aboutoliveoil.org/FridgeTestMyth.pdf|work=All About Olive Oil|publisher=North American Olive Oil Association|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OOtimes2013a&gt;{{cite web|last=Flagg|first=Nancy|title=Olive Oil Fridge Test?

This was demonstrated by a test by scientists at the Olive Center at the [[University of California, Davis]]. Researchers put seven samples of different oils into a refrigerator at 4.7˚C, including a premium extra-virgin olive oil; low-quality extra-virgin olive oil; a blend of virgin and refined olive oil; refined canola oil; refined safflower oil; a 50-50 blend of premium extra virgin olive oil with refined canola oil; and a 50-50 blend of premium extra virgin olive oil with refined safflower oil. When tested at intervals up to 180 hours, not one of the oils fully solidified, and one of the oils that solidified the most was the olive oil-canola oil mixture. Thus, the "Fridge Test" is not reliable for determining oil purity or quality.&lt;ref name=Li2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=Xueqi|title=Refrigeration is not reliable in detecting olive oil adulteration|url=http://static.oliveoiltimes.com/library/ucd-fridge-test.pdf|publisher=UC Davis Olive Center|accessdate=8 August 2013|author2=Selina Wang, Dan Flynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ignition ====
Pure olive oil should burn in an [[oil lamp]]. The ignition test however, like the refrigerator test, is not conclusive.

'''''Per minas''''', in [[Great Britain|British]] [[common law]], to engage in behavior "by means of menaces or threats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clickdocs.co.uk/glossary/per-minas.htm Clickdocs web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Etymology|comes from]] [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanjeev.net/latin/latin-phrases-starting-with-p-07.html List of Latin legal phrases].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Manent''' ({{IPA-fr|manɑ̃|lang}}; born 6 May 1949, [[Toulouse]]) is a French political scientist and academic. He teaches political philosophy at the [[Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales]], in the [[Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron]]. Every autumn{{when|When did this begin? Does it still?|date=July 2017}}, he is also a visiting teacher in [[Boston College]] at the Department of Political Science.

After graduating from the [[École Normale Supérieure]], he became assistant to [[Raymond Aron]] at the [[Collège de France]]. He was one of the founders of the quarterly ''Commentaire'' and remains a regular contributor.

Manent is a key figure of the contemporary French political philosophy and his work has helped the rediscovery of the [[French Liberal School|French liberal]] tradition.

The '''Polish Resettlement Act 1947''' was the first ever mass immigration legislation of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It offered British citizenship to over 200,000{{cn|date=November 2016}} displaced Polish troops on British soil who had fought against [[Nazi Germany]] and opposed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] takeover of their homeland. The act also supplied a labour force to the demands of war-torn Britain.

==Background==

The [[Polish contribution to World War II]] was outstanding, and directly led to the Polish Resettlement Act 1947 and the formation of the [[Polish British]] community as it exists today.

In advance of the war, the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish Cypher Bureau]] broke the early version of the [[Enigma machine]] and gave their knowledge to the British, forming the basis for British cryptographic breakthroughs that produced the [[Ultra]] intelligence that was a key factor in many Allied successes during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm | work=BBC News | title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret | date=20 July 2009 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Poles came to the United Kingdom to help the [[Allies of World War II|Allied war effort]] after the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] led to the [[occupation of Poland]] in 1939. By 1940, with the fall of France, the Polish President, Prime Minister and the [[Polish government in exile]] transferred to London, along with a first wave of at least 20,000 soldiers and airmen. Thousands more followed throughout the war.

Poles formed the fourth-largest Allied armed force in Europe after the Soviets, the Americans and the combined troops of British Empire. Poles were the largest group of [[non-British personnel in the RAF during the Battle of Britain]]. [[Special Operations Executive]] had a large section of covert, elite Polish troops and close cooperation with the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish resistance]]. The Polish Army under British high command participated in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], the [[Battle of the Falaise Gap]], the [[Battle of Arnhem]], the [[Siege of Tobruk]] and the liberation of many European cities including [[Bologna]] and [[Breda]].

By July 1945, 228,000 troops of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] were serving under the high command of the British Army. Many of these men and women were originally from the [[Kresy]] region of eastern Poland including cities such as [[Lwów]] and [[Wilno]]. They had been deported from Kresy to the Soviet [[gulags]] when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany occupied Poland in 1939 in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact. When two years later Churchill and Stalin formed an alliance against Hitler, the Kresy Poles were released from the Gulags in Siberia, formed the [[Anders Army]] and marched to Persia to create the [[II Corps (Poland)]] under British high command.

==Yalta==

The Polish II Corps was instrumental in the Allied defeat of the Germans in North Africa and Italy, and its members hoped to return to Kresy in an independent and democratic Poland at the end of the War. But at [[Yalta]], Churchill agreed Stalin should keep the Soviet gains that [[Adolf Hitler]] had endorsed in the Nazi-Soviet Pact, including Kresy, and carry out [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)]]. Consequently, Churchill had agreed that tens of thousands of veteran Polish troops under British command should lose their [[Kresy]] homes to the Soviet Union, with the implication that relatives including wives and children would be at the mercy of the [[NKVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/behindcloseddoors/about/index.html|title=WWII Behind Closed Doors - PBS|website=WWII Behind Closed Doors - PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, thirty officers and men from the [[II Corps (Poland)]] committed suicide.&lt;ref name="PpOlson"&gt;pp.374-383 Olson and Cloud 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill explained his actions in a three-day Parliamentary debate starting 27 February 1945, which ended in a [[vote of confidence]]. Many MPs openly criticised Churchill over Yalta and voiced strong loyalty to Britain's Polish allies.&lt;ref name="PpOlson" /&gt; Some reporters felt Churchill was not confident Poland would be the independent and democratic country Polish troops could return to, because the prime minister also said: 'His Majesty's Government will never forget the debt they owe to the Polish troops... I earnestly hope it will be possible for them to have citizenship and freedom of the British empire, if they so desire.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BTsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_mkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4479,4501733|title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate, 25 MPs risked their careers to draft an amendment protesting against Britain's tacit acceptance of Poland's domination by the Soviet Union. These members included [[Arthur Greenwood]]; [[Sir Archibald Southby, 1st Baronet]]; [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]]; [[James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster]] and [[Victor Raikes]].&lt;ref name="PpOlson" /&gt; After the failure of the amendment, [[Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford]], the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Norwich]], resigned his seat in protest at the British treatment of Poland.&lt;ref name="PpOlson" /&gt;

==Legislation==

When the Second World War ended, [[Joseph Stalin]] reneged on his Yalta promises and a Communist government was installed in Poland. Still, the British government wanted to maintain cordial relations with Stalin, and so tried to persuade Poles in the UK to leave. Most Poles [[Western betrayal|felt betrayed]] by their wartime allies. They refused to return to Poland, because of a range of reasons: the [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)]], Soviet conduct around the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]], the [[Trial of the Sixteen]] and other executions of pro-democracy Poles such as [[Cursed soldiers|former members]] of the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] including [[Emil Fieldorf]] and [[Witold Pilecki]], and finally, the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]].

The result was the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, Britain's first mass immigration law.

Large numbers of Poles, after occupying resettlement camps of the [[Polish Resettlement Corps]], later settled in London, and industrial areas of the North, while many other Poles were recruited as [[European Volunteer Workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Diana|author2=Miles, Robert|year=1998|title=Refugees or migrant workers? The case of the European Volunteer Workers in Britain (1946–1951)|journal=Journal of Refugee Studies|volume=1|issue=3-4|pages=214–236|url=http://jrs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/3-4/214|doi=10.1093/jrs/1.3-4.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others settled in the British Empire, forming large [[Polish Canadian]] and [[Polish Australian]] communities.

In the 1951 Census, the Polish-born population of the UK numbered some 162,339, up from 44,642 in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Colin|title=John Bull's Island: Immigration and British Society 1871-1971|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=1988|isbn=0-333-28209-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burrell|first=Kathy|year=2002|title=Migrant memories, migrant lives: Polish national identity in Leicester since 1945|journal=Transactions of the Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society|issue=76|pages=59–77|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/2002/burrell2002-3.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Britain's social and economic areas had been hard hit by the Second World War, and to rebuild itself physically and financially it required a workforce to do it quickly and effectively. The Polish Resettlement Act enabled Poles to settle in Britain and provide labour. They formed much of the [[Polish British]] community as it existed prior to Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, and the mass immigration to Britain which followed.

'''Puddling''' is both the material and the process of lining a water body such as a channel or pond with '''puddle clay''' (puddle, puddling) - a watertight (low [[hydraulic conductivity]]) material based on [[clay]] and water mixed to be workable,&lt;ref&gt;"puddle, n. 4" also called puddling. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd. ed. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puddle clay as a lining==
Puddling is used in maintaining [[canal]]s or [[reservoir]]s on permeable ground. The technique of puddling and its use was developed by early canal engineer [[James Brindley]]; it is considered his greatest contribution to engineering.&lt;ref name=Rolt&gt;{{cite book |title=Navigable Waterways |last=Rolt |first=L.T.C. |authorlink=L. T. C. Rolt |year=1969 |publisher=W &amp; J Mackay}}&lt;/ref&gt; This processed material was used extensively in [[United Kingdom|UK]] canal construction in the period starting circa 1780. Starting about 1840 puddle clay was used more widely as the water-retaining element (or core) within [[Embankment dam|earthfill dams]], particularly in the [[Pennines]]. Its usage in UK dams was superseded about 1960 by the use of [[Road roller|rolled]] clay in the core, and better control of moisture content.

A considerable number of early notable dams were built in that era and they are now sometimes referred to as the 'Pennines embankment' type.  These dams are characterized by a slender vertical puddle clay core supported on both sides by earthfill shoulders of more heterogeneous material.  To control under-seepage through the natural foundation below the dam, the Pennines embankments generally constructed a puddle clay-filled cutoff trench in rock directly below the central core.  Later construction often used concrete to fill the cutoff trench.&lt;ref&gt;George M. Reeves, Ian Sims, J. C. Cripps Eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=iDqaIaLe6lkC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp; Clay Materials Used in Construction], p.377. [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-86239-184-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make puddle, clay or heavy [[loam]] is chopped with a spade and mixed into a plastic state with water and sometimes coarse sand or grit to discourage excavation by [[Mole (animal)|mole]]s or [[European water vole|water vole]]s. The puddle is laid about {{convert|10|in|cm}} thick at the sides and nearly {{convert|3|ft|abbr=on}} thick at the bottom of a canal, built up in layers. Puddle has to be kept wet in order to remain waterproof so it is important for canals to be kept filled with water.

The clay is laid down with a tool called a 'punner', or 'pun', a large rectangular block on a handle about {{convert|5|ft|m}} long, or trodden down, or compacted by some other means (e.g. by an [[excavator]] using the convex outside of its scoop, or, historically, by driving cattle across the area).

==Puddle as a building material==
Puddle clay or puddle [[adobe]] is often called [[Cob (material)|cob]]. Cob has added ingredients of a fibrous material to act as a mechanical binder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">'''Quadratic voting''' (sometimes abbreviated QV) is a collective [[decision-making]] procedure, where participants cast their ''preference'' and ''intensity of preference'' for each decision (as opposed to a simple ''for'' or ''against'' decision).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalley|first=Steven|last2=Weyl|first2=E.

According to its authors [https://galton.uchicago.edu/~lalley/ Steven P. Lalley] and [http://glenweyl.com/ E. Glen Weyl], '''Quadratic voting''' is claimed to achieve the greatest possible good for the greatest number of group members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collectivedecisionengines.com/quadratic-voting.html|title=Quadratic Voting|website=collectivedecisionengines.com|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other proponents of Quadratic Voting admit that is at best an approximation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1030268293|title=Radical Markets: uprooting capitalism and democracy for a just society|last=Posner|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Posner|last2=Weyl|first2=E. Glen|isbn=9780691177502|location=Princeton|oclc=1030268293|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It addresses issues of [[voting paradox]] and [[Majority rule|majority-rule]].

Based on market principles, each voter is endowed with a [[budget]] of “voice credits” that they may spend influencing the outcome of a range of decisions. If a participant has a strong preference for or against a particular decision, additional votes can be allocated. A vote [[pricing]] rule determines the cost of additional votes, whereby each vote increasingly becomes more expensive.

The quadratic nature of the voting means that a voter can use his or her votes more efficiently spread across many issues.  For example a voter with a budget of 16 vote credits can apply 1 vote credit to each of 16 issues. But if they feel strongly about a single issue and apply 4 votes at the cost of 16 credits to a single issue. This will use their entire budget. This also means there is a large incentive to buy and sell votes, although using a strictly secret ballot gives some protection against vote buying as the purchase cannot be verified.

The term '''registered owner''' is usually used in instances of [[title (property)|title]] of a vehicle (such as an automobile) to refer to the person who has ''right of possession'' of the vehicle, as opposed to the party that has ''right of property''.  The party that has right of property is referred to as a [[lienholder]], and in the event the registered owner fails to pay off the lien according to the agreed-to terms, the lienholder has the right to invoke [[repossession]] of the vehicle.

The '''Romanian Royal Strike''' ({{lang-ro|Greva regală}}) was a period of [[constitutional crisis]] in [[Romania]] between August 1945 and January 1946. During this period, [[Michael I of Romania|King Michael I]] refused to sign the bills enacted by the [[Petru Groza]] cabinet or to receive its Ministers in audience. 

The King was "in strike" as a form of protest, following Petru Groza's refusal to resign his position on the King's request - an unprecedented fact in Romanian political life. Following the advice of the opposition parties, the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), and silently encouraged by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], King Michael sought to replace the left-wing Petru Groza Cabinet - supported by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leadership - with one based on the two opposition parties.

The Royal Strike ended in January 1946, when Petru Groza accepted in his cabinet two representatives from the main factions of the PNȚ and PNL, leading to diplomatic recognition by the governments of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. This was a formal arrangement, since the two Ministers held little power in a cabinet increasingly dominated by the Communist Party.

The '''Russian State Library''' ({{lang-ru|Российская государственная библиотека}}) is the [[national library]] of [[Russia]], located in [[Moscow]]. It is the largest in the country and the [[List of largest libraries|fifth largest]] in the world for its collection of books (17.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;http://leninka.ru/index.php?doc=2661&lt;/ref&gt; It was named the '''[[V. I. Lenin]] State Library of the USSR''' from 1925 until it was renamed in 1992 as the Russian State Library.

The library has over 275&amp;nbsp;km of shelves with more than 43 million items,&lt;ref name=rsl/&gt; including over 17 million books and serial volumes, 13 million journals, 350 thousand music scores and sound records, 150,000 maps and others. There are items in 247 languages of the world, the foreign part representing about 29 percent of the entire collection.

Between 1922 and 1991 at least one copy of every book published in the [[USSR]] was deposited with the library, a practice which continues in a similar method today, with the library designated by law as a [[legal deposit]] library.

==History==
{{See also|Rumyantsev Museum}}
The library was founded on July 1, 1862, as [[Moscow]]'s first free public library named ''The Library of the Moscow Public Museum and [[Nikolay Rumyantsev|Rumiantsev]] Museum'', or ''The Rumiantsev Library''.  It is nicknamed the "Leninka."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rsl.ru/en | title=Russian State Library | accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rumyantsev Museum]] part of the complex was Moscow's first public museum, and housed the Art collection of count [[Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev]], which had been given to the Russian people and transferred from [[St. Petersburg]] to Moscow. Its donation covered above all books and manuscripts as well as an extensive numismatic and an ethnographic collection. These, as well as approximately 200 paintings and more than 20,000 prints, which had been selected from the collection of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, could be seen in the so-called Pashkov House (a palace, established between 1784 and 1787, in the proximity  of the [[Kremlin]]). [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]] donated the painting ''The Appearance of Christ before the People'' by [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] for the opening of the museum.

[[Image:Pashkov house.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century postcard of [[Pashkov House]], old building of the Russian State Library, overlooking the Kremlin]]
The citizens of Moscow, deeply impressed by the count's altruistic donation, named the new museum after its founder and had the inscription "from count Rumyantsev for the good Enlightenment" carved above its entrance. In the subsequent years, the collection of the museum grew by numerous further donations of objects and money, so that the museum soon housed a yet more important collection of Western European paintings, an extensive antique collection and a large collection of icons. Indeed, the collection grew so much that soon the premises of the Pashkov House became insufficient, and a second building was built beside the museum shortly after the turn of the 20th century to house the paintings in particular. 
After the [[October Revolution]] the contents again grew enormously, and again lack of space became an urgent problem.  Acute financial problems also arose, for most of the money to finance the Museum flowed into the [[Pushkin Museum]], which had only been finished a few years before and was assuming the Rumyantsev Museum's role. Therefore, it was decided in 1925 to dissolve the Rumyantsev Museum and to spread its collections over other museums and institutions in the country. Part of the collections, in particular the Western European art and antiques, were thus transferred to the Pushkin Museum. Pashkov House (at 3 [[Mokhovaya Street]]) was renamed the Old Building of the Russian State Library. The old state archive building on the corner of Mokhovaya and Vozdvizhenka Streets was razed and replaced by the new buildings.

[[Image:Russian State Library front 2007.JPG|thumb|New building of the library, view of the front entrance in 2007 (in front is the monument to Dostoevsky)]]
Construction of the first stage, designed by [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Vladimir Gelfreikh]] in 1927–1929, was authorized in 1929 and commenced in 1930.&lt;ref name=B1&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://old.rsl.ru/history/xxcentury4.htm | title=History of the Russian State Library (in Russian). 1917–1941, p. 4 | accessdate=2008-12-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080209130159/http://old.rsl.ru/history/xxcentury4.htm | archivedate=2008-02-09 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The first stage was largely complete in 1941. In the process, the building acquired the ''modernized neoclassicism'' exterior features of the [[Palace of Soviets]] (co-designed by Shchuko and Gelfreikh), departing from the stern modernism of the 1927 drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ikonnikov, A.

The first stage of Khimki library was complete in 1975.&lt;ref name=B2/&gt;

In 1925 the complex was renamed the '''[[V. I. Lenin]] State Library of the USSR'''. In 1992, it was renamed the Russian State Library by order of a decree from President Boris Yeltsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0037-6795(1994)72%3a%3C233%3aSlavonic%20%26%20East%20European%20Review%3E2.0.TX%3b2-2&amp;origin=EBSCO | title=Creating a National Library for the Workers' State: The Public Library in Petrograd and the Rumiantsev Library under Bolshevik Rule | author=Stuart, Mary | journal=The Slavonic and East European Review |date=April 1994 | volume=72 | issue=2 | pages=233–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saburō Aizawa''' ({{lang-ja|相沢 三郎}} ''Aizawa Saburō'') (September 6, 1889 &amp;ndash; July 3, 1936) was a [[Japan]]ese soldier born in [[Iwate Prefecture]].

He reached the rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]]. He assassinated [[Tetsuzan Nagata]] with his sword on August 12, 1935, because he was reputedly putting the Army "in the paws of high finance". Aizawa made no attempt to resist arrest and reportedly said that he "was in an absolute sphere, so there was neither affirmation nor negation, neither good nor evil".&lt;ref&gt;Schoppa, R. Keith: ''East Asia: Identities and Change in the Modern World'', Page 248. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After a high-profile trial, he was executed by a [[firing squad]]. His actions helped the [[Tōseiha]] faction, which he hated, gain absolute control over the Japanese military.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">The '''Seneschal of the Agenais''' was an officer carrying out and managing the domestic affairs of the lord of the former county and district of [[Agenais]].  During the course of the twelfth century, the [[seneschal]]ship, also became an office of military command.

The seneschal managed the household, coordinating between the receivers of various landholdings and the chamber, treasury, and the chancellory or chapel.  The seneschals of the Agenais, like those appointed in [[Seneschal of Périgord|Périgord]], [[Seneschal of Poitou|Poitou]], and [[Seneschal of Anjou|Najou]] had custody of demesne fortresses, the regional treasuries, and presidency of the highest court of regional custom.

The '''''Alcatel'' mandatory standstill period''' is a period of at least ten calendar days following the notification of an award decision in a contract tendered via the [[Official Journal of the European Union]], before the contract is signed with the successful supplier(s). Its purpose is to allow unsuccessful bidders to challenge the decision before the contract is signed. It is named after a pair of linked [[European Court of Justice]] cases which are jointly known as the ''[[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]]'' case (Case C-81/98). Within the UK, it was introduced by the [[Office of Government Commerce]] in 2005.

The timelines given below are the minimum (of at least 10 days) under the 'Alcatel' mandatory standstill period and show the days by which specific actions by 
- the tenderer (ie a request for additional de-briefing within the standstill period), and 
- the contracting authority (ie notify all tenderers of the award decision and the completion of any requested additional de-briefing) in order to comply with the minimum period before entering into a contract (assuming no legal challenges are formally notified).

Notes:
- Depending on the day of the initial notification of the intention of the contract award decision, given the very tight timescales for the additional debriefing, it may be more practical to extend the end-date of the standstill period beyond the minimum of 10 calendar days.

- The 'traditional' de-briefing requirement (within 15 days of receiving a written request) remains where a tenderer does not seek an additional de-briefing within the first 2 working days of the standstill period.  In any case, all tenderers can make formal complaints in Court within the standstill period regardless of having requested or received debriefing within the standstill period and Courts can agree to grant interim measures preventing contract award.

;Time line
Action
* Day 0	Notify tenderers of decision and intention to award contract on or after 'date'
* Day 1	
* Day 2	Tenderers must request additional debriefing (by phone, email, fax) before end of day (midnight)
* Day 3	
* Day 4	
* Day 5	
* Day 6	
* Day 7	Additional de-briefings must be completed before end of day (midnight)*
* Day 8	
* Day 9	
* Day 10	End of minimum standstill period**

The contract may be concluded if no legal challenge has been notified

* If there is a delay in completing the requested additional de-briefings, the end-date of the standstill period must be extended to ensure 3 full working days between the last de-brief and the end of the standstill period remembering that the last day must be a working day.
** The end of a standstill period must not fall on a public holiday or at the weekend.  Day 10 ends at midnight on that day.

'''Tarleton Gillespie''' is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research New England and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the [http://www.comm.cornell.edu Department of Communication] at [[Cornell University]]. He is the author of the book ''Wired Shut: Copyright and the Shape of Digital Culture''.

Gillespie has been awarded the Young Faculty Teaching Excellence Award in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at [[Cornell University]]; he was the commencement speaker for the [[Information Science]]/Information Science, Systems and Technology majors at [[Cornell University]] for 2007.

==Education==
Gillespie received his B.A. in English from [[Amherst College]] in 1994, and his M.A. in Communication from the [[UC San Diego|University of California, San Diego]] in 1997.  He obtained his Ph.D. in Communication from the [[UC San Diego|University of California, San Diego]] in January 2002. He has been working for the Department of Communication at Cornell University since 2010.

==Research==
Gillespie is currently researching the impact of the Internet and modern media technologies on copyright law and the progression of copyright law in the digital age. He is also interested in topics such as digital rights management and other digital copy protection strategies and their effect on culture. Broader interests include debates on peer-to-peer file-sharing, information technology, animation and children's media. His 2018 book, "Custodians of the Internet", discusses the complex relationship social media sites have with hate speech and extremist groups on their sites, as there are no defined "custodian" responsibilities in policing this content, and actions taken are mainly left up to the discretion of private companies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thirteen.org/openmind/science/guardians-of-the-web/5925/|title=Guardians of the Web |last=Hefner |first=Alexander |last2=Gillespie |first2=Tarleton |date=April 21, 2018 |website= The Open Mind, Thirteen |access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===The Basics of Gillespie article "The Politics of 'Platforms===
The article "The Politics of 'Platforms" by Tarleton Gillespie provides the information of how one word can provide many paths for an online content provider. He has grouped the word 'platform' into four distinct categories that can help define what an online software platform does. He categorizes the word platform as computational, architectural, figurative and political. All four of these categories relate to why the term 'platform' has "emerged in reference to online content-hosting intermediaries and, just as important, what value both its specificity and its flexibility offer them" (The Platform of Politics,p.&amp;nbsp;350).

'''"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule"''' (''Die drei reinen Typen der legitimen Herrschaft'') is an [[essay]] written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]], explaining his [[tripartite classification of authority]].  Originally published in the journal ''Preussische Jahrbücher'' 187, 1-2, 1922, an English [[translation]], translated by Hans Gerth, was published in the journal ''Berkeley Publications in Society and Institutions'' 4(1): 1-11, 1958. Weber also refers to the three types of legitimate rule in his famous essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| Weber's ideas about legitimate rule also appear in his ''[[Basic Concepts in Sociology]]'' and ''[[The Theory of Social and Economic Organization]]''.

The translation of the German word [[Herrschaft (sociology)|Herrschaft]] is at the heart of understanding Weber's point about political legitimacy.  The translation ''Rule'' was employed in the 1958 essay translation by the key early Weber translator [[Hans Gerth]], and is in the title of the essay as translated here.  Other translators of Weber including  Alexander M. Henderson and [[Talcott Parsons]], translated Herrschaft as ''authority''.  Weber translators Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters discuss the difficulties in translating Herrschaft as well, typically using "dominion" and "domination" in addition to the original German Herrschaft&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Weber, [[belief]]s in the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of a [[political system]] go beyond [[philosophy]] and they directly contribute to the state system stability and [[authority]].&lt;ref name=rb294&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers have an explanation for their [[Superior (hierarchy)|superiority]], an explanation that is commonly accepted but during a crisis can be questioned.&lt;ref name=rb294/&gt; Weber sees only three categories of legitimation strategies (which he calls "[[pure type]]s") used to justify the right of rulers to rule:
* '''[[Legal authority]]''' is based on a system of [[law|rule]]s that is applied administratively and judicially in accordance with known principles. The persons who administer those rules are appointed or elected by legal procedures. Superiors are also subject to rules that limit their powers, separate their private lives from official duties and require written documentation.&lt;ref name=rb294/&gt;
* '''[[Traditional authority]]''' is based on a system in which authority is legitimate because it "has always existed". People in power usually enjoy it because they have inherited it. Officials consist either of personal retainers (in a [[Patrimonialism|patrimonial]] regime) or of personal loyal allies, such as [[vassal]]s or tributary lords (in a [[feudal regime]]). Their prerogatives are usually similar to those of the ruler above them, just reduced in scale, and they too are often selected based on inheritance.&lt;ref name=rb295&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Charismatic authority]]''' is based on the [[charisma]] of the leader, who shows that he possesses the right to lead by virtue of magical powers, prophecies, heroism, etc. His followers respect his right to lead because of his unique qualities (his charisma), not because of any tradition or legal rules. Officials consist of those who have shown personal devotion to the ruler, and of those who possess their own charisma.&lt;ref name=rb295/&gt;

The types of authority change over time, when the ruled are no longer satisfied with the system.&lt;ref name=rb297&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.297&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after the death of a charismatic leader his followers, if they lack the charisma of their predecessor, will try to institute a system based on tradition or law. On the other hand, these systems can be challenged by the appearance of a new charismatic leader, especially during economic or military crises.

These 'pure types' are almost always found in combination with other 'pure types' &amp;mdash; for example, [[familial charisma]] (important in [[kingship]] and the [[Indian caste system]]) is a combination of charismatic and traditional elements, while [http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3632148.html institutional charisma] (existing in all [[church organization]]s, but absent from a [[priesthood]] that fails to develop such an organization) is a mixture of charismatic and legal elements.

Though on rational grounds a champion of absolutism for the sovereign, Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European [[classical liberalism|liberal thought]]: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law that leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Pierre |last=Manent |title=An Intellectual History of Liberalism |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=RraTbBJ0m_YC&amp;pg=PA20 |year=1994 |pages=20–38 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |chapter=Hobbes and the New Political Art |isbn=9780691034379}}&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of humans as being matter and motion, obeying the same physical laws as other matter and motion, remains influential; and his account of human nature as self-interested cooperation, and of political communities as being based upon a "social contract" remains one of the major topics of political philosophy.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Hobbes was born at [[Westport, Wiltshire|Westport]], now part of [[Malmesbury]] in Wiltshire, England, on 5 April 1588.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hobbes-Thomas.html |title=Thomas Hobbes Biography |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=July 24, 2009 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born prematurely when his mother heard of the coming invasion of the [[Spanish Armada]], Hobbes later reported that "my mother gave birth to twins: myself and fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vita carmine expressa |year=1679 |first=Thomas |last=Hobbes |chapter=Opera Latina |editor-first=William |editor-last=Molesworth |editor-link=William Nassau Molesworth |location=London |volume=I |page=86 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi00molegoog#page/n96/mode/2up |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Z_JiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood is almost completely unknown, and his mother's name is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.2307/3791051 |jstor=3791051 |title=Thomas Hobbes: Radical in the Service of Reaction |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=sNtoQgAACAAJ |year=1986 |last=Jacobson |first=Norman |last2=Rogow |first2=Arnold A. |journal=[[Political Psychology (journal)|Political Psychology]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=469 |issn=0162-895X |isbn=9780393022889 |lccn=79644318 |oclc=44544062}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Thomas Sr., was the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of [[Charlton, Brinkworth|Charlton]] and [[Westport, Wiltshire|Westport]]. Thomas Hobbes, the younger, had a brother Edmund, about two years older, and a sister.  Thomas Sr. was involved in a fight with the local clergy outside his church, forcing him to leave London and abandon the family. The family was left in the care of Thomas Sr.'s older brother, Francis, a wealthy merchant with no family.  Hobbes Jr. was educated at Westport church from age four, passed to the [[Malmesbury school]], and then to a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer, a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]]. Hobbes was a good pupil, and around 1603 he went up to [[Magdalen Hall]], the predecessor college to [[Hertford College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hertford.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Philosophy at Hertford College |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Hertford College]] |accessdate=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/hobbes.html |website=The Galileo Project |title=Hobbes, Thomas |publisher=[[Rice University]] |accessdate=July 24, 2009 |year=1995 |first=Al Van |last=Helden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LGSytrSTMQwC&amp;pg=PT89 |title=Thomas Hobbes: Politics and law |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-41508083-5 |year=1993 |page=89 |last=King |first=Preston T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal John Wilkinson was a [[Puritan]], and he had some influence on Hobbes.

At university, Hobbes appears to have followed his own curriculum; he was "little attracted by the scholastic learning" and completed his [[B.A. degree]] in 1608. He was recommended by Sir James Hussey, his master at Magdalen, as tutor to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire|William]], the son of [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire|William Cavendish]], Baron of Hardwick (and later [[Duke of Devonshire|Earl of Devonshire]]), and began a lifelong connection with that family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hobbes.html |title=Thomas Hobbes |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=July 24, 2009 |last=O'Connor |first=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E. F. |author2-link=E. F. Robertson|date=November 2002 |website=School of Mathematics and Statistics |location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes became a companion to the younger William and in 1610 they both took part in a [[Grand Tour|grand tour]] of Europe. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour, in contrast to the [[scholastic philosophy]] that he had learned in Oxford. His scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors.  One outcome was, in 1628, his translation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', the first translation of that work into English from the original Greek. It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as ''Horea Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses'' also represent the work of Hobbes from this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=Three Discourses: A Critical Modern Edition of Newly Identified Work of the Young Hobbes |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Noel B. |editor-link=Noel B.

Although he associated with literary figures like [[Ben Jonson]] and briefly worked as [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s [[amanuensis]], he did not extend his efforts into philosophy until after 1629. In June 1628, his employer Cavendish, then the Earl of Devonshire, died of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and the widowed countess dismissed Hobbes.]{{cn|date=November 2018}} 

==In Paris (1630-1637)==

Hobbes soon found work as a tutor to [[Sir Gervase Clifton, 2nd Baronet|Gervase Clifton]], the son of [[Sir Gervase Clifton, 1st Baronet]] mostly spent in Paris until 1631. Thereafter, he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]], the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years, as well as tutoring, he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited [[Florence]] in 1636 and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by [[Marin Mersenne]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Hobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in [[physics]]. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if Men were not to fall back into "brutishness and misery". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==In England==
Hobbes came home, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent, which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. However, by the end of the [[Short Parliament]] in 1640, he had written a short treatise called ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic''. It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of ''The Elements of Law'' was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between ''The Elements of Law'' and ''Leviathan,'' which demonstrates that the events of the [[English Civil War]] had little effect on his [[contractarian]] methodology. However, the arguments in ''Leviathan'' were modified from ''The Elements of Law'' when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation. Namely, Hobbes wrote in ''The Elements of Law'' that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the [[consent of the governed]], while in ''Leviathan'' he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts about the [[engagement controversy]] or of his reaction to treatises published by [[Patriarchalism|Patriarchalists]], such as [[Sir Robert Filmer]], between 1640 and 1651.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

When in November 1640 the [[Long Parliament]] succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt that he was in disfavour due to the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris, he rejoined the coterie around Mersenne and wrote a critique of the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' of [[Descartes]], which was printed as third among the sets of "Objections" appended, with "Replies" from Descartes, in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.

Hobbes also extended his own works in a way, working on the third section, ''[[De Cive]]'', which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in ''Leviathan''. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics (''Tractatus opticus'') included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as ''Cogitata physico-mathematica'' in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, [[Gilles de Roberval]] and others to referee the controversy between [[John Pell]] and [[Longomontanus]] over the problem of [[squaring the circle]].

==Civil war period (1642–1651)==

In 1647, Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nndb.com/people/691/000031598// |title = People |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had come to Paris from [[Jersey]] around July.  This engagement lasted until 1648 when Charles went to Holland.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Hobbes de cive.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from ''De Cive'' (1642)]]

The company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce ''Leviathan'', which set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war. Hobbes compared the State to a monster ([[leviathan]]) composed of men, created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions. The work closed with a general "Review and Conclusion", in response to the war, which answered the question: Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect is irrevocably lost?{{cn|date=November 2018}}

During the years of composing ''Leviathan'', Hobbes remained in or near Paris. In 1647, a serious illness that nearly killed him disabled him for six months.{{cn|date=November 2018}} On recovering, he resumed his literary task and completed it by 1650.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Meanwhile, a translation of ''De Cive'' was being produced; scholars disagree about whether it was Hobbes who translated it.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1650, a pirated edition of ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vilen |last=Vardanyan |title=Panorama of Psychology |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=q_23H6AtR2AC&amp;pg=PA72 |publisher=[[AuthorHouse]] |date=10 January 2011 |page=72 |isbn=9781456700324}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was divided into two small volumes (''Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policie'' and ''De corpore politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politick'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shrikant |last=Yelegaonkar |title=Western Thinker's in Political Science |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=nQTECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT140 |publisher=[[Lulu.com]] |year=2009 |page=140 |isbn=9781329082779}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1651, the translation of ''De Cive'' was published under the title ''Philosophicall Rudiments concerning Government and Society''. Also, the printing of the greater work proceeded, and finally appeared in mid-1651, titled ''Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common Wealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civil.''{{cn|date=November 2018}} It had a famous title-page engraving depicting a crowned giant above the waist towering above hills overlooking a landscape, holding a sword and a [[crozier]] and made up of tiny human figures.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The work had immediate impact.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Soon, Hobbes was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists, who might well have killed him.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Hobbes appealed to the revolutionary English government for protection and fled back to London in winter 1651.{{cn|date=November 2018}} After his submission to the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], he was allowed to subside into private life in [[Fetter Lane]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==''Leviathan''==
{{Main article|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}
[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Leviathan'']]

In ''Leviathan'', Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of [[State (polity)|states]] and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.

Beginning from a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the [[state of nature]]. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a "war of all against all" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). The description contains what has been called one of the best known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state humankind would be in, were it not for political community:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Introduction|title=Human Nature and De Corpore Politico|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xxx|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII.: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In such a state, people fear death, and lack both the things necessary to [[wikt:commodious|commodious]] living, and the hope of being able to toil to obtain them. So, in order to avoid it, people accede to a [[social contract theory|social contract]] and establish a [[civil society]]. According to Hobbes, society is a population and a [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]] [[authority]], to whom all individuals in that society cede some rights for the sake of protection. Any power exercised by this authority cannot be resisted, because the protector's sovereign power derives from individuals' surrendering their own sovereign power for protection. The individuals are thereby the authors of all decisions made by the sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Of the Rights of Sovereigns by Institution|title= Leviathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=117|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "he that complaineth of injury from his sovereign complaineth that whereof he himself is the author, and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself, no nor himself of injury because to do injury to one's self is impossible". There is no doctrine of [[separation of powers]] in Hobbes's discussion.&lt;ref&gt;"1000 Makers of the Millennium", p. 42. Dorling Kindersley, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hobbes, the sovereign must control civil, military, judicial and [[Cuius regio, eius religio|ecclesiastical]] powers, even the words.&lt;ref&gt;Vélez, F., ''La palabra y la espada'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

===John Bramhall===
In 1654 a small treatise, ''Of Liberty and Necessity'', directed at Hobbes, was published by Bishop [[John Bramhall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Hobbes and Bramhall on Liberty and Necessity |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |editor-first=Vere |editor-last=Chappell |editor-link=Vere Chappell |first=Karl |last=Ameriks |author-link=Karl Ameriks |first2=Desmond M. |last2=Clarke |author2-link=Desmond M.

Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication. However, a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with "an extravagantly laudatory epistle".{{cn|date=April 2017}}  Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of ''A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity''). In 1656, Hobbes was ready with ''The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance'', in which he replied "with astonishing force"{{cn|date=January 2017}} to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the [[Free will|free-will]] controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with ''Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions'', and also included a bulky appendix entitled ''The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale''.

===John Wallis===
{{details|Hobbes–Wallis controversy}}
Hobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in ''Leviathan''. He went on to publish ''[[De Corpore]]'', which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics but also an erroneous proof of the [[squaring of the circle]]. This all led mathematicians to target him for [[polemics]] and sparked [[John Wallis]] to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655, the publishing date of ''De Corpore'', Hobbes and Wallis went round after round trying to disprove each other's positions. After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that it has become one of the most infamous feuds in mathematical history.

===Atheist===
Hobbes has been accused of [[atheism]], or (in the case of Bramhall) of teachings that could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's ''The Catching of Leviathan'', that "atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible".&lt;ref&gt;p. 282 of Molesworth's edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|location=Cambridge|publisher=Blackwell|date=1995|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and [[J. G. A. Pocock]], but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion.

As Martinich has pointed out, in Hobbes's time the term "atheist" was often applied to people who believed in God but not in [[divine providence]], or to people who believed in God but also maintained other beliefs that were inconsistent with such belief. He says that this "sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the [[early modern period]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|location=Cambridge|publisher=Blackwell|date=1995|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, he argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that "though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity".&lt;ref&gt;''Human Nature'' I.XI.5.&lt;/ref&gt; (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following [[Tertullian]], whose views were not condemned in the [[First Council of Nicaea]].) Like [[John Locke]], he also stated that true [[revelation]] can never disagree with human reason and experience,&lt;ref&gt;''Leviathan'' III.xxxii.2. "...we are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor (that which is undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason".&lt;/ref&gt; although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war.

==Later life==

In 1658, Hobbes published the final section of his philosophical system, completing the scheme he had planned more than 20 years before. ''De Homine'' consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the ''Human Nature'' and the ''Leviathan''. In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics and physics, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works. From the time of the [[The Restoration|Restoration]], he acquired a new prominence; "Hobbism" became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king, Hobbes' former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of £100.

The king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred "should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the ''Leviathan''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8|website=British History Online|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26780|accessdate=14 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an ''Appendix'' to his ''Latin translation of Leviathan'', published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the [[Court of High Commission|High Court of Commission]] had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the [[Nicene Creed]], which, he maintained, ''Leviathan'' did not do.

The only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death, including ''Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662''. For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond, whatever his enemies tried. Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable, and noble or learned foreigners who came to England never forgot to pay their respects to the old philosopher.

His final works were an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' into "rugged" English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''Odyssey'' in 1675.

The '''Treaty of Peace and Friendship''' of 1904 between [[Chile]] and [[Bolivia]] was signed in [[Santiago de Chile]] on October 20, 1904 to delineate the boundary through 96 specified points between Cerro Zapaleri and Cerro Chipe and to regulate the relations between the two countries 20 years after the end of the [[War of the Pacific]].

The Bolivia–Chile boundary is about {{convert|535|mi|km|disp=flip}} long and is demarcated by pillars in the [[Andes]]. Most of the boundary consists of straight lines between high mountain peaks. From the [[Argentina]]–Bolivia–Chile [[tripoint]] of [[Zapaleri|Cerro Zapaleri]], it extends northward through more than five degrees of latitude to the Peru–Bolivia–Chile tripoint at 17° 29' 55.0" S. [[latitude]] and 69° 28' 28.8" W. [[longitude]].

==Historical background==

When Bolivia became independent from Spain on August 6, 1825, it took possession of the territories that corresponded to its colonial administration in accordance with the ''[[uti possidetis juris]]'' of 1810. Bolivia claimed the maritime territory westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean between the [[Salado River (Antofagasta, Chile)|Río Salado]] on the south and the [[Río Loa]] on the north, which included part of the [[Atacama Desert]]. In 1842 Chile made claims to the desert area following the discovery and exploitation of [[Nitre|nitrate]] deposits. With negotiations extending over a period of several decades, a decision was reached finally between Bolivia and Chile in a treaty dated August 10, 1866.
Article I of the treaty of 1866 stated that "the line of demarcation of boundaries between Chile and Bolivia in the desert ''…shall henceforth be, the parallel of latitude 24 degrees South.''" On December 5, 1872, a subsequent treaty confirmed the [[24th parallel south|24th parallel]] as the boundary between the two states. In accordance with various other treaties, Bolivia was given an equal share of revenues from [[guano]] deposits located in Chilean territory between the 24th and [[25th parallel south|25th parallels]]; and Chile had the same concession in Bolivian territory between the 24th and [[23rd parallel south|23rd parallels]], which area included the port of [[Antofagasta]].

In 1872, the Government of Bolivia granted a concession to a British firm to develop the nitrate deposits in Bolivian territory for a period of 15 years. The following year the secret 1873 [[Treaty of Defensive Alliance (Bolivia–Peru)]], called defensive by the signer, was signed at Lima in order to guarantee the independence, sovereignty, and integrity of their respective territories, though this treaty was kept secret and not communicated to Chile. Therefore, Chile interprets this pact as a secret alliance against them. In 1878 Bolivia placed a minimum tax on the production of the nitrate firm. In the intervening time, the concession had been transferred to a Chilean company making the leveling of the tax a violation of the treaty of 1866, in which Bolivia had agreed not to increase taxes on the industry without the approval of Chile. Chile asked Peru for a proclamation of neutrality, but as the latter did not respond Chile declared war on both Peru and Bolivia on April 5, 1879 precipitating the so-called War of the Pacific.

The [[Treaty of Ancón]] ended the conflict between Peru and Chile on October 20, 1883, and a truce was signed by Bolivia and Chile at [[Valparaíso]] on April 4, 1884. In accordance with the terms of the truce, Chile was to  administer Bolivian territory from the 23rd parallel northward to the Rio Loa, thus depriving Bolivia of the northern part of the province of Antofagasta and a Pacific littoral. The eastern boundary of the territory was given as a series of straight-line segments extending northward between stated points from Cerro Zapaleri (Cerro Sapaleri) through the two thirds of the northeastern slope of Cerro Licancabur, Cerro Cabana, most southerly bay head of Salar de Ascotan, Volcan Oyahue (Volcan Ollague) and Volcan Tua, and then by the boundary between the former Peruvian province of Tarapaca and Bolivia.

In 1889, a [[Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia|railroad constructed inland from Antofagasta reached Uyuni]] on the Bolivian plateau. On May 18, 1895, a treaty signed by Chile and Bolivia confirmed the latter's loss of the territory between the 23rd parallel and the Rio Loa. A second treaty also was signed on the 18th by the two states that promised to transfer [[Tacna]] and [[Arica]] to Bolivia should Chile obtain them, or if not, the Caleta de Vitor, a small port south of Arica.

On October 20, 1904, a peace treaty between Chile and Bolivia delimited the boundary through 96 specified points between Cerro Zapaleri and Cerro Chipe. Provision was made in the treaty for demarcation and boundary pillars were erected shortly thereafter.

Chilean sovereignty was recognized by Bolivia over the territory from the ocean to the existing Argentine boundary between the 23rd and 24th parallels. Chile also recognized the right of Bolivia in perpetuity to commercial transit through its territory and ports, to be regulated by special agreements.

The Salas-Pinilla Protocol of 1907 made two modifications of the 1904 boundary, although ratifications of the protocol were not exchanged until 31 years later. A change was made between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca in favor of Chile in order to keep the Collaguasi railroad, which connected with the Antofagasta-Uyuni railroad, entirely within Chilean territory. In return a second change transferred a small parcel of Chilean territory to Bolivia between Cerro de Patalani and Alto de Panantalla.

In 1913, a railroad was completed between Arica and La Paz, which gave Bolivia access to the Pacific Ocean by means of a second railroad.

In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Ancón, Peru ceded unconditionally to Chile the littoral [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá Province]], bounded north by the Rio Camarones, south by the Rio Loa, east by Bolivia, and west by the Pacific Ocean. The provinces of Tacna and Arica, bounded north by the Rio Sama from its source in the mountains adjoining Bolivia to the sea, south by the Rio Camarones, east by Bolivia and west by the ocean, were to be administered by Chile for a 10-year period, followed by a plebiscite to determine whether these provinces would remain permanently under Chilean administration or if they would continue to be part of Peruvian territory. Efforts to reach an agreement on the terms of a plebiscite were unsuccessful, and Chile remained in possession of Tacna and Arica after
the expiration of the 10-year period stipulated in the Treaty of Ancón.

In a treaty signed at Lima on June 3, 1929, Article 2 delimited the international boundary dividing the disputed territory of Tacna and Arica between Peru and Chile. A complementary protocol signed on the same day stated in Article I that neither government might without previous agreement with the other cede to any third state all or any part of the territory which, in accordance with the treaty, remained under their respective sovereignties. In Article 2 of the protocol, [[port facilities]] granted to Peru under Article 5 of the treaty should consist of free transit to Peruvian territory and from such across Chilean territory. The placing of pillars marking the boundary was completed the following year and a demarcation protocol was signed at Lima on August 5, 1930.

In 1939, Chile announced a plan to divert the waters of the [[Lauca River|Rio Lauca]] westward through a canal and tunnel into the [[Azapa Valley|Quebrada Azapa]] for purposes of irrigation in the Valle de Azapa and hydroelectric-power generation. Within six miles of the international boundary, Lago Cotacotani is the source of the Rio Lauca which flows successively westward, southward, and eastward for about 50 miles in Chilean territory before entering Bolivia where it ultimately reaches Lago Coipasa. Construction on the project was not started until 1948, and water diversion began 14 years later from a dam located about 16 miles southwest of Lago Cotacotani. In 1962 Bolivia threatened to take the matter of water diversion before the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) which organization ultimately requested the Governments of Bolivia and Chile to resort to one of the means of pacific settlement of disputes provided for in the inter-American system.

==Geographic setting==
The Bolivia–Chile boundary extends along the spectacular heights of the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes. From 13,000 feet at the Peru tripoint, it connects with numerous snow-capped peaks exceeding 18,000 feet in elevation to the Argentina tripoint Cerro Sapaleri, at 18,530 feet. Several peaks are above 19,000 feet such as Cerro Sairecahur with an elevation of 19,587 feet. In general mountain passes are high and not easily accessible with some over 14,000 feet in elevation. Barren rocky slopes, limited areas of short grasses, and scattered mountain shrubs are typical along the boundary. Near the boundary salars or salt plains are common such as the [[Salar de Coipasa]] in Bolivia and the [[Salar de Ascotán]] in Chile.

Because of great differences in the elevation and exposure of landform features in the Andes, climatic conditions range broadly along the boundary. Characteristic of the high elevations, mean annual temperatures are relatively low and precipitation tends to be greater on the windward side than on the leeward side of the mountains. The temperatures and precipitation of enclosed valleys and plateau areas contrast greatly with the exposed peaks. Most of the high peaks are snow-capped throughout the year.

In general, the area is sparsely populated and few roads cross the boundary. Small towns serve mining companies, transportation maintenance stations, and scattered people engaged in pastoralism or limited cultivation. The principal roads crossing the boundary parallel the [[Arica–La Paz railway|Arica–La Paz]] and Antofagasta–Uyuni railroads. A number of tracks and trails are in use locally along the boundary.

==Boundary alignment==
The treaty delimited the boundary from south to north through 96 specific points indicated in the text by numbers in parentheses. In accordance with the treaty of 1904, the boundary between Cerro Zapaleri (Cerro Sapaleri),
the Argentina tripoint, and Cerro Chipapa is as follows:
:''From the highest peak of Cerro Zapaleri (1), in a straight line to the highest point (2) of the ridge going toward the south of the Cerros de Guayaques in the approximate latitude of 22° 54'; from here another straight line to the Portezuelo del Cajon (3), and following the divide of that ridge which runs north by the northern slope of Cerro Juriques (Volcan Juriques) (4), through the innominated point located at two thirds of elevation of the northeastern slope of Volcan Licancabur (Cerro Licancabur) in the latitude of 22° 49' 41" and longitude of 67° 52' 35" (5), Cerro Sairecabur (6), [Cerro] Curiquinca (7), and Volcan Putana or [Cerro] Jorjencal (8,) from this point [the boundary] follows by one of the spurs in the direction of the Cerro del Pajonal (9), and in a straight line to the southern peak of the Cerros de Tocorpuri (10), from where it follows again by the divide of the Cordon del Panizo (Cerro Panizo) (11), and Cerros de Tatio (12). It follows always to the north of the divide of the Cordon del Linzor (Volcan Linzor) (13) and of the Cerros de Silaguala (Cordon de Silaguala) (14) from whose northern peak (Volcan Apagado) (15) it goes by a spur to the Cerrito de Silala (Cerro Silala) (16) and then in a straight line to the Cerro Inacaliri or [Cerro] Cajon (17).''

:''From this point it goes in a straight line to the peak that seems to be in the center of the group of the Cerros del Inca or Barranca (Faldas de Barrancane) (18) and then along the divide following northward by the ridge of the Cerro de Ascotan or [Cerro del] Jardin (19); from the peak of this mountain it goes in a straight line to the peak of Cerro Araral (20), and by another straight line to the peak of Volcan Ollague (Volcan Oyahue) (21)''

:''From here [the boundary goes] in a straight line to the highest peak of Cerro Chipapa (22),...''

The Boliviano-Chilean protocol of 1907 modified the boundary of 1904 between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca (25) and transferred a small parcel of Bolivian territory to Chile.&lt;ref&gt;The treaty of 1904 had previously delimited the boundary between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca as follows:
:''...[from] the highest peak of Cerro Chipapa (22), descending to the west by a ridge to the peak of Cerro Cosca (23). From this point it follows the divide along the ridge that connects with the Cerro Alconcha (24) and from here it goes to the Volcan Olca (25) by the highest divide.''&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Between Cerro Chipapa and Volcan Olca, the boundary shall be a straight line from Cerro Chipapa, as marked, to the northern crest of Cerro Paroma (Cerro Paruma), leaving inside Chilean territory a space of not less than one kilometer between the eastern-most point of the Collaguasi railroad and the frontier: from Cerro Paroma it shall continue along the crest which unites Cerro Paroma with Volcan Olca.''

The boundary between Volcan Olca and Cerro de Patalani is delimited by the treaty of 1904.
:''…From this volcano [Volcan Olca] it follows by the ridge of the Cerros del Millunu (Cordon del Milluni) (26), of [Cerro] Laguna (27), Volcan Irruputuncu (28), [Cerro] Bofedal (29) and [Cerro] Chela (30), and from a high point of mountains, it arrives at Milluri (Cerro Milliri) (31) and then Huallcani (32).''

:''From here it goes to the Cerro Caiti (33) and follows by the divide to Cerro Napa(34).''

:''From the peak of this mountain it goes in a straight line to a point (35) situated 10 kilometers to the south of the east peak of Cerro Huailla (36), from where it goes in a straight line to the height mentioned, doubling back again to the east and following by a ridge of the Cerros Laguna (37), Corregidor (38), and Huaillaputuncu (39) to the easternmost stones of [Cerro] Sillillica (40), following along a ridge that goes northwest to the peak of Cerro Piga (41).''

:''From this mountain, it goes in a straight line to the highest peak of Tres Cerritos (42) and follows in a straight line to Cerro Challacollo (43) and to the narrowest part of the fields of Sacaya (44), opposite Vilacollo.''

:''From Sacaya the boundary goes in a straight line to the stones of Cueva Colorada (45) and Santaile (46), where it follows to the northwest by the Cerros Irruputuncu (47) and Patalani (48).''

A second modification of the 1904 boundary made by the Boliviano-Chilean protocol of 1907 between Cerro de Patalani and Alto de Panantalla (54) transferred a small piece of Chilean territory to Bolivia&lt;ref&gt;The treaty of 1904 had previously delimited the boundary between Cerro Patalani and Alto de Panantalla as follows:
:  ''...From this peak [Cerro Patalani (48)] it goes in a straight line to the Cerro Chiarcollo (49), crossing the
  Rio Cancosa (50) and from here also in a straight line to the peak of Cerro Pintapintani (51) following from
  this peak by the ridge of the Cerros Quiuri (52), Pumiri (Cerro Pumire) (53) and Panantalla (54).''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Between Cerro Patalani and Panantaya (Alto de Panantalla), the frontier shall be a straight line from Cerro Patalani to the crest of Cerro Irpa Pueblo, and from there in a straight line to Cerro Irpa; from there it shall follow the divide to the highest point of Cerros Sillayhuay (Cordillera Sillajhuay) and shall double in the north in order to follow the Cerros de Torini (Cerro Toroni) divide to the Apacheta de Oje, and from there the divide to Cerro Armasaya. From this point it shall be a straight line to Apacheta Tirujalla (Apacheta Tillujaya) and from there a straight line to the Alto de Panantaya, as marked.''

The boundary between Alto de Panantalla and the Peru tripoint is delimited by the treaty of 1904:

:''…From the height of Panantalla it goes in a straight line to Tolapacheta (55), half the distance between Chapi and Rinconada, and from this point in a straight line to the Portezuelo Huailla (56); next it passes by the peaks of the Cerros Lacataya (57) and Salitral (58). It returns to the north going in a straight line to the Cerrito Tapacollo (Cerro Tapacollo) (59) in the Salar de Coipasa, and in another straight line to the marker of Quellaga (60) from which it follows in straight lines to the Cerro Prieto (Cerrito Prieto) (61) to the north of the field of Pisiga (Pisiga Sucre), Cerrito Toldo (Cerro Toldo) (62), markers of Sicaya (63), Chapillicsa (64), Cabarray (Cabaray) (65), Tres Cruces (66), Jamachuma (67), Quimsachata (68) and Chinchillani (69), and cutting across the Rio Todos Santos (70) it goes by the landmarks of [Cerro] Payacallo (71) and Carahuano (72) to Cerro Capitan (74).''
      
:''It then follows northward by the divide of the ridge of the Cerros Lliscaya (75) and Quilhuiri (76) and from the summit at this point it goes in a straight line to the Cerro Puguintica (77).''

:''To the north of this last point, Bolivia and Chile agree to fix the following boundary:''
:''from the Cerro Puquintica (77) it goes northward by the ridge toward Macaya, crossing in this place the Rio Lauca (78) and then following in a straight line to the Cerro Chiliri (Cerro Chilliri) (79); it continues northward by the divide to the Portezuelo de Japu (80), the peak of [Cerro]. Quimasachata (81), Portezuelo Tambo Quemado (82), the Cerros de Quisiquisini (83), Portezuelo Huacollo (Paso Guacollo) (84), peaks of the Cerros de Payachata [Nevados de Payachata] (85 and 86), Cerro Larancahua (87), to the Portezuelo Casiri (88).''

:''From this point it goes to the Cerros de Condoriri (89) that separate the waters of the Rio Sajama and Rio Achuta from those of the Rio Caquena or Cosapilla, and continues by the ridge between those hills, and goes to the Cerro Carbiri (91), passing by the Portezuelo Achuta (90); from Cerro Carbiri, it descends to the narrows of the Rio Caquena or Rio Caspailla (92), above the post house which also bears the last name. It will then follow the course of the Rio Caquena or Rio Cosapilla to the outlet (93) in the meadows of the Estancia, from where it goes in a straight line to the marker to Visviri (94). From here it goes in a straight line ''&lt;ref&gt;At the time of the treaty of 1904, a permanent boundary had not been established between Peru and Chile, and the latter administered the Arica - Tacna area. Therefore, the Bolivia-Chile boundary was delimited northward of the present Peru tripoint as follows:
:…From here [the marker of Visviri (94)] it goes in a straight line to the [Cerro] Santurario (95) that is found north of the [Rio] Maure on the northwest of the confluence of this river with another that comes from the north, two kilometers north of the Maure Posthouse; it continues northwest by the ridge that leads to the marker on the Cerro Chipe or Cerro Tolacollo (96), the last point on the frontier.&lt;/ref&gt;''[northward to the Peru tripoint]''&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with the protocol of 1930 relative to the demarcation of the Chile-Peru boundary, the Peru tripoint is boundary pillar No. 80 and marker No. 5 of the old Bolivia-Chile boundary. The tripoint is
located at 17° 29' 55.0" S. latitude and 69° 28' 28.8" W.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present situation==
Bolivia continues to have aspirations for a territorial outlet to the Pacific Ocean. Chile has granted Bolivia duty-free use of the ports of Arica and Antofagasta and of the railroads connecting them. An agreement has not been reached by the two states relative to the diversion of water from the Rio Lauca by Chile. There seems to be no dispute with respect to the alignment of the Bolivia-Chile boundary. Diplomatic relations between Bolivia and Chile have been broken since April 1962, with a shorter period of diplomatic relations in 1975 during the [[Pinochet]]–[[Banzer]] negotiations.

After five years of negotiation,  Bolivia sought a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] on the matter. On October 1, 2018, the ICJ ruled against Bolivia's claim that Chile was under a "legal obligation to negotiate a sovereign access" to the sea for Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Agence France-Presse |title=UN court rejects Bolivia's bid for sea access via Chile |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/01/un-court-rejects-bolivias-bid-sea-access-via-chile/ |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=The Telegraph |date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/30/landlocked-bolivia-pacific-sea-international-court-of-justice|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after [[German reunification]], the '''Commission of Inquiry for the Assessment of History and Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany''', which was a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|truth commission]] that lasted from 1992 to 1994, was established by the German government with the objective of looking at the history and the consequences of the former [[East Germany|East German]] communist government. It released its report in 1994, but some felt that more could be investigated. This resulted in the establishment of the '''Commission of Inquiry on Overcoming the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity''' lasting from 1995 to 1998, which had the same objective, but investigated more thoroughly.

Both commissions had to look at the dictatorship itself and the human rights violation under the rule of the East German [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED). The second commission, however, was more focused on the effects on everyday life than on the human rights violations.

The idea of a commission was brought up by the non-governmental organization [[Human Rights Watch]]. There were many issues over racism and human rights violation after the unification in 1989, and Human Rights Watch therefore recommended the creation of a commission that would look at human rights violations in the former East Germany. In the same year the first commission was created for "the purpose of truly unifying Germany"&lt;ref name="usip.org"&gt;United States Institute of Peace. "Truth Commission : Germany 92", p.216. Accessed March 3, 2016. http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Germany92-Charter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germany after World War II ==

{{Main|History of Germany (1945–90)}}

After World War II, Germany was divided in two parts, East Germany which was called the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and was led by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), and West Germany which was called the Federal Republic of Germany and was governed by the Western Allied powers (United States, United Kingdom, France).

=== East Germany ===

East Germany was a communist state under Soviet influence. The GDR claimed full employment. As Sue Lawson writes, "even the lowest earners could manage a reasonable, if modest, standard of living. Poverty, homelessness and dependence on benefits hardly existed." &lt;ref name="Lawson, Sue p.88"&gt;Lawson, Sue. "Social Provision." In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.88. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; East Germans did not worry about finding a job: "In the old GDR you were never unemployed." &lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Sue. "Social Provision." In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.91. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was demographic issue because of the low birth rate which caused employment issues, and for that reason the GDR decided to create laws that would help parents to have children and to work at the same time. There were advantages for people who married before age thirty. They had access to interest-free loans, and the repayment of the loan would diminish every time they had a child.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Sue. "Social Provision." In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.89. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an increase in childbirth and overall population. The status of women was valued in East Germany. Almost all women able to work could have a job at the same time as having children, though this did mean more work for many women in both employment and child care.&lt;ref name="Lawson, Sue p.90"&gt;Lawson, Sue. "Social Provision." In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.90. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, demands in the GDR for freedom of expression, travel and assembly rose.&lt;ref&gt;Peter James. Modern Germany. New York : Routledge, 1998, p. 6. Accessed February 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As East Germans started to see other Eastern European communist countries throwing off Soviet control, citizens started to protest and in 1989, the peaceful revolution started. In August 1989, many East Germans tried to leave the GDR for West Germany. In September 1989, many went to Hungary because it had opened its doors to Austria, and from Austria, they could reach West Germany. Weekly demonstrations began to take place: every Monday, people would protest in the street and ask for freedom under the slogan ''Wir sind das Volk'', "we are the people." In October, [[Erich Honecker]], the leader of East Germany, had no choice but to resign. On 9 November, cabinet member [[Günter Schabowski]] announced the "immediate freedom of travel for East German citizens".&lt;ref&gt;James, Peter. "Road to unity." In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.7. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; All these protests and demonstrations led to the unification of both Germanies on 3 October 1990.

=== West Germany ===

West Germany had a similar demographic problem to the one in the East, but implemented a different solution. Rather than attempting to increase birth rates, West Germany imported foreign "[[Foreign worker|guest workers]]." There was no attempt to further integrate women into the economic system. If a woman was a mother, she would work part-time or not at all. West Germany's priority was economic growth, rather than maternity and childcare, and for that reason people that were unemployed had to resort to [[Welfare|welfare benefits]].&lt;ref name="Lawson, Sue p.88"/&gt;

== After Unification ==

=== Economy ===

After the Unification, Germany realized that absorbing the GDR would be costly. East Germany was poorer than West Germany, putting strain on the finances of the new, unified government.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, David P., editor. Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5, p. 305. Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1991, the government was forced to increase taxes to stem the budget deficit.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Krieger, Joel, editor. The Oxford Companion to politics of the World, Second Edition. Oxford University Press, 2001. Accessed 3 March 2016. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195117394.001.0001/acref-9780195117394-e-0281?rskey=TMboDP&amp;result=2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unemployment]] in the East Germany became a major problem and differences were more visible because the West had a lower percent of unemployment than the East. The unification also affected Europe's economy, contributing to "a European currency crisis in 1992."  &lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

=== Women ===

Women seemed to be more affected by unification and the transition than men. In the old East Germany, some women had access to "unpaid child care leave until the child started school, and then return to a similar job." &lt;ref name="Lawson, Sue p.90"/&gt; Once both Germanies were unified, women lost these advantages.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Their economic situation was not as secure as before due to a shortage of jobs. Consequently, many women faced early retirement as they lost their former job security.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Rights Watch ==

In 1992, the organization [[Human Rights Watch]] sent a mission to Germany to analyze racism and human rights violations in the country following unification. The group suggested that Germany created a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate these current problems as well as East Germany's past. As a result the Commission of Inquiry for the Assessment of History and Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany was established in 1992 by the German government.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch/Helsinky. "Germany for Germans" Xenophobia and Racism Violence in Germany. United States of America: Human Rights Watch, 1995, p. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 1992 commission (Commission of Inquiry for the Assessment of History and Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany) ==

The commission was created on May 14, 1992 and released its report in June 1994. It was set up by members of the [[Bundestag|German Parliament]] in March 1992. In the early 1990s, all archives of the GDR as well as the SED were made available to scholars. When the commission began, the commissioners had access to all the records that could be found.

The commission had 27 members, led by the East German parliamentarian and human rights activist [[Rainer Eppelmann]]. Other members included [[Markus Meckel]], [[Gerd Poppe]], Dr. Dorothea Wils, Dirk Hansen, and Dr. Dietman Keller.

=== Why a commission? ===

Germany established a truth commission as a result of ongoing social tensions and problems affecting the country, in hopes that it would be a solution. Additionally, many Germans wanted answers about the SED dictatorship and the effects it had on "the possibilities of political and moral rehabilitation of the victims." &lt;ref&gt;United States Institute of Peace. "Truth Commission: Germany 92", p.216. Accessed March 3, 2016. http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Germany92-Charter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The German government and parliament also felt strongly about the commission, believing that it was essential to unify Germany.&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt; Instead of [[retributive justice]], the German Parliament opted for a focus on [[restorative justice]] because of ongoing social problems, aiming at non-violent reconciliation of those problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rössner, Dieter. "Mediation as a Basic Element of Crime Control: Theoretical and Empirical Comments", Buffalo Criminal Law Review, Vol. 3, No. 1 (April 1999): p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandate ===

The mandate had two main objectives. The first was to help the victims of the GDR and the SED. The second was about reconciliation. Germany needed to be reconciled with its past so it needed to develop a common political culture. To do so, the commission had to look at human rights violations. It had to examine every aspect of the dictatorship, how it functioned, what was its ideology and theology, what responsibilities it had for human rights violations, and what role it played in the destruction of the environment. The commission also had to investigate which groups were oppressed and to think about ways they could give restitution to these oppressed groups.&lt;ref&gt;United States Institute of Peace. "Truth Commission: Germany 92", p.217. Accessed March 3, 2016. http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Germany92-Charter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The commission needed to look at the opposition in East Germany and its actions, as well as the role of the Lutheran Church. The influences of "international framework conditions" (more precisely, Soviet politics), needed to be investigated, as did the relation between both Germanies.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's mandate included research covering the years from 1945 until 1989.

The commission also needed to include scholarly expertise, public hearings and forums, as well as discussion with citizens.

=== Recommendations ===

The commission's recommendations included: 
* the creation of national holidays, including the unification date (3 October) 
* documentary centers and a map of the governing buildings used by the SED so people would be aware of their past and could achieve reconciliation. The commission hoped that would also help to build a common political culture and shared historical knowledge to have a truly unified Germany
* the exchange of information with Eastern European countries
* a permanent foundation to implement the recommendations and try to help victims from the SED period.&lt;ref&gt;United States Institute of Peace. "Truth Commission : Germany 92." Accessed February 5, 2016. http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-germany-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conclusions ===

The most notable impact the first commission had was the establishment of a subsequent commission to further investigate matters that the first one had not addressed. Parliament opted to wait for the report of the second commission before taking any decisions on the recommendations of the first commission.

=== Criticism ===

"However, a great deal of criticism was voiced by victims of the GDR dictatorship that the support rendered by the state came late, was too limited, and did not cover all groups of victims." &lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, David P., editor. Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some victims that talked about victors' justice. For example, "At the universities, a comprehensive screening took place. Many professors and lecturers were dismissed on the basis of [[Stasi]] documents and other evidence showing that they had worked as informers for the Stasi or were SED members. There were number of protests by the accused and their supporters who felt that these dismissals were unjust and constituted revenge." &lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, David P., editor. Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Media also criticized without knowing the facts. The commission was accused of being useless because it did not change anything. It was also criticized for the length of the report, which totalled 18 volumes.

== The 1995 commission (Commission of Inquiry on Overcoming the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity) ==

The second commission ran from July 1995 to June 1998, and focused primarily on aspects of the mandate that had not been examined by the earlier commission. Rainer Eppelmann stayed on as chairman of the commission, but the number of commissioners increased to 36, who were later divided into 9 groups. All commissioners were chosen by the German parliament.

=== Mandate ===

The second commission followed the same mandate as the first, but focused more on aspects of everyday life under the SED dictatorship, such as discrimination against women, education and economic effects. The mandate also analyzed social effects, science and culture in East Germany as well as unified Germany, focusing on both past and present.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;United States Institute of Peace. "Truth Commission : Germany 95." Accessed February 5, 2016. http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-germany-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recommendations/Reparations and Aftermath ===

The recommendations from the second commission were essentially the same as the first , but also added the need to educate the people about their past. Discarding the call for this to be done through a  dedicated foundation, commissioners suggested that people could learn about their past in schools instead. They called again for a permanent and independent foundation that would follow up the recommendations, investigate the past, preserve the commission's archives, and  provide assistance to the victims of the SED.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:GedenkstätteBerlin-Hohenschönhausen Krankenhaus.jpg|thumb|Hohenschönhausen]]

As opposed to the first commission, this one convinced parliament and the government to create the independent foundation that would, in a sense, continue the work of both commissions. This foundation was called the "[[Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship|Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur]]" (Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship). It was created on 5 June 1998. There was also a memorial built in Berlin. Another foundation was created and named [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial|"Hohenschönhausen"]]. The mandate of this foundation was to investigate history and to educate the public about it. In 2007, there a law passed to give reparations to persons that were prisoners during the SED dictatorship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur helped creating the law to give reparation to the victims of the SED. They expanded the reparations to victims other than just political prisoners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">'''Turbary''' is the ancient right to cut [[peat|turf]], or peat, for fuel on a particular area of bog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ie/infoturbary.html Turbary - the Right to Cut Turf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209170644/http://www.ipcc.ie/infoturbary.html |date=2010-12-09 }}. Irish Peatland Conservation Council. Retrieved: 2010-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The word may also be used to describe the associated piece of bog or peatland and, by extension, the material extracted from the turbary.  Turbary rights, which are more fully expressed legally as ''common of turbary'', are often associated with [[Commons|commonage]], or, in some cases, rights over another person's land.

Turbary was not always an unpaid right ([[easement]]), but, at least in Ireland, regulations governed the price that could be charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1951/si/40/made/en/print|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turf was widely used as fuel for [[cooking]] and domestic heating but also for commercial purposes such as evaporating [[brine]] to produce [[Edible salt|salt]]. The right to take peat was particularly important in areas where [[firewood]] was scarce. The right to collect firewood was protected by [[estovers]].

In the [[New Forest]] of southern England, a particular right of turbary belongs not to an individual person, dwelling or plot of land, but to a particular [[hearth]] and [[chimney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newforest.hampshire.org.uk/today1.html|title=New Forest commons rights|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013015258/http://newforest.hampshire.org.uk/today1.html|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
In more recent times, as the  ecological significance of the bog lands has been better understood, and as the amount of remaining peat has been decreasing, partly due to fuel usage and partly due to usage of peat as fertiliser, as well as agricultural incursions into drained bog lands, some of the remaining bogs have come under environmental protection.  This has created controversy over the rights of turbary, and in some cases extinguished the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politico.ie/politics/stop-digging-issue-raised-bogs|title=Stop digging on issue of raised bogs - Politico|website=politico.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Geographic regions of turbary works in Europe include the [[Netherlands]], Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and [[The Broads]] in [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], England, and the [[Marais Audomarois|Audomarois marshlands]] near [[Saint-Omer]], [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theotherside.co.uk/tm-heritage/visit/visit-stomer-audomarois.htm|title=Audomarois marshlands nr.Saint-Omer|website=www.theotherside.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationforcommonland.org.uk/rights-of-common|title=Rights of Common - Foundation for Common Land|website=www.foundationforcommonland.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is also used in colloquial language by older generations in  Ireland, in places such as [[County Clare]], to refer to the area where turf is cut, or to the material extracted.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from Anglo-French ''turberie'' and Low German, ''turf''. Compare Sanskrit ''darbhá'', meaning tuft of grass.&lt;ref&gt;Entries for ''turbary'' and ''turf''. ''The Oxford English Dictionary,'' Second Edition. Clarendon Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-19-861186-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turnkey''' or a '''turnkey project''' (also spelled '''turn-key''') is a type of project that is constructed so that it can be sold to any buyer as a completed product. This is contrasted with [[build to order]], where the constructor builds an item to the buyer's exact specifications, or when an incomplete product is sold with the assumption that the buyer would complete it.

A turnkey project or contract as described by Duncan Wallace (1984) is:&lt;ref name=wallace&gt;{{cite conference |title=Contracts for Industrial Project |last1=Wallace |first1=Duncan |year=1984 |book-title= |pages=3 |location=Kuala Lumpur |conference=Building and Civil Engineering Claims }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|…. a contract where the essential design emanates from, or is supplied by, the Contractor and not the owner, so that the legal responsibility for the design, suitability and performance of the work after completion will be made to rest … with the contractor …. 'Turnkey' is treated as merely signifying the design responsibility as the contractor's.}}

A turnkey computer system is a complete computer including hardware, operating system and application(s) designed and sold to satisfy specific business requirements.

==Common usage==

'''Turnkey'''  refers to something that is ready for immediate use, generally used in the sale or supply of goods or services. The word is a reference to the fact that the customer, upon receiving the product, just needs to turn the ignition key to make it operational, or that the key just needs to be turned over to the customer.&lt;ref name=rics&gt;{{cite web|title=RICS draft guidance note - Comparative construction and engineering contracts": 1.3.5 The 'turnkey' approach|url=https://consultations.rics.org/consult.ti/comparative.construction/view?objectId=2425300|website=RICS Consult|publisher=RICS Consult|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnkey is often used to describe a home built on the developer's land with the developer's financing ready for the customer to move in. If a contractor builds a "turnkey home" they frame the structure and finish the interior. Everything is completed down to the cabinets and carpet. "Turnkey" is commonly used in the construction industry, for instance, in which it refers to the bundling of materials and labour by Home Builder or General Contractor to move into the home without owner involvement. 'Turnkey' is also commonly used in [[motorsports]] to describe a car being sold with [[Powertrain|drivetrain]] (engine, transmission, etc.) to contrast with a vehicle sold without one so that other components may be re-used.

Similarly, this term may be used to advertise the sale of an established business, including all the equipment necessary to run it, or by a business-to-business supplier providing complete packages for business start-up.&lt;ref name=rics/&gt; An example would be the creation of a "turnkey hospital" which would be building a complete medical centre with installed medical equipment.

==Specific usage==

The term turnkey is also often used in the technology industry, most commonly to describe pre-built computer "packages" in which everything needed to perform a certain type of task (e.g. audio editing) is put together by the supplier and sold as a bundle.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This often includes a computer with pre-installed software, various types of hardware, and accessories. Such packages are commonly called [[computer appliance|appliances]]. A website with a ready-made solutions and some configurations is called a turnkey website.

In real estate, '''turnkey''' is defined as a home or property that is ready for occupation for its intended purpose, ie., a home that is fully functional, needs no upgrading or repairs (move-in ready).  In commercial use, a building set up to do auto repairs would be defined as turnkey if it came fully stocked with all needed machinery and tools for that particular trade.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The turnkey process includes all of the steps involved to open a location including the site selection, negotiations, space planning, construction coordination and complete installation. '''Turnkey''' real estate also refers to a type of [[investment]]. This process includes the purchase, construction or rehab (of an existing site), the leasing out to tenants, and then the sale of the property to a buyer. The buyer is purchasing an investment property which is producing a stream of income.

In [[oil well|drilling]], the term indicates an arrangement where a contractor must fully complete a well up to some milestone to receive any payment (in exchange for greater compensation upon completion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=turnkey|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/t/turnkey.aspx|website=Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of modern immigration controls in 1905, foreign nationals evading immigration control or committing crimes were regarded as a police matter and those people arrested were put before the courts whereupon they would be prosecuted and go through the deportation process. The '''United Kingdom Immigration Service's enforcement''' arm evolved gradually from the early 1970s onwards to meet demand from police for assistance in dealing with foreign national offenders and suspected immigration offenders within the UK. The wider history of UK immigration control is dealt with under [[UK immigration control - history]].

== Immigration enforcement within the UK from 1962==

=== 1962–1973 Limitations of in-country enforcement ===
The [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]] placed new restrictions on [[British Commonwealth]] citizens entering the UK and was seen as severe at the time. While it allowed conditions to be imposed on those previously allowed free entry it provided no powers concerning those who evaded the border controls altogether.
 
""A person shall not be required to submit to examination ... after the expiration of the period of twenty-four hours from the time when he lands in the United Kingdom. …" (Para 2 Sch1, Commonwealth Citizens Act 1962).

This was partially addressed by the 1968 Act after which Commonwealth citizens were  required by law to submit to immigration control on arrival. However, for those that evaded the border controls, the law stipulated that there were only 28 days in which to apprehend them. In the event of their being captured the person was awarded an in-country right of appeal that would mean they could not immediately be removed.

The 1971 Act removed the 28-day limit and created a right of appeal that could only be exercised from abroad. It also attempted to define the concept of illegal entry but it was only by testing the law through various judgements and challenges that the principle was established that someone arriving illegally did not have to go through the judicial process and deportation consideration, they could be "administratively" removed on the direction of an immigration officer acting on the authority of the Secretary of State. The evidence of the need for new powers was provided in a parliamentary question from 1972 which gave the bald facts that 13 people had been successfully prosecuted in the previous 12 months for facilitating illegal entry and 10 people had been treated as illegal entrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1972/may/11/immigrants-illegal-entry#S5CV0836P0_19720511_CWA_65|title=Immigrants (Illegal Entry) (Hansard, 11 May 1972)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of the [[Immigration Act 1971]], action to detect immigration offenders in the community was still considered a police matter and largely limited to the detection of seamen deserters, absconders from ports or those who were the subject of deportation orders. The powers in the 1971 Act focussed on the offences of overstaying and assumed that those who did so would be prosecuted and deported. Although it defined what an illegal entrant was, it did not provide sufficient clarity as to how the law should be applied. The concept of illegal entry as laid out in the 1971 Act did not extend to those who simply presented false documents or deceived the immigration officer on arrival about what they were going to do. It was only by establishing legal [[precedent]] through judgments’ that a consistent set of powers emerged.

=== 1973–1985 formation of enforcement teams ===
Control of immigration in the UK was, until the 1980s almost exclusively focussed on border control. The law regarding the treatment of immigration offenders within the UK was unclear and would not start being resolved until the mid-1970s.  Efforts made to extend controls at the border contrasted sharply with the lack of powers to deal with those who evaded them. The Labour government of 1974-79 maintained a policy of opposing internal immigration controls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1976/apr/08/illegal-immigrants#S5CV0909P0_19760408_HOC_80|title=Illegal Immigrants (Hansard, 8 April 1976)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of putting more resource into the border control and visa offices abroad.

The police who dealt with foreign nationals acted according to whether the person had been posted "wanted" or not and were reliant on Home Office records of who had overstayed. The police set up their own Immigration Intelligence Unit in October 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/jan/31/police-drugs-and-illegal-immigration#S5CV0849P0_19730131_HOC_396|title=POLICE (DRUGS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION) (Hansard, 31 January 1973)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1976/aug/04/national-immigration-intelligence-unit#S5CV0916P2_19760804_CWA_42|title=National Immigration Intelligence Unit (Hansard, 4 August 1976)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1980/jun/30/illegal-immigration-police-manpower#S5LV0411P0_19800630_LWA_7|title=ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: POLICE MANPOWER (Hansard, 30 June 1980)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Act prosecutions recorded at the time are then police prosecutions rather than Immigration Service ones. The police enjoyed some success in this work but a clear need emerged for the Immigration Service and police to cooperate and immigration enforcement offices evolved in the early 1970s to meet this need.

After the new Act came into force in 1973 more effort was directed to the detection and removal of illegal entrants. The Act was based on a concept of illegal entry which assumed illegal entry via clandestine landings. This had some basis in fact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1969/apr/22/immigrants-and-illegal-entry#S5LV0301P0_19690422_HOL_42|house=House of Lords|date=22 April 1969|column_start=372|column_end=374|title=IMMIGRANTS AND ILLEGAL ENTRY}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the incentive within the 1962 Act to enter this way but even with the new laws it was a slow start; the total number of illegal entrants, overstayers and seamen deserters detected and removed in 1973 was reported as 44 but, in 1977, when answering a question on the numbers of deportees in 1973 the minister stated that 147 had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/mar/23/deportation#S5CV0928P0_19770323_CWA_31|title=Deportation (Hansard, 23 March 1977)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early immigration enforcement statistics are difficult to interpret as the terms "illegal entrant" and "illegal migrant" seem to have been used interchangeably and, at various times, encompassed overstayers, deportees AND illegal entrants which are all different types of offender in later reports. The lack of a cohesive enforcement structure must have played a part in this confusion but, overall, the numbers of enforced removals were very small.

Enforcement work was carried out by Immigration Officers who were otherwise normally engaged on passport controls at ports. In London, the main enforcement offices were based at Harmondsworth near Heathrow and at Adelaide House, London Bridge. Duties at the Port of London included, for instance, dealing with passengers and crew, interviewing foreign criminals in London prisons, attending court and a range of visits to private addresses to talk to people about their status or circumstances. Later in the 1970s  Immigration Officers were diverted to interview people in relation to their applications made under the amnesties of the time.

The other main London enforcement unit, based at Harmondsworth near Heathrow Airport, was the Immigration Service Intelligence Unit which, by 1976, had 29 officers, responsible for managing the Immigration Service Intelligence database&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1983/mar/16/computers-use-in-immigration-control#S5LV0440P0_19830316_LWA_4|title=COMPUTERS: USE IN IMMIGRATION CONTROL (Hansard, 16 March 1983)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a remit of assisting the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/apr/06/immigration-service-intelligence-unit#S5LV0390P0_19780406_LWA_1|title=IMMIGRATION SERVICE INTELLIGENCE UNIT (Hansard, 6 April 1978)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 major operations were possible and were being mounted with particular emphasis on the hotel and restaurant trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1980/oct/28/policeimmigration-service-operations#S5LV0414P0_19801028_LWA_2|title=POLICE/IMMIGRATION SERVICE OPERATIONS (Hansard, 28 October 1980)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1985–1993 growth, specialisation and PACE ===
Enforcement work became increasingly diverse and relatively more sophisticated during the 1980s. The London offices developed specialist teams targeting foreign vice trade workers, marriage fraud and West Indian gang crime. The central London office worked closely with police to play a key role in the detention and removal of a number of high profile "[[Yardie]]s" and other criminals associated with Jamaican drug crime. Combatting bogus colleges, (already noted above), was also an ongoing theme in enforcement work with some particular successes, including the closure of the "Advanced College of Business and Cultural Studies" where 63 people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1988/jun/07/colleges-immigration-rules#S6CV0134P0_19880607_CWA_81|title=Colleges (Immigration Rules) (Hansard, 7 June 1988)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another regular source of work was the "marriage visit" to a home address to test whether the  relationship was a [[Sham marriage]]. Marriage abuse was, and is, an embedded feature of immigration enforcement work and the Enforcement Directorate sought to combat it directly by allowing specialist teams to develop. "Operation Goldring" was a long running exercise operated by a central London unit at Isis House in the late 1980s early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/feb/26/immigration#S6CV0168P0_19900226_CWA_196|title=Immigration (Hansard, 26 February 1990)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the Immigration Service was split to form separate Ports and Enforcement Directorates. The split did not immediately solve the issue of those "hybrid" ports which dealt with both areas of work.By later standards enforcement immigration officers were severely constrained. Lack of radio or telephone communications meant that they were heavily reliant on police support. Although immigration officers were conferred powers of arrest under the 1971 Act they did not use these as a matter of policy and they were reliant of police officers and police facilities to perform their duties. When conducting pro-active investigations to private addresses immigration officers would take the lead in identifying immigration offenders and ask police to execute the arrest on their behalf.

Those offenders thus detected would be interviewed at a police station under caution. A large proportion of available resource was dedicated to responding to police requests for assistance. By 1989 the two main London offices at Isis House and ISIU Harmondsworth were responding to thousands of calls per year. The central London identified 1,402 offenders as a result of police call-outs in 1989 and ISIU 1,230.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/feb/26/immigration#S6CV0168P0_19900226_CWA_190|title=Immigration (Hansard, 26 February 1990)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 when a Jamaican woman [[Joy Gardner]] resisted having a deportation order enforced by an immigration officer and police in London, she died of suffocation after being gagged and having her head wrapped with tape. The incident and its subsequent investigation halted most pro-active immigration enforcement for a substantial period and was the cause of a reappraisal by police of their role in immigration enforcement which had far-reaching implications. The [[Metropolitan Police]], and other forces, were concerned at the potential damage done to community trust and confidence. The police insisted on new safeguards and processes to better communicate the nature of joint operations and assess risks. Although police assistance continued to be the norm it was the beginning of a shift towards greater self-reliance by immigration enforcement.

In the 1990s there was a rapid increase in the numbers of immigration offenders claiming asylum shortly after arrest. Senior police officers expressed concern at the escalating use of police stations as places where immigration offenders were required to report having been released.

In 1993 asylum seekers were given the right of appeal before removal as part of the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Act 1993. The numbers of asylum applications began to rise.  In 1993, 120 immigration officers undertook the  enforcement work for the whole of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/mar/17/immigration-officers#S6CV0221P0_19930317_CWA_61|title=Immigration Officers (Hansard, 17 March 1993)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that to create an effective in-country control would require a raft of new legislation and a vast expansion of detention facilities and enforcement immigration officers.  In 1992 Home Secretary, [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] ruled out wider internal immigration controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1992/mar/02/asylum-and-immigration#S6CV0205P0_19920302_HOC_165|title=Asylum and Immigration (Hansard, 2 March 1992)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994–1997 in-country asylum claims and focus on illegal working ===
The exact numbers claiming asylum when detected were not recorded, but the numbers who had to be released after detection rather than removed from the UK are available. Between 1994 and 1996 there is shown a rising trend in detection of illegal entrants but the numbers released on Temporary Admission increased steadily. People without legal qualification could function as immigration legal advisors; [[legal aid]] was available for immigration cases. Legal aid costs rose dramatically between 1988 and 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1991/jul/09/immigration#S6CV0194P0_19910709_CWA_2|title=Immigration (Hansard, 9 July 1991)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/jul/27/legal-aid#S6CV0229P0_19930727_CWA_20|title=Legal Aid (Hansard, 27 July 1993)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the numbers of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1998/jul/23/immigration-and-asylum#S6CV0316P0_19980723_CWA_80|title=Immigration and Asylum (Hansard, 23 July 1998)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/mar/29/immigration-appeals#S6CV0328P0_19990329_CWA_522|title=Immigration (Appeals) (Hansard, 29 March 1999)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997 25% of all judicial reviews lodged were related to immigration cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/mar/29/immigration-appeals#S6CV0328P0_19990329_CWA_522|title=Immigration (Appeals) (Hansard, 29 March 1999)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing numbers of those detected were found working illegally, 10,000 in 1994 as opposed to fewer than 4,000 in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1995/dec/11/asylum-and-immigration-bill#S6CV0268P0_19951211_HOC_204|title=Asylum and Immigration Bill (Hansard, 11 December 1995)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1997 it was illegal to undertake paid work only if employment was prohibited as a condition of entry; people who had entered illegally were not subject to this restriction, although they would if detected be arrested as illegal entrants. There was no sanction on employers employing an illegal entrant.

=== 1997–2001 employer sanctions - impact of reorganisation ===
Section 8 of the Asylum Act of 1996 made it an offence to employ an illegal worker, with a potential fine of £5,000. Very few employers prosecuted were prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2004/jan/06/immigration-offences-employers#S6CV0416P2_20040106_CWA_514|title=Immigration Offences (Employers) (Hansard, 6 January 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of a Home Office IT project in 1999 had the effect of stopping the essential casework machinery that supported enforced removals. As part of the general restructuring that the crisis provoked the Immigration Service was again divided into two different management structures. The previous Ports Directorate and Enforcement Directorate were done away with and the service was partially regionalised under the command of "Immigration Service Regional Operations" and "Immigration Service SE Operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap59.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs - Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IND in Croydon, which had built up long-standing processes to liaise with prisons, courts and the Immigration Service in arranging the deportation of those who had been recommended for deportation by courts or whose removal was "conducive to the public good". However, by 1999 the processes for dealing with foreign criminals held within UK prisons awaiting deportation were under pressure. 
For enforcement offices, casework backlogs increased. By 2000 tentative steps were being taken to re-establish processes that had been removed. Despite the crisis within asylum casework, changes included modernisation and the continuation of vital longer term strategic planning including the development of professional management skills and project management, the development of prosecutions capability, joint working with other agencies, the growth in numbers and prosecutions capability for arrest trained officers, (including use of the new powers contained in the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] which allowed the confiscation of the criminal assets of traffickers, among others).  The development of better IT systems continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2002/jul/18/information-database#S6CV0389P2_20020718_CWA_737|title=Information Database (Hansard, 18 July 2002)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither did the hiatus stop the increasingly useful liaison work with police in combating organised crime. The disruption of West Indian organised or semi-organised crime continued to be a theme of immigration enforcement work with particular success in the early 2000s in dealing with [[Yardies]]. Immigration enforcement forged a close partnership with police and played an important role in the ongoing operation to combat black-on-black crime, [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]] which started in 1998.

=== 2001–2004 - development of arrest and prosecutions capability ===
New efforts to increase enforcement resources had yet to kick in and the mechanisms to support the casework in difficult removal cases was still being re-established. Despite this there were signs of progress. An additional London office had been established in Croydon and removals of immigration offenders showed a marginal increase. An ambitious plan unfolded following the commitments made as part of the 1999 legislation. In 2000 a pilot in London established the Immigration Service’s first arrest team which was set up trained and equipped to operate independently of the police. By the end of the pilot three London Arrest Teams had been established and had conducted 413 operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2001/oct/30/immigration-snatch-squads#S6CV0373P0_20011030_CWA_310|title=Immigration Snatch Squads (Hansard, 30 October 2001)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 report the Home Affairs Select Committee welcomed a commitment to increase enforcement staff but was sceptical regarding the ambitious target for enforced removals. The numbers of enforcement staff had risen from 1,677 in 2002 to 2,463 in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2004/may/18/asylum-and-immigration-treatment-of#S5LV0661P0_20040518_HOL_158|title=Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill (Hansard, 18 May 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reorganisation of enforcement resulted in the setting up of a number of "co-located" offices. These were enforcement units that drew in a support network of mainstream IND caseworkers whose role was to deal with "barrier" casework, i.e.: the vital casework to deal with late applications to stay in the UK, Judicial Reviews and appeals which were part and parcel of the legal hurdles placed by legal advisors seeking to block someones removal. The results of the co-locations were disappointing but the principle was one that stuck and evolved later in the development of regionalisation and the setting up of Local Immigration Teams.

==== Developing Enforcement Capabilities project ====
The "Developing Enforcement Capabilities" project grew in size, scope and importance between 2000–2004 and transformed the Immigration Service enforcement arm into a law enforcement agency. The establishment of the arrest teams went hand in hand with a new system of tasking based on a National Intelligence Model to make best use of information and ensure that the work was better tied to national targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2002/feb/25/illegal-immigrants-and-overstayers#S6CV0380P0_20020225_CWA_1171|title=Illegal Immigrants and Overstayers (Hansard, 25 February 2002)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003 there were forty new Intelligence Units in operation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/775awe17.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs - Additional Written Evidence|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the level and standard of training for operational staff had been greatly enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2002/jun/12/immigration-service#S6CV0386P2_20020612_CWA_320|title=Immigration Service (Hansard, 12 June 2002)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over and above the formation of the arrest teams whose remit was the detection of immigration offenders, was the establishment, in January 2002, of an Immigration Crime Team to tackle organised immigration related crime such as identity fraud, forgery and trafficking. Early successes included the arrest of 29 persons connected with British passport fraud and the arrest of two men for the manufacture and supply of forged British passports one of whom received a five-year sentence and the other 18 months. The operation resulted in one of the largest ever seizures of high quality forged passports believed to have a street value of over £2 million.

The ICT operated as part of Reflex, the Government's inter-agency task force created to combat organised immigration crime. Immigration enforcement also contributed to a joint intelligence unit under Operation Maxim involving the Immigration Service and [[UK Passport Service]] (UKPS) with a remit to investigate identity fraud alongside related criminality. In 2001 the numbers of fraudulent British passport applications detected was 161. In 2002 it was 1360.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2003/nov/13/passports#S6CV0413P2_20031113_CWA_164|title=Passports (Hansard, 13 November 2003)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICT also contributed to Operation Wisdom, targeting individuals who obtained passports using the identities of dead children which was co-ordinated by the National Crime Squad and involved 18 UK police forces and the Immigration Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2003/dec/19/identity-fraud#S6CV0416P2_20031219_CWA_69|title=Identity Fraud (Hansard, 19 December 2003)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003-04 ICT made 115 arrests related to organised crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2005/mar/14/serious-organised-crime-and-police-bill#S5LV0670P0_20050314_HOL_65|title=Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill (Hansard, 14 March 2005)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cockle-pickers tragedy - gangmaster licensing ====
In February 2004 at least 23 Chinese nationals were drowned in an horrific [[2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster|disaster at Morecambe Bay]], Lancashire when cut off by tides while cockling – digging for cockles. This tragedy, and crime, was the result of a number of factors; the fact that the people had been trafficked by [[Snakehead (gang)|"Snakeheads"]] and then used for illegal labour by a Gangmaster who had no regard for their safety, (and who was subsequently jailed).

In the subsequent investigation and enquiry there was much confusion as to whether the Immigration Service had been aware of the illegal workers at Morecambe bay and might have prevented their exploitation and deaths. This confusion was embarrassing and highlighted the lack of management information systems to record the nature of operations conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2004/mar/04/morecambe-bay#S6CV0418P1_20040304_HOC_325|title=Morecambe Bay (Hansard, 4 March 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operational side of IND had been largely left out of the IT development that took place after the failure of the Casework Programme and the tragedy was the cause of a review of systems and processes and quickly led to the introduction, in April 2005, of a new National Operations Database, (NOD), developed by enforcement staff themselves, to better manage and record operational activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-02-11b.246240.h|title=Illegal Immigrants: Employment: 11 Feb 2009: Hansard Written Answers - TheyWorkForYou|website=TheyWorkForYou|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSS"&gt;Hansard source (Citation: HC Deb, 11 February 2009, c2045W&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morecambe Bay disaster highlighted facts that were already well known, that large numbers of illegal workers were being exploited, and was a key element leading to the passing of the [[Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004]] and the creation of the [[Gangmasters Licensing Authority]].

==== Growth in marriage abuse ====
The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 required registrars of civil marriages to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Secretary. Unfortunately it did not contain any power to carry out investigations into the genuineness of an intended marriage or to delay or refuse to conduct the marriage.
By the early 2000s the numbers of suspect marriages being reported by registrars rose alarmingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2004/jun/22/sham-marriages#S6CV0422P2_20040622_CWA_466|title=Sham Marriages (Hansard, 22 June 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to registrars' concerns and media coverage of the issue, the Government established a "Bogus Marriage Task Force" in 2004 which included representatives from the Immigration Service, local government, the registration service and IND policy officials. This proposed a new scheme to govern marriages where one or both parties were subject to immigration control and did not have entry clearance as a spouse or fiancé(e). The scheme was enacted in section 19 of the [[Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004]] and came into force on 1 February 2005.
An exemption for Church of England marriages was to be part of the legislation's downfall but, when the new provisions came into force, the [[London Borough of Brent]] experienced a drop of 50% in the overall number of marriages taking place. The numbers of reports from all registrars of suspicious marriages dropped from 3,740 in 2004 to fewer than 200 between February 2005 and March 2006.

In 2003/04, in the London area alone, there were 114 people arrested in connection with taking part in or arranging sham marriages. These operations were led, and co-ordinated by Officers from the London Command Crime Group who were solely responsible for the disruption of illegal marriages in the London and South East area. Of these 43 people were charged and given custodial sentences of up to 18 months. The offences ranged from: Conspiracy to commit perjury; Facilitation offences under the Immigration Act 1971; Bigamy offences under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and Forgery and Counterfeiting offences. During 2004-05, 100 people were arrested of whom 59 were charged and received sentences from three months to nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/775awe20.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs - Additional Written Evidence|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new laws was challenged by The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants,(JCWI), who argued that the new requirements were in breach of the right to marry  contained in Article 12 of [[European Convention of Human Rights]]; a "disproportionate and ineffective response to the alleged problem of 'sham' marriages"; and potentially discriminatory on faith grounds.

==== Focus on illegal workers and employers ====
The growth in enforcement resources, the increase in removals and the focus on illegal workers are all illustrated by the rise in illegal working operations between 2004 and 2006. In 2004 there were 1,600 enforcement operations against illegal workers, a 360% increase on the previous year, which detected 3,330 people working illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm64/6472/6472.pdf|title=Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain - Five year strategy for asylum and immigration|last=Home Office|first=|date=February 2005|website=|publisher=|isbn=0-10-164722-0|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parliamentary reply in 2009 the Home Secretary reported that, in 2005/06, there had been 2915 operations targeting illegal workers which resulted in 3819 arrests. By 2007/08 this had risen to 7178 operations and 5589 arrests.&lt;ref name="HSS"/&gt;

The failure of the 1999 Act to impose fines on employers for using illegal workers was now addressed by the [[Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006]] which created a new [[Civil penalty]] for employers who hired illegal workers,(Section 15), and separate criminal offence of knowingly employing an illegal worker, (Section 21). The rules imposed much stricter rules than the 1999 legislation as to the level of evidence that employers needed to keep regarding proof of employment rights and carried a potential £10,000 fine for each illegal employee. The Act came into force on 29 February 2008.

=== Foreign national prisoners crisis ===

==== Background and context ====
In April 1996, the total percentage of prisoners who were foreign nationals had reached 7.8%. By 1999 it was 8.1%, 2002, 10% and in 2003, 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2004/may/24/prisons-foreign-nationals#S5LV0661P0_20040524_HOL_292|title=Prisons: Foreign Nationals (Hansard, 24 May 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These percentages have to be seen in the context of a rising prison population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2002/may/15/prison-overcrowding#S5LV0635P0_20020515_HOL_60|title=Prison Overcrowding (Hansard, 15 May 2002)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, the foreign prisoner population had peaked at 14% and, at the time of writing in 2011, the figure has dropped slightly to 12.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/resourcecentre/publicationsdocuments/index.asp?cat=85|title=HM Prison Service - Publications &amp; Documents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113144232/http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/resourcecentre/publicationsdocuments/index.asp?cat=85|archive-date=13 November 2010|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN04334.pdf|title=Prison Population Statistics|last=Allen|first=Grahame|last2=Dempsey|first2=Noel|date=4 July 2016|website=|series=BRIEFING PAPER Number SN/SG/04334|publisher=House of Commons Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The criminal deportation process is different from that action taken against illegal entrants and is based on some of the oldest immigration legislation. It is a process for dealing with those who have broken the criminal law and, before Court Recommended deportation was discontinued, could be thought of as falling into two main areas:
* Deportation recommended by a court as part of a persons sentence,
* Deportation decided on by the Secretary of State on the basis that the persons presence was "not conducive to the public good".

Court recommendations for deportation meant that the person had a right of appeal against this part of the sentence that might have to be disposed of before any further action could be taken. If the court did not recommend deportation it was still possible for deportation to be taken on "conducive" grounds, (see above). Whatever route was chosen full consideration had to be given of the persons other circumstances - such as family ties and length of residence.

Tracking the prisoner through the criminal justice system was a difficult task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070611/debtext/70611-0001.htm#0706113000027|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 11 Jun 2007  (pt 0001)|last=Westminster|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well established system was dismantled in 1999 during the failed IT project noted earlier. This instability coincided not only with a steep rise in the numbers of foreign prisoners as described above, but also with the growth of asylum applications. All available IND resources were diverted to deal with the asylum backlog and the Criminal Casework Team that was gradually re-formed after the Casework Programme crisis, was left under staffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/77513.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs - Fifth Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional factor, which proved fatal, was the lack of centrally available data on either the numbers of prisoners or the stage their case had reached. The development of IT systems within IND focussed almost entirely on asylum. The Case Information Database, (CID), which was hurriedly rolled out in the wake of the Casework Programme failure did not cater properly for either deportation or other casework relating to immigration offenders and prosecutions. Within a very short time of its development the organisation was dependent on CID for its management information but, because of its limitations, IND’s senior managers were left unsighted to the full implications of the rise in the numbers of foreign criminals.

==== Impact and aftermath ====
On 14 July 2005, the National Audit Office published a report concerning the removal of asylum seekers.It reported that;

:"The Criminal Casework Team did not have figures available on how many failed applicants had been released from prison because removal could not be arranged".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nao.org.uk/report/returning-failed-asylum-applicants/|title=Returning Failed Asylum Applicants|last=|first=|date=|website=National Audit Office|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This triggered a chain of events which involved the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] asking for further clarification. IND had difficulty answering the questions relating to the numbers involved and had to revise the figure upwards on more than one occasion, which undermined its credibility. It emerged, by April 2006, that 1023 foreign prisoners had been released at the end of their sentence between 1999 and 2006 without deportation consideration having been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4945922.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} How the deportation story emerged|last=|first=|date=9 October 2006|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May, it was confirmed that 880 of the cases had been considered for deportation but it was too little too late and the Home Secretary [[Charles Clarke]] resigned. On 23 May 2006 the new Home Secretary [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] stated to the Home Affairs Committee:

:"I believe that… in the wake of the problems of mass migration that we have been facing our system is not fit for purpose. It is inadequate in terms of its scope; it is inadequate in terms of its information technology, leadership, management, systems and processes; and we have tried to cope with this new age, if you like, with a system that has been inherited from an age that came before it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP07-11/RP07-11.pdf|title=The UK Borders Bill: Bill 53 of 2006-07|last=Thorp|first=Arabella|date=31 January 2007|website=|series=RESEARCH PAPER 07/11|publisher=House of Commons Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the aftermath of the scandal the trigger point at which foreign nationals would be considered for deportation was reduced from two years imprisonment to twelve months and plans were put in place to introduce "automatic deportation".
Following an investigation into the background to the problem the Enforcement &amp; Removals Directorate was broken up for the second time in seven years and its resources distributed among a network of new regional Local Immigration Teams. Its central management support functions were disbanded.

== Immigration offences and types of enforcement action ==
Most people removed or deported from within the UK are not convicted criminals but immigration offenders; those who have for instance overstayed their visa or have been found to have entered the country illegally. These are not usually deported but made subject to [[administrative removal]] under powers found within Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and Schedule 2 of the [[Immigration Act 1971]]. Where a person is removed from the UK, they can still make an application to return to the UK, but under new immigration rules introduced in October 2008, a person who has been removed from the UK may not apply for a visa for a period of 1,5 or 10 years, depending on whether they voluntarily left or were removed.

=== Deportation ===
[[Deportation]] is the lawful expulsion of an undesirable alien, usually following a criminal conviction but also in cases where there are grounds "conducive to the public good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/enforcement/oemsectionb/chapter12?view=Binary|title=Enforcement Instructions and Guidance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204060655/http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/enforcement/oemsectionb/chapter12?view=Binary|archive-date=4 December 2008|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 5 of the Immigration Act 1971—provides the power for the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] to make or revoke a deportation order (DO). This requires a person to leave the UK and prohibits them from re-entering the UK unless it is revoked. Any leave to enter or remain which a person gains is invalid whilst a DO is outstanding against them. There is no expiry date to a DO. A person who enters the UK in breach of a DO is an illegal entrant (see below) and may be removed as such.
Deportation Orders were once always signed by the Home Secretary but are now more commonly signed by a senior official. They place a bar on return to the UK for lengths of time which vary according to the severity of the offence. Deportation Orders stay in force until revoked.

Section 32 of the [[UK Borders Act 2007]] places a duty on the Secretary of State to  make a deportation order in respect of a person who is not a British citizen who has been convicted in the UK of an offence and sentenced to either: 
* a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months; or
* a period of imprisonment of any duration for a particularly serious offence.
This duty applies to all foreign criminals except where they fall within one of the exceptions in section 33. Where an exception does apply, deportation may still be pursued.

Section 33 of the Act details those who are exempt from the provisions of automatic deportation. There are certain exemptions: 
* where an individual raises a claim for Asylum and Human Rights.
*where the foreign criminal was under the age of 18 on the date of conviction the individual will be exempt from automatic deportation.
* where the foreign criminal is an EEA citizen or immediate family member of an EEA citizen.
* subject to extradition, Mental Health Provisions or a recognised victim of trafficking.

=== Illegal entry ===
Illegal entrants fall into a number of types:
* Clandestine - those who have entered the country by evading the controls, e.g.: hidden in a vehicle, and there is no evidence of lawful entry. This category will be unable to provide any evidence of their entry to the United Kingdom. However, absence of a passport is not in itself sufficient grounds for dealing with a person as an illegal entrant. Full checks must be made to establish the person's identity and method of entry as far as possible.
* Deception - those who have entered by verbal or documentary deception, e.g.: by falsifying their account when applying for a visa or for leave to enter. It is an offence under section 24A of the Immigration Act 1971 to obtain or seek to obtain leave to enter or remain by deception. This can be either verbal or documentary deception. A person can be an illegal entrant if a third party has secured their entry by deception, even if they were unaware of it. If a person seeks entry to the UK as a visitor when their true intention is to claim asylum, then they are an illegal entrant as, had the immigration officer known the facts, he would not have granted leave as a visitor.
* Seamen deserters - Crew members, both sea-crews and air-crews are subject to different immigration rules and procedures to normal arrivals. When ships dock in the United Kingdom, it may be that crewmembers "jump" ship, without permission. Seaman deserters may not have a passport but rather hold a [[Seaman's Book]], a national identity document issued to professional seamen that contains a record of their rank and service career.

Those absconding from port arrival areas are also technically illegally entrants but, when detected, may be dealt with under port arrival procedures for administrative convenience. Those returning to the UK in breach of an existing deportation order are also treated as illegal entrants.

The powers to remove illegal entrants are found in paragraphs 9 or 10 of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. These enable an Immigration Officer to give any directions for removal as are authorised in paragraph 8 of schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.

A series of court judgements in the late 1970s and early 1980s clarified some aspects of the law regarding illegal entry. The definition of what constituted illegal entry was gradually extended to include entry by deception. These included the Zamir judgement, which concerned a person who obtained a visa to join his father as his dependant while omitting to mention that he was married. The judgement  held that people applying to come to the UK had a "duty of candour" to reveal any factors relevant to their stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1980/nov/12/catering-industry-foreign-workers#S5CV0992P0_19801112_HOC_547|title=CATERING INDUSTRY (FOREIGN WORKERS) (Hansard, 12 November 1980)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Lords later changed its mind and it was not until 1983, with the Khawaja judgement, that a settled definition of illegal entry by deception came about.

The case of Norman (Court of Appeal 1985) established that a person who sought entry as a visitor when his true intention was to claim asylum was an illegal entrant. Had the Immigration Officer known on arrival that asylum was intended, then he would not have granted entry as a visitor.

=== Overstaying ===
Overstayers are those who stay beyond the time limit imposed on them when they enter the country. Those detected are removed under administrative powers found in Section 10 of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act.

Overstayers were, until the end of the 1990s, treated as potential deportees – a cumbersome administrative process which involved a written submission to the Home Secretary in each case. Until the mid-1980s there were attempts to prosecute overstayers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1982/feb/18/immigration-illegal-overstaying#S6CV0018P0_19820218_CWA_179|title=Immigration (Illegal Overstaying) (Hansard, 18 February 1982)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was seen to be both expensive in terms of court time and of little deterrence value as well as further delaying the persons departure. A further difficulty was the interpretation of the law by the courts which held that an overstayer had to be detected within three years and proof had to be offered that the person knew that they had overstayed. This was later overturned by the 1988 Act.

The process by which overstayers were detected before 1998 was ostensibly based on the system of landing and embarkation cards. Landing cards were, and are, completed by arriving foreign nationals, (not EU nationals). A small percentage of arriving passengers had their arrival conditions recorded for later embarkation checks. These were placed on conditional "coded" landing by the immigration officer on arrival and would be required to fill out an embarkation card on departure. These cards were tallied by a small army of junior clerical staff in the Croydon HQ and those who had no "pair" could be assumed not to have left. In practice, the value of the cards as a clear indicator that a person had overstayed was limited and its value as a trigger for pro-active investigations was questionable. Embarkation controls were ended in 1998 at a time when savings had to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1998/mar/16/immigration-control#S6CV0308P0_19980316_CWA_474|house=House of Commons|date=16 March 1998|column_start=506W|column_end=507W|title=Immigration Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing card did though often contain a useful written record of the person intentions on arrival and evidence of their inbound carrier who would be liable to pay for their return trip. Overstayers were most likely to emerge in the course of other enquiries or as part of a police investigation. Assisting police to establish nationality of arrestees was, and is, a major part of immigration enforcement work.

=== Marriage abuse ===
The investigation of bogus marriages was, especially during the 1980s and 1990s, a bread-and-butter activity for Immigration Service enforcement. There were occasional operations to stop marriages at Registry Offices where firm intelligence suggested a fraud but the majority of this work was conducted at residential addresses at the behest of IND caseworkers who referred applications for further checks. Immigration Officers would visit the marital address and assess whether there was evidence that the marriage was genuine and subsisting and not a "marriage of convenience". Officers would assess the domestic setting and draw obvious conclusions where there was only evidence of one person living there. That might conclude matters but, in cases of doubt, the couple would be interviewed in detail and asked questions regarding their domestic life together and the history of their relationship. Some marriage visits did not fall into this category and were altogether sadder. It was common for immigration offices to receive letters, particularly from young Anglo-Asian women, asking for help to prevent a [[forced marriage]]. The ability of immigration officers to provide help in these scenarios was fatally limited by the fear the women had of the consequences of presenting evidence in a public immigration appeals hearing. Some protection was eventually provided by the [[Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007]].

The information available to the Immigration Service regarding bogus marriages was hindered by the proper concerns that registrars had of breaching confidentiality. The 1999 Asylum and Immigration Act introduced new powers for registrars’ to demand that both partners attend in person to give notice, provide proof of identity and a declaration of nationality. Under the terms of the Act registrars had a duty to report to the Home Office any marriage that they have reasonable grounds for suspecting to be a sham marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2000/nov/30/marriages-immigration#S6CV0357P0_20001130_CWA_1296|title=Marriages (Immigration) (Hansard, 30 November 2000)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Act required registrars of civil marriages to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office it did not contain any power to carry out investigations into the genuineness of an intended marriage or to delay or refuse to conduct the marriage.
Marriage enquiries continued to be part of the general remit of operational enforcement but the numbers of enquiries possible became less as the focus was put on tracing failed asylum seekers and illegal workers. It remained a background issues rather than a primary concern with relatively little information gathered regarding success and failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/feb/16/marriages-of-convenience#S6CV0325P0_19990216_CWA_336|title=Marriages of Convenience (Hansard, 16 February 1999)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/mar/01/eu-nationals#S6CV0326P0_19990301_CWA_352|title=EU Nationals (Hansard, 1 March 1999)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1998/feb/11/eea-nationals#S6CV0306P0_19980211_CWA_35|title=EEA Nationals (Hansard, 11 February 1998)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point a Home Office minister even denied that it was his responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/apr/29/bogus-marriages#S6CV0223P0_19930429_CWA_205|title=Bogus Marriages (Hansard, 29 April 1993)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 24(5) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provides the following definition:
"Sham marriage" means a marriage (whether or not void) –
*(a) entered into between a person ("A") who is neither a British national nor a national of an EEA State other than the United Kingdom and another person (whether or not such a person or such a national): and
*(b) entered into by A for the purpose of avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of United Kingdom immigration law or the immigration rules.

====Enforcement working practice====
Working practice for enforcement immigration officers is based on the fact they are seeking to arrest or detain people who are already in the UK and have committed indictable offences. People arrested under immigration law are treated in the same way as those arrested by police for other offences. They are subject to the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and, when arrested, are usually interviewed under caution in a police station and may have access to legal representation. The major exception to the foregoing is in the case of known immigration offenders, e.g.: absconders, who may simply be re-detained under powers contained in Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. Although immigration offenders may, in theory, be prosecuted for illegal entry or overstaying it is usual practice to seek to remove the person from the UK as quickly as possible.

Immigration enforcement has, during the 2000s and after, undergone a long process of reform where immigration staff have been trained and equipped to perform their own arrests rather than rely on police support. Not all enforcement work is based on visiting addresses to arrest or detain suspects; much effort is dedicated to attending police stations and interviewing suspected offenders who have been arrested by police.

Where private addresses are visited in an effort to trace offenders officers generally seek to gain the cooperation of those present but do have certain powers of entry and may obtain warrants to search premises. Enforcement visits are intelligence led and must, in accordance with agreements with police, be risk assessed.

The aim of the investigation is to prove the offence of illegal entry or overstaying and the aim of most searches is to seek evidence of the person’s identity and immigration status to establish when, where and how they entered the UK. Where interviews at ports of entry are based on the idea of establishing a person’s credibility on a balance of probabilities, the aim of the enforcement immigration officer is to prove an offence has been committed at a certain point in time, at a certain place and to a high degree of probability. Having successfully completed an investigation the officer will refer the case to a Chief Immigration Officer or above who will take note of any compassionate circumstances and, if authorised, serve formal notice on the person that they are an offender and are liable to be detained. Where there are no barriers to removal, e.g., outstanding criminal matters or other legal barriers, the person is taken to an immigration removal centre and arrangements made for their departure. In practice there are a multitude of potential obstacles to removing a person from the UK which may include outstanding applications or appeals, legal representations and lack of essential documentation.

'''United States labor law''' sets the rights and duties for employees, [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]], and [[employer]]s in the United States. Labor law's basic aim is to remedy the "[[inequality of bargaining power]]" between employees and employers, especially employers "organized in the [[US corporate law|corporate]] or other forms of ownership association".&lt;ref&gt;[[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]], [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section151&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §141]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the 20th century, federal law created minimum [[social and economic rights]], and encouraged state laws to go beyond the minimum to favor employees.&lt;ref&gt;Most statutes explicitly encourage this, including the [[FLSA 1938]], the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]]. "[[Federal preemption]]" rules have, however, restricted experimentation in key areas. These include the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]], as the [[US Supreme Court]] developed a doctrine not found in the Act, and [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] requires a federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 but higher in 28 states, and discourages working weeks over 40 hours through time-and-a-half [[overtime pay]]. There are no federal or state laws requiring [[paid holidays]] or [[paid family leave]]: the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] creates a limited right to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in larger employers. There is no automatic right to an occupational pension beyond federally guaranteed [[Social Security Act of 1935|social security]],&lt;ref&gt;[[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter7/subchapter1&amp;edition=prelim §§301–306] on federally funded state programs and [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter7/subchapter2&amp;edition=prelim §§401–434] on federal old age, survivors and disability insurance benefits.&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] requires standards of prudent management and good governance if employers agree to provide pensions, health plans or other benefits. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]] requires employees have a safe system of work.

A [[contract of employment]] can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights. But to increase their [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] to get better terms, employees organize labor unions for [[collective bargaining]]. The [[Clayton Act of 1914]] guarantees all people the right to organize,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section17&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 15 USC §17], "The labor of a human being [[Labour is not a commodity|is not a commodity]] or article of commerce. Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, instituted for the purposes of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through [[unfair labor practices]]. Under the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959]], labor union governance follows democratic principles. If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities have a duty to bargain in [[good faith]]. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing influence through pension funds,&lt;ref&gt;D Webber, ''The Rise of the Working Class Shareholders: Labor's Last Best Weapon'' ([http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674972131 2018])&lt;/ref&gt; and representation on [[US corporate law|corporate]] boards.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Democracy in America at Work: The History of Labor's Vote in Corporate Governance' (2019) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246974 42 Seattle University Law Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], all employing entities and labor unions have a duty to treat employees equally, without discrimination based on "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]] §703(a)(1), [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-2&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §2000e-2(a)], "Employers must not refuse to hire, discharge or otherwise discriminated 'against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;/ref&gt; There are separate rules for sex discrimination in pay under the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]]. Additional groups with "protected status" were added by the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]] and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. There is no federal law banning all sexual orientation or [[Sexual identity|identity]] discrimination, but 22 states had passed laws by 2016. These equality laws generally prevent discrimination in hiring, terms of employment, and make discharge because of a protected characteristic unlawful. There is no federal law against [[Unfair dismissal|unjust discharge]], and most states also have no law with full protection against wrongful [[termination of employment]].&lt;ref&gt;cf [[International Labour Organization]], [[Termination of Employment Convention, 1982]] setting out general principles on fair reasons for discharge of workers.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collective agreements]] made by labor unions and some individual contracts require people are only discharged for a "[[just cause]]". The [[Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988]] requires employing entities give 60 days notice if more than 50 or one third of the workforce may lose their jobs. Federal law has aimed to reach [[full employment]] through [[monetary policy]] and spending on infrastructure. Trade policy has attempted to put labor rights in international agreements, to ensure open markets in a [[global economy]] do not undermine [[Fair trade|fair]] and [[full employment]].

[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|left|After the [[Declaration of Independence]], [[slavery in the US]] was progressively abolished in the north, but only finished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] in 1865 near the end of the [[American Civil War]].]]
Modern US labor law mostly comes from statutes passed between [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935|1935]] and [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974|1974]], and changing interpretations of the [[US Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] to the last major statute [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]]. [[CL Estlund]], 'The Ossification of American Labor Law' (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1123792 102 Columbia Law Review 1527] argues that collective labor right "ossified" with the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959]], after which there was a "longstanding political impasse at the national level". E McGaughey, 'Fascism-Lite in America (or the Social Ideal of Donald Trump)' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3024584 7(1) British Journal of American Legal Studies], 14, argues that since 1976, "No modern judiciary had engaged in a more sustained assault on democracy and human rights. In particular, its attack on labor and democratic society made inequality soar."&lt;/ref&gt; However, laws regulated the rights of people at work and employers from colonial times on. Before the [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, the [[common law]] was either uncertain or hostile to labor rights.&lt;ref&gt;See JV Orth, ''Combination and conspiracy: a legal history of trade unionism, 1721-1906'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Unions were classed as conspiracies, and potentially criminal.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Journeymen-Taylors of Cambridge]]'' (1721) 8 Mod 10, 88 ER 9&lt;/ref&gt; It tolerated [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude in the Americas|indentured servitude]]. From the [[Pequot War]] in [[Connecticut]] from 1636 onwards, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|were enslaved]] by European settlers. More than half of the European immigrants arrived as prisoners, or in [[indentured servitude]],&lt;ref&gt;C Tomlins, 'Reconsidering Indentured Servitude: European Migration and the Early American Labor Force, 1600–1775' (2001) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00236560123269?journalCode=clah20 42 Labor History 5]&lt;/ref&gt; where they were not free to leave their employers until a [[Debt bondage|debt bond]] had been repaid. Until its abolition, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought millions of Africans to do forced labor in the Americas. However, in 1772, the [[England|English]] [[Court of King's Bench]] held in ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' that slavery was to be presumed unlawful at common law.&lt;ref&gt;(1772) [http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1772/57.pdf 98 ER 499]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Stewart (customs official)|Charles Stewart]] from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] had bought [[James Somerset]] as a slave and taken him to [[England]]. With the help of [[abolitionists]], Somerset escaped and sued for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' (that "holding his body" had been unlawful). [[Lord Mansfield]], after declaring he should "[[let justice be done whatever be the consequence]]", held that slavery was "so odious" that nobody could take "a slave by force to be sold" for any "reason whatever". This was a major grievance of southern slave owning states, leading up to the [[American Revolution]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;AW Blumrosen, ‘The Profound Influence in America of Lord Mansfield’s Decision in Somerset v Stuart’ (2007) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/twlr13&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page= 13 Texas Wesleyan Law Review 645]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1790 United States Census]] recorded 694,280 slaves (17.8 per cent) of a total 3,893,635 population. After independence, the [[British Empire]] halted the [[Atlantic slave trade]] in [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Slave Trade Act 1807]]&lt;/ref&gt; and abolished slavery in its own territories, by paying off slave owners in [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|1833]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] distributed around £20 million, around $3 billion in 2017 dollars. See the [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/ UCL Legacies of British Slave-ownership] page.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, northern states progressively abolished slavery. However, southern states did not. In ''[[Dred Scott v Sandford]]'' the Supreme Court held the federal government could not regulate slavery, and also that people who were slaves had no legal rights in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1856/9.html 60 US 393] (1857)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil War]] was the result. [[President Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 made abolition of slavery a war aim, and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] of 1865 enshrined the abolition of most forms of slavery in the Constitution. Former slave owners were further prevented from holding people in involuntary servitude for debt by the [[Peonage Act of 1867]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[JR Commons]], ''[[Principles of Labor Legislation]]'' (1916) [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924020748095#page/n55/mode/2up/search/cambridge ch II, 38-40]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] ensured equal access to justice, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] required that everyone would have the right to vote. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] was also meant to ensure equality in access to housing and transport, but in the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'', the Supreme Court found it was "unconstitutional", ensuring that racial segregation would continue. In dissent, [[Harlan J]] said the majority was leaving people "practically at the mercy of corporations".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1883/182.html 109 US 3] (1883)&lt;/ref&gt; Even if people were formally free, they remained factually dependent on [[property]] owners for work, income and basic services.

Like slavery, common law repression of labor unions was slow to be undone.&lt;ref&gt;S Perlman, ''A History of Trade Unionism in the United States'' (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806, ''[[Commonwealth v Pullis]]'' held that a [[Philadelphia]] shoemakers union striking for higher wages was an illegal "conspiracy",&lt;ref&gt;3 Doc Hist 59 (1806)&lt;/ref&gt; even though [[US corporate law|corporations]] - combinations of employers - were lawful. Unions still formed and acted. The first federation of unions, the [[National Trades Union]] was established in 1834 to achieve a [[Eight-hour day#United States|10 hour working day]], but it did not survive the soaring unemployment from the financial [[Panic of 1837]]. In 1842, ''[[Commonwealth v Hunt]]'', held that ''Pullis'' was wrong, after the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers’ Society struck for higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;45 Mass. 111, 4 Metcalf 111 (1842)&lt;/ref&gt; The first instance judge said unions would "render property insecure, and make it the spoil of the multitude, would annihilate property, and involve society in a common ruin". But in the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], [[Chief Justice Shaw|Shaw CJ]] held people "are free to work for whom they please, or not to work, if they so prefer" and could "agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights, in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests." This stopped criminal cases, although civil cases persisted.&lt;ref&gt;See EE Witte, ‘Early American Labor Cases’ (1926) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/789460 35 Yale Law Journal 829], employers brought at least three successful claims against their employees before 1863, and fifteen up to 1880 for "conspiracy". See also FB Sayre, ‘Criminal Conspiracy’ (1922) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1328648 35 Harvard Law Review 393].

It aimed for racial and gender equality, political education and cooperative enterprise,&lt;ref&gt;L Fink, ''Workingmen’s Democracy: The Knights of Labor and American Politics'' (1983) xii-xiii, it declined due to a ‘titanic’ lack of leadership, and divisions. Members turned over quickly.&lt;/ref&gt; yet it supported the [[Alien Contract Labor Law of 1885]] which suppressed workers migrating to the US under a contract of employment. Industrial conflicts on [[Railroads in the United States|railroads]] and [[telegraphs]] from 1883 led to the foundation of the [[American Federation of Labor]] in 1886, with the simple aim of improving workers wages, housing and job security "here and now".&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Congress, Senate, ''[[Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations]]'' (Government Printing Office, 1916) [http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5757/ 64th Cong., 1st sess., S. Doc. 415, 2, 1526–1529]&lt;/ref&gt; It also aimed to be the sole federation, to create a strong, unified labor movement. Business reacted with litigation. The [[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890]], which was intended to sanction business cartels acting in [[restraint of trade]],&lt;ref&gt;See TW Hazlett, ‘The Legislative History of the Sherman Act Re-examined’ (1992) [https://search.proquest.com/docview/1297279202?pq-origsite=gscholar 30 Economic Inquiry 263], 266 and H Hovenkamp, ‘Labor Conspiracies in American Law, 1880-1930’ (1988) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tlr66&amp;div=45&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals 66 Texas Law Review 919]&lt;/ref&gt; was applied to labor unions. In 1895, the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[In re Debs]]'' affirmed an injunction, based on the Sherman Act, against the striking workers of the [[Pullman Company]].

In 1905, ''[[Lochner v New York]]'' held that [[New York (state)|New York]] limiting bakers' working day to 60 hours a week violated employers' [[freedom of contract]]. The Supreme Court majority supposedly unearthed this "right" in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], that no State should "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|periods=no|198|45|1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Harlan J]], [[Holmes J]] dissented, arguing that the "[[United States Constitution|constitution]] is not intended to embody a particular economic theory" but is "made for people of fundamentally differing views". On questions of social and economic policy, courts should never declare legislation "unconstitutional". The Supreme Court, however, accelerated its attack on labor in ''[[Loewe v. Lawlor]]'', holding that triple damages were payable by a striking union to its employers under the [[Sherman Act of 1890]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|208|274|1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of cases was finally quashed by the [[Clayton Act of 1914]] §6. This removed labor from [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]], affirming that the "[[Labour is not a commodity|labor of a human being is not a commodity]] or article of commerce" and nothing "in the antitrust laws" would forbid the operation of labor organizations "for the purposes of mutual help".&lt;ref&gt;Now 15 USC §17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Second Bill of Rights Speech.ogv|thumb|left|In his [[State of the Union]] address of 1944, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] urged that America develop [[Second Bill of Rights]] through legislation, including the right to fair employment, an end to unfair competition, to education, health and social security.]]
Throughout the early 20th century, states enacted labor rights to advance social and economic progress. But despite the [[Clayton Act]], and abuses of employers documented by the ''[[Commission on Industrial Relations]]'' from 1915, the Supreme Court struck labor rights down as unconstitutional, leaving management powers virtually unaccountable.&lt;ref&gt;On the "science" of management that developed, see [[FW Taylor]], ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]'' ([https://archive.org/stream/principlesofscie00taylrich#page/n5/mode/2up 1911]).

United States]]'', 249 US 211 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, the courts held state and federal attempts to create [[social security]] to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''[[State Board of Control v Buckstegge]]'', 158 Pac 837, 842 (1916) Arizona Supreme Court striking down a new state pension law. ''[[Railroad Retirement Board v Alton Railroad Co]]'', 295 US 330 (1935) striking down a compulsory contributory pension scheme for rail workers.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were unable to save in safe public pensions, millions of people bought shares in corporations, causing massive growth in the [[stock market]].&lt;ref&gt;See GC Means, ‘The Separation of Ownership and Control in American Industry’ (1931) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1883922 46(1) The Quarterly Journal of Economics 68] and [[LD Brandeis]], ''[[Other People’s Money And How the Bankers Use It]]'' (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Supreme Court precluded regulation for good information on what people were buying, [[corporate promoters]] tricked people into paying more than stocks were really worth. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] wiped out millions of people's savings. Business lost investment and fired millions of workers. Unemployed people had less to spend with businesses. Business fired more people. There was a downward spiral into the [[Great Depression]]. This led to the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for President in 1932, who promised a "[[New Deal]]". Government committed to create [[full employment]] and a system of [[social and economic rights]] enshrined in federal law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[FD Roosevelt]], ''Campaign Address on Progressive Government at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, California'' ([https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Campaign_Address_on_Progressive_Government_at_the_Commonwealth_Club_in_San_Francisco,_California 1932]) written by [[AA Berle]].&lt;/ref&gt; But despite the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s overwhelming electoral victory, the Supreme Court continued to strike down legislation, particularly the [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]], which regulated enterprise in an attempt to ensure fair wages and prevent [[unfair competition]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[ALA Schechter Poultry Corp v US]]'', 295 US 495 (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after Roosevelt's [[United States presidential election, 1936|second overwhelming victory]] in 1936, and Roosevelt's threat to create more judicial positions if his laws were not upheld, one Supreme Court judge [[The switch in time that saved nine|switched positions]]. In ''[[West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish]]'' the Supreme Court found that [[minimum wage]] legislation was constitutional,&lt;ref&gt;300 US 379 (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; letting the [[New Deal]] go on. In labor law, the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] guaranteed every employee the right to unionize, collectively bargain for fair wages, and take collective action, including [[Solidarity action|in solidarity]] with employees of other firms. The [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] created the right to a minimum wage, and time-and-a-half [[overtime]] pay if employers asked people to work over 40 hours a week. The [[Social Security Act of 1935]] gave everyone the right to a basic pension and to receive insurance if they were unemployed, while the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] ensured buyers of securities on the [[stock market]] had good information. The [[Davis–Bacon Act of 1931]] and [[Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936]] required that in federal government contracts, all employers would pay their workers fair wages, beyond the minimum, at prevailing local rates.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Copeland "Anti-kickback" Act of 1934]], 18 USC §874 and [[McNamara–O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965]] wage rates to be paid as prevail in the locality.&lt;/ref&gt; To reach [[full employment]] and out of depression, the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]] enabled the federal government to spend huge sums of money on building and creating jobs. This accelerated as [[World War Two]] began. In 1944, his health waning, Roosevelt urged Congress to work towards a "[[Second Bill of Rights]]" through legislative action, because "unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world" and "we shall have yielded to the spirit of [[Fascism]] here at home."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Delano Roosevelt, ''Eleventh State of the Union Address'' ([https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt%27s_Eleventh_State_of_the_Union_Address 1944])&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[New Deal]] had created a minimum safety net of labor rights, and aimed to enable [[fair pay]] through [[collective bargaining]], a Republican dominated Congress revolted when Roosevelt passed away. Against the veto of [[President Truman]], the [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]] limited the right of labor unions to take [[solidarity action]], and enabled states to ban unions requiring all people in a workplace becoming union members. A series of Supreme Court decisions, held the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] not only created minimum standards, but stopped or "[[Federal preemption|preempted]]" states enabling better union rights, even though there was no such provision in the statute.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon]]'' 359 US 236 (1959) but contrast ''[[Chamber of Commerce v Brown]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2008/22.html 522 US 60] (2008) where [[Breyer J]] and [[Ginsburg J]] dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; Labor unions became extensively regulated by the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959]]. Post-war prosperity had raised people's living standards, but most workers who had no union, or [[job security]] rights remained vulnerable to unemployment. As well as the crisis triggered by ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brown v Board of Education of Topeka]]'', 347 US 483 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; and the need to dismantle segregation, job losses in agriculture, particularly among [[African Americans]] was a major reason for the [[civil rights movement]], culminating in the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] led by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]. Although Roosevelt's [[Executive Order 8802]] of 1941 had prohibited [[racial discrimination]] in the national defense industry, people still suffered discrimination because of their [[skin color]] across other workplaces. Also, despite the increasing numbers of women in work, sex discrimination was endemic. The government of [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], requiring equal pay for women and men. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] introduced the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], finally prohibiting discrimination against people for "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Slowly, a new generation of equal rights laws spread. At federal level, this included the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]], the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], now overseen by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].

Although people, in limited fields, could claim to be equally treated, the mechanisms for fair pay and treatment were dismantled after the 1970s. The last major labor law statute, the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] created rights to well regulated [[occupational pensions]], although only where an employer had already promised to provide one: this usually depended on [[collective bargaining]] by unions. But in 1976, the Supreme Court in ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]'' held anyone could spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, apparently as a part of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to "[[freedom of speech]]". From this point, [[big business]] was able to lobby all politicians to stop any further progression of labor rights. After the Republican [[President Reagan]] took office in 1981, he dismissed all [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|air traffic control staff]] who went on strike for fair wages, and replaced the [[National Labor Relations Board]] members with pro-management men. Dominated by Republican appointees, the Supreme Court suppressed labor rights, removing rights of professors, religious school teachers, or undocumented migrants to organize in a union,&lt;ref&gt;''[[NLRB v Yeshiva University]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1980/24.html 444 US 672], (1980), ''[[NLRB v Catholic Bishop of Chicago]]'', 440 US 490 (1979) 5 to 4 on the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, and ''[[Hoffman Plastic Compounds v NLRB]]'', 535 US 137 (2002) 5 to 4 under the NLRA of 1935&lt;/ref&gt; allowing employees to be searched at work,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brown v Hotel and Restaurant Employees]]'', 468 US 491 (1984) 5 to 4 on the NLRA of 1935&lt;/ref&gt; and eliminating employee rights to sue for medical malpractice in their own health care.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mertens v Hewitt Associates]]'', 508 US 248 (1993) 5 to 4 under [[ERISA 1974]].

The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] criminalized large numbers of migrants. The [[Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988]] guaranteed workers some notice before a mass termination of their jobs. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] guaranteed a right to just 12 weeks leave to take care for children after birth, all unpaid. The [[Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996]] cut the minimum wage, by enabling employers to take the tips of their staff to subsidize the minimum wage. A series of proposals by Democrat and independent politicians to advance labor rights were not enacted,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the [[Dunlop Report of 1994]], [[Workplace Democracy Act of 1999]], [[Employee Free Choice Act]], [[Paycheck Fairness Act]], [[Equality Act of 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]] began to fall behind all other developed countries in labor rights,&lt;ref&gt;See Z Adams, L Bishop and S Deakin, ''CBR Labour Regulation Index (Dataset of 117 Countries'' (Cambridge, [[Centre for Business Research]] [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/256566/cbr-lri-117-countries-codebook-and-methodology.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y 2016]) 761, United States of America&lt;/ref&gt; with stagnating [[Income inequality in the United States|real income growth]], and [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|lower human development]], [[List of countries by life expectancy|lower life expectancy]], and [[Poverty in the United States|higher poverty]].

[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Spanish 09-2456M original.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] believed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] of 1948 "may well become the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere." Based on the President's call for a [[Second Bill of Rights]] in 1944, articles 22–24 elevated rights to "social security", "just and favourable conditions of work", and the "right to rest and leisure" to be as important as the "right to own property".&lt;ref&gt;[[UDHR 1948]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights art 17]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[US contract law|Contracts]] between employees and employers (mostly [[US corporate law|corporations]]) usually begin an employment relationship, but are often not enough for a decent livelihood. Because individuals [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]], especially against wealthy corporations, labor law creates legal rights that override unjust {{Citation needed|reason=describing it as unjust is entirely subjective|date=June 2018}} market outcomes. Historically, the law faithfully enforced property rights and [[freedom of contract]] on any terms,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Lochner v New York]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1905/100.html 198 US 45] (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; even if this was inefficient, exploitative and unjust{{Citation needed|reason=describing it as exploitative and unjust is entirely subjective|date=June 2018}}. In the early 20th century, as more people favored the introduction of democratically determined [[economic and social rights]] over rights of property and contract in unequal{{Citation needed|reason=describing it as unequal is entirely subjective|date=June 2018}} markets, state and federal governments introduced law reform. First, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] created a minimum wage (now $7.25 at federal level, higher in 28 states) and [[overtime pay]] of one and a half times. Second, the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] creates very limited rights to take unpaid leave. In practice, good employment contracts improve on these minimums. Third, while there is no right to an [[occupational pension]] or other benefits, the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] ensures employers guarantee those benefits if they are promised. Fourth, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970]] demands a safe system of work, backed by professional inspectors. Individual states are often empowered to go beyond the federal minimum, and function as [[laboratories of democracy]] in social and economic rights, where they have not been constrained by the [[US Supreme Court]].

===Scope of protection===
{{Slist worker scope}}
{{see also|Worker|Employee|Inequality of bargaining power}}
[[Common law]], state and federal statutes usually confer labor rights on "employees", but not people who are autonomous and have sufficient [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] to be "independent contractors". In 1994, the ''[[Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report]]'' recommended a unified definition of an employee under all federal labor laws, to reduce litigation, but this was not implemented. As it stands, Supreme Court cases have stated various general principles, which will apply according to the context and purpose of the statute in question. In ''[[NLRB v Hearst Publications, Inc]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|322|111|1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; newsboys who sold newspapers in Los Angeles claimed that they were "employees", so that they had a right to collectively bargain under the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]]. The newspaper corporations argued the newsboys were "independent contractors", and they were under no duty to bargain in [[good faith]]. The Supreme Court held the newsboys were employees, and common law tests of employment, particularly the summary in the [[Restatement of the Law of Agency, Second]] §220, were no longer appropriate. They were not "independent contractors" because of the degree of control employers had. But the [[National Labor Relations Board]] could decide itself who was covered if it had "a reasonable basis in law." Congress reacted, first, by explicitly amending the [[NLRA]] §2(1) so that independent contractors were exempt from the law while, second, disapproving that the common law was irrelevant. At the same time, the Supreme Court decided ''[[United States v Silk]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|331|704|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding that "economic reality" must be taken into account when deciding who is an employee under the [[Social Security Act of 1935]]. This meant a group of coal loaders were employees, having regard to their economic position, including their [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack of bargaining power]], the degree of discretion and control, and the risk they assumed compared to the coal businesses they worked for. By contrast, the Supreme Court found truckers who owned their own trucks, and provided services to a carrier company, were independent contractors.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Goldberg v Whitaker House Cooperative, Inc]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1961/71.html 366 US 28] (1961), on homeworkers making 'knitted, crocheted, and embroidered goods of all kinds.'&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is now accepted that multiple factors of traditional common law tests may not be replaced if a statute gives no further definition of "employee" (as is usual, e.g., the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]], [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]], [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]]). Alongside the purpose of labor legislation to mitigate inequality of bargaining power and redress the economic reality of a worker's position, the multiple factors found in the [[Restatement of Agency]] must be considered, though none is necessarily decisive.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nationwide Mut Ins Co v Darden]]'', {{ussc|503|318|1992}} employee under [[ERISA]], rejecting two-prongs of the Fourth Circuit's substitute test, based on expectations and reliance.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Mc Nelis, 8 years old, a newsboy. This boy has just recovered from his second attack of pneumonia. Was found... - NARA - 523323.jpg|thumb|left|"[[Newspaper hawker|Newsboys]]" in [[L.A.]] were held in the leading case, ''[[NLRB v Hearst Publications, Inc]]'', to be employees with labor rights, not independent contractors, on account of their [[unequal bargaining power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|322|111|1944}}, confirmed in ''[[United States v Silk]]'', {{ussc|331|704|1947}} and ''[[Nationwide Mut Ins Co v Darden]]'', {{ussc|503|318|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Common law]] agency tests of who is an "employee" take account of an employer's control, if the employee is in a distinct business, degree of direction, skill, who supplies tools, length of employment, method of payment, the regular business of the employer, what the parties believe, and whether the employer has a business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Restatement of the Law of Agency, Second]] §220 and ''[[Community for Creative Non-Violence v Reid]]'', 490 US 730 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Some statutes also make specific exclusions that reflect the common law, such as for independent contractors, and others make additional exceptions. In particular, the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] §2(11) exempts supervisors with "authority, in the interest of the employer", to exercise discretion over other employees' jobs and terms. This was originally a narrow exception. Controversially, in ''[[NLRB v Yeshiva University]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|444|672|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court held that full time professors in a [[Yeshiva University|university]] were excluded from collective bargaining rights, on the theory that they exercised "managerial" discretion in academic matters. The dissenting judges pointed out that management was actually in the hands of university administration, not professors. In ''[[NLRB v Kentucky River Community Care Inc]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|532|706|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held, again 5 to 4, that six registered nurses who exercised supervisory status over others fell into the "professional" exemption. [[Stevens J]], for the dissent, argued that if "the 'supervisor' is construed too broadly", without regard to the Act's purpose, protection "is effectively nullified".&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates v Wells]]'', {{ussc|538|440|2003}} a majority of the Supreme Court held four physician shareholders could potentially be "employees" under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. [[Ginsburg J]], joined by [[Breyer J]] dissenting on reasoning, held it was clear that they were.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]], in ''[[Christopher v SmithKline Beecham Corp]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-204 567 US __] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that a traveling medical salesman for [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]] of four years was an "outside salesman", and so could not claim overtime. People working unlawfully are often regarded as covered, so as not to encourage employers to exploit vulnerable employees. For instance in ''[[Lemmerman v AT Williams Oil Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;350 S.E.2d 83 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; under the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act an eight-year-old boy was protected as an employee, even though children working under the age of 8 was unlawful. However, in ''[[Hoffman Plastic Compounds v NLRB]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|535|137|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that an undocumented worker could not claim back pay, after being discharged for organizing in a union. The gradual withdrawal of more and more people from the scope of labor law, by a slim majority of the Supreme Court since 1976, means that the US falls below international law standards, and standards in other democratic countries, on core labor rights, including [[freedom of association]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[International Labour Organization]], [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948]] [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312232 C087] and [[Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949]] [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312243:NO C098]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law tests were often important for determining who was, not just an employee, but the relevant employers who had "[[vicarious liability]]". Potentially there can be multiple, joint-employers could who share responsibility, although responsibility in [[US tort law|tort law]] can exist regardless of an employment relationship. In ''[[Ruiz v Shell Oil Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA5/1969/758.html 413 F.2d 310] (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fifth Circuit]] held that it was relevant which employer had more control, whose work was being performed, whether there were agreements in place, who provided tools, had a right to discharge the employee, or had the obligation to pay.&lt;ref&gt;See also, ''[[Zheng v Liberty Apparel Co]]'', 335 F3d 61 (2003) Second Circuit, Cabranes J finding joint employment.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Local 217, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees Union v MHM Inc]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA2/1992/908.html 976 F.2d 805] (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; the question arose under the [[Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988]] whether a subsidiary or parent corporation was responsible to notify employees that the hotel would close. The [[Second Circuit]] held the subsidiary was the employer, although the trial court had found the parent responsible while noting the subsidiary would be the employer under the [[NLRA]]. Under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]], 29 USC §203(r), any "enterprise" that is under common control will count as the employing entity. Other statutes do not explicitly adopt this approach, although the [[NLRB]] has found an enterprise to be an employer if it has "substantially identical management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers and supervision."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Advance Electric]]'', 268 NLRB 1001 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[South Prairie Construction Co v Local No 627]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1976/88.html 425 US 800] (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that the DC Circuit had legitimately identified two corporations as a single employer given that they had a "very substantial qualitative degree of centralized control of labor",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Local No International Union of Operating Engineers v National Labor Relations Board]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCADC/1975/366.html 518 F.2d 1040] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; but that further determination of the relevant bargaining unit should have been remitted to the [[NLRB]]. When employees are hired through an agency, it is likely that the end-employer will be considered responsible for statutory rights in most cases, although the agency may be regarded as a joint employer.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Castillo v Case Farms of Ohio]]'', 96 F Supp. 2d 578 (1999) an employer who used an [[employment agency]] called "American Temp Corps", was responsible for how [[migrant farm workers]] hired in Texas to work in an Ohio chicken factory, were packed into sub-human transport and living conditions in violation of the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act of 1983]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract of employment===
{{Slist employment contract}}
{{see also|United States contract law}}
When people start work, there will almost always be a [[contract of employment]] that governs the relationship of employee and the employing entity (usually a [[US corporate law|corporation]], but occasionally a human being).&lt;ref&gt;If there is no contract (written, oral, or by conduct) a ''[[quantum meruit]]'' claim for [[restitution]] can be available.&lt;/ref&gt; A "contract" is an agreement enforceable in law. Very often it can be written down, or signed, but an [[oral agreement]] is also a fully enforceable contract. Based on the reasoning that the party with less bargaining power benefits from having the range of acceptable contracts limited to a set that has been vetted to exclude allegedly exploitative terms, and the fact that employees have [[unequal bargaining power]] to almost all employing entities, most employment contracts are "[[standard form contracts|standard form]]".&lt;ref&gt;See [[F Kessler]], 'Contracts of Adhesion—Some Thoughts About Freedom of Contract' (1943) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1117230 43(5) Columbia Law Review 629]&lt;/ref&gt; Most terms and conditions are photocopied or reproduced for many people. Genuine [[negotiation]] is rare, unlike in commercial transactions between two business corporations. This has been the main justification for enactment of rights in federal and state law. The federal right to [[collective bargaining]], by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make [[collective agreements]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] §1, [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section151&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §151], "The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries."&lt;/ref&gt; The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased [[overtime]] pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a "minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers", even when a person could not get a high enough wage by individual bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fair Labor Standards Act 1938]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section202&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §202]&lt;/ref&gt; These and other rights, including [[Family and Medical Leave Act 1993|family leave]], rights against [[Civil Rights Act 1964|discrimination]], or basic [[job security]] standards, were designed by the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures to replace individual contract provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights. For example, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] entitles states and municipalities to set minimum wages beyond the federal minimum. By contrast, other statutes such as the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Gade v National Solid Wastes Management Association]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1992/86.html 505 US 88] (1992) holding 5 to 4 that [[OSHA 1970]] preempted [[Illinois]] state law that improved training and handling hazardous waste materials.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Ingersoll-Rand Co v McClendon]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1990/159.html 498 US 133] (1990) holding 6 to 3 that [[ERISA 1974]] precluded a [[Texas]] wrongful termination action for denying an employee benefit from the federal statute on general grounds in §514. The minority only endorsed preemption on specific ground in §510.&lt;/ref&gt; have been interpreted in a series of contentious judgments by the [[US Supreme Court]] to "[[Federal preemption|preempt]]" state law enactments.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[BI Sachs]], 'Despite Preemption: Making Labor Law in Cities and States' (2011) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1788911 124 Harvard Law Review 1153]&lt;/ref&gt; These interpretations have had the effect to "stay experimentation in things social and economic" and stop states wanting to "serve as a laboratory" by improving labor rights.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[New State Ice Co v Liebmann]]'', 285 US 262 (1932) per [[Brandeis J]] "To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the nation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This Court has the power to prevent an experiment."&lt;/ref&gt; Where minimum rights do not exist in federal or state statutes, principles of [[US contract law|contract law]], and potentially [[US tort law|torts]], will apply.

[[File:Ecrivains consult - Texte 4 mains.jpg|thumb|left|Employment contracts are subject to minimum rights in state and federal statute, and those created by [[collective agreements]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[JI Case Co v National Labor Relations Board]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1944/39.html 321 US 322] (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Aside from terms in oral or written agreements, terms can be incorporated by reference. Two main sources are [[collective agreements]] and company handbooks. In ''[[JI Case Co v National Labor Relations Board]]'' an employing corporation argued it should not have to bargain in [[good faith]] with a labor union, and did not commit an [[unfair labor practice]] by refusing, because it had recently signed individual contracts with its employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1944/39.html 321 US 322] (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Supreme Court]] held unanimously that the "very purpose" of collective bargaining and the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] was "to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group". Terms of collective agreements, to the advantage of individual employees, therefore supersede individual contracts. Similarly, if a written contract states that employees do not have rights, but an employee has been told they do by a supervisor, or rights are assured in a company handbook, they will usually have a claim.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[McLain v Great American Insurance Co]]'', 208 Cal. App. 3d 1476 (1989) holding the [[parol evidence presumption]] will rarely apply to employment.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Torosyan v Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc]]'' the [[Supreme Court of Connecticut]] held that a promise in a handbook that an employee could be dismissed only for a good reason (or "just cause") was binding on the employing corporation. Furthermore, an employer had no right to unilaterally change the terms.&lt;ref&gt;662 A2d 89 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Most other state courts have reached the same conclusion, that contracts cannot be altered, except for employees' benefit, without new [[consideration]] and true agreement.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Demasse v ITT Corp]]'', 984 P2d 1138 (1999) in the [[Arizona Supreme Court]]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a slight majority on the [[California Supreme Court]], appointed by Republican governors, held in ''[[Asmus v Pacific Bell]]'' that a company policy of indefinite duration can be altered after a reasonable time with reasonable notice, if it affects no vested benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Asmus+v+Pacific+Bell&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;case=5124554271174185010&amp;scilh=0 999 P2d 71] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The four dissenting judges, appointed by Democratic governors, held this was a "patently unfair, indeed unconscionable, result – permitting an employer that made a promise of continuing job security... to repudiate that promise with impunity several years later". In addition, a basic term of [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] which cannot be waived, is implied by common law or equity in all states. This usually demands, as a general principle that "neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Kirke La Shelle Company v The Paul Armstrong Company et al]]'' 263 NY 79 (1933) and see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] §205&lt;/ref&gt; The term of [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] persists throughout the employment relationship. It has not yet been used extensively by state courts, compared to other jurisdictions. The [[Montana Supreme Court]] has recognized that extensive and even punitive damages could be available for breach of an employee's reasonable expectations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stark v Circle K Corp]]'', 230 Mont 468, [https://casetext.com/case/stark-v-circle-k-corporation 751 P2d 162] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; However others, such as the [[California Supreme Court]] limit any recovery of damages to contract breaches, but not damages regarding the manner of termination.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Foley v Interactive Data Corp]]'', [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/foley-v-interactive-data-corp-28525 765 P2d 373] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the [[UK labour law|United Kingdom]] the requirement for "[[Good faith (law)|good faith]]"&lt;ref&gt;This is also referred to as "mutual trust and confidence".

Finally, it was traditionally thought that arbitration clauses could not displace any employment rights, and therefore limit access to justice in public courts.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Alexander v Gardner-Denver Co]]'', {{ussc|415|36|1974}} state policy favoring arbitration, but arbitrator decision can be reviewed de novo on employment rights.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|556|247|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 5 to 4 decision under the [[Federal Arbitration Act of 1925]], individual employment contract arbitration clauses are to be enforced according to their terms. The four dissenting judges argued that this would eliminate rights in a way that the law never intended.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'', {{ussc|563|333|2011}} 5 to 4, binding arbitration can be imposed in class action cases for employment and consumer rights&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wages and pay===

{{Main|Fair Labor Standards Act|Minimum wage in the US|List of U.S. minimum wages|Executive pay in the US}}
While contracts often determine wages and terms of employment, the law refuses to enforce contracts that do not observe basic standards of fairness for employees.&lt;ref&gt;On economic and political theory, see [[JS Mill]], ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/101#Mill_0199_1672 Book V, ch XI, §§9–11] and generally ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1948/63.html 334 US 1] (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] aims to create a national minimum wage, and a voice at work, especially through collective bargaining should achieve fair wages. A growing body of [[US corporate law|law]] also regulates [[executive pay]], although a system of "[[maximum wage]]" regulation, for instance by the former [[Stabilization Act of 1942]], is not currently in force. Historically, the law actually suppressed [[wage regulation|wages]], not of the highly paid, by ordinary workers. For example, in 1641 the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] [[Massachusetts General Court|legislature]] (dominated by property owners and the official church) required wage reductions, and said rising wages "tende to the ruin of the Churches and the [[Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Bay Colony Records (1641) vol I, 223. See also [[JR Commons]], ''History of Labor in the United States'' (Macmillan 1918) [https://archive.org/stream/historyoflabouri01commuoft#page/50/mode/2up vol I, ch II, 50]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, democratic opinion demanded everyone had a [[minimum wage]], and could bargain for fair wages beyond the minimum. But when states tried to introduce new laws, the [[US Supreme Court]] held them unconstitutional. A right to [[freedom of contract]], argued a majority, could be construed from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s protection against being deprived "of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". Dissenting judges argued that "due process" did not affect the legislative power to create social or economic rights, because employees "are not upon a full [[Inequality of bargaining power|level of equality]] of choice with their employer".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adkins v Children's Hospital]]'', [www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1923/78.html 261 US 525] (1923) per [[Taft CJ]] (dissenting). The majority held a minimum wage passed by Congress for young people and women in Washington DC was unconstitutional. Continued in ''[[Murphy v Sardell]]'', [https://casetext.com/case/murphy-v-sardell 269 US 530] (1925) wage laws for young people struck down, [[Brandeis J]] dissenting and [[Holmes J]] objecting.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:History of US federal minimum wage increases.svg|thumb|left|The real federal minimum wage has declined by one third since 1969.]]
After the [[Wall Street Crash]], and the [[New Deal]] with the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the majority in the [[US Supreme Court]] was changed. In ''[[West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish]]'' [[Hughes CJ]] held (over four dissenters still arguing for [[Freedom of Contract]]) that a [[Washington (state)|Washington]] law setting minimum wages for women was constitutional because the state legislatures should be enabled to adopt legislation in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1937/73.html 300 US 379] (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; This ended the "''[[Lochner v New York|Lochner]]'' era", and Congress enacted the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v Darby Lumber Co]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1941/49.html 312 US 100] (1941) dismissed a challenge to the [[FLSA 1938]] being constitutional.&lt;/ref&gt; Under §202(a) the federal minimum wage aims to ensure a "standard of living necessary for health, efficiency and general well being".&lt;ref&gt;[[FLSA 1938]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section202&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §202(a)]&lt;/ref&gt; Under §207(a)(1), most employees (but with many exceptions) working over 40 hours a week must receive 50 per cent more [[overtime]] pay on their hourly wage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section207&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §207]&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody may pay lower than the minimum wage, but under §218(a) states and municipal governments may enact higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section218&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §218(a)].&lt;/ref&gt; This is frequently done to reflect local productivity and requirements for decent living in each region.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[California Labor Code]] [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;division=2.&amp;title=&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=1.&amp;article= §1182.12], requiring a $10 per hour wage from 2016. [[New York Consolidated Laws]] [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO: LAB art 19], requires $9 per hour from 2016. Lawsuits from business groups have mostly been rejected, e.g. in ''[[New Mexicans for Free Enterprise v Santa Fe]]'', 138 NM 785 (2005) the City of Santa Fe enacted a minimum wage ordinance, above the federal and state wages. Businesses challenged it as being beyond the City's powers. Fry J held that the ordinance was lawful and constitutional.&lt;/ref&gt; However the federal minimum wage has no automatic mechanism to update with inflation. Because the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] has opposed raising wages, the federal [[Real wages|real minimum wage]] is over 33 per cent lower today than in 1968, among the lowest in the industrialized world.

[[File:Fight for $15 on 4-15 (17160512642).jpg|thumb|right|People have campaigned for a $15 an hour minimum wage, because the [[real wage|real minimum wage]] has fallen by more than 33% compared to 1968. In "[[Gratuity|tipped]]" jobs, some states still enable employers to take their workers' tips for between $2.13 and the $7.25 minimum wage per hour.]] 
Although there is a federal minimum wage, it has been restricted in (1) the scope of who it covers, (2) the time that counts to calculate the hourly minimum wage, and (3) the amount that employers' can take from their employees' tips or deduct for expenses. First, five [[US Supreme Court]] judges held in ''[[Alden v Maine]]'' that the federal minimum wage cannot be enforced for employees of state governments, unless the state has consented, because that would violate the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1999/62.html 527 US 706] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Souter J]], joined by three dissenting justices,&lt;ref&gt;Souter J, [[Stevens J]], [[Ginsburg J]], [[Breyer J]] dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; held that no such "sovereign immunity" existed in the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;This brought the effective position back to ''[[National League of Cities v Usery]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|426|833|1976}} where 5 judges to 4, held the [[FLSA 1938]] could not be constitutionally applied to state governments. Brennan, White, Marshall, Stevens J dissenting. Yet in ''[[Garcia v San Antonio Metro Transit Authority]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|469|528|1985}} 5 judges to 4 upheld extension of the [[FLSA 1938]] to state and local government workers. There was authority under the FLSA consistent with the Tenth Amendment to extend the Act's protection to public transport employees. Blackmun J gave the majority opinion. Powell, Burger, Rehnquist, O'Connor J dissenting.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minimum wage in the United States|Twenty-eight states]], however, did have minimum wage laws higher than the federal level in 2016. Further, because the [[US Constitution]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution|article one]], [[Commerce clause|section 8, clause 3]] only allows the federal government to "regulate [[Commerce clause|Commerce]]... among the several States", employees of any "enterprise" under $500,000 making goods or services that do not enter commerce are not covered: they must rely on state minimum wage laws.&lt;ref&gt;See today [[FLSA 1938]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section203&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §203(r)-(s)]. Previously, ''[[Walling v Jacksonville Paper Co]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1943/25.html 317 US 564] (1943). See also ''[[AB Kirschbaum Co v Walling]]'' 316 US 517 (1942), workers building for firms that would not do interstate commerce were not covered, and ''[[Borden Co v Borella]]'' 325 US 679 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt; [[FLSA 1938]] §203(s) explicitly exempts establishments whose only employees are close family members.&lt;ref&gt;[[FLSA 1938]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section203&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §203(s)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Under §213 the minimum wage may not be paid to 18 categories of employee, and paying overtime to 30 categories of employee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section213&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §213] n.b. the statute does not make clear what justifications there are for any exemptions.&lt;/ref&gt; This include under §213(a)(1) employees of "''bona fide'' executive, administrative, or professional capacity". In ''[[Auer v Robbins]]'' police sergeants and lieutenants at the [[St Louis]] Police Department, [[Missouri]] claimed they should not be classed as executives or professional employees, and should get overtime pay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1997/13.html 519 US 452] (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scalia J]] held that, following [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] guidance, the St Louis police commissioners were entitled to exempt them. This has encouraged employers to attempt to define staff as more "senior" and make them work longer hours while avoiding overtime pay.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Adams v United States]]'', 44 Fed Claims 772 (1999) and ''[[Erichs v Venator Group]]'', Inc 128 F Supp 2d 1255 (ND Cal 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Another exemption in §213(a)(15) is for people "employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services". In ''[[Long Island Care at Home Ltd v Coke]]'', a corporation claimed exemption, although [[Breyer J]] for a unanimous court agreed with the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] that it was only intended for carers in private homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|=noperiods|551|158|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monopsony3.png|thumb|left|While a minority argue it causes unemployment,&lt;ref&gt;These theories, although not accompanied by empirical evidence, include [[M Friedman]], 'The Methodology of Positive Economics' in M Friedman, ''Essays in Positive Economics'' (University of Chicago Press 1953) 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; modern economic theory holds that a reasonable [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]] stimulates growth because labor markets are [[monopsonistic]] through [[unequal bargaining power]]. If poorer workers have more to spend it stimulates [[effective aggregate demand]] for goods and services and grows the economy.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[David Card|DE Card]] and [[Alan Krueger|AB Krueger]], ''Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage'' (1995) and S Machin and A Manning, ‘Minimum wages and economic outcomes in Europe’ (1997) 41 European Economic Review 733&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Second, because §206(a)(1)(C) says the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, courts have grappled with which hours count as "working".&lt;ref&gt;Under 29 USC §211(c) employers must keep payroll records for evidence of working time.&lt;/ref&gt; Early cases established that time traveling to work did not count as work, unless it was controlled by, required by, and for the benefit of an employer, like traveling through a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of America]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1945/88.html 325 US 161] (1945) time traveling to work through the coal mine did count as working because it (1) required physical and mental exertion that was (2) controlled and required by the employer (3) for the employer's benefit. See also, ''[[Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; Railroad Co v Muscoda Local No 123]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1944/97.html 321 US 590] (1944) travel to work, once underground, was working time.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in, ''[[Anderson v Mount Clemens Pottery Co]]'' a majority of five to two justices held that employees had to be paid for the long walk to work through an employer's Mount Clemens Pottery Co facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1946/110.html 328 US 680] (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Murphy J]] this time, and time setting up workstations, involved "exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employer's benefit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1946/110.html 328 US 680] (1946) per [[Murphy J]]. See also ''[[Morillion v Royal Packing Co]]'', [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/4th/22/575.html 22 Cal 4th 575] (2000) the [[California Supreme Court]] held an employer must pay for hours traveling on company vehicles.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Armour &amp; Co v Wantock]]'' [[firefighters]] claimed they should be fully paid while on call at their station for fires. The [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held that, even though the firefighters could sleep or play cards, because "[r]eadiness to serve may be hired quite as much as service itself" and time waiting on call was "a benefit to the employer".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|=noperiods|323|126|1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in 1992 the [[Sixth Circuit]] controversially held that needing to be infrequently available by phone or pager, where movement was not restricted, was not working time.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Martin v Onion Turnpike Commission]]'' 968 F2d 606 (6th 1992) See also ''[[Merrill v Exxon Corp]]'', 387 FSupp 458 (SD Tex 1974) while pep meetings are working, but Department of Labor approved standard apprenticeship mandatory training was not working time.&lt;/ref&gt; Time spent doing unusual cleaning, for instance showering off toxic substances, does count as working time,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Steiner v Mitchell]]'' 350 US 247 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; and so does time putting on special protective gear.&lt;ref&gt;''[[IBP Inc v Alvarez]]'', 546 US 21 (2005) [[Stevens J]] for a unanimous court.&lt;/ref&gt; Under §207(e) pay for overtime should be one and a half times the regular pay. In ''[[Walling v Helmerich and Payne Inc]]'', the [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held that an employer's scheme of paying lower wages in the morning, and higher wages in the afternoon, to argue that overtime only needed to be calculated on top of (lower) morning wages was unlawful. Overtime has to be calculated based on the average regular pay.&lt;ref&gt;323 US 37 (1944) [[Murphy J]] holding that higher afternoon wages did not count as "premium" pay that could be ignored.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Christensen v Harris County]]'' six [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judges held that police in [[Harris County, Texas]] could be forced to use up their accumulated "compensatory time" (allowing time off with full pay) before claiming overtime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2000/38.html 529 US 576] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the dissent, [[Stevens J]] said the majority had misconstrued §207(o)(2), which requires an "agreement" between employers, unions or employees on the applicable rules, and the Texas police had not agreed.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Skidmore v Swift &amp; Co]]'', 323 US 134 (1944) the Department of Labor's recommendations over what counted as overtime would be given a level of deference commensurate with its persuasiveness, the thoroughness of investigation, its consistency, and the validity of its reasoning.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, §203(m) allows employers to deduct sums from wages for food or housing that is "customarily furnished" for employees. The [[Secretary of Labor]] may determine what counts as fair value. Most problematically, outside states that have banned the practice, they may deduct money from a "tipped employee" for money over the "cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996" – and this was $2.13 per hour. If an employee does not earn enough in tips, the employer must still pay the $7.25 minimum wage. But this means in many states tips do not go to workers: tips are taken by employers to subsidize low pay. Under [[FLSA 1938]] §216(b)-(c) the Secretary of State can enforce the law, or individuals can claim on their own behalf. Federal enforcement is rare, so most employees are successful if they are in a labor union. The [[Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968]] limits deductions or "garnishments" by employers to 25 per cent of wages,&lt;ref&gt;15 USC §1672&lt;/ref&gt; though many states are considerably more protective. Finally, under the [[Portal to Portal Act of 1947]], where Congress limited the minimum wage laws in a range of ways, §254 puts a two-year time limit on enforcing claims, or three years if an employing entity is guilty of a willful violation.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §254. See ''[[McLaughlin v Richland Shoe Co]]'', 468 US 128 (1988) Stevens J, 'willful' means reckless disregard for whether conduct was forbidden by the state. [[Brennan J]] and [[Blackmun J]] dissented.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clock 200 Fifth Av jeh.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948]] article 23 requires "reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay", but there is no federal or state right to [[paid annual leave]]: Americans have the least in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;See R Ray, M Sanes and J Schmitt, 'No Vacation Nation Revisited' (Washington DC 2013) [http://cepr.net/documents/publications/no-vacation-update-2013-05.pdf Center for Economic and Policy Research] 1, "the average worker in the private sector in the United States receives only about ten days of paid vacation and about six paid holidays per year".&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The US has not ratified this convention, although it is a founding member of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no general federal or state legislation requiring paid annual leave. Title 5 of the [[United States Code]] §6103 specifies ten [[Public holidays in the United States|public holidays]] for federal government employees, and provides that holidays will be paid.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section6303&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 5 USC §6303]. These are (1) New Year's Day (2) [[Martin Luther King Jr]]'s Birthday (3) Washington's Birthday (4) Memorial Day (5) Independence Day (6) Labor Day (7) Columbus Day (8) Veterans Day (9) [[Thanksgiving Day]] (10) Christmas Day.&lt;/ref&gt; Many states do the same, however, no state law requires private sector employers to provide paid holidays. Many private employers follow the norms of federal and state government, but the right to annual leave, if any, will depend upon [[collective agreements]] and individual employment contracts. State law proposals have been made to introduce paid annual leave. A 2014 [[Washington (state)|Washington]] Bill from [[United States House of Representatives]] member [[Gael Tarleton]] would have required a minimum of 3 weeks of paid holidays each year to employees in businesses of over 20 staff, after 3 years work. Under the [[International Labour Organization]] [[Holidays with Pay Convention 1970]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Holidays with Pay Convention 1970]] (no 132)&lt;/ref&gt; three weeks is the bare minimum. The Bill did not receive enough votes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=2238&amp;year=2013 HB 2238]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, employees in all [[European Union]] countries have the right to at least 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days) of paid annual leave each year.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Working Time Directive 2003]] art 7&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is no federal or state law on limits to the length of the working week. Instead, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] §207 creates a financial disincentive to longer working hours. Under the heading "Maximum hours", §207 states that [[time and a half]] pay must be given to employees working more than 40 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section207&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §207]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not, however, set an actual limit, and there are at least 30 exceptions for categories of employee which do not receive overtime pay.&lt;ref&gt;[[FLSA 1938]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section213&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §213]&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter working time was one of the labor movement's original demands.

Rybczynski, ''Waiting for the Weekend'' (1991) 142&lt;/ref&gt; State legislation to limit working time was, however, suppressed by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Lochner v New York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1905/100.html 198 US 45] (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York State Legislature]] had passed the Bakeshop Act of 1895, which limited work in bakeries to 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week, to improve health, safety and people's living conditions.

Just as there are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or [[Parental leave|family leave]] in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states.

Contrast [[L Summers]], 'Some simple economics of mandated benefits' (1989) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1827753 79(2) American Economic Review 177] ([[Theory|theorizing]] (without evidence) that pay will fall to compensate for the cost of any mandated benefit, such as family and medical leave).&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year.&lt;ref&gt;But under 29 USC §2611(2) employees "at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50."&lt;/ref&gt; Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2512(a)(2) and on adoption, see ''[[Kelley v Crosfield Catalysts]]'' 135 F2d 1202 (7th Circuit 1998) The same rules for federal employees were codified in 5 USC §§6381–6387.&lt;/ref&gt; Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(a)(2) and 29 USC §2612(f) mothers and fathers must share time if they work for the same employer.&lt;/ref&gt; Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is "foreseeable",&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(e)&lt;/ref&gt; and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" according to medical advice.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(e)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2614(c). If an employee quits, the employer is enabled to recoup costs.&lt;/ref&gt; Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc]]'' held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2002/557.html 535 US 81] (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer."&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2614(b). Under 29 USC §2612(b)(2) employers may transfer employees to another position with similar pay and benefits if health absences could be intermittent. Under §2618 special rules apply for employees of local educational agencies.&lt;/ref&gt; Employees or the [[Secretary of Labor]] can bring enforcement actions,&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2617, and see ''[[Frizzell v Southwest Motor Freight]]'', 154 F3d 641 (6th Circuit 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2617(a)(1)(A)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Moore v Payless Shoe Source]]'' (8th Circuit 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free [[child care]] or [[day care]]. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. D Paquette, 'The enormous ambition of Hillary Clinton's child-care plan' (May 12, 2016) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/ The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pensions===
{{Slist pensions}}
{{main|Pensions in the United States|List of largest pension schemes in the US|Investment manager}}
In the early 20th century, the possibility of having a "retirement" became real as people lived longer,&lt;ref&gt;See generally WC Greenough and FP King, ''Pension plans and public policy'' (1976), S Sass, ''The Promise of Private Pensions: The First 100 Years'' (Harvard University Press 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and believed the elderly should not have to work or rely on charity until they died.&lt;ref&gt;See [[JR Commons]] and JB Andrews, ''[[Principles of Labor Legislation]]'' (1920) [https://archive.org/stream/principlesoflabo00commrich#page/422/mode/2up 423–438]&lt;/ref&gt; The law maintains an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public [[social security]] created by the [[Social Security Act of 1935]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[42 USC]] ch 7&lt;/ref&gt; (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or [[life insurance]] that individuals buy themselves. At work, most [[occupational pension]] schemes originally resulted from [[collective bargaining]] during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;See L Conant, ''A Critical Analysis of Industrial Pension Systems'' (1922) and MW Latimer, ''Trade Union Pension Systems'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Unions usually bargained for employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by [[collective agreement]] became known as "[[Taft-Hartley plan]]s" after the [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]] required joint management of funds by employees and employers.&lt;ref&gt;See [[LMRA 1947]], [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section186&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §186(c)(5)(B)]&lt;/ref&gt; Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called [[TIAA]], was established on the initiative of [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1918 with the express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees.&lt;ref&gt;This followed Carnegie's attendance the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]] in 1916 to explain labor unrest. See W Greenough, ''It's My Retirement Money – Take Good Care of It: The TIAA-CREF Story'' (Irwin 1990) 11–37, and E McGaughey, ''Participation in Corporate Governance'' (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2593904 ch 6(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; These could be collective and [[defined benefit]] schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual "[[401(k)]]" plans. These are named after the [[Internal Revenue Code]] §[[401(k)]],&lt;ref&gt;[[26 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section401&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §401(k)]&lt;/ref&gt; which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same [[tax deferral]] rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a "[[defined benefit]]" plan, a [[401(k)]] only contains whatever the employer and employee [[Defined contribution plan|contribute]]. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have minimum [[social security]]. The [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]] §902 codified a model for employers to [[Automatic enrolment|automatically enroll]] their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out.&lt;ref&gt;On the theory behind [[automatic enrolment]], see [[Richard Thaler|R Thaler]] and S Benartzi, 'Save more tomorrow: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Savings’ (2004) 112(1) Journal of Political Economy 164 and E McGaughey, 'Behavioural economics and labour law' (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2460685 LSE Legal Studies Working Paper No. 20/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no right to an occupational pension. The [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other "employee benefit" plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], 29 USC §1003(a). This could include any [[Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association]], such as for child care cover, sick leave, fringe benefits or extra unemployment insurance.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Morgan Stanley Building (WTM by official-ly cool 112).jpg|thumb|left|Investment managers, like [[Morgan Stanley]] and all pension trustees, are [[fiduciaries]]. This means they must avoid [[conflicts of interest]]. During a takeover bid, ''[[Donovan v Bierwirth]]'' held trustees must take advice or not vote on corporate stocks if in doubt about [[Conflict of interest|conflicts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA2/1982/447.html 680 F2d 263] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Five main rights for beneficiaries in [[ERISA 1974]] include information, [[funding]], [[vesting]], [[anti-discrimination]], and [[fiduciary duties]]. First, each beneficiary should receive a "summary plan description" in 90 days of joining, plans must file annual reports with the [[Secretary of Labor]], and if beneficiaries make claims any refusal must be justified with a "full and fair review".&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], [[29 USC]] §§1022–1133&lt;/ref&gt; If the "summary plan description" is more beneficial than the actual plan documents, because the pension fund makes a mistake, a beneficiary may enforce the terms of either.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rhorer v Raytheon Engineers and Constructors, Inc]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA5/1999/1081.html 181 F3d 364] (5th 1999) a plan beneficiary can enforce terms in the summary plan description, even if the underlying document conflicts.&lt;/ref&gt; If an employer has pension or other plans, all employees must be entitled to participate after at longest 12 months, if working over 1000 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], [[29 USC]] §1052&lt;/ref&gt; Second, all promises must be funded in advance.&lt;ref&gt;ERISA 1974, [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter18/subchapter1/node551/part3&amp;edition=prelim §1081–1102], containing detailed rules.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]] was established by the federal government to be an insurer of last resort, but only up to $60,136 per year for each employer. Third, employees' benefits usually cannot be taken away (they "[[Vesting|vest]]") after 5 years,&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], [[29 USC]] §1053. The employer can extend to 7 years, with staggered vesting and a labor union can collectively agree for up to 10 years. Most will seek the shortest period of time.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributions must [[accrue]] (i.e. the employee owns contributions) at a proportionate rate.&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], [[29 USC]] §1054&lt;/ref&gt; If employers and pension funds merge, there can be no reduction in benefits,&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], [[29 USC]] §1058&lt;/ref&gt; and if an employee goes bankrupt their creditors cannot take their occupational pension.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patterson v Shumate]]'', 504 US 753 (1992) Blackmun J, a pension is treated like a right under a spendthrift trust, so in bankruptcy proceedings, pensions cannot be taken away. Scalia J concurred. See again, ''[[Guidry v Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund]]'', 493 US 365 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[US Supreme Court]] has enabled benefits to be withdrawn by employers simply amending plans. In ''[[Lockheed Corp v Spink]]'' a majority of seven judges held that an employer could alter a plan, to deprive a 61-year-old man of full benefits when he was reemployed, unbound by [[fiduciary duties]] to preserve what an employee had originally been promised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1996/52.html 517 US 882] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In dissent, [[Breyer J]] and [[Souter J]] reserved any view on such "highly technical, important matters".&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd]]'' [1991] 1 WLR 589 and ''[[Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman]]'' [2000] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/39.html UKHL 39]&lt;/ref&gt; Steps to terminate a plan depend on whether it is individual, or multi-employer, and ''[[Mead Corp v Tilley]]'' a majority of the [[US Supreme Court]] held that employers could recoup excess benefits paid into pension plans after [[PBGC]] conditions are fulfilled. [[Stevens J]], dissenting, contended that all contingent and future liabilities must be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1989/103.html 490 US 714] (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, as a general principle, employees or beneficiaries cannot suffer any discrimination or detriment for "the attainment of any right" under a plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] §1140, however see the highly controversial case ''[[McGann v H&amp;H Music Co]]'' (5th 1991) where a man diagnosed HIV positive, filed for treatment under work health care plan. The employer changed the plan to limit AIDS treatment to $5000. Fifth Circuit held the employer's motive was not specifically to injure the worker but to control costs and apparently lawful.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth, managers are bound by responsibilities of competence and loyalty, called "[[fiduciary duties]]".&lt;ref&gt;See EP Serota and FA Brodie (eds), ''ERISA Fiduciary Law'' (2nd edn 2007). In general, people who manage other people's money will be a "[[fiduciary]]" in law, and bound by special duties. The core duty is to avoid any possibility of a [[conflict of interest]]. Other duties that fiduciaries have (but any agent may also have) include the duty of care, skill and competence (i.e. not to be [[negligent]]) and the duty to follow the terms of one's assignment. Discussed further in ''[[Peacock v Thomas]]'' 516 US 349 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Under §1102, a [[fiduciary]] is anyone who administers a plan, its trustees, and investment managers who are delegated control. Under §1104, [[fiduciaries]] must follow a "[[Prudent person|prudent]]" person standard, involving three main components. First, a fiduciary must act "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan".&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1104&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §1104(a)(1)(D)]&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they must act with "care, skill and diligence", including "diversifying the investments of the plan" to "minimize the risk of large losses".&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1104&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §1104(a)(1)(B)-(C)]&lt;/ref&gt; Liability for carelessness extends to making misleading statements about benefits,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Varity Corp v Howe]]'' 516 US 489 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and have been interpreted by the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to involve a duty to vote on proxies when [[corporate stocks]] are purchased, and publicizing a statement of investment policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Labor]], ''Interpretive bulletin relating to written statements of investment policy, including proxy voting policy or guidelines'' (1994) [http://www.dol.gov/dol/allcfr/title_29/part_2509/29CFR2509.94-2.htm 29 CFR 2509.94–2], "The fiduciary duties described at [[ERISA]] Sec. 404(a)(1)(A) and (B), require that, in voting [[Proxy voting|proxies]], the responsible fiduciary consider those factors that may affect the value of the plan's investment and not subordinate the interests of the participants and beneficiaries in their retirement income to unrelated objectives. These duties also require that the named fiduciary appointing an investment manager periodically monitor the activities of the investment manager with respect to the management of plan assets, including decisions made and actions taken by the investment manager with regard to proxy voting decisions. The named [[fiduciary]] must carry out this responsibility solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and without regard to its relationship to the plan sponsor."&lt;/ref&gt; Third, and codifying fundamental equitable principles, a [[fiduciary]] must avoid any possibility of a [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Meinhard v Salmon]]'', 164 NE 545 (NY 1928) and ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1726] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/1726/J76.html EWHC Ch J76]&lt;/ref&gt; He or she must act "solely in the interest of the participants... for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits" with "reasonable expenses",&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1104&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §1104(a)(1)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically avoiding [[self-dealing]] with a related "party in interest".&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1106&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §1106]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Donovan v Bierwirth]]'', the [[Second Circuit]] held that trustees of a pension which owned shares in the employees' company as a [[takeover]] bid was launched, because they faced a potential [[conflict of interest]], had to get independent legal advice on how to vote, or possibly abstain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USCA2/1982/447.html 680 F2d 263] (1982) per Friendly J, "We do not mean by this either that trustees confronted with a difficult decision need always engage independent counsel or that engaging such counsel and following their advice will operate as a complete whitewash.... perhaps, after the events of late September, resignation was the only proper course."&lt;/ref&gt; Remedies for these duties have, however, been restricted by the [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] to disfavor damages.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Local 144, Nursing Home Pension Fund v Demisay]]'', 508 US 581 (1992) and ''[[Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Co v Knudson]]'' 534 US 204 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In these fields, according to §1144, [[ERISA 1974]] will "supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan".&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1144&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §1144]&lt;/ref&gt; ERISA did not, therefore, follow the model of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] or the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which encourage states to legislate for improved protection for employees, beyond the minimum. The preemption rule led the [[US Supreme Court]] to strike down a [[New York (state)|New York]] that required giving benefits to pregnant employees in [[ERISA]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shaw v Delta Air Lines, Inc]]'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html 463 US 85] (1983) per [[Blackmun J]]&lt;/ref&gt; It held a case under [[Texas]] law for damages for denying vesting of benefits was preempted, so the claimant only had [[ERISA]] remedies.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ingersoll-Rand Co v McClendon]]'', 498 US 133 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It struck down a [[Washington (state)|Washington]] law which altered who would receive life insurance designation on death.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Egelhoff v Egelhoff]]'', 532 US 141 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; However, under §1144(b)(2)(A) this does not affect 'any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or [[securities]].' So, the Supreme Court has also held valid a [[Massachusetts]] law requiring mental health to be covered by employer group health policies.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metropolitan Life Insurance Co v Massachusetts]]'' 471 US 724 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; But it struck down a [[Pennsylvania]] statute which prohibited employers becoming subrogated to (potentially more valuable) claims of employees for insurance after accidents.&lt;ref&gt;''[[FMC Corp v Holliday]]'' 498 US 52 (1990) per [[O'Connor J]]. [[Stevens J]] dissented. See also ''[[District of Columbia v Greater Washington Board of Trade]]'', 506 US 125 (1992) [[Stevens J]] dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet more recently, the court has shown a greater willingness to prevent laws being preempted,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran]]'', 536 US 355 (2002) Souter J, 5 to 4, held an [[Illinois]] statute requiring 'independent medical review' of a denial of a claim for treatment under an [[HMO]] contract was not preempted because it was insurance regulation.&lt;/ref&gt; however the courts have not yet adopted the principle that state law is not preempted or "superseded" if it is more protective to employees than a federal minimum.

[[File:Bernie Sanders in East Los Angeles (27211671695).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Workplace Democracy Act of 1999]],&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr1277/text HR 1277], Title III, §301&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Bernie Sanders]] but not yet passed, would give every employee the representatives on boards of their pension plans, to control how vote are cast on [[corporate stocks]]. Currently [[investment managers]] control most voting rights in the economy using "other people's money".&lt;ref&gt;See earlier, [[LD Brandeis]], ''[[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It]]'' ([http://louisville.edu/law/library/special-collections/the-louis-d.-brandeis-collection/other-peoples-money-by-louis-d.-brandeis 1914]) an JS Taub, 'Able but Not Willing: The Failure of Mutual Fund Advisers to Advocate for Shareholders’ Rights’ (2009) 34(3) The Journal of Corporation Law 843, 876&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most important rights that [[ERISA 1974]] did not cover were who controls investments and [[securities]] that beneficiaries' retirement savings buy. The largest form of retirement fund has become the [[401(k)]]. This is often an individual account that an employer sets up, and an [[investment management]] firm, such as [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]], [[Fidelity Investments|Fidelity]], [[Morgan Stanley]] or [[BlackRock]], is then delegated the task of trading fund assets. Usually they also vote on corporate shares, assisted by a "proxy advice" firm such as [[Institutional Shareholder Services|ISS]] or [[Glass Lewis]]. Under [[ERISA 1974]] §1102(a),&lt;ref&gt;[[ERISA 1974]], [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1102&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §1102]&lt;/ref&gt; a plan must merely have named fiduciaries who have "authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan", selected by "an employer or employee organization" or both jointly. Usually these [[fiduciaries]] or [[trustees]], will delegate management to a professional firm, particularly because under §1105(d), if they do so, they will not be liable for an investment manager's breaches of duty.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section1105&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §1105(d)]&lt;/ref&gt; These investment managers buy a range of assets, particularly [[corporate stocks]] which have voting rights, as well as [[government bonds]], [[corporate bonds]], [[commodities]], real estate or [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s. Rights on those assets are in practice monopolized by investment managers, unless pension funds have organized to take voting in house, or to instruct their investment managers. Two main types of pension fund to do this are union organized [[Taft-Hartley plan]]s, and [[Public employee pension plans in the United States|state public pension plans]]. Under the amended [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] §302(c)(5)(B) a union bargained plan has to be jointly managed by representatives of employers and employees.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] §302(c)(5)(B)&lt;/ref&gt; Although many local pension funds are not consolidated and have had critical funding notices from the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[US Department of Labor]], [https://www.dol.gov/ebsa/criticalstatusnotices.html Critical, Endangered and WRERA Status Notices]' (Retrieved August 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; more funds with employee representation ensure that corporate voting rights are cast according to the preferences of their members. [[Public employee pension plans in the United States|State public pensions]] are often larger, and have greater [[bargaining power]] to use on their members' behalf. State pension schemes invariably disclose the way trustees are selected. In 2005, on average more than a third of trustees were elected by employees or beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;See D Hess, 'Protecting and Politicizing Public Pension Fund Assets: Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Governance Structures and Practices’ (2005–2006) 39 UC Davis LR 187, 195. The recommended [[Uniform Management of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act of 1997]] §17(c)(3) suggested funds publicize their governance structures. This was explicitly adopted by a number of states, while others already followed the same best practice.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[California Government Code]] §20090 requires that its public employee pension fund, [[CalPERS]] has 13 members on its board, 6 elected by employees and beneficiaries. However, only pension funds of sufficient size have acted to replace [[investment manager]] voting. Furthermore, no general legislation requires voting rights for employees in pension funds, despite several proposals.&lt;ref&gt;See, sponsored by [[Peter Visclosky]], Joint Trusteeship Bill of 1989 [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c101:H.R.2664.IH: HR 2664]. See further R Cook, 'The Case for Joint Trusteeship of Pension Plans' (2002) WorkingUSA 25. Most recently, the Employees' Pension Security Act of 2008 ([http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h5754/text HR 5754]) §101 would have amended ERISA 1974 §403(a) to insert 'The assets of a pension plan which is a single-employer plan shall be held in trust by a joint board of trustees, which shall consist of two or more trustees representing on an equal basis the interests of the employer or employers maintaining the plan and the interests of the participants and their beneficiaries.'&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Workplace Democracy Act of 1999]], sponsored by [[Bernie Sanders]] then in the [[US House of Representatives]], would have required all single employer pension plans to have trustees appointed equally by employers and employee representatives.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr1277/text HR 1277], Title III, §301&lt;/ref&gt; There is, furthermore, currently no legislation to stop investment managers voting with other people's money as the [[Dodd-Frank Act of 2010]] §957 banned [[broker-dealer]]s voting on significant issues without instructions.&lt;ref&gt;This inserted a new Securities Exchange Act of 1934 §6(b)(10)&lt;/ref&gt; This means votes in the largest [[US corporate law|corporations]] that people's retirement savings buy are overwhelmingly exercised by investment managers, whose interests potentially conflict with the interests of beneficiaries' on [[labor rights]], [[fair pay]], [[job security]], or pension policy.

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]],&lt;ref&gt;Text of the [http://finduslaw.com/occupational_safety_and_health_act_osha_29_u_s_code_chapter_15 Occupational Safety and Health Act]&lt;/ref&gt; signed into law in 1970 by President [[Richard Nixon]], creates specific standards for workplace safety. The Act has spawned years of litigation by industry groups that have challenged the standards limiting the amount of permitted exposure to chemicals such as [[benzene]]. The Act also provides for protection for "whistleblowers" who complain to governmental authorities about unsafe conditions while allowing workers the right to refuse to work under unsafe conditions in certain circumstances. The Act allows states to take over the administration of OSHA in their jurisdictions, so long as they adopt state laws at least as protective of workers' rights as under federal law. More than half of the states have done so.

Union Representation on American Corporate Boards' (1998) 51(4) Industrial and Labor Relations Review 557&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The central right in [[labor law]], beyond minimum standards for pay, hours, pensions, safety or privacy, is to participate and vote in workplace governance.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Cox]], DC Bok, [[MW Finkin]] and RA Gorman, ''Labor Law: Cases and Materials'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The American model developed from the [[Clayton Act of 1914]],&lt;ref&gt;[[15 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section17&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §17]&lt;/ref&gt; which declared the "labor of a [[human being]] is not a [[commodity]] or article of commerce" and aimed to take workplace relations out of the reach of courts hostile to collective bargaining. Lacking success, the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] changed the basic model, which remained through the 20th century. Reflecting the "[[inequality of bargaining power]] between employees... and employers who are organized in the [[US corporate law|corporate]] or other forms of ownership association",&lt;ref&gt;[[NLRA 1935]], [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section151&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §151]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[NLRA 1935]] codified basic rights of employees to organize a [[labor union|union]], requires employers to bargain in [[good faith]] (at least on paper) after a union has majority support, binds employers to [[collective agreements]], and protects the right to take [[collective action]] including a strike. Union membership, collective bargaining, and standards of living all increased rapidly until Congress forced through the [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]]. Its amendments enabled states to pass laws restricting agreements for all employees in a workplace to be unionized, prohibited collective action against associated employers, and introduced a list of unfair labor practices for unions, as well as employers. Since then, the [[US Supreme Court]] chose to develop a doctrine that the rules in the [[NLRA 1935]] preempted any other state rules if an activity was "arguably subject" to its rights and duties.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon]]'' 359 US 236 (1959) and previously ''[[Garner v Teamsters Local 776]]'', 346 US 485, 490 (1953) and most recently ''[[Chamber of Commerce v Brown]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2008/22.html 522 US 60] (2008) [[Breyer J]] and [[Ginsburg J]] dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; While states were inhibited from acting as "[[laboratories of democracy]]", and particularly as unions were targeted from 1980 and membership fell, the [[NLRA 1935]] has been criticized as a "failed statute" as US labor law "ossified".&lt;ref&gt;[[BI Sachs]], 'Revitalizing labor law' (2010) [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1425&amp;context=bjell 31(2) Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law 333] and [[CL Estlund]], 'The Ossification of American Labor Law' (2002) 102 Columbia LR 1527.

When it comes to the rules of organizing, the regime provides employers with too much latitude to interfere with employees' efforts at self-organization, while offering unions too few rights to communicate with employees about the merits of unionization. The [[NLRB]]'s election machinery is dramatically too slow, enabling employers to defeat organizing drives through delay and attrition. The NLRB's remedial regime is also too weak to protect employees against employer retaliation. And, with respect to the statute's goal of facilitating collective bargaining, the regime's "[[good faith]]" bargaining obligation is rendered meaningless by the Board's inability to impose contract terms as a remedy for a party's failure to negotiate in good faith.'&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to more innovative experiments among states, progressive corporations and unions to create direct participation rights, including the right to vote for or [[codetermine]] directors of corporate boards, and elect [[work councils]] with binding rights on workplace issues.

===Labor unions===
{{Sourcelist unions}}
{{main|Labor unions in the US|List of labor unions in the US}}
[[Freedom of association]] in labor unions has always been fundamental to the development of democratic society, and is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[NAACP v Alabama]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1958/150.html 357 US 449] (1958) referring to the "constitutionally protected right of association".&lt;/ref&gt; In early [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial history]], labor unions were routinely suppressed by the government. Recorded instances include cart drivers being fined for striking in 1677 in New York City, and carpenters prosecuted as criminals for striking in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;[[JR Commons]], ''History of Labor in the United States'' (Macmillan 1918) [https://archive.org/stream/historyoflabouri01commuoft#page/24/mode/2up vol I, ch 1, 25]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Revolution]], however, courts departed from repressive elements of [[English common law]]. The first reported case, ''[[Commonwealth v Pullis]]'' in 1806 did find shoemakers in [[Philadelphia]] guilty of "a combination to raise their wages".&lt;ref&gt;JB Commons, ''A Documentary History of American Industrial Society'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, unions continued, and the first federation of trade unions was formed in 1834, the [[National Trades' Union]], with the primary aim of a 10-hour working day.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Cox]], DC Bok, [[MW Finkin]] and RA Gorman, ''Labor Law: Cases and Materials'' (2006) 11. The federation collapsed during the [[Panic of 1837]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842 the [[Supreme Court of Massachusetts]] held in ''[[Commonwealth v Hunt]]'' that a strike by the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers' Society for higher wages was lawful.&lt;ref&gt;45 Mass. 111, 4 Metcalf 111 (1842) See further EE Witte, 'Early American Labor Cases' (1926) 35 Yale Law Journal 829, finding that only three cases on conspiracy were brought between 1842 and 1863. But at least 15 cases were brought between 1863 and 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice Shaw]] held that people "are free to work for whom the please, or not to work, if they so prefer" and "to agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights". The abolition of [[slavery]] by [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] during the [[American Civil War]] was necessary to create genuine rights to organize, but was not sufficient to ensure freedom of association. Using the [[Sherman Act of 1890]], which was intended to break up business cartels, the Supreme Court imposed an injunction on striking workers of the [[Pullman Company]], and imprisoned the leader, and future presidential candidate, [[Eugene Debs]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In re Debs]]'', 64 Fed 724 (CC Ill 1894), 158 U.S. 564 (1895)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also enabled unions to be sued for triple damages in ''[[Loewe v Lawlor]]'', a case involving a [[hat maker]] union in [[Danbury, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;208 US 274 (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; The President and [[United States Congress]] responded by passing the [[Clayton Act of 1914]] to take labor out of [[antitrust law]]. Then, after the [[Great Depression]] passed the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] to positively protect the right to organize and take collective action. After that, the law increasingly turned to regulate unions' internal affairs. The [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]] regulated how members can join a union, and the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959]] created a "bill of rights" for union members.

[[File:Richard Trumka 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Trumka]] is the President of the [[AFL-CIO]], a federation of unions, with 12.5m members. The [[Change to Win Federation]] has 5.5m members in affiliated unions. The two have negotiated merging to create a united American labor movement.]]
While union governance is founded upon [[freedom of association]], the law requires basic standards of democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[ILO]] [[Freedom of Association Convention 1948]] c 87, art 3(1) "Workers' and employers' organisations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes."&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, all unions are democratic organizations,&lt;ref&gt;See historically TW Glocker, ''The Government of American Trade Unions'' (1913) ch XI, and [[American Civil Liberties Union]], ''Democracy in Trade Unions: A survey, with a program of action'' (1943)&lt;/ref&gt; but they divide between those where members elect delegates, who in turn choose the executive, and those where members directly elect the executive. In 1957, after the [[McClellan Committee]] of the [[US Senate]] found evidence of two rival [[Teamsters Union]] executives, [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and [[Dave Beck]], falsifying delegate vote counts and stealing union funds,&lt;ref&gt;See the [[McClellan Committee]], ''Interim Report of the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field'', S Rep No 1417, 85th Cong, 2d Sess 60 ff. Summarized by JR Grodin, ''Union Government and the Law: British and American Experiences'' (1961) 158–159. There was minor wrongdoing found in four other unions, recounted in [[RF Kennedy]], ''[[The Enemy Within (Kennedy book)|The Enemy Within]]'' (1960) 190–212. At the [[Bakery and Confectionary Workers]], the president had doubled his salary. At the [[Allied Trades Unions]] the Vice President made a self-dealing transaction. At the [[International Union of Operating Engineers]] officials had extorted money from employers. At the [[United Textile Workers Union]], the president and treasurer bought second homes.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959]]. Under §411, every member has the right to vote, attend meetings, speak freely and organize, not have fees raised without a vote, not be deprived of the right to sue, or be suspended unjustly.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section411&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §411]&lt;/ref&gt; Under §431, unions should file their constitutions and bylaws with the [[Secretary of Labor]] and be accessible by members:&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter11/subchapter5&amp;edition=prelim §481]&lt;/ref&gt; today union constitutions are online. Under §481 elections must occur at least every 5 years, and local officers every 3 years, by secret ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter11/subchapter5&amp;edition=prelim §481]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, state law may bar union officials who have prior convictions for felonies from holding office.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Veau v. Braisted]]'', {{ussc|363|144|1960}} 5 to 3, the dissenting judges argued that state law could introduce no additional requirement to those in the [[NLRA 1935]]. See also ''[[Brown v. Hotel and Restaurant Employees]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|468|491|1984}} 4 to 3, New Jersey could impose a requirement that all union officials in a casino had no association with organized crime, consistently with [[NLRA 1935]] §7. The dissent argued that the requirement was disproportionate because it applied penalties to the whole union rather than the officials.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to the Hoffa and Beck scandals, there is also an express [[fiduciary duty]] on union officers for members' money, limits on loans to executives, requirements for bonds for handling money, and up to a $10,000 fine or up to 5 years prison for [[embezzlement]]. These rules, however, restated most of what was already the law, and codified principles of governance that unions already undertook.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. JR Grodin, ''Union Government and the Law: British and American Experiences'' (1961) 159, "there is little doubt that in nearly every case [against Beck] a court would agree that conduct found by the committee to be "improper" was also a violation of the union officer's fiduciary obligation. So far as substance, as distinguished from remedy, is concerned, it appears that existing common law [was] probably adequate."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, under §501(b) to bring a lawsuit, a union member must first make a demand on the executive to correct wrongdoing before any claim can be made to a court, even for misapplication of funds, and potentially wait four months' time. The Supreme Court has held that union members can intervene in enforcement proceedings brought by the [[US Department of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trbovich v. United Mine Workers]]'', {{ussc|404|528|1972}} See also ''[[Hall v Cole]]'', {{ussc|412|1|1973}} holding that if plaintiffs are successful, they can be awarded fees.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal courts may review decisions by the Department to proceed with any prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dunlop v. Bachowski]]'', {{ussc|421|560|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of rights, and the level of enforcement has meant that labor unions display significantly higher standards of accountability, with fewer scandals, than corporations or [[financial institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;For a contrasting set of views, compare MJ Nelson, 'Slowing Union Corruption: Reforming the Landrum-Griffin Act to Better Combat Union Embezzlement’ (1999–2000) 8 George Mason Law Review 527&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sharan Burrow World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sharan Burrow]] leads the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], which represents labor union members worldwide, via each national group including the [[AFL-CIO]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [[ITUC]], ''[http://www.ituc-csi.org/IMG/pdf/Const-ENG-W.pdf Constitution]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Beyond members rights within a labor union, the most controversial issue has been how people become members in unions. This affects union membership numbers, and whether labor rights are promoted or suppressed in democratic politics. Historically, unions made [[collective agreements]] with employers that all new workers would have to join the union. This was to prevent employers trying to dilute and divide union support, and ultimately refuse to improve wages and conditions in [[collective bargaining]]. However, after the [[Taft-Hartley Act 1947]], the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] §158(a)(3) was amended to ban employers from refusing to hire a non-union employee. An employee can be required to join the union (if such a collective agreement is in place) after 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section158&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §158(a)(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; But §164(b) was added to codify a right of states to pass so called "[[right to work law]]s" that prohibit unions making collective agreements to register all workers as union members, or collect fees for the service of collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section164&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §164(b)]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, as more states with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governments passed laws restricting union membership agreements, there has been a significant decline of [[union density]]. Unions have not, however, yet experimented with agreements to [[automatically enroll]] employees in unions with a right to opt out. In ''[[Machinists v Street]]'', a majority of the [[US Supreme Court]], against three dissenting justices, held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] precluded making an employee become a union member against their will, but it would be lawful to collect fees to reflect the benefits from collective bargaining: fees could not be used for spending on political activities without the member's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|periods=no|367|740|1961}}, states that "a union may constitutionally compel contributions from dissenting nonmembers in an agency shop only for the costs of performing the union's statutory duties as exclusive bargaining agent." See also ''[[Lincoln Fed Labor Union 19129 v. Northwestern Iron &amp; Metal Co]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|335|525|1949}}. ''[[Communications Workers of America v. Beck]]'', {{ussc|periods=no|487|735|1988}} 5 to 3 that unions could have an agreement with employers that fees be collected to pay for the union's activities, but only up to the point that it was necessary to cover its costs. ''[[Locke v. Karass]]'', 129 S Ct 798 (2008) legitimate costs included the Maine State Employees Association's costs for in national arbitration litigation.&lt;/ref&gt; Unions have always been entitled to publicly campaign for members of Congress or presidential candidates that support [[labor rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations]]'', 335 U.S. 106 (1948) there was no violation of the [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act 1910]] in a union publicly advocating for particular Congress members to be elected.&lt;/ref&gt; But the urgency of political spending was raised when in 1976 ''[[Buckley v Valeo]]'' decided, over powerful dissents of [[White J]] and [[Marshall J]], that candidates could spend unlimited money on their own political campaign,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Buckley v Valeo]]'', 424 US 1 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; and then in ''[[First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti]]'',&lt;ref&gt;435 US 765 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; that corporations could engage in election spending. In 2010, over four dissenting justices, ''[[Citizens United v FEC]]''&lt;ref&gt;558 US 310 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; held there could be essentially no limits to corporate spending. By contrast, every other democratic country caps spending (usually as well as regulating donations) as the original [[Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]] had intended to do. A unanimous court held in ''[[Abood v Detroit School Board]]'' that [[union security agreements]] to collect fees from non-members were also allowed in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;431 US 209 (1977) See further ''[[Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association]]'', 500 US 507 (1991) 5 to 4, the union can require nonmembers to give service fee contributions only for its activities as an exclusive bargaining agent, and not for political activities. Also ''[[Davenport v. Washington Education Association]]'', 551 US 177 (2007) state legislation could require, consistently with the First Amendment, that a union member opts into the fund for political expenditure.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Harris v Quinn]]'' five [[US Supreme Court]] judges reversed this ruling apparently banning public sector union security agreements,&lt;ref&gt;573 US __ (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and were about to do the same for all unions in ''[[Friedrichs v California Teachers Association]]'' until [[Scalia J]] died, halting an anti-labor majority on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;578 US __ (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''[[Janus v AFSCME]]'' the Supreme Court held by 5 to 4 that collecting union fees in public sector employees violated the First Amendment. The dissenting judges repeated that union fees merely paid for benefits of collective bargaining that non-members otherwise received for free. These factors led campaign finance reform to be one of the most important issues in the [[2016 US Presidential election]], for the future of the labor movement, and democratic life.

===Collective bargaining===
{{Slist collective bargain}}
{{main|Collective bargaining|Arbitration in the US|National Labor Relations Act 1935|Taft-Hartley Act 1947|Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute|Railway Labor Act of 1926}}
Since the [[industrial revolution]], collective bargaining has been the main way to get [[fair pay]], improved conditions, and a voice at work. The need for positive rights to organize and bargain was gradually appreciated after the [[Clayton Act of 1914]]. Under §6,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section17&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 15 USC §17]&lt;/ref&gt; labor rights were declared to be outside of [[antitrust law]], but this did not stop hostile employers and courts suppressing unions. In ''[[Adair v United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1908/23.html 208 US 161] (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Coppage v Kansas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;236 US 1 (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]], over powerful dissents,&lt;ref&gt;In ''Adair'', from [[Holmes J]] and [[McKenna J]], and in ''Coppage'' from [[Holmes J]], [[Day J]] and [[Hughes J]]&lt;/ref&gt; asserted the Constitution empowered employers to require employees to sign [[yellow dog contracts|contracts]] promising they would not join a union. These "[[yellow dog contracts]]" were offered to employees on a "[[Hobson's choice|take it or leave it]]" basis, and effectively stopped unionization. They lasted until the [[Great Depression]] when the [[Norris–La Guardia Act of 1932]] banned them.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter6&amp;edition=prelim §§101–115]. This was approved and applied by ''[[New Negro Alliance v Sanitary Grocery Co]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1938/101.html 303 US 552] (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; This also prevented the courts from issuing any injunctions or enforcing any agreements in the context of a labor dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter6&amp;edition=prelim §104]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[United States presidential election, 1932|landslide election]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] was drafted to create positive rights for collective bargaining in most of the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;This reenacted labor provisions from the [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]], after ''[[A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp v United States]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1935/122.html 295 US 495] (1935) struck it down.&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to create a system of federal rights so that, under §157, employees would gain the legal "right to self-organization", "to bargain collectively" and use "concerted activities" including strikes for "mutual aid or other protection".&lt;ref&gt;[[NLRA 1935]], [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section157&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §157], "Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection."&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was meant to increase [[bargaining power]] of employees to get better terms in than individual contracts with employing corporations. However §152 excluded many groups of workers, such as state and [[Federal Labor Relations Act of 1978|federal government employees]],&lt;ref&gt;[[NLRA 1935]], [[29 USC]] §152(2). See the [[Federal Labor Relations Act of 1978]]. There are special rules for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Railway Labor Act of 1926|railway and airline]] staff,&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section152&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §152(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; domestic and [[Agriculture in the United States|agriculture]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] §158(3)&lt;/ref&gt; These groups depend on special federal statutes like the [[Railway Labor Act of 1926]] or state law rules, like the [[California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975]]. In 1979, five [[US Supreme Court]] judges, over four forceful dissents, also introduced an exception for church operated schools, apparently because of "serious [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] questions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1979/47.html 440 US 490] (1979) [[Brennan J]] for the four dissenting justices said an exception for this employer was not in §152(2), it was twice rejected in 1935 and 1947, it was "invented by the Court for the purpose of deciding this case", and was a "cavalier exercise in statutory interpretation". Joined by [[White J]], [[Marshall J]], [[Blackmun J]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "independent contractors" are excluded, even though many are economically dependent workers. Some courts have attempted to expand the "independent contractor" exception. In 2009, in ''[[FedEx Home Delivery v NLRB]]'' the [[United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia|DC Circuit]], adopting submissions of [[FedEx]]'s lawyer [[Ted Cruz]], held that post truck drivers were independent contractors because they took on "entrepreneurial opportunity". [[Garland J]] dissented, arguing the majority had departed from common law tests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=563+F3d+492+(DC+2009)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;case=15820652359117123721&amp;scilh=0 563 F3d 492] (DC 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The "independent contractor" category was estimated to remove protection from 8 million workers.&lt;ref&gt;R Eisenbrey and L Mishel, 'Supervisor in Name Only: Union Rights of Eight Million Workers at Stake in Labor Board Ruling' (2006) [http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/issuebriefs/225/ib225.pdf Economic Policy Institute Issue Brief #225]&lt;/ref&gt; While many states have higher rates, the US has an 11.1 per cent [[unionization rate]] and 12.3 per cent rate of [[coverage by collective agreement]].

Union membership was 7.4% in private sector, but 39% in the public sector. In the five largest states, California has 15.9% union membership, [[Texas]] 4.5%, Florida 6.8%, [[New York (state)|New York]] 24.7% (the highest in the country), and [[Illinois]] 15.2%.

Between 2007 and 2013 the NLRB was shut down as the President and then [[United States Senate|Senate]] refused to make appointments.]]
At any point employers can freely bargain with union representatives and make a [[collective agreement]]. Under [[NLRA 1935]] §158(d) the mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment".&lt;ref&gt;[[NLRA 1935]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/158 29 USC §158(d)]. See ''[[NLRB v Borg-Warner Corp]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1958/76.html 356 US 342] (1958) Burton J held an employer refused to bargain unlawfully by insisting on a clause requiring a pre-strike ballot of employees. Harlan J dissented. See also ''[[First National Maintenance Corp v NLRB]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1981/155.html 452 US 666] (1981) holding there was no mandatory duty to bargain over First National Maintenance Corp's "decision to terminate its Greenpark Care Center operation and to discharge the workers". Brennan J, joined by Marshall J, dissented saying the majority "states that "bargaining over management decisions that have a substantial impact on the continued availability of employment should be required only if the benefit, for labor-management relations and the collective-bargaining process, outweighs the burden placed on the conduct of the business." ... I cannot agree with this test, because it takes into account only the interests of management; it fails to consider the legitimate employment interests of the workers and their union."&lt;/ref&gt; A collective agreement will typically aim to get rights including a [[fair day's wage for a fair day's work]], reasonable notice and severance pay before any necessary [[layoff]]s, [[just cause]] for any job termination, and [[Arbitration in the United States|arbitration]] to resolve disputes. It could also extend to any subject by mutual agreement. A union can encourage an employing entity through [[collective action]] to sign a deal, without using the [[NLRA 1935]] procedure. But, if an employing entity refuses to deal with a union, and a union wishes, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) may oversee a legal process up to the conclusion of a legally binding [[collective agreement]]. By law, the NLRB is meant to have five members "appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the [[US Senate|Senate]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section153&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §153]&lt;/ref&gt; and play a central role in promoting collective bargaining. First, the NLRB will determine an appropriate "[[bargaining unit]]" of employees with employers (e.g., offices in a city, or state, or whole economic sector),&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section159&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §159(b)].&lt;/ref&gt; The NLRB favors "[[enterprise bargaining]]" over "[[sectoral collective bargaining]]", which means US unions have traditionally been smaller with less [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] by international standards. Second, a union with "majority" support of employees in a bargaining unit becomes "the exclusive representatives of all the employees".&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section159&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §159(a)]&lt;/ref&gt; But to ascertain majority support, the NLRB supervises the fairness of elections among the workforce. It is typical for the NLRB to take six weeks from a petition from workers to an election being held.&lt;ref&gt;[[BI Sachs]], 'Revitalizing labor law' (2010) 31(2) BJELL 335–6&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, managers may attempt to persuade or coerce employees using high-pressure tactics or [[unfair labor practices]] (e.g. threatening job termination, alleging unions will bankrupt the firm) to vote against recognizing the union. The average time for the [[NLRB]] to decide upon complaints of [[unfair labor practices]] had grown to 483 days in 2009 when its last annual report was written.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Labor Relations Board]], ''[https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/basic-page/node-1677/nlrb2009.pdf Seventy Fourth Annual Report]'' (2009) 152&lt;/ref&gt; Third, if a union does win majority support in a bargaining unit election, the employing entity will have an "obligation to bargain collectively". This means meeting union representatives "at reasonable times and confer in [[good faith]] with respect to wages, hours, and other terms" to put in a "written contract". The NLRB cannot compel an employer to agree, but it was thought that the NLRB's power to sanction an employer for an "unfair labor practice" if they did not bargain in good faith would be sufficient. For example, in ''[[JI Case Co v NLRB]]'' the [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held an employer could not refuse to bargain on the basis that individual contracts were already in place.&lt;ref&gt;321 US 332 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, in ''[[Wallace Corp v NLRB]]'' the Supreme Court also held that an employer only bargaining with a [[company union]], which it dominated, was an [[unfair labor practice]]. The employer should have recognized the truly [[independent union]] affiliated to the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).&lt;ref&gt;323 US 248 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[NLRB v Sands Manufacturing Co]]'' the Supreme Court held an employer did not commit an unfair trade practice by shutting down a water heater plant, while the union was attempting to prevent new employees being paid less.&lt;ref&gt;306 US 332 (1939) 5 to 2&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, after 2007 President [[George W. Bush]] and the [[US Senate|Senate]] refused to make any appointments to the Board, and it was held by five judges, over four dissents, in ''[[New Process Steel LP v NLRB]]'' that rules made by two remaining members were ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;560 US 674 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; While appointments were made in 2013, agreement was not reached on one vacant seat. Increasingly it has been made politically unfeasible for the [[NLRB]] to act to promote collective bargaining.

[[File:Bernie Sanders &amp; Hillary Clinton (28205920271).jpg|thumb|right|The proposed [[Employee Free Choice Act]], sponsored repeatedly by [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Bernie Sanders]] and Democrat representatives, would require employers to bargain in 90 days or go to arbitration, if a simple majority of employees sign cards supporting the union.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 1409, [https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/560/text S. 560].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been blocked by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s in [[United States Congress|Congress]].]]
Once collective agreements have been signed, they are legally enforceable, often through [[Arbitration in the United States|arbitration]], and ultimately in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section185&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §185] and see ''[[Textile Workers Union of America v Lincoln Mills]]'' 353 US 448 (1957) holding federal law is to be applied to promote national uniformity and carry out policies in the national labor laws.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal law must be applied for national uniformity, so state courts must apply federal law when asked to deal with collective agreements or the dispute can be removed to federal court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Charles Dowd Box Co v Courtney]]'', 368 US 502 (1962) Also ''[[Avco Corporation v Machinists, Aero Lodge 735]]'', 390 US 557 (1968) suits to enforce collective agreements may be removed from state court to federal court.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, collective agreements include provisions for sending grievances of employees or disputes to binding [[arbitration]], governed by the [[Federal Arbitration Act of 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;[[9 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title9/chapter1&amp;edition=prelim §§1 ff]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[United Steelworkers v Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co]]'' a group of employees at a steel transportation works in [[Chickasaw]], [[Alabama]] requested the corporation go to [[arbitration]] over layoffs and outsourcing of 19 staff on lower pay to do the same jobs. The [[United Steelworkers]] had a collective agreement which contained a provision for arbitration. [[Douglas J]] held that any doubts about whether the agreement allowed the issue to go to arbitration "should be resolved in favor of coverage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1960/109.html 363 US 574] (1960) See also ''[[United Steelworkers v American Manufacturing Co]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1960/107.html 363 US 564] (1960) construction or interpretation of an agreement is for the arbitrator, not the court to decide, and the court must order arbitration even if a claim made seems frivolous.&lt;/ref&gt; An arbitrator's award is entitled to judicial enforcement so long as its essence is from the collective agreement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Steelworkers v Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1960/108.html 363 US 593] (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Courts can decline to enforce an agreement based on [[public policy]], but this is different from "general considerations of supposed public interests".&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Paperworkers v Misco, Inc]]'' 484 US 29 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; But while federal policy had encouraged arbitration where unions and employers had made agreements, the [[US Supreme Court]] drew a clear distinction for arbitration over individual statutory rights. In ''[[Alexander v Gardner-Denver Co]]'' an employee claimed he was unjustly terminated, and suffered unlawful [[race discrimination]] under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The Supreme Court held that he was entitled to pursue remedies both through arbitration and the public courts, which could re-evaluate the claim whatever the arbitrator had decided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1974/19.html 415 US 36] (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; But then, in 2009 in ''[[14 Penn Plaza LLC v Pyett]]'' [[Thomas J]] announced with four other judges that apparently "[n]othing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements [[Inequality of bargaining power|signed by an individual employee]] and those agreed to by a union representative."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|=noperiods|556|247|2009}} joined by [[Roberts CJ]], [[Scalia J]], [[Kennedy J]] and [[Alito J]]&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that a group of employees were denied the right to go to a public court under the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]], and instead potentially be heard only by arbitrators their employer selected. [[Stevens J]] and [[Souter J]], joined by [[Ginsburg J]], [[Breyer J]] dissented, pointing out that rights cannot be waived even by collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v Concepcion]]'', {{ussc|=noperiods|563|333|2011}} another 5 to 4 decision on consumers.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011]] has been proposed to reverse this, urging that "employees have little or no meaningful choice whether to submit their claims to arbitration".&lt;ref&gt;S.987 and H.R.1873&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear why [[NLRA 1935]] §1, recognizing workers' "[[inequality of bargaining power]]" was not considered relevant to ensure that collective bargaining can only improve upon rights, rather than take them away. To address further perceived defects of the [[NLRA 1935]] and the [[US Supreme Court]]'s interpretations, major proposed reforms have included the [[Labor Reform Act of 1977]],&lt;ref&gt;HR 8410, 95th Cong (1977) S 1883, 95th Cong (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Workplace Democracy Act of 1999]], and the [[Employee Free Choice Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;HR 1409. S 560.&lt;/ref&gt; All focus on speeding the election procedure for union recognition, speeding hearings for [[unfair labor practices]], and improving remedies within the existing structure of labor relations.

To ensure that employees are effectively able to bargain for a collective agreement, the [[NLRA 1935]] created a group of rights in §158 to stall "[[unfair labor practices]]" by employers. These were considerably amended by the [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]], where the [[US Congress]] over the veto of President [[Harry S. Truman]] decided to add a list of unfair labor practices for labor unions. This has meant that union organizing in the US may involve substantial levels of [[litigation]] which most workers cannot afford. The fundamental principle of freedom of association, however, is recognized worldwide to require various rights. It extends to the state, so in ''[[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]]'' held the [[New Jersey]] mayor violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] when trying to shut down [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] meetings because he thought they were "communist".&lt;ref&gt;307 US 496 (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Among many rights and duties relating to unfair labor practices, five main groups of case have emerged.

[[File:Weltec stopwork meeting, 19 March 2009 (3367324864).jpg|thumb|left|[[Unfair labor practices]], made unlawful by the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] §153, prohibit employers discriminating against people who organize a union and [[vote]] to get a [[voice at work]].]]
First, under §158(a)(3)-(4) a person who joins a union must suffer no discrimination or retaliation in their chances for being hired, terms of their work, or in termination.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section158&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §158]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one of the first cases, ''[[NLRB v Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp]]'', the US Supreme held that the [[National Labor Relations Board]] was entitled to order workers be rehired after they had been dismissed for organizing a union at their plant in [[Aliquippa]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1937/80.html 301 US 1] (1937) Hughes CJ statd "a single employee was helpless in dealing with an employer; that he was dependent ordinarily on his daily wage for the maintenance of himself and family; that, if the employer refused to pay him the wages that he thought fair, he was nevertheless unable to leave the employ and resist arbitrary and unfair treatment; that union was essential to give laborers opportunity to deal on an equality with their employer."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unlawful for employers to monitor employees who are organizing, for instance by parking outside a union meeting,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Filler Products Inc v NLRB]]'' 376 F2d 369 (4th 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; or videotaping employees giving out union fliers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Sunbelt Manufacturing Inc, AFL-CIO]]'', 308 NLRB 780 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This can include giving people incentives or bribes to not join a union. So in ''[[NLRB v Erie Resistor Corp]]'' the Supreme Court held it was unlawful to give 20 years extra seniority to employees who crossed a [[picket line]] while the union had called a strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1963/94.html 373 US 221] (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; Second, and by contrast, the Supreme Court had decided in ''[[Textile Workers Union of America v Darlington Manufacturing Co Inc]]'' that actually shutting down a recently unionized division of an enterprise was lawful, unless it was proven that the employer was motivated by hostility to the union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1965/60.html 380 US 263] (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Third, union members need the right to be represented, in order to carry out basic functions of collective bargaining and settle grievances or disciplinary hearings with management. This entails a [[duty of fair representation]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild Inc.]]'', 525 US 33 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[NLRB v J Weingarten, Inc]]'' the Supreme Court held that an employee in a unionized workplace had the right to a union representative present in a management interview, if it could result in disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;420 US 251 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[NLRB]] has changed its position with different political appointees, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|DC Circuit]] has held the same right goes that non-union workers were equally entitled to be accompanied.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epilepsy Foundation of North-east Ohio v NLRB]]'' (DC 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, under §158(a)(5) it is an unfair labor practice to refuse to bargain in good faith, and out of this a right has developed for a union to receive information necessary to perform collective bargaining work. However, in ''[[Detroit Edison Co v NLRB]]'' the Supreme Court divided 5 to 4 on whether a union was entitled to receive individual testing scores from a program the employer used.&lt;ref&gt;440 US 301 (1979) Stevens, White, Brennan, Marshall J dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in ''[[Lechmere, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board]]'' the Supreme Court held 6 to 3 that an employer was entitled to prevent union members, who were not employees, from entering the company parking lot to hand out leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;502 US 527 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth, there are a large group of cases concerning "unfair" practices of labor organizations, listed in §158(b). For example, in ''[[Pattern Makers League of North America v NLRB]]'' an employer claimed a union had committed an unfair practice by attempting to enforce fines against employees who had been members, but quit during a strike when their membership agreement promised they would not. Five judges to four dissents held that such fines could not be enforced against people who were no longer union members.&lt;ref&gt;473 US 95 (1985) Blackmun, Brennan, Marshall, Stevens J dissented.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United States union membership and inequality, top 1% income share, 1910 to 2010.png|thumb|400px|As [[Union membership rate|union membership]] declined [[income inequality]] rose, because labor unions have been the main way to participate at work.&lt;ref&gt;Sources: E McGaughey, 'Do corporations increase inequality?'

The [[US Supreme Court]] policy of [[Federal preemption|preemption]], developed from 1953,&lt;ref&gt;See [[A Cox]] and MJ Seidman, 'Federalism and Labor Relations' (1950) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1336175 64 Harvard Law Review 211] called for 'an integrated public labor policy' and warned 'enforcement of... state regulation will thwart the development of federal policy.' [[A Cox]], Federalism in the Law of Labor Relations (1954) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1336794 67 Harvard Law Review 1297] argued for a 'rule of total federal preemption' for 'uniformity'. [[A Cox]], 'Labor Law Preemption Revisited' (1972) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1340014 85 Harvard Law Review 1337].&lt;/ref&gt; means that states cannot legislate where the [[NLRA 1935]] does operate. The [[NLRA 1935]] contains no clause requiring [[Federal preemption|preemption]] as is found, for example, in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act 1938]] §218(a) where deviations from the minimum wage or maximum hours are preempted, unless they are more beneficial to the employee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section218&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 29 USC §218(a)].&lt;/ref&gt; The first major case, ''[[Garner v Teamsters Local 776]]'', decided a [[Pennsylvania]] statute was preempted from providing superior remedies or processing claims quicker than the [[NLRB]] because "the Board was vested with power to entertain petitioners' grievance, to issue its own complaint" and apparent "Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1953/113.html 346 US 485] (1953) per Jackson J&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the [[California Supreme Court]] was not entitled to award remedies against a union for picketing, because if "an activity is arguably subject to §7 or §8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1959/66.html 359 US 236] (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; This was true, even though the NLRB had not given any ruling on the dispute because its monetary value was too small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1959/66.html 359 US 236] (1959) as [[Frankfurter J]] put it, "because the amount of interstate commerce involved did not meet the Board's monetary standards in taking jurisdiction...."&lt;/ref&gt; This reasoning was extended in ''[[Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission]]'', where a [[Wisconsin]] Employment Relations Commission sought to hold a union liable for an unfair labor practice, by refusing to work overtime.

In ''[[Golden State Transit Corp v City of Los Angeles]]'' a majority of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that Los Angeles was not entitled to refuse to renew a taxi company's franchise license because the [[Teamsters Union]] had pressured it not to until a dispute was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1986/62.html 475 US 608] (1986) [[Rehnquist J]] dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently in ''[[Chamber of Commerce v Brown]]'' seven judges on the Supreme Court held that California was preempted from passing a law prohibiting any recipient of state funds either from using money to promote or deter union organizing efforts. [[Breyer J]] and [[Ginsburg J]] dissented because the law was simply neutral to the bargaining process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2008/22.html 522 US 60] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; State governments may, however, use their funds to procure corporations to do work that are union or labor friendly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1993/27.html 507 US 218] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1904socialist.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eugene V. Debs]], founder of the [[American Railway Union]] and five-time presidential candidate, was jailed twice for organizing the [[Pullman Strike]] and denouncing [[World War I]]. His life story is told in a documentary by Bernie Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Jane Sanders]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY2mQxm4SNQ Eugene V. Debs Documentary] (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The right of labor to take [[collective action]], including the [[right to strike]], has been fundamental to [[Commonwealth v Hunt|common law]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commonwealth v Hunt]]'' 45 Mass. 111 (1842) decided that a union called the "Boston Journeymen Bootmakers' Society" was entitled to strike against an employer who hired non-union members. [[Shaw CJ]] held that pre-Independence English cases creating liability for "conspiracy" in organizing a union no longer applied. Contrast ''[[R v Journeymen-Taylors of Cambridge]]'' (1721) 88 ER 9&lt;/ref&gt; federal law, and [[International labour law|international law]] for over a century. Today it is accepted that, as New York teacher unions argued in the 1960s, "If you can’t call a strike you don’t have real [[collective bargaining]], you have 'collective [[begging]].'"&lt;ref&gt;See the article by a first year Columbia Law Student, Lawrence J. Siegel, ‘The unique bargaining relationship of the New York City Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers’ (1964)  1 Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Forum 1, 46, referred to Jules Kolodney, during teacher strikes, ‘In New York, you can’t have true collective bargaining without the implied threat of a strike. If you can’t call a strike you don’t have real collective bargaining, you have ‘collective begging.’ ... Never give up the right of withholding services; have a threat in the background; the leverage of a strike possibility. We must awaken the public to the fact that the largest single employer in the United States is Government. We could become a nation that can’t strike, and that is moving towards Totalitarianism.’ Further, A Anderson, ‘Labor Relations in the Public Service’ [1961] Wisconsin Law Review 601, as ‘Collective conferences, collective negotiation, collective dealing, and even collective begging have been used to describe the public employer employee relations.’&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after slavery was abolished over the 19th century, courts in different states conflicted with each other over the extent of the right to strike: some courts continued to frustrate strikes and issued injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;See EE Witte, ‘Early American Labor Cases’ (1926) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/789460 35 Yale Law Journal 829], employers brought at least three successful claims against their employees before 1863, and fifteen up to 1880 for "conspiracy". See also FB Sayre, ‘Criminal Conspiracy’ (1922) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1328648 35 Harvard Law Review 393]. W Holt, ‘Labor Conspiracy Cases in the United States, 1805-1842: Bias and Legitimation in Common Law Adjudication’ (1984) [http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1913&amp;context=ohlj 22 Osgoode Hall Law Journal 591]. ‘Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations in the Nineteenth Century’ (1980) 93 Harvard Law Review 1510.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sherman Act of 1890]], which was intended to prohibit business combinations in [[restraint of trade]], was first used against labor unions. This resulted in [[Eugene Debs]], [[American Railway Union]] leader and future [[Socialist]] Presidential candidate being imprisoned for taking part in the [[Pullman Strike]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In re Debs]]'', 64 Fed 724 (CC Ill 1894), 158 US 564 (1895)&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court persisted in ''[[Loewe v Lawlor]]'' in imposing damages for strikes under [[antitrust law]],&lt;ref&gt;208 US 274 (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; until Congress passed the [[Clayton Act of 1914]]. Seen as "the [[Magna Carta]] of America's workers",&lt;ref&gt;See [[Samuel Gompers]], 'Labor and the War: the Movement for Universal Peace Must Assume the Aggressive' (October 1914) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015034112782;view=1up;seq=874 XXI(1) American Federationist 849, 860].&lt;/ref&gt; this proclaimed that all collective action by workers was outside antitrust law under the [[commerce clause]], because "[[labor is not a commodity]] or article of commerce". The same principle entered the founding documents of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Versailles Treaty 1919]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_International_Labour_Office#Article_427 art 427] and the right to strike is now embedded in core Conventions of [[international labor law]]. See B Gernigon, A Odero and H Guido, ‘ILO Principles Concerning the Right to Strike’ (1998) 137 International Labour Review 441, 461-5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the end of the ''[[Lochner era]]''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Coppage v Kansas]]'' 236 US 1 (1915) purported to allow employees to sign a contract with their employer promising to not join a union (a "[[yellow dog contract]]"). ''[[Duplex Printing Press Co v Deering]]'', 254 US 443 (1921) holding that the Clayton Act of 1914 §17 did not enable secondary action. ''[[Truax v Corrigan]]'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Truax_v._Corrigan/Dissent_Brandeis 257 US 312] (1921) Brandeis J, dissenting, struck down an Arizona law under the 14th amendment that prohibited any injunction against peaceful strikes. The [[Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act of 1932]] was subsequently passed to void contracts promising to not join a union, and articulated that no federal court could pass an injunction to stop any non-violent labor dispute. Roughly half the states have enacted their own version of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] successfully enshrined in §157 the right "to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection" and in §163 the "right to strike".&lt;ref&gt;[[NLRA 1935]] 29 USC §§157 and 163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:What the Communications Workers Strike is About - Bernie Sanders.webm|thumb|right|2016 Presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] joined the [[Communication Workers of America|Communication Workers Union]] strike against [[Verizon]]. American workers face serious obstacles to strike action, falling below [[international labor law]] standards.]]
Although the "right to strike" is guaranteed by federal law, American [[labor unions]] face the most severe constraints on freedom in the developed world in the (1) purposes for which people can strike, (2) number of employers they can strike against, (3) procedures for taking strikes, (4) absence of protection from dismissal or replacement, and (5) fierce sanctions against unions for "unfair labor practices".

*(1) purposes for which strikes are allowed
**[[Boston Police Strike]] of 1919
**[[Protected concerted activity]]. §8(g) for health care, 10 days notice. 
**''[[NLRB v City Disposal Systems, Inc]]'' 465 US 822 (1984) protected an unprotected concerted activity, one man, Brown, without the union was allowed to refuse to work on unsafe machinery
**''[[New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.]]'', 303 US 552 (1938) boycott and picket of shop that refused to hire African-American workers was lawful.
*(2) against which employers
**''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'', 310 U.S. 88 (1940) picketing could not be restricted by state law, as that would violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], so long as the picket was related to a labor dispute in issue.
**''[[NLRB v Truck Drivers Local 449]]'' 353 US 87 (1957) seven employers were allowed to lockout their workers despite the union going on strike against a different employer within a multi-bargaining unit
**''[[Edward J. DeBartolo Corp v Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Construction Trades Council]]'' 485 US 568 (1988) Secondary boycotts
**''[[National Woodword Manufacturers Association v NLRB]]'' 386 US 612 (1967) Hot cargo agreements under §8(e) and work preservation under §8(b)(4)(ii)(A)-(B)

[[File:Cesar Chavez Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cesar Chavez]] organized the [[United Farm Workers]] and campaigned for [[social justice]] under the slogan "[[Yes We Can (slogan)|Yes we can]]" and "[[Sí, se puede]]".&lt;ref&gt;See '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLqDu5yZj0M Cesar Chavez Explains Boycotts]' and '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlLs_fVBWzM Cesar Chavez speaking at UCLA 10/11/1972]'.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*(3) procedural constraints 
**''[[United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations]]'', 335 US 106 (1948), holding that unions advocating members vote for particular Congress candidates did not violate the [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act]] as amended by the [[Labor Management Relations Act]]
**''[[Eastex, Inc v NLRB]]'' 437 US 556 (1978) distributing union leaflets on company property allowed
**''[[NLRB v Electrical Workers]]'' 346 US 464 (1953) dismissed for disparaging an employer during work
**''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.]]'', 306 U.S. 292 (1939) 5 to 2, held the NLRB had not produced the requisite "substantial evidence" that an employer had acted unlawfully and in directing employment to resume and a lockout to end. The NLRB had attempted to negotiate with an employer on a union's behalf during a lockout.
*(4) no termination protection
**''[[NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co.]]'' 304 U.S. 333 (1938) striking workers remain as employees while on strike, and so it is an unfair labor practice under NLRA 1935 §7 to discriminate in reinstating the workers. However, it was not unfair to hire new workers to break the strike, or to not discharge the strike breakers in order to reinstate the former workers
**''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation]]'', 306 U.S. 240 (1939) employees who took part in an unlawful sit down strike, after the employer had attempted to set up a [[company union]], were not entitled to reinstatement in their jobs. Engaging in an unlawful strike meant losing the protection of the NLRA 1935.
**''[[NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449]]'', 353 U.S. 87 (1957) temporary lockout held to be lawful
**''[[Trans World Airlines, Inc v Flight Attendants]]'' 489 US 426 (1989) employers could promise younger workers senior jobs if they broke a strike. Brennan J, Marshall J, Blackmun J dissented.
*(5) remedies: injunctions, damages, contempt

{{Slist participation}}
While [[collective bargaining]] was stalled by [[US Supreme Court]] [[Federal preemption|preemption]] policy, a dysfunctional [[National Labor Relations Board]], and falling [[union membership rate]] since the [[Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]], employees have demanded direct voting rights at work: for corporate [[boards of directors]], and in [[work councils]] that bind management.&lt;ref&gt;See generally RL Hogler and GJ Grenier, ''Employee Participation and Labor Law in the American Workplace'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This has become an important complement to both strengthening [[collective bargaining]], and securing the votes in labor's capital on [[pension]] boards, which buy and vote on [[US corporate law|corporate stocks]], and control employers.&lt;ref&gt;See D Webber, ''The Rise of the Working Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon'' (2018) and the section above on "[[United States labor law#Pensions|Pensions]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Labor law has increasingly converged with [[US corporate law|corporate law]],&lt;ref&gt;See the popular text by the former Dean of [[Harvard Law School]], [[RC Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' (1986) 32, 'even if your aim is not to understand all of law's effects on corporate activities but only to grasp the basic legal 'constitution' or make-up of the modern corporation, you must, at the very least, also gain a working knowledge of labor law.'&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 the first federal law, the [[Reward Work Act]] was proposed by three US senators to enable employees to vote for one third of the directors on boards of listed companies.&lt;ref&gt;See the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2605/text Reward Work Act, S.2605], sponsored by [[Tammy Baldwin]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], [[Brian Schatz]], joined by [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. In the House, [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr6096 HR 6096] was sponsored by [[Keith Ellison]] and [[Ro Khanna]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, under the Republican governor [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Massachusetts]] became the first state with a right for employees in manufacturing companies to have employee representatives on the board of directors, but only if corporate stockholders voluntarily agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Laws, General Laws, Part I Administration of the Government, Title XII Corporations, [https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156/Section23 ch 156 Business Corporations, §23].

[[File:Greater Boston Labor Council Canvass (8113545366).jpg|thumb|left|In 2018, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] co-sponsored the [[Reward Work Act]] to require one third of boards are elected by employees,&lt;ref&gt;See the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2605/text Reward Work Act, S.2605], sponsored by [[Tammy Baldwin]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], [[Brian Schatz]], joined by [[Kirsten Gillibrand]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Accountable Capitalism Act]] to require 40% on large federal corporations.

[[US corporate law|Corporations]] are chartered under state law, the larger mostly in [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]], but leave investors free to organize voting rights and board representation as they choose.&lt;ref&gt;n.b. The [[New Jersey]] Revised Statute (1957) §14.9–1 to 3 expressly empowered employee representation on boards, but has subsequently been left out of the code. See further JB Bonanno, 'Employee Codetermination: Origins in Germany, present practice in Europe and applicability to the United States’ (1976–1977) 14 Harvard Journal on Legislation 947&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[unequal bargaining power]], but also because of excessive caution among American labor unions about taking on management,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. RA Dahl, 'Power to the Workers?' (November 19, 1970) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1970/11/19/power-to-the-workers/ New York Review of Books] 20&lt;/ref&gt; shareholders have come to monopolize voting rights in American corporations. From the 1970s employees and unions sought representation on company boards. This could happen through [[collective agreements]], as it historically occurred in Germany or other countries, or through employees demanding further representation through [[employee stock ownership plans]], but they aimed for voice independent from capital risks that could not be [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]]. By 1980, workers had attempted to secure board representation at corporations including [[United Airlines]], the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]], and the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;See B Hamer, 'Serving Two Masters: Union Representation on Corporate Boards of Directors’ (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1122261 81(3) Columbia Law Review 639], 640 and 'Labor Unions in the Boardroom: An Antitrust Dilemma’ (1982) [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&amp;context=facpubs 92(1) Yale Law Journal 106]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1974 the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], run by appointees of [[Richard Nixon]], had rejected that employees who held shares in [[AT&amp;T]] were entitled to make shareholder proposals to include employee representatives on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, CCH Federal Securities Law Reporter 79,658 (1974) see JW Markham, 'Restrictions on Shared Decision-Making Authority in American Business' (1975) 11 California Western Law Review 217, 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; This position was eventually reversed expressly by the [[Dodd-Frank Act of 2010]] §971, which subject to rules by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] entitles shareholders to put forward nominations for the board.&lt;ref&gt;This was stalled by litigation in ''[[Business Roundtable v SEC]]'', 647 F3d 1144 (DC Cir 2011). See D Webber, ''The Rise of the Working Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon'' (2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pursuing board seats through shareholder resolutions the [[United Auto Workers]], for example, successfully sought board representation by collective agreement at [[Chrysler]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;JD Blackburn, 'Worker Participation on Corporate Directorates: Is America Ready for Industrial Democracy?’ (1980–1981) 18 Houston Law Review 349&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Steel Workers]] secured board representation in five corporations in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;'The Unions Step on Board' (October 27, 1993) Financial Times&lt;/ref&gt; Some representation plans were linked to [[employee stock ownership plans]], and were open to abuse. At the energy company, [[Enron]], workers were encouraged by management to invest an average of 62.5 per cent of their retirement savings from [[401(k)]] plans in Enron stock against basic principles of prudent, [[Diversification (finance)|diversified investment]], and had no board representation. When Enron collapsed in 2003, employees lost a majority of their pension savings.&lt;ref&gt;PJ Purcell, 'The Enron Bankruptcy and Employer Stock in Retirement Plans' (March 11, 2002) [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/9102.pdf CRS Report for Congress] and JH Langbein, SJ Stabile and BA Wolk, ''Pension and Employee Benefit Law'' (4th edn Foundation 2006) 640–641&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, employees and unions have sought representation because they invest their labor in the firm, and do not want undiversifiable capital risk. Empirical research suggests by 1999 there were at least 35 major employee representation plans with [[worker director]]s, though often linked to corporate stock.&lt;ref&gt;See RB McKersie, 'Union-Nominated Directors: A New Voice in Corporate Governance’ (April 1, 1999) MIT Working Paper.

As well as representation on a corporation's board of directors, or top management, employees have sought binding rights (for instance, over working time, break arrangement, and layoffs) in their organizations through elected [[work councils]]. After the [[National War Labor Board (1918–1919)|National War Labor Board]] was established by the [[Woodrow Wilson]] administration, firms established work councils with some rights throughout the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Industrial Conference Board]], ''Works Councils in the United States'' (1919) Research Report Number 21, 13, found that in 1919 in a survey of 225 work council plans, 120 were created under Federal government supervision, and 105 on employers initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, however, management refused to concede the "right to employ and discharge, the direction of the working forces, and the management of the business" in any way,&lt;ref&gt;NICB, Works Council Manual (1920) Supplemental to Research Report No 21, 25, Appendix, Model Article II(1)&lt;/ref&gt; which from the workforce perspective defeated the object. As the US presidency changed to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] during the 1920s, work "councils" were often instituted by employers that did not have free elections or proceedings, to forestall independent labor unions' right to collective bargaining. For this reason, the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] §158(a)(2) ensured it was an [[unfair labor practice]] for an employer "to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization, or contribute financial or other support to it".&lt;ref&gt;[[NLRA 1935]] §158(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This was designed to enable free work councils, genuinely independent from management, but not dominated work councils or so called "[[company union]]s".&lt;ref&gt;See further ''[[NLRB v Newport News Shipbuilding Co]]'' 308 US 241 (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[work council]] law was passed by the US government in [[Allied-occupied Germany]] called [[Control Council Law, No 22]]. This empowered German workers to organize work councils if elected by democratic methods, with secret ballots, using participation of free labor unions, with basic functions ranging from how to apply [[collective agreements]], regulating health and safety, rules for engagements, dismissals and grievances, proposals for improving work methods, and organizing social and welfare facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Control_Council_Law_No_22_(10_April_1946)_Works_Councils Control Council Law No 22 Works Councils] (April 10, 1946) in Official Gazette of the Control Council for Germany (1945–1946) 43 (R498) arts III-V.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules were subsequently updated and adopted in German law, although American employees themselves did not yet develop a practice of bargaining for work councils, nor did states implement work council rules, even though neither were [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1959/66.html 359 US 236] (1959) holding that state laws are only preempted for bargaining, rather than outcomes (like setting minimum wages, pension rights, health and safety, or workplace representation) which are protected by "§7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under §8... When an activity is arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] in its ''[[Electromation, Inc]]'',&lt;ref&gt;309 NLRB No 163, 142 LRRM 1001 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[EI du Pont de Nemours]]'',&lt;ref&gt;311 NLRB No 88, 143 LRRM 1121 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; decisions confirmed that while management dominated councils were unlawful, genuine and independent work councils would not be. The [[Dunlop Report]] in 1994 produced an inconclusive discussion that favored experimentation with work councils.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor and US Department of Commerce, Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report (1994) 22, 27, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress did propose a [[Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995]] to repeal §158(a)(2), but this was vetoed by President [[Bill Clinton]] as it would have enabled management dominated unions and councils. In 2014, workers at the [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant]], in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], sought to establish a [[work council]]. This was initially supported by management, but its stance changed in 2016, after the [[United Auto Workers]] succeeded in winning a ballot for traditional representation in an exclusive [[bargaining unit]].&lt;ref&gt;J Ramsey, '[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/12/06/vw-chattanooga-unionize-workforce/ VW Chattanooga plant union votes to approve collective bargaining]' (December 6, 2015) autoblog.com and NE Boudette, '[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/business/volkswagen-reverses-courseon-union-at-tennessee-plant.html?_r=0 Volkswagen Reverses Course on Union at Tennessee Plant]' (April 25, 2016) NY Times&lt;/ref&gt; As it stands, employees have no widespread right to vote in American workplaces, which has increased the gap between [[political democracy]] and traditional labor law goals of [[Workplace democracy|workplace]] and [[economic democracy]].

==Equality and discrimination==
{{See also|US employment discrimination law|European labour law|UK employment discrimination law}}
[[File:USMC-09611.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The world's first general equality law, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], followed the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963. The head of the movement, [[Martin Luther King Jr]] told America, "[[I have a dream]] that one day... little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."]]
Since the [[US Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 proclaimed that "all men are created equal",&lt;ref&gt;[[US Declaration of Independence]], "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]....&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US constitution|Constitution]] was progressively amended, and legislation was written, to spread equal rights to all people. While the [[right to vote]] was needed for true political participation, the "[[right to work]]" and "free choice of employment" came to be seen as necessary for "[[life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]".&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948]] and the [[Second Bill of Rights of 1944]].&lt;/ref&gt; After state laws experimented, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Executive Order 8802]] in 1941 set up the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]] to ban discrimination by "race, creed, color or national origin" in the defense industry. The first comprehensive statutes were the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], to limit discrimination by employers between men and women, and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], to stop discrimination based on "[[Racism in the United States|race]], color, [[Religious discrimination in the United States|religion]], sex, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;[[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] §703(a)(1), [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-2&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §2000e-2(a)], "Employers must not refuse to hire, discharge or otherwise discriminated 'against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, more "protected characteristics" were added by state and federal acts. The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]] protects people over age 40. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] requires "reasonable accommodation" to [[Social inclusion|include]] people with disabilities in the workforce. Twenty two state Acts protect people based on [[LGBT employment discrimination in the United States|sexual orientation]] in public and private employment, but [[Equality Act of 2015|proposed federal laws]] have been blocked by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition. There can be no detriment to [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935|union members]], or people who have [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act|served in the military]]. In principle, states may require rights and remedies for employees that go beyond the federal minimum. Federal law has multiple exceptions, but generally requires no [[disparate treatment]] by employing entities, no [[disparate impact]] of formally neutral measures, and enables employers to voluntarily take [[affirmative action]] favoring under-represented people in their workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-2&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §2000e-2(j)]&lt;/ref&gt; The law has not, however, succeeded in eliminating the disparities in income by [[Racial inequality in the United States|race]], health, age or socio-economic background.

===Constitutional rights===
{{Slist constitutional equality}}
{{see also|Equal opportunity|Discrimination}}
The right to equality in employment in the United States comes from at least six major statutes, and limited jurisprudence of the [[US Supreme Court]], leaving the law inconsistent and full of exceptions. Originally, the [[US Constitution]] entrenched gender, race and wealth inequality by enabling states to maintain [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Dred Scott v Sandford]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1856/9.html 60 US 393] (1857). [[US Constitution]] [[Fugitive Slave Clause|Article IV, Section 2]], "no person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due." This was extended by the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], limited by ''[[Prigg v Pennsylvania]]'', 41 US 539 (1842), restored by the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and entrenched by ''[[Ableman v Booth]]'', 62 US 506 (1859)&lt;/ref&gt; reserve the vote to white, property owning men,&lt;ref&gt;On the end of this, see ''[[Harper v Virginia Board of Elections]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1966/58.html 383 US 663] (1966) and contrast ''[[Yick Wo v Hopkins]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1886/197.html 118 US 356], 370 (1886) referring to 'the political franchise of voting' as a 'fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights.'&lt;/ref&gt; and enabling employers to refuse employment to anyone. After the [[Emancipation Proclamation of 1863]] in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendments attempted to enshrined equal civil rights for everyone,&lt;ref&gt;Contrast the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', 83 US 36 (1873) holding that states were entitled to regulate or shut down slaughter houses, causing pollution, without violating the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Privileges or Immunities Clause|clause]] that "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States".&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]],&lt;ref&gt;[[42 USC]] §1981(a)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Civil Rights Act of 1875|1875]] spelled out that everyone had the right to make contracts, hold [[property]] and access accommodation, transport and entertainment without discrimination. However, in 1883 the [[US Supreme Court]] in the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' put an end to development by declaring that [[US Congress|Congress]] was not allowed to regulate the actions of private individuals rather than public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1883/182.html 109 US 3] (1883)&lt;/ref&gt; In his dissent, [[Harlan J]] would have held that no "corporation or individual wielding power under state authority for the public benefit" was entitled to "discriminate against freemen or citizens, in their civil rights".&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Plessy v Ferguson]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1896/151.html 163 US 537] (1896) holding that state laws segregating black from white people in public places (or "[[Jim Crow laws]]"), such as [[Louisiana]]'s [[Separate Car Act]] of 1890, were constitutional. [[Harlan J]] dissented. See also ''[[Lochner v New York]]'' 198 US 45 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United States President Barack Obama bends down to allow the son of a White House staff member to touch his head.jpg|left|thumb|A constitutional right to equality, based on the [[equal protection clause]]s of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments has been disputed. 125 years after [[Harlan J]] wrote his famous dissent that all social institutions should be bound to equal rights,&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1883/182.html 109 US 3] (1883) where the majority struck down the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barack Obama]] won election for President.]]
By 1944, the position had changed. In ''[[Steele v Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1944/136.html 323 US 192] (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; a Supreme Court majority held a labor union had a [[duty of fair representation]] and may not discriminate against members based on race under the [[Railway Labor Act of 1926]] (or the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]]. [[Murphy J]] would have also based the duty on a [[right to equality]] in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]). Subsequently, ''[[Johnson v Railway Express Agency]]'' admitted that the old [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] provided a remedy against private parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1975/90.html 421 US 454] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Courts have not yet accepted a general right of equality, regardless of public or private power. Legislation will usually be found unconstitutional, under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] if discrimination is shown to be intentional,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Washington v Davis]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1976/107.html 426 US 229] (1976) holding that a prima facie case of unconstitutionality would be established by evidence of intent. It was not enough that verbal tests had a disparate impact. Brennan J and Marshall J dissented.&lt;/ref&gt; or if it irrationally discriminates against one group. For example, in ''[[Cleveland Board of Education v LaFleur]]'' the Supreme Court held by a majority of 5 to 2, that a school's requirement for women teachers to take mandatory maternity leave was unconstitutional, against the [[Due Process Clause]], because it could not plausibly be shown that after child birth women could never perform a job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1974/13.html 414 US 632] (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; But while the [[US Supreme Court]] has failed, against dissent, to recognize a constitutional principle of equality,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Massachusetts Board of Retirement v Murgia]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1976/141.html 427 US 307] (1976) and ''[[Regents of the University of California v Bakke]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1978/145.html 438 US 265] (1978). Contrast ''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' (2010) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62007J0555:EN:NOT C-555/07] affirming a constitutional equality principle in [[EU law]] and ''[[Matadeen v Pointu]]'' [1998] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1998/9.html UKPC 9], per [[Lord Hoffmann]] discussing the principle of equality as it is potentially seen in Commonwealth jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt; federal and state legislation contains the stronger rules. In principle, federal equality law always enables state law to create better rights and remedies for employees.&lt;ref&gt;''[[California Fed Savings and Loan Ass v Guerra]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1987/3.html 479 US 272] (1987) holding the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1959]] §12945(b)(2) was not preempted.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal treatment===
{{Slist employment equality}}
{{see also|Disparate treatment|Bona fide occupational qualification|Harassment|US workplace sexual harassment|Retaliation (law)}}
Today legislation bans discrimination, that is unrelated to an employee's ability to do a job, based on sex, race,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Saint Francis College v al-Khazraji]]'', 481 US 604 (1987) an Arabic man was protected from race discrimination under [[CRA 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; ethnicity, national origin, age and disability.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast the [[International Labour Organization]] [[Discrimination Convention 1958]] [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C111 c 111], art 1(1)(b) applying to "such other distinction, exclusion or preference which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] banned gender pay discrimination, amending the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]]. Plaintiffs must show an employing entity pays them less than someone of the opposite sex in an "establishment" for work of "equal skill, effort, or responsibility" under "similar working conditions". Employing entities may raise a defense that pay differences result from a seniority or merit system unrelated to sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title29-section206&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §206(d)(1)], "No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for [[equal work]] on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a [[seniority system]]; (ii) a [[merit system]]; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex: Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee." §206(d)(2) expressly prevents any discrimination caused by labor unions also.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Corning Glass Works v Brennan]]'' the Supreme Court held that although women plaintiffs worked at different times in the day, compared to male colleagues, the working conditions were "sufficiently similar" and the claim was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1974/114.html 417 US 188] (1974) See also ''[[Schultz v Wheaton Glass Co.]]'', 421 F2d 259 (3rd 1970) if work is "substantially equal" then the work must be paid the same, regardless of the job title. See also ''[[County of Washington v Gunther]]'', 452 US 161 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the equal pay provisions are subject to multiple exemptions for groups of employees found in the [[FLSA 1938]] itself. Another is that equal pay rules only operate within workers of an "enterprise",&lt;ref&gt;[[FLSA 1938]], 29 USC §203(r)&lt;/ref&gt; so that it has no effect upon high paying enterprises being more male dominated, nor [[child care]] being unequally shared between men and women that affects long term career progression. Sex discrimination includes discrimination based on pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;After the Supreme Court held by 6 to 3 in ''[[Geduldig v Aiello]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1974/129.html 417 US 484] (1974) that pregnancy was not included in the concept of sex, Congress reversed the decision by the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]]. But see ''[[AT&amp;T Corporation v Hulteen]]'', {{Ussc|556|701|2009|el=no}} 7 to 2, holding that maternity leave taken before the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act 1978]] did not need to count as time worked that will contribute to pension earnings.&lt;/ref&gt; and is prohibited in general by the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]], [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter21/subchapter6&amp;edition=prelim §2000e-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rosie the Riveter]] symbolized women factory workers in [[World War II]]. The [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] banned pay discrimination within workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[ILO]] [[Equal Remuneration Convention 1951]] [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C100 c 100], art 2(2) requiring the principle of equal pay through "(a) national laws or regulations; (b) legally established or recognised machinery for wage determination; (c) [[collective agreements]] between employers and workers".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Beyond gender equality on the specific issue of pay, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is the general anti-discrimination statute. Titles I to VI protects the equal right to vote, to access accommodation, public services, schools, it strengthens the [[Civil Rights Commission]], and requires equality in federally funded agencies. [[Title VII]] bans discrimination in employment. Under §2000e-2, employers must not refuse to hire, discharge or discriminate "against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's [[Race (human categorization)|race]], color, religion, sex, or [[national origin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]], [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-2&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §2000e-2(a)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial segregation|Segregation]] in employment is equally unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]], [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-2&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §2000e-2(a)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; The same basic rules apply for people [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967|over 40 years old]],&lt;ref&gt;[[ADEA 1967]], [[29 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter14&amp;edition=prelim §§623 and 631]&lt;/ref&gt; and for people with [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ADA 1990]], [[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter126/subchapter1&amp;edition=prelim §12112(a)-(b)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although states may go further, a significant limit to federal law is a duty only falls on private employers of more than 15 staff, or 20 staff for age discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]], [[42 USC]] §2000e(b). See ''[[Walters v Metropolitan Educational Enterprises, Inc]]'' 519 US 202 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Within these limits, people can bring claims against [[disparate treatment]]. In ''[[Texas Dept of Community Affairs v Burdine]]'' the [[US Supreme Court]] held plaintiffs will establish a ''prima facie'' case of discrimination for not being hired if they are in a protected group, qualified for a job, but the job is given to someone of a different group. It is then up to an employer to rebut the case, by showing a legitimate reason for not hiring the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;450 US 248 (1981) and see previously ''[[McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green]]'', 411 US 792 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1993, this position was altered in ''[[St Mary's Honor Center v Hicks]]'' where [[Scalia J]] held (over the dissent of four justices) that if an employer shows no discriminatory intent, an employee must not only show the reason is a pretext, but show additional evidence that discrimination has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1993/94.html 509 US 502] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Souter J]] in dissent, pointed out the majority's approach was "inexplicable in forgiving employers who present false evidence in court".&lt;ref&gt;Contrast ''[[O'Connor v Consolidated Coin Caterers Corporation]]'' 517 US 308 (1996) on age discrimination&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparate treatment can be justified under [[CRA 1964]] §2000e-2(e) if an employer shows selecting someone reflects by "religion, sex, or national origin is a [[bona fide occupational qualification]] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;CRA 1965, 42 USC §2000e-2(e)&lt;/ref&gt; Race is not included. For example, in ''[[Dothard v Rawlinson]]'' the state of [[Alabama]] prohibited women from working as prison guards in "contact" jobs, with close proximity to prisoners. It also had minimum height and weight requirements (5"2 and 120 [[Pound (mass)|lbs]]), which it argued were necessary for proper security. Ms Rawlinson claimed both requirements were unlawful discrimination. A majority of 6 to 3 held that the gender restrictions in contact jobs were a [[bona fide occupational qualification]], because there was a heightened risk of sexual assault, although [[Stewart J]] suggested the result might have differed if the prisons were better run. A majority held the height and weight restrictions, while neutral, had a [[disparate impact]] on women and were not justified by business necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1977/143.html 433 US 321] (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in ''[[Wilson v Southwest Airlines Co]]'', a [[Texas]] District Court held an airline was not entitled to require women only to work as cabin attendants (who were further required to be "dressed in high boots and hot-pants") even if it could show a consumer preference. The essence of the business was transporting passengers, rather than its advertising metaphor of "spreading love all over Texas", so that there was no "bona fide occupational requirement".&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wilson_v._Southwest_Airlines_Co./Opinion_of_the_Court 517 FSupp 292] (ND Tex 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[ADEA 1967]], age requirements can be used, but only if reasonably necessary, or compelled by law or circumstance. For example, in ''[[Western Air Lines, Inc v Criswell]]'' the Supreme Court held that airlines could require pilots to retire at age 60, because the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] required this. It could not, however, refuse to employ flight engineers over 60 because there was no comparable FAA rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1985/161.html 472 US 400] (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=20em|salign=right|quote="We are confronted by powerful forces telling us to rely on the good will and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us. They deplore our discontent, they resent our will to organize, so that we may guarantee that [[Humanitarianism|humanity]] will prevail and [[Equal opportunity|equality]] will be exacted. They are shocked that action organizations, sit-ins, [[civil disobedience]], and protests are becoming our everyday tools, just as strikes, demonstrations and union organization became yours to insure that [[bargaining power]] genuinely existed on both sides of the table...."|source=[[Martin Luther King Jr]], ''Speech to the Fourth Constitutional Convention [[AFL-CIO]] Miami, Florida'' (11 December 1961)}}
In addition to prohibitions on discriminatory treatment, [[Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States|harassment]], and detriment in retaliation for asserting rights, is prohibited. In a particularly obscene case, ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v Vinson]]'' the Supreme Court unanimously held that a bank manager who coerced a woman employee into having sex with him 40 to 50 times, including rape on multiple occasions, had committed unlawful harassment within the meaning of [[42 USC]] §2000e.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1986/139.html 477 US 57] (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; But also if employees or managers create a "hostile or offensive working environment", this counts as discrimination. In ''[[Harris v Forklift Systems, Inc]]'' the Court held that a "hostile environment" did not have to "seriously affect employees’ psychological well-being" to be unlawful. If the environment "would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive" this is enough.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1168.ZO.html 510 US 17] (1993) reversing the Sixth Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; Standard principles of agency and vicariously liability apply, so an employer is responsible for the actions of its agents,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burlington Industries Inc v Ellerth]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1998/83.html 524 US 742] (1998) relying on Restatement of Torts §219&lt;/ref&gt; But according to ''[[Faragher v City of Boca Raton]]'' an employing entity can avoid vicarious liability if it shows it (a) exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and (b) a plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of opportunities to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1998/84.html 524 US 775] (1998) n.b. ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'', [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1998/21.html 523 US 75] (1998) sexual harassment was possible between members of the same sex.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an employing entity may not retaliate against an employee for asserting his or her rights under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]], [[42 USC]] §2000e-3&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gomez-Perez v. Potter]]'', 553 US 474 (2008) 6 to 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[University of Pennsylvania v Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'', the Supreme Court held that a university was not entitled to refuse to give up peer review assessment documents in order for the [[EEOC]] to investigate the claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1990/4.html 493 US 182] (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in ''[[Robinson v Shell Oil Company]]'' the Supreme Court held that writing a negative job reference, after a plaintiff brought a race discrimination claim, was unlawful retaliation: employees were protected even if they had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;519 US 337 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been held that simply being reassigned to a slightly different job, operating forklifts, after making a sex discrimination complaint could amount to unlawful retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway Co. v. White]]'', 548 US 53 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; This is all seen as necessary to make equal rights effective.

===Equal impact and remedies===
{{see also|Disparate impact}}
{{Slist equal impact}}
In addition to [[disparate treatment]], employing entities may not use practices having an unjustified [[disparate impact]] on protected groups. In ''[[Griggs v Duke Power Co]]'', a power company on the [[Dan River]], [[North Carolina]], required a [[high school diploma]] for staff to transfer to higher paying non-manual jobs. Because of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in states like [[North Carolina]], fewer [[Black people|black employees]] than [[White people|white employees]] had diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, only 34% of white men and 12% of black men had high school diplomas: [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]], ''U.S. Census of Population'' (1960) vol 1, Characteristics of the Population, pt. 35, Table 47. This rate, under a segregated education system, was worse than most non-segregated systems for European-Americans.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found a diploma was wholly unnecessary to perform the tasks in higher paying non-manual jobs. [[Burger CJ]], for a unanimous [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], held the "[[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Act]] proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation." An employer could show that a practice with [[disparate impact]] followed "business necessity" that was "related to [[job performance]]" but otherwise such practices would be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1971/46.html 401 US 424] (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessary to show any intention to discriminate, just a discriminatory effect. Since amendments by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]],&lt;ref&gt;This overturned ''[[Wards Cove Packing Co, Inc v Atonio]]'' 490 US 642 (1989) where it was held 5 to 4 that employees had the burden of showing a disparate impact did not serve an employer's "legitimate employment goals".&lt;/ref&gt; if [[disparate impact]] is shown the law requires employers "to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity" and that any non-discriminatory "alternative employment practice" is not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[[CRA 1964]], [[42 USC]] §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in ''[[Ricci v DeStefano]]'' five Supreme Court judges held the [[City of New Haven]] had acted unlawfully by discarding test results for [[firefighters]], which it concluded could have had an unjustified [[disparate impact]] by race.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|557|557|2009}} [[Kennedy J]] giving the first judgment.&lt;/ref&gt; In a further concurrence, [[Scalia J]] said "resolution of this dispute merely postpones the [[evil]] day" when a [[disparate impact]] might be found [[unconstitutional]], against the [[equal protection]] clause because, in his view, the lack of a good faith defense meant employers were compelled to do "racial decision making" that "is... discriminatory." In dissent, [[Ginsburg J]] pointed out that [[disparate impact]] theory advances equality, and in no way requires behavior that is not geared to identifying people with skills necessary for jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|557|557|dissent|2009}} [[Ginsburg J]], joined by [[Stevens J]], [[Souter J]] and [[Breyer J]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Secretary Clinton Smiles With South African Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Paycheck Fairness Act]], repeatedly proposed by Democrats such as [[Hillary Clinton]], would prevent employer defenses to sex discrimination that are related to gender. It has been rejected by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[United States Congress]].]]
Both [[disparate treatment]] and disparate impact claims may be brought by an individual, or if there is a "pattern or practice" by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]],&lt;ref&gt;[[42 USC]] [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-5&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim §§2000e-5] to [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e-6&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim 2000e-6]&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[class action]]. Under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], Rule 23 a class of people who share a common claim must be numerous, have "questions of law or fact common to the class", have representatives typical of the claimants, who would "fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class".&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] [https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-iv-parties/rule-23-class-actions/ Rule 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Class actions may be brought, even in favor of people who are not already identified, for instance, if they have been discouraged from applying for jobs,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[International Brotherhood of Teamsters v US]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1977/90.html 431 US 324] (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; so long as there is sufficiently specific presentation of issues of law and fact to certify the action.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[General Telephone Co of Southwest v Falcon]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1982/117.html 457 US 147] (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant practical problem for disparate impact claims is the "[[Bennett Amendment]]" in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] §703(h). Though introduced as a supposedly "technical" amendment by a Utah Republican Senator, it requires that claims for equal pay between men and women cannot be brought unless they fulfill the requirements of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] § 206(d)(1).&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §206(d)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; This says that employers have a defense to employee claims if unequal pay (purely based on gender) flows from "(i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex." By contrast, for claims alleging discriminatory pay on grounds of race, age, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics, an employer only has the more restricted defenses available in the [[CRA 1964]] §703(h).&lt;ref&gt;This exempts (i) a bona fide seniority system (ii) merit systems (iii) systems measuring earnings by quantity or quality of production.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[County of Washington v Gunther]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/1981/126.html 452 US 161] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of the Supreme Court accepted that this was the correct definition. In principle, this meant that a group of women prison guards, who did less time working with prisoners than men guards, and also did different clerical work, would be able to bring a claim - there was no need to be doing entirely "equal work". However [[Rehnquist J]] dissented, arguing the Amendment should have put the plaintiffs in an even worse position: they should be required to prove they do "equal work", as is stated in the first part of §703(h).&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Schultz v Wheaton Glass Co]]'', 421 F.2d 259 (3rd Cir 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the majority held that the gender pay provisions could be worse because, for example, an employer could apply ""a bona fide job rating system," so long as it does not discriminate on the basis of sex", whereas the same would not be possible for other claims under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Given that a significant [[gender pay gap]] remains, it is not clear why any discrepancy or less favorable treatment, should remain at all.&lt;ref&gt;Similar problems are evident in the UK's [[Equality Act 2010]] and its separate "equal pay" provisions. It has been argued that they should be scrapped, so that a claimant can choose the most favorable legal avenue.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dismissal protections===
{{see also|Wrongful dismissal|Unfair dismissal|At-will employment}}
Some state and federal laws presume workers who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement or an individual employment agreement have "[[at-will employment]]".&lt;ref&gt;Typically justified by reference to HG Wood, ''Master and Servant'' (1877)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a policy that employees' may be dismissed without notice and for no stated reason. However state and federal laws prohibiting discrimination or protecting the right to organize or engage in whistleblowing activities modify that rule by providing that discharge or other forms of discrimination are illegal if undertaken on grounds specifically prohibited by law. An employment relationship could be [[Termination of employment|terminated]] by either party at any time without a reason. Starting in 1941, a series of laws prohibited certain discriminatory firings. That is, in most states, absent an express contractual provision to the contrary, an employer can still fire an employee for no or any reason, as long as it is not a reason in violation of public policy.

Most states have modified the general rule that employment is at will by holding that employees may, under that state's [[common law]], have implied contract rights to fair treatment by their employers. US private-sector employees thus do not have the [[Job security#Job security in other nations|indefinite contracts]] (similar to US academic [[tenure]]) traditionally common in many European countries, Canada and New Zealand.

Public employees in both federal and state government are also typically covered by civil service systems that protect them from unjust discharge. Public employees who have enough rights against unjustified discharge by their employers may also acquire a property right in their jobs, which entitles them in turn to additional protections under the due process clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/us_constitution_5th_and_14th_amendments#2 Finduslaw.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Bammert v. Don's Super Valu, Inc.]]'', 646 N.W.2d 365 (Wis. 2002) the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that it was not contrary to public policy for an employer to dismiss an employee on grounds of her husband's drunk driving charge
*''[[Brockmeyer v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet]]'' 113 Wis. 2d 561 (Wis. 1983) the Wisconsin Supreme Court acknowledged there could be public policy reasons to hold a dismissal is unlawful.

*''[[Fortunato v. Office of Stephen M. Silston]]'', D.D.S., 856 A.2d 530 (Conn.

It was contrary to public policy because it frustrated a person's right to access the courts.
*''[[Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers]]'', 531 U.S. 57 (2000) the right to be dismissed for a "just cause" under a collective agreement contained the remedy of reinstatement.

The Supreme Court held that this could not be found contrary to public policy.

In 1959, California added the Division of Fair Employment Practices to the [[California Department of Industrial Relations]]. The Fair Employment and Housing Act&lt;ref&gt;The [http://finduslaw.com/california_fair_employment_and_housing_act_feha_government_code_12900_12996 Fair Employment and Housing Act]&lt;/ref&gt; of 1980 gave the division its own [[Department of Fair Employment and Housing]], with the stated purpose of protecting citizens against [[harassment]] and [[employment discrimination]] on the basis of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/Statutes/feha.asp Details of law] from the DFEH website&lt;/ref&gt; age, ancestry, color, creed, denial of family and medical care leave, disability (including HIV/AIDS), marital status, medical condition, national origin, race, religion, sex, transgender and orientation. [[Sexual orientation]] was not specifically included in the original law but precedent was established based on [[case law]]. On October 9, 2011, California Governor Edmund G. "Jerry" Brown signed into law Assembly Bill No. 887 alters the meaning of gender for the purposes of discrimination laws that define sex as including gender so that California law now prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/california-enacts-22-new-employment-laws-impacting-all-companies-doing-business-state|author=Barnes &amp; Thornburg LLP|title=California Enacts 22 New Employment Laws Impacting All Companies Doing Business in the State |publisher=The National Law Review |date=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state also has its own labor law covering agricultural workers, the [[California Agricultural Labor Relations Act]].

===New Jersey===
In 1945, New Jersey enacted the first statewide civil rights act in the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.nj.gov/oag/dcr/report.html New Jersey Law Against Discrimination]&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of protecting citizens against [[harassment]] and [[employment discrimination]] on the basis of:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmlaw.com/new-jersey-discrimination-lawyers-laws-against-discrimination/ Details of law] from the&lt;/ref&gt; age, color, nationality, age, disability, creed, national origin, ancestry, sex, pregnancy, domestic partnership, sexual orientation, perceived sexual orientation, civil union status, marital status, affectional orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, military service, or mental or physical disability, AIDS and HIV related illnesses and atypical hereditary cellular or blood traits.

===Laws restricting unions===

{{As of|2017}}, twenty-eight states plus [[Guam]] prevent trade unions from signing collective agreements with employers requiring employees pay fees to the union when they are not members (frequently called "right-to-work" laws by their political proponents).

In 2010, the organization "[[Save Our Secret Ballot]]" pushed four states: Arizona, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah to pass constitutional amendments to ban [[Card check]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2016}}

[[File:Ubbo Emmius (1547-1625).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ubbo Emmius]] was the first [[rector magnificus]] of the University of Groningen]]

The institution was founded as a college in 1614 in an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of [[Groningen]] and the [[Ommelanden]], or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/study-abroad/universities/groningen-university-of-2248629.html|title=Groningen, University of|date=22 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rnw.org/archive/university-groningen-facts-figures|title=University of Groningen: Facts &amp; Figures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-groningen-500967|title=''Article in U.S. News &amp; World Report; accessed on 11 July 2017''|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[coat of arms]] of the university was confirmed by [[The Estates]] of the [[Groningen (province)|City and County of Groningen]] in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for ''Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris''. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.

The first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the University with about 100 students enrolling every year. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first Rector Magnificus, [[Ubbo Emmius]], came from [[East Frisia]] in modern-day Germany, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the University and the city and the surrounding region.

The development of the University came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by [[Bernhard von Galen|‘Bommen Berend’]] in 1672. On average two to three hundred students were registered with the University at any one time during this period. [[Petrus Camper]], though, was a shining academic example during the second half of the eighteenth century and was famous far beyond the city limits as an anatomist, a fighter against rinderpest and the founder of the first outpatient’s clinic for surgical medicine.

[[File:Academiegebouw Groningen 1858.jpg|thumb|left|The 19th-century main building in 1858]]

Opportunities and threats followed on each other’s heels during the nineteenth century. In 1815, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the University gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant.

In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the University, which was renamed the "Rijksuniversiteit Groningen" (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the University was given a research as well as an educational duty.

[[File:090529 Academiegebouw Groningen NL.jpg|thumb|The 20th-century main building in 2009]]

The University of Groningen developed apace during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students showed an explosive growth. When the University celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 30,000 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.

In March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the [[China Agricultural University]] to establish a campus in the Chinese city of [[Yantai]]. This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukrant.nl/rug-yantai-van-de-baan/|title=RUG: Yantai van de baan|work=UKrant.nl|date=31 January 2018|publisher= Thereza Langeler, Rob Siebelink |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by [[censorship in China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/video/2189932-de-china-plannen-van-rijksuniversiteit-groningen.html|title=De China-plannen van Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=NOS|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the "insufficient support for the project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2214377-rijksuniversiteit-groningen-blaast-plan-chinees-filiaal-af.html|title=Rijksuniversiteit Groningen blaast plan Chinees filiaal af|publisher=NOS|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the Dutch chemist [[Ben Feringa]], who has spent most of his career at the University of Groningen, won the [[Nobel prize]] for his work on molecular motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Groningen is organized in eleven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, law, economics and business, spatial sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences and technology. Each faculty (''cf.'', College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, and Exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.

Since 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent [[liberal arts college]], [[University College Groningen]] (UCG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/op-university-college-geen-zesjesstudenten~b719f2e0/|title=Op University College geen zesjesstudenten|publisher=''[[De Volkskrant]]''|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/ucg/education/|title=BA/BSc Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences|work=www.rug.nl|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
The various faculties have been housed in old and new buildings around the city, particularly around the historic city center. Most of the faculties- including the Faculty of Law, Faculty of Arts, and the Faculty of Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts are the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at Broerstraat. The faculty of medical sciences is located close-by at the [[University Medical Center Groningen|UMCG]]. The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering is housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at Zernike Campus, named after Dutch [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Frits Zernike|Fritz Zernike]].

The university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The library at the city center also has a [[Starbucks]] in its premises. The university has also recently opened another campus in [[Leeuwarden|Leeuwarden, Friesland]], referred to as " Campus Fryslan" that offers multiple disciplines, in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/about-us/organization/faculties/|title=Faculties {{!}} Our organization {{!}} About us {{!}} University of Groningen|website=www.rug.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Student Life ==
The city of Groningen boasts a remarkable student life, and is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residence are students at either The University of Groningen or at [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences|Hanze]]. The city is tailored around students, and is known to be very welcoming. The university, through [http://www.aclosport.nl/en/about-aclo/ ACLO] offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/education/find-out-more/extracurricular-activities-associations/sports-associations|title=Sports associations {{!}} Extracurricular activities and associations {{!}} Student life {{!}} Find out more {{!}} Education {{!}} University of Groningen|website=www.rug.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university, also has multiple student societies, such as the [[Cleopatra Algemene Studentenvereniging Groningen|Cleopatra Algemene Studentenvereniging]] that organize social events for its members,  as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.

The use of cycles as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as " The World Cycling City" because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/29/how-groningen-invented-a-cycling-template-for-cities-all-over-the-world|title=How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world|last=Zee|first=Renate van der|date=2015-07-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student Housing ===
The University of Groningen, much like most universities in Europe, does not have student accommodation themselves. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via [https://www.sshxl.nl/en SSH Student Housing]- which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sshxl.nl/en|title=SSH student housing {{!}} Rooms and apartments for students|website=www.sshxl.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however. A recent addition to the housing options for students is [https://www.thestudenthotel.com/groningen/student/ The Student Hotel] as well. The Dutch government does has very strict laws for private accommodations for both the tenants( students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.athomeingroningen.com/law-contracts/housing-rights-tenants-duties/|title=Housing rights &amp; Tenant's duties - Housing in groningen|work=Housing in groningen|access-date=2018-06-11|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dutchreview.com/featured/the-student-housing-nightmare-a-tale-of-discrimination-fraud-and-protest/|title=The Student Housing Nightmare|last=|first=|date=11 June 2018|website=The Dutch Review|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildlife Act 1953''' is an Act of Parliament in [[New Zealand]].

Under the act, the majority of native New Zealand vertebrate species are protected by law, and may not be hunted, killed, eaten or possessed. Violations may be punished with fines of up to $100,000.

Wildlife are classified under a number of schedules; all vertebrate species not included in these lists are protected by default. The schedules are periodically amended; for example the [[kea]] was granted full protection in 1984, whereas the [[masked lapwing|spur-winged plover]] (masked lapwing), an Australian species which naturally established itself in New Zealand in the 1930s, had its protected status removed in 2012.

The Act also provides for wildlife sanctuaries, refuges and management reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/whole.html?search=ts_act@bill@regulation@deemedreg_Wildlife+Act+1953_resel_25_a&amp;p=1#DLM277211|title=Wildlife Act 1953 No 31 (as at 13 March 2017), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedules==

===Schedule 1 - Wildlife declared to be game===
This group comprises commonly hunted waterfowl ([[mallard]], [[Pacific black duck|grey duck]], [[Australasian shoveler]], [[paradise shelduck]], [[black swan]] and [[pukeko]]) and introduced game birds, including [[pheasant]], [[quail]], [[Chukar partridge|chukar]] and [[partridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278547.html |title=Schedule 1: Wildlife declared to be game |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These birds may be hunted during the open season, which begins in early May and lasts approximately four weeks.

===Schedule 2 - Partially protected wildlife===
This group comprises just the [[little owl]], the [[silvereye]] and, on the [[Chatham Islands]] only, the [[brown skua]] (''Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278553.html |title=Schedule 2: Partially protected wildlife |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These birds may be shot by landowners if they pose a threat to crops or livestock, without any need for a permit from the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conversation]]. This group formerly included the [[kea]], which has been blamed for attacking sheep, but is now considered endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kea|author=Colin Miskelly |url=http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/kea|publisher=NZ Birds Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schedule 3 - Wildlife that may be hunted or killed subject to Minister's notification===
These may be culled on application to the Department of Conservation, subject to whatever restrictions are imposed. This group includes the [[swamp harrier|Australasian harrier]], [[grey teal]], [[grey-faced petrel]], [[mute swan]], [[Great cormorant|black shag]], [[Little pied cormorant|little shag]], [[Australian pied cormorant|pied shag]] and [[sooty shearwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278564.html |title=Schedule 3: Wildlife that may be hunted or killed subject to Minister's notification |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schedule 4 - Wildlife not protected, except in areas and during periods specified in Minister's notification===
This group formerly consisted of wild [[horses]], which had some degree of protection in the [[Kaimanawa horse|Kaimanawa]] range, but is now obsolete.

===Schedule 5 - Wildlife not protected===
This is a large group that includes many common domestic and introduced species, many of which are regarded as pests. It includes numerous land mammals and birds, three species of Australian ''[[Litoria]]'' tree frogs, the Australian rainbow skink (''[[Lampropholis delicata]]'') and the North American [[red-eared slider]] turtle (''Trachemys scripta elegans'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278571.html |title=Schedule 5: Wildlife not protected |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only species on this list that occur naturally in New Zealand are the [[southern black-backed gull]] and the [[spur-winged plover]] (masked lapwing), both of which present a significant risk of [[bird strike]].

===Schedule 6 - Animals declared to be noxious animals subject to the Noxious Animals Act 1956===
This group consists of the [[chamois]], the [[Himalayan tahr]], and all species of [[deer]] (the family Cervidae), goats (the genus ''[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]''), and [[pig]]s (the genus ''Sus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278592.html |title=Schedule 6: Animals declared to be noxious animals subject to the Noxious Animals Act 1956 |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All are considered harmful to New Zealand's native forests and may be hunted without restriction.

===Schedule 7 - Terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates declared to be animals===
Under the original legislation, the word "animal" referred only to land-based vertebrates. Schedule 7 was added to give protected status to a number of native invertebrates, most of them endangered. The species include two native [[grasshopper]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, many species of beetle including the [[Prodontria lewisi|Cromwell chafer]] and the [[Hadramphus spinipennis|coxella weevil]], all [[giant weta]], the [[katipo]] spider, the [[Spelungula|Nelson cave spider]], and several kinds of native snails including all ''[[Powelliphanta]]'' and ''[[Placostylus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278595.html |title=Schedule 7: Terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates declared to be animals |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schedule 7A - Marine species declared to be animals===
Similarly, this list gives protected status to a number of marine species, including some [[coral]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (notably [[black coral]]), several [[shark]]s, and two species of [[Epinephelus|grouper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278598.html |title=Schedule 7A: Marine species declared to be animals |work=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yunker''' Kotei Eki, {{nihongo|''Yunkeru Kotei Eki''|ユンケル黄帝液}}, is a [[health tonic]] similar to [[Lipovitan]] and produced by the Sato Pharmaceutical Corporation in [[Japan]]. It was first produced in 1967,&lt;ref name="Yunkerhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yunker.jp/history/|title=ユンケルの歴史|accessdate=April 26, 2017|website=Yunker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely available at [[drug stores]] throughout Japan. Yunker contains Chinese [[herbal]] ingredients and [[caffeine]] and is marketed to the Japanese workforce to combat [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

It is one of 33 tonics manufactured by Sato for a range of ailments related to fatigue. The Yunker line of tonics is also sold in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Europe]] and Singapore, but the contents of some tonics have been altered to meet domestic regulations.&lt;ref name="Yunkersg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satopharm.com.sg/product/yunker-kotei-solution|title=Yunker Kotei Solution|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[USDA]] report from 2002 reported that exports of ''Yunkeru Kotei-eki'' to six countries including the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]] and Singapore were continuing to grow, and that Sato planned to start exports to [[Thailand]] later that year.
