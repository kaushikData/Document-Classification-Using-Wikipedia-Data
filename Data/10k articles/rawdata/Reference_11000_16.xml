==Description==
On the left is a house called Castlefield that was home to the Borrow family. There are paintings of Isaac, [[Thomas and Ann Borrow]] in [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]. Left of centre is [[Exeter House]] which is no longer standing but came to notability when it played host to [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] when he decided to turn back with his Scottish armies and not go to London to take the crown. The large buildings to the right are mills powered by the [[River Derwent (Derbyshire)|River Derwent]].&lt;ref&gt;Label on painting in Derby Museum, read July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although one of the buildings is now demolished the right hand mill is now part of a [[World Heritage site]] and was [[Derby Industrial Museum]].

The painting is displayed (in 2011) in Derby Museum in the room reserved for the [[Hanson Log Boat]].&lt;ref name=purchase/&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was bought by [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] in 2006 from a European collector via [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref name=purchase/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/9548/a-prospect-of-the-city-of-derby | title=A Prospect of the City of Derby | publisher=ArtFund | accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''Australian Encyclopaedia''''' is an encyclopaedia focused on Australia. In addition to biographies of notable Australians the coverage includes the [[geology]], [[flora]], [[fauna]] as well as the history of the continent. It was first published by [[Angus and Robertson]] in two volumes, one each in 1925 and 1926. The most recent edition, the sixth, is of eight volumes published in 1996.

==History==
The encyclopaedia was initiated in 1912 as a historical and biographical record under the directorship of [[Charles H. Bertie]], municipal librarian of [[Sydney]]. The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 temporarily halted its progress.

In 1917, work resumed and it was decided that the book should also include scientific subjects. Herbert J. Carter, later to be president of the [[Linnean Society of New South Wales]] (1925–26) recruited other Australian scientists to work on the encyclopedia. Their contributions were, in many instances, the first summaries of scientific knowledge published in a general reference work in Australia. In 1920 Captain [[Arthur Jose]] was released from the [[Australian Navy]] and became the general editor. He found that, since significant time had elapsed since the project started and newer sources of information were available, it had become necessary to re-write much of the historical and biographical information.

[[Richard Appleton]] became editor-in-chief in 1977 and oversaw the fourth and fifth editions.

'''Calibration''' in measurement technology and [[metrology]] is the comparison of [[measurement]] values delivered by a [[device under test]] with those of a [[Standard (metrology)|calibration standard]] of known accuracy. Such a standard could be another measurement device of known accuracy, a device generating the quantity to be measured such as a [[voltage]], [[sound]] tone, or a physical artefact, such as a metre ruler.

The outcome of the comparison can result in no significant error being noted on the device under test, a significant error being noted but no adjustment made, or an adjustment made to correct the error to an acceptable level. Strictly speaking, the term calibration means just the act of comparison, and does not include any subsequent adjustment.

The calibration standard is normally traceable to a national standard held by a National Metrological Institute.

==BIPM Definition==
The formal definition of calibration by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) is the following: "Operation that, under specified conditions, in a first step, establishes a relation between the quantity values with measurement uncertainties provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with associated measurement uncertainties (of the calibrated instrument or secondary standard) and, in a second step, uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication."&lt;ref name=metrology_terms&gt;''[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf JCGM 200:2008 International vocabulary of metrology]'' — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This definition states that the calibration process is purely a comparison, but introduces the concept of [[measurement uncertainty]] in relating the accuracies of the device under test and the standard.

==Modern calibration processes==
The increasing need for known accuracy and uncertainty and the need to have consistent and comparable standards internationally has led to the establishment of national laboratories. In many countries a National Metrology Institute (NMI) will exist which will maintain primary standards of measurement (the main [[International System of Units|SI units]] plus a number of derived units) which will be used to provide [[traceability]] to customer's instruments by calibration.

The NMI supports the metrological infrastructure in that country (and often others) by establishing an unbroken chain, from the top level of standards to an instrument used for measurement.  Examples of National Metrology Institutes are [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]] in the [[UK]], [[NIST]] in the [[United States]], [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]] in [[Germany]] and many others.  Since the Mutual Recognition Agreement was signed it is now straightforward to take traceability from any participating NMI and it is no longer necessary for a company to obtain traceability for measurements from the NMI of the country in which it is situated, such as the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.

===Quality===
To improve the quality of the calibration and have the results accepted by outside organizations it is desirable for the calibration and subsequent measurements to be "traceable" to the internationally defined measurement units.  Establishing [[traceability]] is accomplished by a formal comparison to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard]] which is directly or indirectly related to national standards (such as [[NIST]] in the USA), international standards, or [[certified reference materials]]. This may be done by national standards laboratories operated by the government or by private firms offering metrology services.

[[Quality management system]]s call for an effective [[metrology]] system which includes formal, periodic, and documented calibration of all measuring instruments.  [[ISO 9000]]&lt;ref name="iso9001"&gt;ISO 9001: "Quality management systems — Requirements" (2008), section 7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ISO 17025]]&lt;ref name="iso17025"&gt;ISO 17025: "General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories" (2005), section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; standards require that these traceable actions are to a high level and set out how they can be quantified.

To communicate the quality of a calibration the calibration value is often accompanied by a traceable uncertainty statement to a stated confidence level.  This is evaluated through careful uncertainty analysis.
Some times a DFS (Departure From Spec) is required to operate machinery in a degraded state. Whenever this does happen, it must be in writing and authorized by a manager with the technical assistance of a calibration technician.

Measuring devices and instruments are categorized according to the physical quantities they are designed to measure. These vary internationally, e.g., [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] 150-2G in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.nist.gov/nvlap/upload/hb150-2g-1.pdf|title = Calibration Laboratories: Technical Guide for Mechanical Measurements|last = Faison|first = C. Douglas|date = March 2004|journal = NIST Handbook 150-2G|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 June 2015|last2 = Brickenkamp|first2 = Carroll S.|publisher = [[NIST]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories|NABL]]-141 in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fcriindia.com/national-training-2/metrology-pressure-thermal-electrotechnical-measurement-calibration/|title = Metrology, Pressure, Thermal &amp; Eletrotechnical Measurement and Calibration|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2015|website = |publisher = Fluid Control Research Institute (FCRI), Ministry of Heavy Industries &amp; Public Enterprises, Govt. of India|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150614205726/http://www.fcriindia.com/national-training-2/metrology-pressure-thermal-electrotechnical-measurement-calibration/|archivedate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these standards cover instruments that measure various physical quantities such as [[electromagnetic radiation]] ([[RF probe]]s), [[sound]] ([[sound level meter]] or [[noise dosimeter]]), time and frequency ([[intervalometer]]), [[ionizing radiation]] ([[Geiger counter]]), light ([[light meter]]), mechanical quantities ([[limit switch]], [[pressure gauge]], [[pressure switch]]), and, thermodynamic or thermal properties ([[thermometer]], [[temperature control]]ler). The standard instrument for each test device varies accordingly, e.g., a dead weight tester for pressure gauge calibration and a dry block temperature tester for temperature gauge calibration.

==Instrument calibration prompts==
Calibration may be required for the following reasons:
* a new instrument
* after an instrument has been repaired or modified
* when a specified time period has elapsed
* when a specified usage (operating hours) has elapsed
* before and/or after a critical measurement
* after an event, for example
** after an instrument has been exposed to a shock, [[vibration]], or physical damage, which might potentially have compromised the integrity of its calibration
** sudden changes in weather
* whenever observations appear questionable or instrument indications do not match the output of surrogate instruments
* as specified by a requirement, e.g., customer specification, instrument manufacturer recommendation.

In general use, calibration is often regarded as including the process of '''adjusting''' the output or indication on a measurement instrument to agree with value of the applied standard, within a specified accuracy. For example, a [[thermometer]] could be calibrated so the error of indication or the correction is determined, and adjusted (e.g. via [[Operational definition#Temperature|calibration]] constants) so that it shows the true temperature in [[Celsius]] at specific points on the scale. This is the perception of the instrument's end-user. However, very few instruments can be adjusted to exactly match the standards they are compared to. For the vast majority of calibrations, the calibration process is actually the comparison of an unknown to a known and recording the results.

==Basic calibration process==

===Purpose and scope===
The calibration process begins with the design of the measuring instrument that needs to be calibrated. The design has to be able to "hold a calibration" through its calibration interval. In other words, the design has to be capable of measurements that are "within [[engineering tolerance]]" when used within the stated environmental conditions over some reasonable period of time.&lt;ref name="HaiderAsif2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haider|first1=Syed Imtiaz|last2=Asif|first2=Syed Erfan|title=Quality Control Training Manual: Comprehensive Training Guide for API, Finished Pharmaceutical and Biotechnologies Laboratories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-djll_c9Z9MC&amp;pg=PA49|date=16 February 2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-4994-1|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a design with these characteristics increases the likelihood of the actual measuring instruments performing as expected.
Basically,the purpose of calibration is for maintaining the quality of measurement as well as to ensure the proper working of particular instrument.

===Frequency===
The exact mechanism for assigning tolerance values varies by country and as per the  industry type. The measuring of equipment is  manufacturer generally assigns .the measurement tolerance, suggests a calibration interval (CI) and specifies the environmental range of use and storage. The using organization generally assigns the actual calibration interval, which is dependent on this specific measuring equipment's likely usage level. The assignment of calibration intervals can be a formal process based on the results of previous calibrations. The standards themselves are not clear on recommended CI values:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bare|first1=Allen|title=Simplified Calibration Interval Analysis|date=2006|publisher=NCSL International Workshop and Symposium, under contract with the Office of Scientific and Technical Information, U.S. Department of Energy|location=Aiken, SC|pages=1–2|url=http://sti.srs.gov/fulltext/2006/ms2006099.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::"... shall be calibrated at periodic intervals established and maintained to assure acceptable accuracy and reliability...Intervals shall be shortened or may be lengthened, by the contractor, when the results of previous calibrations indicate that such action is appropriate to maintain acceptable reliability."

===Standards required and accuracy===
The next step is defining the calibration process. The selection of a standard or standards is the most visible part of the calibration process. Ideally, the standard has less than 1/4 of the measurement uncertainty of the device being calibrated. When this goal is met, the accumulated measurement uncertainty of all of the standards involved is considered to be insignificant when the final measurement is also made with the 4:1 ratio.&lt;ref name="JablonskiBrezina2011"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio was probably first formalized in Handbook 52 that accompanied MIL-STD-45662A, an early US Department of Defense metrology program specification. It was 10:1 from its inception in the 1950s until the 1970s, when advancing technology made 10:1 impossible for most electronic measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Handbook: Evaluation of Contractor's Calibration System|url=http://www.barringer1.com/mil_files/MIL-HDBK-52.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|page=7|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=17 August 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a 4:1 accuracy ratio with modern equipment is difficult. The test equipment being calibrated can be just as accurate as the working standard.&lt;ref name="JablonskiBrezina2011" /&gt; If the accuracy ratio is less than 4:1, then the calibration tolerance can be reduced to compensate. When 1:1 is reached, only an exact match between the standard and the device being calibrated is a completely correct calibration. Another common method for dealing with this capability mismatch is to reduce the accuracy of the device being calibrated.

For example, a gauge with 3% manufacturer-stated accuracy can be changed to 4% so that a 1% accuracy standard can be used at 4:1.  If the gauge is used in an application requiring 16% accuracy, having the gauge accuracy reduced to 4% will not affect the accuracy of the final measurements. This is called a limited calibration. But if the final measurement requires 10% accuracy, then the 3% gauge never can be better than 3.3:1. Then perhaps adjusting the calibration tolerance for the gauge would be a better solution. If the calibration is performed at 100 units, the 1% standard would actually be anywhere between 99 and 101 units. The acceptable values of calibrations where the test equipment is at the 4:1 ratio would be 96 to 104 units, inclusive. Changing the acceptable range to 97 to 103 units would remove the potential contribution of all of the standards and preserve a 3.3:1 ratio. Continuing, a further change to the acceptable range to 98 to 102 restores more than a 4:1 final ratio.

This is a simplified example. The mathematics of the example can be challenged. It is important that whatever thinking guided this process in an actual calibration be recorded and accessible. Informality contributes to [[tolerance stacks]] and other difficult to diagnose post calibration problems.

Also in the example above, ideally the calibration value of 100 units would be the best point in the gauge's range to perform a single-point calibration. It may be the manufacturer's recommendation or it may be the way similar devices are already being calibrated. Multiple point calibrations are also used. Depending on the device, a zero unit state, the absence of the phenomenon being measured, may also be a calibration point.  Or zero may be resettable by the user-there are several variations possible. Again, the points to use during calibration should be recorded.

There may be specific connection techniques between the standard and the device being calibrated that may influence the calibration. For example, in electronic calibrations involving analog phenomena, the impedance of the cable connections can directly influence the result.

===Manual and automatic calibrations===
Calibration methods for modern devices can be manual or automatic.

As an example, a manual process may be used for calibration of a pressure gauge. The procedure requires multiple steps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Procedure for calibrating pressure gauges (USBR 1040)|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation|pages=70–73|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/geotech/rock/EMpart_2/USBR1040.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=October 2018}} to connect the gauge under test to a reference master gauge and an adjustable pressure source, to apply fluid pressure to both reference and test gauges at definite points over the span of the gauge, and to compare the readings of the two. The gauge under test may be adjusted to ensure its zero point and response to pressure comply as closely as possible to the intended accuracy. Each step of the process requires manual record keeping.

An automatic pressure calibrator &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNC Model 3666 Automatic Pressure Calibration System|url=http://www.kingnutronics.com/Model%203666%20Automatic%20Pressure%20Calibration%20System.pdf|publisher=King Nutronics Corporation|accessdate=28 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204112439/http://www.kingnutronics.com/Model%203666%20Automatic%20Pressure%20Calibration%20System.pdf#|archive-date=2014-12-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a device that combines an electronic control unit, a pressure intensifier used to compress a gas such as [[Nitrogen]], a [[pressure transducer]] used to detect desired levels in a [[hydraulic accumulator]], and accessories such as [[Trap (plumbing)|liquid traps]] and gauge [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]]. An automatic system may also include data collection facilities to automate the gathering of data for record keeping.

===Process description and documentation===
All of the information above is collected in a calibration procedure, which is a specific [[test method]]. These procedures capture all of the steps needed to perform a successful calibration. The manufacturer may provide one or the organization may prepare one that also captures all of the organization's other requirements. There are clearinghouses for calibration procedures such as the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) in the United States.

This exact process is repeated for each of the standards used until transfer standards, [[certified reference materials]] and/or natural physical constants, the measurement standards with the least uncertainty in the laboratory, are reached. This establishes the [[traceability]] of the calibration.

See [[Metrology]] for other factors that are considered during calibration process development.

After all of this, individual instruments of the specific type discussed above can finally be calibrated. The process generally begins with a basic damage check. Some organizations such as nuclear power plants collect "as-found" calibration data before any [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] is performed. After routine maintenance and deficiencies detected during calibration are addressed, an "as-left" calibration is performed.

More commonly, a calibration technician is entrusted with the entire process and signs the calibration certificate, which documents the completion of a successful calibration.
The basic process outlined above is a difficult and expensive challenge. The cost for ordinary equipment support is generally about 10% of the original purchase price on a yearly basis, as a commonly accepted [[rule-of-thumb]]. Exotic devices such as [[scanning electron microscope]]s, [[gas chromatograph]] systems and [[laser]] [[interferometer]] devices can be even more costly to maintain.

The 'single measurement' device used in the basic calibration process description above does exist. But, depending on the organization, the majority of the devices that need calibration can have several ranges and many functionalities in a single instrument. A good example is a common modern [[oscilloscope]]. There easily could be 200,000 combinations of settings to completely calibrate and limitations on how much of an all inclusive calibration can be automated.

[[Image:F18NARack.JPG|thumb|An instrument rack with tamper-indicating seals]]

To prevent unauthorised access to an instrument tamper-proof seals are usually applied after calibration. The picture of the oscilloscope rack shows these, and prove that the instrument has not been removed since it was last calibrated as they will possible unauthorised to the adjusting elements of the instrument. There also are labels showing the date of the last calibration and when the calibration interval dictates when the next one is needed. Some organizations also assign unique identification to each instrument to standardize the record keeping and keep track of accessories that are integral to a specific calibration condition.

When the instruments being calibrated are integrated with computers, the integrated computer programs and any calibration corrections are also under control.

==Historical development==
{{Main article|History of measurement}}

===Origins===
The words "calibrate" and "calibration" entered the [[English language]] as recently as the [[American Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/calibrate|title=the definition of calibrate|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in descriptions of [[artillery]], thought to be derived from a measurement of the calibre of a gun.

Some of the [[History of measurement#Earliest known systems|earliest known systems of measurement]] and calibration seem to have been created between the ancient civilizations of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], with excavations revealing the use of angular gradations for construction.&lt;ref name="Baber1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baber |first=Zaheer |date=1996 |title=The Science of Empire: Scientific Knowledge, Civilization, and Colonial Rule in India |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-2919-8 |pages=23–24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucDBJSxaCPYC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "calibration" was likely first associated with the precise division of linear distance and angles using a [[dividing engine]] and the measurement of gravitational [[mass]] using a [[weighing scale]]. These two forms of measurement alone and their direct derivatives supported nearly all commerce and technology development from the earliest civilizations until about AD 1800.&lt;ref name="FranceschiniGaletto2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Franceschini |first1=Fiorenzo |last2=Galetto |first2=Maurizio |last3=Maisano |first3=Domenico |last4=Mastrogiacomo |first4=Luca |last5=Pralio |first5=Barbara |date=6 June 2011 |title=Distributed Large-Scale Dimensional Metrology: New Insights |isbn=978-0-85729-543-9 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=117–118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIwbFtXyMcMC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calibration of weights and distances ({{circa|lk=no|1100 CE}})===
{{see also|Weights and Measures Act}}

Early measurement devices were ''direct'', i.e. they had the same units as the quantity being measured. Examples include length using a yardstick and mass using a weighing scale. At the beginning of the twelfth century, during the reign of Henry I (1100-1135), it was decreed that a yard be "the distance from the tip of the King's nose to the end of his outstretched thumb."&lt;ref name="Ackroyd2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|title=Foundation: The History of England from Its Earliest Beginnings to the Tudors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2XHs80O0OEC&amp;pg=PT133|date=16 October 2012|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-250-01367-5|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it wasn't until the reign of Richard I (1197) that we find documented evidence.&lt;ref name="BlandTawney1919"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bland|first1=Alfred Edward|last2=Tawney|first2=Richard Henry|title=English Economic History: Select Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSO6emWmBuAC&amp;pg=PA154|year=1919|publisher=Macmillan Company|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Assize of Measures''
:"Throughout the realm there shall be the same yard of the same size and it should be of iron."

Other standardization attempts followed, such as the [[Magna Carta]] (1225) for liquid measures, until the [[Mètre des Archives]] from France and the establishment of the [[Metric system]].

===The early calibration of pressure instruments===
[[Image:Utube.PNG|thumb|Left|upright|100px|Direct reading design of a U-tube manometer]]One of the earliest pressure measurement devices was the [[Evangelista Torricelli#Barometer|Mercury barometer, credited to Torricelli]] (1643),&lt;ref name=tilford1992pressure&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilford|first1=Charles R|title=Pressure and vacuum measurements|journal=Physical methods of chemistry|date=1992|pages=106–173|url=http://www.glb.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/pmc-2.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205044516/http://www.glb.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/pmc-2.pdf#|archive-date=2014-12-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which read atmospheric pressure using [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]. Soon after, water-filled [[manometer]]s were designed. All these would have linear calibrations using gravimetric principles, where the difference in levels was proportional to pressure. The normal units of measure would be the convenient inches of mercury or water.

In the direct reading hydrostatic manometer design on the right,  applied pressure P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; pushes the liquid down the right side of the manometer U-tube, while a length scale next to the tube measures the difference of levels. The resulting height difference "H" is a direct measurement of the pressure or vacuum with respect to [[atmospheric pressure]]. In the absence of differential pressure both levels would be equal, and this would be used as the zero point. 
  
The [[Industrial Revolution]] saw the adoption of "indirect" pressure measuring devices, which were more practical than the manometer.&lt;ref name="FridmanSabak2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fridman |first1=A. E. |last2=Sabak |first2=Andrew |last3=Makinen |first3=Paul |date=23 November 2011 |title=The Quality of Measurements: A Metrological Reference |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4614-1478-0 |pages=10–11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyX-1VzPokQC&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example is in high pressure (up to 50 psi) steam engines, where mercury was used to reduce the scale length to about 60 inches, but such a manometer was expensive and prone to damage.&lt;ref name=cusco1998guide&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuscó|first1=Laurence|title=Guide to the Measurement of Pressure and Vacuum|date=1998|publisher=The Institute of Measurement and Control|location=London|isbn=0 904457 29 X|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stimulated the development of indirect reading instruments, of which the [[Bourdon tube]] invented by [[Eugène Bourdon]] is a notable example. 
{{multiple image

}}

In the front and back views of a Bourdon gauge on the right, applied pressure at the bottom fitting reduces the curl on the flattened pipe proportionally to pressure. This moves the free end of the tube which is linked to the pointer. The instrument would be calibrated against a manometer, which would be the calibration standard. For measurement of indirect quantities of pressure per unit area, the calibration uncertainty would be dependent on the density of the manometer fluid, and the means of measuring the height difference. From this other units such as pounds per square inch could be inferred and marked on the scale.

A substantial portion of his photographic collection, represented by nearly 11,000 glass negatives, was donated by [[Pathé|Kodak Pathé]] to the [[George Eastman House]] (GEH) International Museum of Photography and Film in 1974.&lt;ref name="GEH"/&gt; GEH noted that Chusseau-Flaviens also acquired copies of photographs from other photographers, annotating their names on his glass negatives.&lt;ref name="GEH"&gt;{{cite web | first=A. | last=Eskind | date=January 1999 | url=http://www.geh.org/fm/chusseau-flaviens/htmlsrc/chus-intro-1999.html | title=Ch.

'''Charles Trick Currelly''' (January 11, 1876 &amp;ndash; April 10, 1957) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[clergy]]man and [[Archaeology|archeologist]], and the first director of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] from 1914 to 1946.

==Early life==

Charles Currelly was born on January 11, 1876 in Exeter, Ontario, the son of John Currelly and Mary Treble. An only child, he attended the local school in Exeter and was known to visit the shops of the blacksmith, tanner, and wheelwright in order to study how different materials were used.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Matthews |first=Julia |date=Spring 2006 |title=The Right Man in the Right Place at the Right Time: A Look at the Visionary who was Instrumental in Founding the ROM |magazine=Rotunda |volume=38 |issue=3 |publisher=Royal Ontario Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tutored by Reverend Jasper Wilson in Latin, who also taught him how to shoot.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt; Currelly's high school years at the [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]] brought his family to Toronto. During this time, Currelly participated in art lessons and nature studies. After graduating in 1894, he attended the University of Toronto's [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria College]] like his father and grandfather. At Victoria College, he took biology and earth science courses in addition to Asian history and the Romance Languages. He received his B.A. in 1898.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt; After leaving university, Currelly spent the next two years serving as a lay missionary for the [[Methodist Church]] at the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]] in Northern [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref name="torontostar" /&gt; During this time, he collected information on [[First Nations]] life in early Canada that was exhibited upon his return to Victoria College for postgraduate studies.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt; Currelly was awarded his master's degree from Victoria College in 1902.&lt;ref name="torontostar" /&gt;

== Archeology==

After completing his master's degree, Currelly and his friend Ned Burwash, the son of [[Nathaniel Burwash]], chancellor of Victoria University went to England planning to study how [[Social gospel]] had filtered down to the working classes. However, this plan was disrupted when Currelly stopped at the [[British Museum]] to have some coins identified.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt; After a little [[shawabti]] figure fell out of his pocket, Currelly was sent to the office of famous Egyptologist, [[Flinders Petrie]] who worked for the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]]. Petrie interviewed Currelly about his drawing skills and offered him an assistantship. Soon, Curelly was living in Petrie's home learning how to pack artifacts.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harbordite&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Some Distinguished Harbordites |magazine=Harbordite |date=Spring 1992 |issue=30 |publisher=Harbord Collegiate Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Currelly was responsible for a dig in Egypt where he discovered the [[cenotaph]] and tomb of [[Ahmose I]].&lt;ref name=Lovat&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Lovat|title=The Museum Makers: The Story of the Royal Ontario Museum|year=1986|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|location=Ontario|isbn=0-88854-326-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curelly continued to work in Ehnasya, [[Lower Egypt]], and in [[Sinai]] under Petrie until 1905, when Petrie left the Egypt Exploration Fund.&lt;ref name="Lovat" /&gt; In 1907, Currelly also left the Fund.

While in Egypt, Currelly discovered his talent and love of collecting and began to collect for people in Britain and Canada including [[Edmund Walker]], the father of one of his school friends. After meeting with Walker in 1905, Currelly was appointed official collector for the University of Toronto and later was  given the title of curator of Oriental archaeology.&lt;ref name="Lovat" /&gt;  Currelly delved into his work, becoming more and more convinced that a good museum must be developed in Toronto &lt;ref name="Harbordite" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CurrellyROM&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles T. Currelly|url=http://www.rom.on.ca/en/about-us/our-history/founders/charles-t-currelly|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Ontario Museum==

In 1906, when Edmund Walker was chairing a commission on the future of the University of Toronto, it was recommended that a museum should be constructed to serve students and the public. Soon planning for the founding of a provincial museum started under Walker's watchful eye. In 1907, Currelly was made curator of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology. During 1911, Currelly started to work in the basement of the first museum building which was still under construction. Finally, in 1914, Currelly became director of the Archaeology Museum.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harbordite" /&gt; Throughout his life, Currelly continuously worked to advance the Museum's interests, and never stopped looking for acquisitions to compliment the Museum's collections leading them to grow enormously through the late 1910s and 1920s. When Currelly finally retired in 1946, the Museum renamed the old Armour Court the Currelly Gallery.&lt;ref name="CurrellyROM" /&gt;

==Later life and death==

[[File:CurrellyBust.JPG|thumb|100px|text-top|Currelly Bust]]

Before Currelly died, he wrote an autobiography entitled, ''I Brought the Ages Home.'' This book recounts his adventures, travels, and museum work. During his retirement Currelly lived near [[Port Hope, Ontario]]. While in [[Florida]] for a winter vacation, Curelly fell ill and was taken the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=torontostar&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Charles T. Currelly, 82 Noted Archeologist Dies|newspaper=Toronto Daily Star|date=12 April 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 81-year-old Currelly died on April 10, 1957, at the hospital where he had been receiving treatment since December.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum Founder Passes in Baltimore Hospital|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=we8xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6-IFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4644,2776533&amp;dq=charles-trick-currelly&amp;hl=en|accessdate=19 June 2013|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=12 April 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 7, 1957 an exhibition was held at the Museum to commemorate him. The exhibition was marked by the unveiling of a bronze bust of Currelly which was cast in 1957 by the Vandevoorde Art Foundry of Montreal. The original sculpture was created in 1919 by Canadian artist Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar. This bust and a bronze medallion of Currelly can still be viewed today in the Museum's Sackler Reading Room.&lt;ref name=Bust&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Arthur M. |date= Spring 2009 |title= Commemorating a ROM Legend: Saying Goodbye to C.T.

'''Citation Network''' is a [[social network]] which contains paper sources and linked by co-citation relationships. Egghe &amp; Rousseau once (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;228) explain "when a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' cites a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can show this by an arrow going from the node representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the document representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this way the documents from a collection D form a directed graph, which is called a 'citation graph' or 'citation network' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/citation_network.htm Science Citation Index: Effectiveness in locating articles in the anaesthetics field: 'Perturbation of ion transport'. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 43: 814, Cawkell, A. E. (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==
[[Citation]] is a reference to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.
Citation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available. In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called "Research Reviews".&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/publications/papers/CMU-ECE-2011-017.pdf Structures and Statistics of Citation Networks, Miray Kas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and figures&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; ==
* Citation networks are directed. The links go from one document to the other. 
* Citation networks are acyclic because a paper can cite only existing papers.
* All edges in the citation networks point backwards in time.
* Links in co-authorship networks are reciprocal (symmetric).
* The link weights between two authors in co-authorship networks can increase over time if they have further collaboration.
* Vertices and edges added to the citation/co-authorship networks are permanent and cannot be removed at a later time. 
* The already formed part of the network is mostly static and only the leading edge of the network changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6636">Technical variations of [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] distributions include support for different hardware devices and systems or software package configurations. Organizational differences may be motivated by historical reasons. Other criteria include security, including how quickly security upgrades are available; ease of package management; and number of packages available.

These tables compare each noteworthy distribution's latest stable release on wide-ranging objective criteria. It does not cover each operating system's [[operating system advocacy|subjective merits]], branches marked as unstable or beta, nor compare Solaris distributions with other operating systems.

== General ==

Basic general information about the distributions: creator or producer, release date and latest version, and so forth.

'''Electronic mail''' ('''email''' or '''e-mail''') is a method of exchanging messages ("[[mail]]") between people using electronic devices. Invented by [[Ray Tomlinson]], email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across [[computer network]]s, which today is primarily the [[Internet access|Internet]]. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be [[Online and offline|online]] at the same time, in common with [[instant messaging]]. Today's email systems are based on a [[store-and-forward]] model. Email [[Server (computing)|servers]] accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] or a [[webmail]] interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.

Originally an [[ASCII]] text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments. [[International email]], with internationalized email addresses using [[UTF-8]], has been standardized, but {{as of|2017|lc=y}} it has not been widely adopted.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

The history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early [[ARPANET]], with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561). An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today. Email had an important role in creating the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Partridge|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services.

==Terminology==
Historically, the term ''electronic mail'' was used generically for any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe [[fax]] document transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pages 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Luckett, What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85 Popular Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021738/https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85 |date=2016-04-30 }}, Vol. 202, No. 3 (March 1973); page 85&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today.

Electronic mail has been most commonly called ''email'' or ''e-mail'' since around 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+mail%2Ce-mail&amp;year_start=1980&amp;year_end=1995&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share= |title=Google Ngram Viewer |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516172701/http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+mail%2Ce-mail&amp;year_start=1980&amp;year_end=1995&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share= |archivedate=2013-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but variations of the [[spelling]] have been used:

{{Main|History of email}}
[[Computer]]-based mail and messaging became possible with the advent of [[time-sharing]] computers in the early 1960s, and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems. Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the [[ARPANET]] (created in the late 1960s), which aimed at [[software portability]] between its systems.  That portability helped make the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) increasingly influential.

For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the [[X.400]] email system, part of the [[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile]] (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php "Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101025735/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |date=2016-01-01 }}, Susan R. Harris, Ph.D., and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html | title= A Brief History of the Internet | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150811053448/http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html | archivedate= 2015-08-11 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] email protocols the standard.

==Operation==
The diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=How E-mail Works|publisher=howstuffworks.com|year=2008|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/e-mail-messaging/email.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611181852/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/e-mail-messaging/email.htm|archivedate=2017-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that takes place when sender [[Placeholder names in cryptography|Alice]] transmits a message using a [[E-mail client|mail user agent]] (MUA) addressed to the [[email address]] of the recipient.

[[File:email.svg|thumb|Email operation]]
# The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol, a profile of the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), to send the message content to the local [[mail submission agent]] (MSA), in this case ''smtp.a.org''.
# The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header), in this case ''bob@b.org''  which is a [[Fully qualified domain address|fully qualified domain address (FQDA)]]. The part before the @ sign is the ''local part'' of the address, often the [[username]] of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a [[domain name]]. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the [[fully qualified domain name]] of the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).
# The [[DNS server]] for the domain ''b.org'' (''ns.b.org'') responds with any [[MX record]]s listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case ''mx.b.org'', a [[message transfer agent]] (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html "MX Record Explanation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117204846/https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html |date=2015-01-17 }}, it.cornell.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final [[message delivery agent]] (MDA).
# The MDA delivers it to the [[Email Mailbox|mailbox]] of user ''bob''.
# Bob's MUA picks up the message using either the [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP3) or the [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP).

In addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:
* Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as [[IBM]] [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]]. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.
* Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a [[webmail]] service.
* Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1. 
* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.
* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.

Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called ''[[open mail relay]]s''. This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci782509,00.html |title=What is open relay? |accessdate=2008-04-07 |date=2004-07-19 |work=WhatIs.com |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824005337/http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci782509,00.html |archivedate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ch Seetha Ram|title=Information Technology for Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bHAGrUxqRsC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2010|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-8450-267-1|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of [[email spam|unsolicited bulk email]] and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare,&lt;ref name="IMCR-016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |title=Allowing Relaying in SMTP: A Series of Surveys |accessdate=2008-04-13 |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |date=2002-08-20 |work=IMC Reports |publisher=[[Internet Mail Consortium]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118121843/http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.

==Message format {{anchor|Internet Message Format}}==
The basic Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322, with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called ''[[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]]'' or ''MIME''. RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008, and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 – which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the [[ARPANET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Simpson|title=An update to the email standards|date=October 3, 2008|publisher=MailChannels Blog Entry|url=http://blog.mailchannels.com/2008/10/update-to-email-standards.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006080735/http://blog.mailchannels.com/2008/10/update-to-email-standards.html|archivedate=October 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The header is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]] such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a [[signature block]] at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.

===Message header===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bracket]] --&gt;
Each message has exactly one [[Header (computing)|header]] (the "header section" of the message, according to the specification), which is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]] ("header fields"). Each field has a name ("field name" or "header field name") and a value ("field body" or "header field body"). RFC 5322 specifies the precise [[syntax]].

Informally, each line of text in the header that begins with a non-[[Whitespace character|whitespace]] [[Printable characters|printable character]] begins a separate field. The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character ":". The separator is then followed by the field value (the "body" of the field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character. Field names and, without [[Extended SMTP#SMTPUTF8|SMTPUTF8]], field bodies are restricted to 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME [[MIME#Encoded-Word|encoded words]].

====Header fields====
Email header fields can be multi-line, with each line recommended to be no more than 78 characters, although the technical limit is 998 characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322|title=RFC 5322, Internet Message Format|author=P.

In particular, this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters. Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products, and promoted by some governments.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/now-get-your-email-address-in-hindi/articleshow/53830034.cms|title=Now, get your email address in Hindi - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2016-10-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828044631/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/now-get-your-email-address-in-hindi/articleshow/53830034.cms|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The message header must include at least the following fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6 |title=RFC 5322, 3.6. Field Definitions |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230021424/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6 |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.4 |title=RFC 5322, 3.6.4. Identification Fields |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230021424/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.4 |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''From'': The [[email address]], and optionally the name of the author(s). In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings.
* ''Date'': The local time and date when the message was written. Like the ''From:'' field, many email clients fill this in automatically when sending. The recipient's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to them.

RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]; it provides for [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html permanent] and [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html provisional] field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064 |title=RFC 5064 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=December 2007 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725215530/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064 |archivedate=2014-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''To'': The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message's recipient(s). Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.
* ''Subject'': A brief summary of the topic of the message. [[E-mail subject abbreviations|Certain abbreviations]] are commonly used in the subject, including [[E-mail subject abbreviations|"RE:" and "FW:"]].
* ''Cc'': [[Carbon copy]]; Many email clients will mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list. (''Bcc'': [[Blind carbon copy]]; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.)
* [[Content-Type]]: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a [[MIME]] type.
* ''Precedence'': commonly with values "bulk", "junk", or "list"; used to indicate that automated "vacation" or "out of office" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. [[Sendmail]] uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with "Precedence: special-delivery" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the ''X-Auto-Response-Suppress'' field.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft, Auto Response Suppress, 2010, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx microsoft reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407033540/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx |date=2011-04-07 }}, 2010 Sep 22&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Message-ID'': Also an automatically generated field; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).
* ''In-Reply-To'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies for reply messages.
* ''References'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.
* ''Reply-To'': Address that should be used to reply to the message.
* ''Sender'': Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).
* ''Archived-At'': A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.

Note that the ''To:'' field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content. The "To:" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the "From:" field does not have to be the real sender of the email message. Some mail servers apply [[email authentication]] systems to messages being relayed. Data pertaining to server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.

SMTP defines the ''trace information'' of a message, which is also saved in the header using the following two fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|rfc=5321|author=[[John Klensin]]|sectionname=Trace Information|section=4.4| date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Received'': when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).
* ''Return-Path'': when the delivery SMTP server makes the ''final delivery'' of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.

Other fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called ''trace fields'', in a broader sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|title=Trace headers|author=John Levine|date=14 January 2012|work=email message|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=16 January 2012|quote=there are many more trace fields than those two|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811135249/http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|archivedate=11 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Authentication-Results'': when a server carries out authentication checks, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.&lt;ref&gt;This extensible field is defined by RFC 7001, that also defines an [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] registry of [http://www.iana.org/assignments/email-auth/ Email Authentication Parameters].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Received-SPF'': stores results of [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 7208.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Auto-Submitted'': is used to mark automatically generated messages.&lt;ref&gt;Defined in RFC 3834, and updated by RFC 5436.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''VBR-Info'': claims [[Vouch by Reference|VBR]] whitelisting&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5518.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Message body===

====Content encoding====
Internet email was originally designed for 7-bit [[ASCII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TCP/IP Network Administration|year=2002|isbn=978-0-596-00297-8|author=Craig Hunt|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most email software is [[8-bit clean]] but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The [[MIME]] standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: [[quoted printable]] for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and [[base64]] for arbitrary binary data. The [[8BITMIME]] and [[BINARY]] extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many [[mail transport agent]]s still do not support them fully. In some countries, several encoding schemes coexist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is coincidence, when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international [[character set]]s, [[Unicode]] is growing in popularity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Plain text and HTML====
Most modern graphic [[email client]]s allow the use of either [[plain text]] or [[HTML#HTML email|HTML]] for the message body at the option of the user. [[HTML email]] messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well, for compatibility reasons. Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in [[block quote]]s, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as [[underline]]s and [[italics]], and change [[font]] styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about [[web bug]]s, abuse of HTML email as a vector for [[phishing]] attacks and the spread of [[malware|malicious software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|title=Email policies that prevent viruses|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512053927/http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html|archive-date=2007-05-12|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some web-based [[mailing list]]s recommend that all posts be made in plain-text, with 72 or 80 [[characters per line]] for all the above reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |title=When posting to a RootsWeb mailing list... |publisher=Helpdesk.rootsweb.com |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219024856/http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |archivedate=2014-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html |title=...Plain text, 72 characters per line... |publisher=Openbsd.org |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208005706/http://openbsd.org/mail.html |archivedate=2014-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because they have a significant number of readers using [[List of email clients#Text-based|text-based email clients]] such as [[Mutt (email client)|Mutt]]. Some [[Microsoft]] [[email client]]s allow rich formatting using their proprietary [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF), but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible [[email client]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138053 |title=How to Prevent the Winmail.dat File from Being Sent to Internet Users |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109193922/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138053 |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Servers and client applications==
[[File:Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.png|thumb|The interface of an email client, [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Catch-all (Mail)]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
Messages are exchanged between hosts using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] with software programs called [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called [[mail delivery agent]]s (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it,&lt;ref&gt;In practice, some accepted messages may nowadays not be delivered to the recipient's InBox, but instead to a Spam or Junk folder which, especially in a corporate environment, may be inaccessible to the recipient&lt;/ref&gt; and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a [[bounce message]] back to the sender, indicating the problem.

Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[IMAP]], or, as is more likely in a large [[corporation|corporate]] environment, with a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] protocol specific to [[Novell Groupwise]], [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]s.  Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called [[mail user agent]]s (MUAs).

Mail can be stored on the [[client (computing)|client]], on the [[Server (computing)|server]] side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include [[Maildir]] and [[mbox]]. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as [[IMAP]], moving email from one server to another can be done with any [[Mail user agent|MUA]] supporting the protocol.

Many current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as [[Gmail]] or [[Yahoo! Mail]], that performs the same tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/|title=Free Email Providers in the Yahoo! Directory|last=|first=|date=|website=dir.yahoo.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704154604/http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/|archive-date=2014-07-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[webmail]] interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard [[web browser]], from any computer, rather than relying on an email client.

===Filename extensions===
Upon reception of email messages, [[email client]] applications save messages in operating system files in the file system. Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the ''[[mbox]]'' format. The specific format used is often indicated by special [[filename extension]]s:
;&lt;tt&gt;eml&lt;/tt&gt;
:Used by many email clients including [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Microsoft Outlook Express]], [[Lotus notes]], [[Windows Mail]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as [[plain text]] in [[MIME]] format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.
;&lt;tt&gt;emlx&lt;/tt&gt;
:Used by [[Apple Mail]].
;&lt;tt&gt;msg&lt;/tt&gt;
:Used by [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Office Outlook]] and [[OfficeLogic|OfficeLogic Groupware]].
;&lt;tt&gt;mbx&lt;/tt&gt;
:Used by [[Opera Mail]], [[KMail]], and [[Apple Mail]] based on the [[mbox]] format.

Some applications (like [[Apple Mail]]) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.

===URI scheme mailto===
{{main|mailto}}
The [[URI scheme]], as registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], defines the &lt;tt&gt;mailto:&lt;/tt&gt; scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the ''To:'' field.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2368 section 3 : by Paul Hoffman in 1998 discusses operation of the "mailto" URL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnett 2011 p. 245" /&gt;

==Types==

===Web-based email===
{{main|Webmail}}
Many email providers have a web-based email client (e.g. [[AOL Mail]], [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]], [[Hotmail]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]]). This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible [[web browser]] to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the client, so can't be read without a current Internet connection.

===POP3 email services===
The [[Post Office Protocol]] 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the [[server (computing)|server]]. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).&lt;ref name="Windows to Linux"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = David | title = Windows to Linux | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | location =  | page = 192 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161226051835/https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage | archivedate = 2016-12-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IMAP email servers===
The [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like [[smartphone]]s are increasingly used to check email while travelling, and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually mail is left in folders in the mail server.

===MAPI email servers===
[[MAPI|Messaging Application Programming Interface]] (MAPI) is used by [[Microsoft Outlook]] to communicate to [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] - and to a range of other email server products such as [[Axigen|Axigen Mail Server]], [[Kerio Connect]], [[Scalix]], [[Zimbra]], [[HP OpenMail]], [[IBM Lotus Notes]], [[Zarafa (software)|Zarafa]], and [[Bynari]] where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.

==Uses==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}

===Business and organizational use===
Email has been widely accepted by business, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an 'e-revolution' in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed [[Internet]]). A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.&lt;ref name=om&gt;By Om Malik, GigaOm. "[http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ Is Email a Curse or a Boon?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012735/http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ |date=2010-12-04 }}" September 22, 2010. Retrieved October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has some key benefits to business and other organizations, including:
; Facilitating logistics
: Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an in-person meeting, [[telephone call]], or [[conference call]] can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.
; Helping with synchronisation
: With [[Real-time computing|real time]] communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows [[wikt:asynchrony|asynchrony]]: each participant may control their schedule independently.
; Reducing cost
: Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or [[long distance telephone call]]s, [[telex]] or [[telegrams]].
; Increasing speed
: Much faster than most of the alternatives.
; Creating a "written" record
: Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.

====Email marketing====
Email marketing via "[[opt-in email|opt-in]]" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information.&lt;ref name=brett&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.

===Personal use===

====Personal computer====
Many users access their personal email from friends and family members using a [[personal computer]] in their house or apartment.

====Mobile====
Email has become used on [[smartphone]]s and on all types of computers. Mobile "apps" for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home. While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. {{As of|2011}}, there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.&lt;ref name="Barnett 2011 p. 245"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Derek |last2=Smith |first2=Marc A. |last3=Heer |first3=Jeffrey |author-link3=Jeffrey Heer |chapter=E-Mail |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA245#v=onepage |editor1-last=Barnett |editor1-first=George A |title=Encyclopedia of social networks |publisher=Sage |publication-place=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2011 |isbn=9781412994170 |page=245 |oclc=959670912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages. It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their [[Facebook]] accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketingland.com/smartphone-activities-study-email-web-facebook-37954|title=Email Is Top Activity On Smartphones, Ahead Of Web Browsing &amp; Facebook [Study]|date=28 March 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429184034/http://marketingland.com/smartphone-activities-study-email-web-facebook-37954|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries. For example, in comparison to 75% of those consumers in the US who used it, only 17% in India did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics|title=The ultimate mobile email statistics overview|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711160527/http://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics|archivedate=2014-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declining use among young people====
{{as of|2010}}, the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. For persons 12 to 17, the number was down 18 percent. Young people preferred [[instant messaging]], [[texting]] and [[social media]]. Technology writer Matt Richtel said in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that email was like the [[VCR]], [[vinyl record]]s and [[Still camera|film cameras]]—no longer cool and something older people do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/technology/21email.html|title=E-Mail Gets an Instant Makeover|last=Richtel|first=Matt|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-12-20|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/why-are-young-people-abandoning-email/339329/|title=Why Are Young People Abandoning Email?|last=Gustini|first=Ray|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=2010-12-21|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging [[Mobile app|app]]s 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/email-is-dying-among-mobiles-youngest-users/|title=Email is dying among mobile’s youngest users|last=Perez|first=Sarah|publisher=techcrunch.com|date=2016-03-24|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}

===Attachment size limitation===
{{Main|Email attachment}}
Email messages may have one or more attachments, which are additional files that are appended to the email. Typical attachments include [[Microsoft Word]] documents, [[pdf]] documents and scanned images of paper documents. In principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments, but in practice email clients, [[server (computing)|server]]s and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files, or complete email - typically to 25MB or less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exchangepedia.com/2007/09/exchange-server-2007-setting-message-size-limits.html ''"Setting Message Size Limits in Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2007"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212114611/http://exchangepedia.com/2007/09/exchange-server-2007-setting-message-size-limits.html |date=2013-02-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geek.com/articles/news/google-updates-file-size-limits-for-gmail-and-youtube-20090629 ''"Google updates file size limits for Gmail and YouTube"'', geek.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219141547/http://www.geek.com/articles/news/google-updates-file-size-limits-for-gmail-and-youtube-20090629 |date=2011-12-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=8770&amp;topic=1517 ''"Maximum attachment size"'', mail.google.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to technical reasons, attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.exchangeqa.aspx|title=Exchange 2007: Attachment Size Increase,...|date=2010-03-25|publisher=TechNet Magazine, Microsoft.com US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825220922/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.exchangeqa.aspx?pr=blog|archivedate=2016-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email. Where larger files need to be shared, [[file hosting service]]s of various sorts are available; and generally suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-large-files-to-other-people-7005da19-607a-47d5-b2c5-8f3982c6cc83 "Send large files to other people"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807110751/https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-large-files-to-other-people-7005da19-607a-47d5-b2c5-8f3982c6cc83 |date=2016-08-07 }}, Microsoft.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-ways-to-email-large-attachments/ "8 ways to email large attachments"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702171053/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-ways-to-email-large-attachments/ |date=2016-07-02 }}, Chris Hoffman, December 21, 2012, makeuseof.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information overload===
The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and "white collar" employees has led to concerns that recipients face an "[[information overload]]" in dealing with increasing volumes of email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radicati|first=Sara|title=Email Statistics Report, 2010|url=http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2010-2014-Executive-Summary2.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901222039/http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2010-2014-Executive-Summary2.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Doug|title=Happy Information Overload Day!|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-20/tech/information.overload.day_1_mails-marsha-egan-rss?|work=CNN|date=July 26, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121113709/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-20/tech/information.overload.day_1_mails-marsha-egan-rss?|archivedate=January 21, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth in mobile devices, by default employees may also receive work-related emails outside of their working day. This can lead to increased stress, decreased satisfaction with work, and some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/technology/20digi.html|title=Struggling to Evade the E-Mail Tsunami|date=2008-04-20|publisher=The New York Times|first=Randall|last=Stross|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094850/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/technology/20digi.html|archivedate=April 17, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as efforts to read the many emails could reduce [[productivity]].

===Spam===
{{Main|Email spam}}
Email "spam" is the term used to describe unsolicited bulk email. The low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30% of total email traffic was already spam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitepronews.com/2015/05/04/seeing-spam-how-to-take-care-of-your-google-analytics-data/|title=Seeing Spam?

The US [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] and similar laws elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Spam Bill 2003 ([http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd045.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911062331/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd045.pdf |date=2006-09-11 }})&lt;/ref&gt; had some impact, and a number of effective [[anti-spam techniques (email)|anti-spam techniques]] now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/07/google-says-ai-catches-99-9-percent-gmail-spam/ "Google Says Its AI Catches 99.9 Percent of Gmail Spam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916054313/https://www.wired.com/2015/07/google-says-ai-catches-99-9-percent-gmail-spam/ |date=2016-09-16 }}, Cade Metz, July 09 2015, wired.com&lt;/ref&gt; but the volume sent is still very high&amp;mdash;and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products, but malicious content or links.&lt;ref name="securelist"&gt;[https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/74682/spam-and-phishing-in-q1-2016/ "Spam and phishing in Q1 2016"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154745/https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/74682/spam-and-phishing-in-q1-2016/ |date=2016-08-09 }},  May 12, 2016, securelist.com&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, for example, the proportion of spam to legitimate email rose to 59.56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2018_fifa-2018-and-bitcoin-among-2017-most-luring-topics|title=Kaspersky Lab Spam and Phishing report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malware===
A range of malicious email types exist. These range from [[List of email scams|various types of email scams]], including [[Social engineering (security)|"social engineering"]] scams such as [[advance-fee scam]] "Nigerian letters", to [[phishing]], [[email bomb]]ardment and [[Computer worm|email worms]].

===Email spoofing===
{{Main|Email spoofing}}
[[Email spoofing]] occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. [[Email spam]] and [[phishing]] methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.

===Email bombing===
{{main|Email bomb}}

[[Email bomb]]ing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.

===Privacy concerns===
{{Main|Email privacy}}

Today it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although [[information technology]] personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.

Email privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:
* email messages are generally not encrypted.
* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.
* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.
* the "Received:"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.
* [[web bug]]s invisibly embedded in email content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is read, or re-read, and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the [[user agent string]].

There are [[cryptography]] applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, [[Virtual Private Network]]s or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], SMEmail,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3176 SMEmail – A New Protocol for the Secure E-mail in Mobile Environments], Proceedings of the Australian Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC'08), pp. 39–44, Adelaide, Australia, Dec. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[S/MIME]] can be used for [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over [[Transport Layer Security]]/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.

Additionally, many [[mail user agent]]s do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] prevent this. Finally, attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer filesharing]]. Attached files may contain [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or [[Computer virus|viruses]].

===Flaming===
[[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word "incendiary" to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the [[social norms]] that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kiesler |author2=D. Zubrow |author3=A.M. Moses |author4=V. Geller |title=Affect in computer-mediated communication: an experiment in synchronous terminal-to-terminal discussion|journal=Human-Computer Interaction|volume=1|pages=77–104|year=1985|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0101_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email bankruptcy===
{{main|Email bankruptcy}}
Also known as "email fatigue", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a "boilerplate" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All We Are Saying.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24|first=Grant|last=Barrett|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094849/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html|archivedate=April 17, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internationalization===
Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based. MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets, but other headers and email addresses using UTF-8, while standardized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://registry.in/Internationalized_Domain_Names_IDNs|title=Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) {{!}} Registry.In|website=registry.in|access-date=2016-10-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513012539/http://registry.in/Internationalized_Domain_Names_IDNs|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have yet to be widely adopted.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/datamail-worlds-first-free-linguistic-email-service-supports-eight-india-languages/articleshow/54923001.cms|title=DataMail: World's first free linguistic email service supports eight India languages|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022080739/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/datamail-worlds-first-free-linguistic-email-service-supports-eight-india-languages/articleshow/54923001.cms|archivedate=2016-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalconqurer.com/gadgets/made-india-datamail-empowers-russia-email-address-russian-language/|title=Made In India ‘Datamail’ Empowers Russia With Email Address In Russian Language - Digital Conqueror|date=7 December 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305005327/http://digitalconqurer.com/gadgets/made-india-datamail-empowers-russia-email-address-russian-language/|archivedate=5 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|International email|Email address#Internationalization}}

===Tracking of sent mail===
The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] introduced [[Delivery Status Notification]]s (delivery receipts) and [[Return receipt#Email|Message Disposition Notifications]] (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production. (A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined, but it never gained traction; see RFCs 3885&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3885, ''SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking''&lt;/ref&gt; through 3888.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3888, ''Message Tracking Model and Requirements''&lt;/ref&gt;)

Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:
* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.
* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ([[email spoofing]]), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user.

In the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of [[web bug]]s have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D9143AF931A15752C1A9669C8B63|title=Software That Tracks E-Mail Is Raising Privacy Concerns|author=Amy Harmon|publisher=The New York Times|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Email.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102000000/http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |archivedate=2018-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/yahoo/notification-when-yahoo-email-is-opened.php |title=Webdevelopersnotes.com |publisher=Webdevelopersnotes.com |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109193140/http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/yahoo/notification-when-yahoo-email-is-opened.php |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML.

[[File:Hero lion Dur-Sharrukin Louvre AO19862.jpg|thumb|Possible representation of Enkidu as [[Master of Animals]] grasping a lion and snake, in an [[Assyrian palace relief]], from [[Dur-Sharrukin]], now Louvre]]
{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=4}}
'''Enkidu''' ({{cuneiform|𒂗𒆠𒆕}} EN.KI.DU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, "[[Enki]]'s creation"), formerly misread as '''Eabani''', is a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. Enkidu was formed from clay and water by [[Ninhursag|Aruru]], the goddess of creation, to rid [[Gilgamesh]] of his arrogance.

In the story he is a [[wild man]], raised by animals and ignorant of human society until he is bedded by [[Shamhat]]. Thereafter a series of interactions with humans and human ways bring him closer to civilization, culminating in a wrestling match with Gilgamesh, king of [[Uruk]]. Enkidu embodies the wild or natural world. Though equal to Gilgamesh in strength and bearing, he acts in some ways as an [[antithesis]] to the cultured, urban-bred warrior-king. Enkidu then becomes the king's constant companion and deeply beloved friend, accompanying him on adventures until he is stricken with illness and dies.

The deep, tragic loss of Enkidu profoundly inspires in Gilgamesh a quest to escape death by obtaining godly immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|ref=harv |last=Jastrow |first=Morris |authorlink=Morris Jastrow Jr. |wstitle=Eabani|volume=8|pages=788–789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of Enkidu==
The people of Uruk complain to the gods that their mighty king Gilgamesh is too harsh. The goddess Aruru forms Enkidu from water and clay as rival to Gilgamesh, as a countervailing force. Enkidu lived in the wild, roaming with the herds, and joining the game at the watering-hole. M.H. Henze notes in this an early Mesopotamian tradition of the wild man living apart and roaming the hinterland, who eats grass like the animals and like them, drinks from the watering places.&lt;ref name=Henze&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u1By9tEjh6AC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=enkidu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q36PVMaZCIrBgwT9gYHoAw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=enkidu&amp;f=false |via=Google Books |author=Henze, M.H. |title=The Madness of King Nebuchadnezzar |publisher=Brill |year=1999 |ISBN=9789004114210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hunter sees him and realizes that it is Enkidu who is freeing the animals from his traps. He reports this to Gilgamesh, who sends the temple prostitute, [[Shamhat]], to deal with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aina.org/books/eog/eog.htm |title=The Coming of Enkidu |series=The Epic of Gilgamesh |publisher=Assyrian International News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enkidu spends six days and seven nights copulating with Shamhat, after which, sensing her scent upon him, the animals flee from him, and he finds he cannot return to his old ways.&lt;ref name=Westenholz&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRqbe67ChgAC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;dq=enkidu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cJaPVNT1M8OZgwT-x4GQCw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=enkidu&amp;f=false |via=Google Books |author1=Westenholz, Aage |author2=Koch-Westenholz, Ula |contribution=Enkidu - the noble savage? |title=Wisdom, Gods, and Literature: Studies in Assyriology in Honour of W.G.

He now protects the shepherd's flock against predators, turning against his old life. Jastrow and Clay are of the opinion that the story of Enkidu was originally a separate tale to illustrate "man's career and destiny, how through intercourse with a woman he awakens to the sense of human dignity, ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ4ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=enkidu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oaSPVJOSAcuogwTH7oDgCQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=enkidu&amp;f=false |via=Google Books |author1=Jastrow, Morris Jr. |author2=Clay, ALbert T. |title=An Old Babylonian Version of the Gilgamesh Epic |page=20 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamhat tells him of the city of Uruk and of its king Gilgamesh. He travels to Uruk and engages Gilgamesh in a wrestling match as a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins and the two become fast friends.

==Adventures with Gilgamesh==
Enkidu assists Gilgamesh in defeating and killing [[Humbaba]], the guardian monster of the [[Cedar Forest]]. Enkidu selects a particularly tall tree to provide lumber for a new door for Enlil's temple in Uruk. Later, he assists Gilgamesh in slaying [[Gugalanna]] the ''[[Bull (mythology)|Bull of Heaven]]'', which the gods have sent to kill Gilgamesh as a reprisal for rejecting [[Ishtar]]'s affections while enumerating the misfortunes that befell her former lovers. Ishtar demands that the pair pay for the bull's destruction. [[Shamash]] appeals to the other gods to let both of them live, but only Gilgamesh is spared. Enkidu succumbs to a wasting illness. He represents the hero who wins fame but dies early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolff, H. N. |date=April-June 1969 |title=Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the heroic life |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=392-398 |publisher=American Oriental Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilgamesh responds to the loss of Enkidu by seeking out [[Utnapishtim]] in a quest for eternal life.

There is another non-canonical tablet in which Enkidu journeys into the underworld, but many scholars consider the tablet to be a sequel or add-on to the original epic as the work was revised several times.  The section about the Flood is also considered to be addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moran |first=William L. |date=1991 |title=Epic of Gilgamesh: A document of ancient humanism |url=http://biblio.ebaf.edu/cgi-bin/koha/opac-ISBDdetail.pl?biblionumber=175380 |publisher=The Canadian Society for Mesopotamian Studies Bulletin |page=20 |issn=0844-3416 |access-date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Experiments 1751 color.jpg|thumb|upright 1.25 |Title page of 1751 original publication]]
''' ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity'' ''' is a mid-eighteenth century book consisting of letters from [[Benjamin Franklin]]. These letters concerned Franklin's discoveries about the behavior of electricity based on experimentation and scientific studies. The book came in [[pamphlet]] form for the first three English editions. The last two editions were in a book volume with hard covers and [[Bookbinding|a book spine]]. There were eleven European editions of the book: five English editions, three French editions, and a German, Italian and Latin edition. The publication was well received worldwide. It was considered America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century.

The book came about through the activities of scientists at the [[Royal Society]] of London. Franklin sent letters to members of the Society about his experiments on electricity and the observations he had made. Most of these letters went to [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]]. Some of these were read at the society's meetings. There was much interest shown, so some of them were sent to a printer to be published in a magazine. Public interest in Franklin's letters about electricity led the Society to gather together many of the letters to Collinson from Franklin over a two-year period and send them to the printer for publication. This first collection of letters was published in a ninety-page [[pamphlet]] in 1751. It was soon followed by other parts that were "Supplemental" to the existing edition and eventually a "New" publication was sold from the total of all the "Parts" produced. Each edition expanded by additional Franklin letters being added. It ultimately became a 496-page volume by 1769. The book inspired others to follow in Franklin's footsteps to do further in-depth research on electricity.

== Background ==

[[File:Franklin machine.jpg|thumb|upright 0.9|Franklin's electrostatic machine &lt;br /&gt; display at [[Franklin Institute]] museum.]]

Franklin was first attracted to the study of electricity when he saw the showman [[Archibald Spencer]] do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744).{{sfn|Benge|Benge|2005|page=106}} He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed.{{sfn|Benge|Benge|2005|page=107}} He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=42}} In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner [[David Hall (publisher)|David Hall]], and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=53}}

Peter Collinson &amp;ndash; a wealthy [[Quaker]] cloth merchant, a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and one of the founders of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] &amp;ndash; donated (in 1746) a [[Leyden jar]] battery, a glass tube,{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} and an account of new German experiments in electricity to the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] (founded by Franklin). The account described how to make electricity from the glass tube.{{sfn|Stearns|1970|p=620}} Franklin first experimented with static electricity in the middle of 1747, referring to it as "these new wonders."{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=54}} In conducting his initial electrical research, Franklin made use of the unique battery and glass tube provided by Collinson.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=53}}

[[Thomas Penn]], son of [[William Penn]], made an electrostatic machine that supplemented Collinson's equipment.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=53}} To these Franklin added an [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|electrostatic generating machine of his own design]] that was more efficient than the one given to him by Penn.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} It was convenient because it was constructed with a handle, like that of a common grindstone, and turned by the operator. The simple mechanical machine mechanism then spun an axle that had mounted on it a glass sphere that rubbed on a cloth pad.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=55}} The glass sphere bulb generated 'electric fire' (an [[electric charge]]) that was transferred through conductors to a Leyden jar capacitor that held the electric charge that was then used for experimentation.&lt;ref name=ExperimentingMethod&gt;{{cite news |last=Hillis |first= Newell|date=February 16, 1914 |title=The Quest of God |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9340462// | work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |location=Brooklyn, New York |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin formed a research core team that consisted of [[Ebenezer Kinnersley]], [[Thomas Hopkinson]], and [[Philip Syng]] and developed the first scientific research laboratory in America.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|pages=53–54}} He repeated his experiments to obtain the same results and recorded this observation. In this process he showed that anyone could repeat and prove these results themselves of the electrical principle if they did the experiment he detailed.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=55}} 

Franklin spent much time studying this new field of electricity, and from 1747 through 1750 sent many letters to Collinson on his findings. The book consists of a collection of these letters. The book came in pamphlet form for the first three editions. The last two editions were a book volume with hard covers. Franklin's letters explained his experiments and the observations he made from them. He sent these to Collinson to show that the equipment {{ndash}} put into the hands of the group of men associated with Library Company of Philadelphia {{ndash}} was being put to good use.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=54}}

[[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], a scientist specializing in the study of electricity, theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=49}} Watson received in 1746 from [[John Mitchell (geographer)|Dr. John Mitchell]] a lengthy Franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity. He read part of the letter to fellow members of the Royal Society of London on November 9, 1749. A week later he finished the reading. On December 4 Watson received another similar Franklin letter dated April 29, 1749, from Collinson and read it to the Society on December 21, 1749. Over the next two years Collinson had transmitted to the Society more of Franklin's letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by Franklin and his team of experimenters. Many talked about the tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] - the basics to his lightning rod invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=41}}

Watson turned over some of these Franklin letters to the local publisher  [[Edward Cave]], who had them printed in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1750.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|p=81}} In April 1751 Cave printed in a publication more of the letters Collinson had received and they included corrections personally added by Franklin.{{sfn|Cohen|1941|p=92}} This publication was titled, ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity, Made in Philadelphia in America by Mr. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and Communicated in several letters to Mr. P. Collinson of London, F.R.S'' (London).{{sfn|Stearns|1970|pp=619–620}} It was a 90-page pamphlet of 86 numbered pages.&lt;ref name=letter1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0055 |title=From Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, 28 March 1747 |author= |date= |website=Founders Online |publisher=National Historical Publications and Records Commission |access-date=July 12, 2015 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028190523/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0055 |archivedate=28 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet included an unsigned preface written by Dr. [[John Fothergill (physician)|John Fothergill]].{{sfn|Cohen|1956|pages=432, 478}} This first publication of ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity'' sold for the expensive price of two [[shillings]] and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] British money, {{Inflation|UK|.125|1751|2015|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=96}}

The eighteenth century book consists of a collection of letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.&lt;ref name=BF-PC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NolletDebunked&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-experiments-and-observations-on-electricity-made-at-philadelphia-in-america/oclc/942611109&amp;referer=brief_results |title=New experiments and observations on electricity : made at Philadelphia in America (Notes section) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005 |website=WorldCat - Book Details|publisher= [[Thompson Gale]]|access-date=February 16, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were five English editions to this book. The first three editions were not hard cover volumes, but rather just pamphlets with paper covers of collected letters of Franklin. They were carelessly put together when published. Each of these pamphlet editions had supplements of additional letters that were added later and then republished. The first publication of 1751 was supplemented in 1753 with 20 more pages and called ''Supplemental Experiments and Observations, Part II''. It was numbered 89 to 109 and published by E. Cave.  This was again supplemented with an additional 44 pages in 1754, numbered 110 to 154, and titled ''New Experiments and Observations, Part III.'' It was published by R. Cave, the son of E. Cave. The second edition published in 1754 was a reprint of parts I and II of the first edition. The third edition published in 1760, 1762, and 1764 was a reprint of all three parts of the first edition and numbered 1–154.&lt;ref name=BF-PC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NolletDebunked/&gt;

In this first set of letters Franklin talked about ''electrical fire'', later (1749) changing the terminology to ''electrical fluid''.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=56}} He wrote to Collinson on June 5, 1747, that his experiments showed that the electrical fire was a new [[Classical element|element]] of matter existing as particles in all ordinary matter.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|p=450}}  Franklin determined that a friction rubbing process like that of rubbing glass with a cloth does not create these particles, but only temporararily groups them together so that they can be collected and held in a Leyden jar of water and metal.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|p=450–454}} According to Franklin, one side of the Leyden jar had an accumulation of electrical fire, which he labeled as ''positive'' (''plus''), and the other side had a deficiency of electrical fire, labeled ''negative'' (''minus''). These losses and gains of electrification were exactly equal and are essentially the modern law of [[charge conservation]] except that it is now recognized that negative charges exist in their own right, not just as a deficiency of positive charges.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=26-27}} It is an important principle in modern science that explains the [[microphysics]] of the electrification of gross bodies.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|pp=49–50}} In these letters, Franklin introduced technical words that we use today for things related to electricity such as ''plus,'' ''minus,'' ''positive,'' ''negative,'' ''charge,'' ''discharge,'' ''armature,'' ''electric shock,'' ''electrician,'' ''condenser,'' ''conductor,'' and ''battery.''{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=40}}{{sfn|Wilson|1960|p=19}}
[[File:Leyden jar electric battery.jpg|thumb|upright 0.8|right| Leyden jar "electric battery"]]
Franklin's first experiments explained in this first set of letters to Collinson that the Leyden jar, a type of [[capacitor]], had equal and opposite charges on the inner and outer conductors.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=12}} This was shown in illustrations in his book.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=12}} The significant Franklin theory introduced to Collinson in a letter dated April 29, 1747, was the concept of the "dissectible condenser."{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=52}} Today we call this distribution of charges in a device, a capacitor.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=41}} He observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} In the case of the Leyden jar this was glass (nonconducting matter) and on each side of it was a metal material (conducting matter).{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} These opposite metal layers had the exact opposite electric charges (positive and negative).{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} He observed that when the wire on the inside of the jar was ''electrised'' positively by a certain amount, that the outer conductor simultaneously became ''electrised'' negatively in the same proportion.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}}

Franklin explained in these letters that in an experiment he did show that the charge was in the glass itself and not in the water within the jar, as had been theorized by others. After a Leyden jar was charged he poured the water from it into another Leyden jar that was not charged. It turned out the electric force was not ''condensed'' in the water itself, as the new Leyden jar had no charge with this water from the first Leyden jar. Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar. The conclusion then was that it was the glass itself that was the condenser of the electric force. It was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter what shape the glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle.{{sfn|Wilson|1960|p=21}} It was finally determined that a property of the glass itself was this "force" of equal and opposite charges.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=52}}{{sfn|Cohen|1956|p=452–465}}

Franklin further explains in these letters that the jar did not electrically balance itself, but a wire of some conducting material had to make contact from the inner conductor (plus) to the outer conductor (minus).{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} This way Franklin observed the balancing and combining of the two different states of electricity in the "miraculous bottle."{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} In the later editions of the book Franklin explained in his letters and showed in illustrations an assembly of Leyden jars that he termed "electrical battery" following the military term of the time of a "battery" being a group of cannons assembled together.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|pages=462}}{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=24–25}} Franklin assembled a number of parallel-plate condensers consisting of 11 plates of glass and each were "armed" with a lead metal sheet on each side. He hooked them together with wires in a series and then a master wire was attached that could then discharge (balance) the battery when touched to both sides.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=53}}
[[File:Bifocals by Benjamin Franklin - Franklin Institue - DSC06605.JPG|thumb|right|upright 1.21|Fourth edition volume increased to 496 pages. &lt;br /&gt; Had hard covers and additions to third edition. &lt;br /&gt; (Franklin's bifocal glasses shown on the book)]]
The fourth edition, published in 1769, is the first complete edition in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that increased the number of pages from 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his [[lightning rod]] invention, [[meteorological]] observations, [[human nature]], worldwide population increase, [[waterspout]]s, experiments on [[amber]], and information on his [[Franklin stove|Pennsylvania fireplace invention]]. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was published in 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. The only new document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the ''[[Public Advertiser]]'' London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition.&lt;ref name=Note4+5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-21-02-0156 |title=Note on the Fourth and Fifth Editions of Experiments and Observations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2017 |website=Founders Online |publisher=US National Archives |access-date=March 15, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth English edition, published in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on different parts of the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter that was important to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him for the gift of the German "electric tube" with directions on how to use it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so he made that particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.{{sfn|Cohen|1941|pp=149–170}}

== Editions ==
[[File:New Experiments PI&amp;II 1754.jpg|thumb|right|upright 1.60|Second edition 1754 of "New Experiments" of Part I and Part II]]
There were eleven editions of Experiments and Observations on Electricity. There were five English editions, three French editions, and an edition each in German, Italian and Latin. The first three English editions were similar, but not identical, and consisted of two or three parts. Each of these separate parts were printed and sold individually as a pamphlet. Each had a slight title change (i.e. "New", "Supplemental") apparently to promote selling additional copies to people that had bought before.{{sfn|Cohen|1941|pp=139–140}}

== Reception in France ==
[[File:Franklin's Experiments 1752 French edition.jpg|thumb|left|upright 0.85|1752 French edition]]
The [[French language|French]] translation, published in 1752, contained an experiment suggesting that a long, pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|p=82}} In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity.{{sfn|Stearns|1970|p=624}} Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the iron rod.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|p=82}}{{sfn|Benge|Benge|2005|page=126}} In London it was repeated in [[Spital Square]] on July 20, 1752, and again in [[Chelmsford, Essex]], on August 12, 1752.&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9345310// | work= The Manning Times |location= Manning, South Carolina |date=December 25, 1907 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Experiment suggested by Franklin and performed by D'Alibald |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9346628// | work= Covina Argus |location= Covina, California |date= November 30, 1907 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the [[kite experiment]] that he talked about in a letter to Collinson dated October 19, 1752.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; A man by the name of G.

King Louis XV honored Franklin after seeing some of the electrical experiments done in the royal palace at [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St. Germain]] near Paris, France. However physicist [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong.&lt;ref name=Nollet1753letter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-04-02-0154 |title= Jean-Antoine Nollet: Letters on Electricity|last=Nollet |first=Jean-Antoine |date=January 1, 1753 |website=NHPRC |publisher=US government National Archives |access-date=February 17, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often.

== Legacy ==

All editions of the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first publication of it was done in the United States by [[I. Bernard Cohen]].{{sfn|Purvis|2014|p=273}} The book is Franklin's only scientific work,{{sfn|Rosenberg|2009|page=212}} and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Kurutz|1980|page=212}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|page=181}} The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=12}} Eighteenth-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] writes in his book ''[[The History and Present State of Electricity]]'' (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.{{efn-ua|"Priestley declares in his ''History and Present State of Electricity'': Nothing was ever written upon the subject of electricity which was more read and admired in all parts of Europe than these letters. There is hardly any European language into which they have not been translated; and, as if this were not sufficient to make them properly known, a translation of them has been lately made into Latin."{{sfn|Cohen|1941|pp=139–140}}  }}

Benjamin Franklin was given the [[Copley Medal]] by the [[Royal Society]] in 1753 in recognition of his work in electricity as reported in this book.&lt;ref name=ManWhoDared&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Man Who Dared Lightning |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9339326// | work=The Chatham Press  |location=Chatham, New Jersey |date=December 26, 1974 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italictitle}}
The '''''Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke''''' ([[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''''GW''''') is an ongoing project of the [[Berlin State Library|Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]] to publish a [[union catalog]]ue of [[Incunable|incunabula]]. The ''Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke'' is available in part in print and in its entirety—in [[Draft document|draft]] form—via an [[online database]]. The first volume of the print catalogue was published in 1925 ([[Leipzig]]: [[Anton Hiersemann]]) and the most recent volume was completed in 2009, extending to the entry ''Horem''.

The '''''Grote Spectrum Encyclopedie''''' ("Great Spectrum Encyclopedia") (published by [[Het Spectrum]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] between 1974 and 1980) is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] encyclopedia which treats subjects in 5000 large and comprehensive articles (like the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'') with a clear accent on the [[social sciences]]. 
[[Image:UBN Grote Spectrum Encyclopedie.JPG|thumb|right|Encyclopedia of Spectrum]]

== Description ==
Encyclopedia contains about 5000 large detailed articles on various topics with an emphasis on social sciences. All illustrations and design are colored, which is new for this kind of [[encyclopedias]], published in the [[Netherlands]].
The editor-in-chief of the encyclopaedia in 1972-1974 was Ines van Eyck , who in 1971-1972 also was preparing articles for the publication.
The circulation of the encyclopedia, as a rule, was sold with the delivery of volumes to the house. The total cost was 2500 guilders . As a rule, the possibility of buying on credit was used , the payment of which amounted to 60 guilders per month for a full five years.
The rise of new storage media in the 1990s ([[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]]) halted the plans for a second edition of the ''Grote Spectrum Encyclopedie''. An actualised supplement did appear in 2002.

== Composition ==
The encyclopedia is functionally illustrated and consists of 20 volumes A-Z, and four [[index volumes]] with references to lemmas within the treated subjects. The fourth index volume also contains a comprehensive bibliography (which is not included in the articles themselves). A supplement (volume 25) appeared in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19327">'''ISO 3166-1 numeric''' (or '''numeric-3''') [[code]]s are three-digit [[country code]]s defined in [[ISO 3166-1]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), to represent [[country|countries]], [[dependent territory|dependent territories]], and special areas of geographical interest. They are similar to the three-digit country codes developed and maintained by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]], from which they originate in its [[UN M.49]] standard. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its second edition in 1981, but they were released by the United Nations Statistics Division since as early as 1970.&lt;ref name="iarc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/epi/sp95/sp95-app1.pdf| title=Appendix 1. United Nations Standard Country Codes| work=Cancer Registration: Principles and Methods, IARC Scientific Publication No. 95| pages=208–211| date=1991| publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of numeric codes over alphabetic codes is script ([[writing system]]) independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166-faqs/iso_3166_faqs_general.htm| title=ISO 3166 &amp;ndash; FAQs &amp;ndash; General questions| publisher=International Organization for Standardization (ISO)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO 3166-1 alphabetic codes ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|alpha-2]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|alpha-3]]) use letters from the 26-letter [[English alphabet]] and are suitable for languages based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. For people and systems using non-Latin scripts (such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] or [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]]), the English alphabet may be unavailable or difficult to use, understand, or correctly interpret. While numeric codes overcome the problems of script dependence, this independence comes at the cost of loss of mnemonic convenience.

Another advantage is that when countries merge or split, they will get a new numeric code, while the alphabetic code stays in use for (a part of) that country. A persistent number is needed in datasets with historical country information.

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The numeric codes {{mono|900}} to {{mono|999}} can be user-assigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html| title=Glossary for ISO 3166 - Codes for countries and their subdivisions| publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawn codes==
When countries merge, split, or undergo territorial change, their numeric codes are withdrawn and new numeric codes are assigned. For example:
* [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]] used numeric codes {{mono|278}} and {{mono|280}} respectively before their unification in 1990. Since then, the unified [[Germany]] has used numeric code {{mono|276}}, while keeping the alphabetic codes for West Germany.
* [[Ethiopia]] used numeric code {{mono|230}} before [[Eritrea]] split away in 1993. Since then, Ethiopia has used numeric code {{mono|231}}, while keeping the same alphabetic codes.
* [[Sudan]] used numeric code {{mono|736}} before [[South Sudan]] split away in 2011. Since then, Sudan has used numeric code {{mono|729}}, while keeping the same alphabetic codes.

If a country changes its name without any territorial change, its numeric code remains the same. For example, when [[Burma]] was renamed Myanmar without territorial change in 1989, its alphabetic codes were changed, but its numeric code {{mono|104}} has remained the same.

The following numeric codes have been withdrawn from ISO 3166-1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html#disused| title=Country codes in ISO 3166 (Table 2: codes withdrawn from use)| author=Clive Feather| date=2003-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UN M.49]] standard developed by the United Nations Statistics Division, additional numeric codes are used to represent geographical regions and groupings of countries and areas for statistical processing purposes, but these codes are not included in ISO 3166-1. Unlike alphabetic codes, there are no reserved numeric codes in ISO 3166-1.

'''JOSM''' ({{Audio|GT JOSM.ogg|listen}}) ''(Java OpenStreetMap Editor)'' is a [[free software]] desktop editing tool for [[OpenStreetMap]] [[geodata]] created in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], originally developed by Immanuel Scholz and currently maintained by Dirk Stöcker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM|title=JOSM|website=Wiki.openstreetmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a lot of advanced features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=Jokar Arsanjani, J., Zipf, A., Mooney, P., Helbich, M. |date=2015 |title=OpenStreetMap in GIScience: Experiences, Research, and Applications|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319142791 |location= |publisher=Springer |page=71 |isbn=978-3-319-14280-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also more complicated [[user interface]] than default online editor [[iD (software)|iD]].

== Features ==
[[File:Josm presets de.png|thumb|JOSM road presets menu in German]]
Some notable features of JOSM are importing [[GPS Exchange Format|GPX]] files (GPS tracks),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2013 |title=Geographic Information Systems: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications |url=http://www.igi-global.com/book/geographic-information-systems/66203 |location=USA |publisher=Information Resources Management Association |page=546 |isbn=1466620382}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with [[aerial imagery]] (including [[Web Map Service|WMS]], [[Tile Map Service|TMS]] and [[Web Map Tile Service|WMTS]] protocols), support for multiple [[cartographic projection]]s, layers, relations editing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mapbox.com/blog/josm-relations/|title=Mapping complex features in JOSM using relations|first=Ruth|last=Maben|website=Mapbox.ocm}}&lt;/ref&gt; data validation tools, data filtering, offline work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Comparison_of_editors#JOSM|title=Comparison of editors - OpenStreetMap Wiki|website=Wiki.openstreetmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; presets and rendering styles.&lt;ref name="PacktPub"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/checking-openstreetmap-data-problems | title=OpenStreetMap | publisher=PacktPub | date=September 2010 | accessdate=22 May 2016 | author=Bennett Jonathan | ISBN=9781847197504}}&lt;/ref&gt; JOSM provides more than 200 [[keyboard shortcut]]s for the core functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopersGuide/ShortcutsList|title=DevelopersGuide/ShortcutsList – JOSM|website=Josm.openstreetmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many additional features (like tools for drawing buildings, adding Wikipedia links or viewing data in 3D) are available through the [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learnosm.org/en/josm/josm-plugins/|title=LearnOSM|website=Learnosm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linux Weekly News"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lwn.net/Articles/322163/ | title=OpenStreetMap: the data behind the maps | publisher=Linux Weekly News | date=March 6, 2009 | accessdate=22 May 2016 | author=Chance Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osm-traffic-simulation"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/4976

== History ==
First changeset was created on 27 September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://josm.openstreetmap.de/changeset/1/josm|title=Changeset 1 – JOSM|website=Josm.openstreetmap.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; First beta version (which required Java 5)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2005-October/001181.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211011011/https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2005-October/001181.html# |archive-date=2016-12-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was made available on 4 October 2005 and JOSM 1.0 has been released on 22 January 2006.&lt;ref name="josm-1.0"/&gt; Current versioning scheme, using code [[changeset]] number, was introduced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/josmeditor/diary/38165|title=OpenStreetMap - josmeditor's diary - JOSM reaches version 10000 in its 10th year|website=Openstreetmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 project logo has been replaced with the new artwork, which won a design contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2014/12/12/josm-new-logo/|title=A new logo for JOSM, the Java OpenStreetMap Editor - OpenStreetMap Blog|website=Blog.openstrretmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this year stable releases are identified with additional YY.MM internal version number (following r6763 - 14.01&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Changelog/2014#a2014-01-27:Stablereleaser676314.01 | title=2014 Changelog | accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), however they may not exactly reflect the release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/josm-dev/2016-November/007774.html | title=16.10 release | publisher=The josm-dev Archives | date=6 November 2016 | accessdate=7 November 2016 | author=Legner, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since revision 10786 (16.07) released on 12 August 2016 support for Java versions earlier than 8 has been dropped.&lt;ref name=changelog/&gt;

== Usage ==
The highest number of edits in OSM is done using JOSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editor_usage_stats#by_number_of_edits|title=Editor usage stats - OpenStreetMap Wiki|website=Wiki.openstreetmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software was used to perform several large scale OSM imports, including [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] data in the United States.&lt;ref name="Tiger"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.linux.com/news/openstreetmap-project-completes-import-united-states-tiger-data | title=OpenStreetMap project completes import of United States TIGER data | website=Linux.com | date=23 January 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2016 | author=Nathan Willis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JOSM can also be used for editing an OSM sister project [[OpenHistoricalMap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Historical_Map#Editing_OHM|title=Open Historical Map - OpenStreetMap Wiki|website=Wiki.openstreetmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's included as a [[Package manager|package]] in many Linux distributions like [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]],&lt;ref name="ubuntu"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JOSM | title=JOSM | website=Help.ubuntu.com | date=10 December 2009 | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/JOSM/ | title=JOSM | website=Ubuntuusers.de | date=22 April 2016 | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://packages.debian.org/jessie/josm|title=Debian -- Details of package josm in jessie|website=Packages.debian.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/josm/|title=rpms/josm {{!}} PkgDB|website=Admin.fedoraproject.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arch Linux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/josm/|title=Arch Linux - josm 11826-1 (any)|website=Archlinux.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Open Source Geospatial Foundation|OSGEO]] [[Live DVD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/osm_overview.html | title=OSGEO-DVD | publisher=OSGEO | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various tutorials are available. The LearnOSM Tutorial, translated in 16 languages, has a section on JOSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learnosm.org/en/josm/|title=LearnOSM|website=Learnosm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the editing process, the tools, the plugins, the presets, the imagery functionalities, conflict resolution and other features.

'''Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei''' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: កម្ពោជិកបុត្តាខេមរាតរី) is a [[dragon boat]] from [[Cambodia]]. The boat holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness record]] of being the longest dragon boat in the world. With an overall length of {{convert|87.3|m|ft}}, in November 2018, the boat beat the previous record of {{convert|77.8|m|ft}} set by a Chinese dragon boat in May 2016.&lt;ref name="Record set for world’s longest dragon boat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Record set for world’s longest dragon boat|publisher=[[The Phnom Penh Post]]|accessdate=28 November 2018|url=https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/record-set-worlds-longest-dragon-boat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was showcased during the 2018 [[Water Festival]] in [[Phnom Penh]].

==History==
The boat was built to remember the history of production and use of dragon boats by the [[Khmer people]] and [[Monarchy of Cambodia|Khmer kings]] in older times, who used dragon boats as means of transport to defend the territory.&lt;ref name="Recording longest dragon boat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Recording longest dragon boat|publisher=xinhuanet.com|accessdate=28 November 2018|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-11/12/c_137600775.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was built by ''Union of Youth Federations of Cambodia'' at an overall cost of {{US$|60000|2018}}. Construction of the boat began in April 2018 and it took nearly seven months to finish the construction. The boat measures {{convert|87.3|m|ft}} in overall length, {{convert|1.99|m|ft}} in width and it can accommodate 179 [[oarsman]].&lt;ref name="Cambodia sets world record for longest boat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambodia sets world record for longest boat|publisher=[[The Manila Times]]|accessdate=28 November 2018|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/cambodia-sets-world-record-for-longest-boat/467195/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambodia breaks Guinness World Records"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambodia breaks Guinness World Records|publisher=China daily|accessdate=28 November 2018|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201811/12/WS5be91b36a310eff303288192.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambodia sets new record"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambodia sets new record|publisher=Cambodia daily|accessdate=28 November 2018|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/cambodia-sets-new-record-for-worlds-longest-dragon-boat-142296/}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 13,000 people participated in the construction of the boat and it was completely [[Handicraft|hand-made]].&lt;ref name="Longest boat on display in capital"&gt;{{cite news|title=Longest boat on display in capital|publisher=[[Khmer Times]]|accessdate=28 November 2018|url=https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50552836/longest-boat-on-display-in-capital/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name ''Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei'' translates to “Dragon Boat of Khmer Youth in Cambodian Territory".&lt;ref name="Record set for world’s longest dragon boat"/&gt;

The 179 oarsman in the boat symbolizes the day Cambodia was liberated from [[Khmer Rouge]] (7 January 1979); 1 being the month and 79 the year.&lt;ref name="Record set for world’s longest dragon boat"/&gt;

"SIG(0) on the other hand, uses public key authentication, where the public keys are stored in DNS as KEY RRs and a private key is stored at the signer."&lt;/ref&gt; RFC 3445 eliminated their use for application keys and limited their use to DNSSEC.&lt;ref name="rfc3445_sec1_subtype"&gt;RFC 3445, §1. "DNSSEC will be the only allowable sub-type for the KEY RR..."&lt;/ref&gt; RFC 3755 designates DNSKEY as the replacement within DNSSEC.&lt;ref name="rfc3755_sec3"&gt;RFC 3755, §3. "DNSKEY will be the replacement for KEY, with the mnemonic indicating that these keys are not for application use, per RFC3445.  RRSIG (Resource Record SIGnature) will replace SIG, and NSEC (Next SECure) will replace NXT.  These new types completely replace the old types, except that SIG(0) RFC2931 and TKEY RFC2930 will continue to use SIG and KEY."&lt;/ref&gt; RFC 4025 designates IPSECKEY as the replacement for use with IPsec.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 4025, Abstract.

RFC 6594 defines ECC SSH keys and SHA-256 hashes. See the [http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sshfp-rr-parameters/dns-sshfp-rr-parameters.xml IANA SSHFP RR parameters registry] for details.
|-
|&lt;div id="TA"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;TA||32768||{{n/a}}||DNSSEC Trust Authorities||Part of a deployment proposal for DNSSEC without a signed DNS root.

|250
|RFC 2845
|Transaction Signature
|Can be used to authenticate [[dynamic DNS|dynamic updates]] as coming from an approved client, or to authenticate responses as coming from an approved recursive name server&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2845, abstract&lt;/ref&gt; similar to DNSSEC.

|Text record
|Originally for arbitrary human-readable ''text'' in a DNS record. Since the early 1990s, however, this record more often carries [[machine-readable data]], such as specified by RFC 1464, [[opportunistic encryption]], [[Sender Policy Framework]], [[DKIM]], [[DMARC]], [[Zero configuration networking#Apple's multicast DNS/DNS-SD|DNS-SD]], etc.

|Can be used for publishing mappings from hostnames to URIs.
|}

==Other types and pseudo resource records==
Other types of records simply provide some types of information (for example, an HINFO record gives a description of the type of computer/OS a host uses), or others return data used in experimental features. The "type" field is also used in the protocol for various operations.

|All cached records
|Returns all records of all types known to the name server.  If the name server does not have any information on the name, the request will be forwarded on.  The records returned may not be complete.  For example, if there is both an A and an MX for a name, but the name server has only the A record cached, only the A record will be returned.  Sometimes referred to as "ANY", for example in Windows nslookup and Wireshark.
|-
|[[AXFR]]
|252
|[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#page-12 RFC 1035]&lt;ref name="RFC1035_page-12" /&gt;

|Transfer entire zone file from the master name server to secondary name servers.
|-
| &lt;div id="IXFR"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;IXFR
|251
|RFC 1996
| Incremental Zone Transfer|| Requests a zone transfer of the given zone but only differences from a previous serial number.  This request may be ignored and a full (AXFR) sent in response if the authoritative server is unable to fulfill the request due to configuration or lack of required deltas.
|-
| &lt;div id="OPT"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;OPT
|41
|RFC 6891
|Option
|This is a "pseudo DNS record type" needed to support [[EDNS]]
|}

==Obsolete record types==
Progress has rendered some of the originally defined record-types obsolete.
Of the records listed at IANA, some have limited use, for various reasons. Some are marked obsolete in the list, some are for very obscure services, some are for older versions of services, and some have special notes saying they are "not right".

|RFC 883
|RFC 973
|Mail destination (MD) and mail forwarder (MF) records; MAILA is not an actual record type, but a query type which returns MF and/or MD records. RFC 973 replaced these records with the MX record.

|RFC 883
|Not formally obsoleted. Unlikely to be ever adopted (RFC 2505).
|Records to publish mailing list subscriber lists in the DNS: MB(7), MG(8), MR(9), MINFO(14); MAILB (253) is a query code which returns one of the aforementioned records.  The intent, as specified by RFC 883, was for MB to replace the [[SMTP]] VRFY command, MG to replace the SMTP EXPN command, and MR to replace the "551 User Not Local" SMTP error.  Later, RFC 2505 recommended that both the VRFY and EXPN commands be disabled, making the use of MB and MG unlikely to ever be adopted. They were classified as experimental by RFC 1035.
|-
|WKS
|11
|RFC 883, RFC 1035
|Declared as "not to be relied upon" by RFC 1123 (with further information in RFC 1127): WKS(11)&lt;ref name=rfc1123&gt;RFC 1123 section 2.2, 5.2.12, 6.1.3.6&lt;/ref&gt;
|Record to describe well-known services supported by a host. Not used in practice. The current recommendation and practice is to determine whether a service is supported on an IP address by trying to connect to it. SMTP is even prohibited from using WKS records in MX processing.&lt;ref name=rfc1123/&gt;

|NB
NBSTAT
|32

|Mistakes: NB(32), NBSTAT(33) (from RFC 1002); the numbers are now assigned to NIMLOC and SRV.
|-
|NULL
|10
|&lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 883&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|RFC 1035
|Obsoleted by RFC 1035: NULL(10)  (RFC 883 defined "completion queries" (opcode 2 and maybe 3) which used this record, RFC 1035 later reassigned opcode 2 to be "status" and reserved opcode 3.)
|-
|A6
|38
|RFC 2874
|&lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 6563&lt;/nowiki&gt;

24
|RFC 2065
|RFC 3755
|Part of the first version of DNSSEC (RFC 2065).
Obsoleted by DNSSEC updates (RFC 3755): NXT(30). At the same time, the domain of applicability for KEY and SIG was also limited to not include DNSSEC use.
|-
|HINFO
|13
|RFC 883
|Not obsoleted. Currently used by [[Cloudflare]] in response to queries of the type ANY(255) [https://blog.cloudflare.com/what-happened-next-the-deprecation-of-any/]
|Record intended to provide information about host CPU type and operating system. It was intended to allow protocols to optimize processing when communicating with similar peers

|RFC 7208
|[[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]](99) (from RFC 4408) was specified as part of the [[Sender Policy Framework]] protocol as an alternative to storing SPF data in TXT records, using the same format.  It was later found that the majority of SPF deployments lack proper support for this record type, and support for it was discontinued in RFC 7208.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=Resolution of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID Experiments|rfc=6686|appendix=A|sectionname=Background on the RRTYPE Issue|first1=M.|last1=Kucherawy|year=2012|month=July|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}

{{globalize|date=July 2018}}
A '''museum label''' or caption is a [[label]] describing an object exhibited in a [[museum]] or one introducing a room or area.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"&gt;[http://www.museumprofessionals.org/forum/member-articles/2424-writing-exhibit-labels.html Writing Exhibit Labels / object labels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430212508/http://www.museumprofessionals.org/forum/member-articles/2424-writing-exhibit-labels.html |date=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="EnduringLabel"&gt;[http://www.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/parry/parry.html The Enduring Label — How Shall We Label Our Exhibit Today? Applying the Principles of On-Line Publishing to an On-Site Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of various museum labels==
===Introduction labels===
Kim Kenney, curator of the [[William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum]] says that the first label a visitor should see should explain your exhibit display in general. The introduction label should be a “teaser” and talk about the main sections of your exhibit to encourage people to see the rest. If there is something significant or special of the main exhibit, it should be introduced here. At this point the visitor should have a good feeling what the museum is generally about. Visitors should understand immediately what they are going to see and they should desire to want to see the entire exhibit. Perhaps a brochure would accompany the introduction explaining the main museum, the price, and the hours.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

=== Section labels ===
A section label is a small introduction. It consists of sub-topics in a museum exhibition. Kenney says they should represent the "meat" of the museum. If the section is large, perhaps more than one section label is in order. The description should consist of 100-200 words or thereabouts. The visitor should not be strained to read all the labels, so they should be on the short side if anything.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

===Object labels===
[[File:Wayne-Thiebaud---De-Young-1 label.jpg|thumb||An object label at the [[de Young Museum]]]]
[[File:Thomas Cole NHS 34.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A decorative museum label at the [[Thomas Cole National Historic Site]]]]
Object labels are the smallest. They just describe the individual object they are displayed next to. Typically the title of the work or a descriptive title phrase is given, followed by the date and place of creation, and the materials or technique of the object. Increasingly, there may be a brief description or commentary. An accession number is often given, and often the accession date. If the object is included in an [[audio guide]] or some other form of tour, there may be a symbol indicating this. Kenney says she prefers in an object label a one word title followed by a 25–50 word description for a museum label. She explains that people want specific aspects of the object they might not notice at first glance or might not have already known (i.e. something unusual, material made of, date of artifact, who made). Most people want to know specifics like when it was made, why it was made, usage and when it became part of the museum.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

===Credit panel===
Practice varies as to whether accession dates and donor information are included. Some donations, especially from government organizations, may specify a credit on the label. Loaned objects are usually specified in some way. It is the opinion of Kenney that donor information clutters up the object label. She believes it is better to give a list of donors on a credit panel.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Belshalti-nannar's museum label.jpg|thumb|upright|The first known museum label]]
The first known museum labels are from the [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]] originally dating to circa 530 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, ''Excavations at Ur: a record of twelve years' work.'', p. 238 ''The room was a museum of local antiquities maintained by the princess Belshalti-Nannar, and in the collection was this clay drum, the earliest museum label known...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Casey"&gt;Casey, p. "First Public Museum" ''Around 530 B.C.E. in Ur, an educational museum containing a collection of labeled antiquities was founded by Ennigaldi-Nannathe, daughter of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylonia.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum labels of the 20th century and 21st century BCE items found in Ennigaldi's museum were labeled in three different languages on clay cylinders as to what the centuries old objects were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_43_1.html THE PRECURSORS OF MUSEUMS]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon, p. 36 ''When archaeologists excavated certain parts of the palace and temple complex at Ur, they were puzzled to find dozens of artifacts, neatly arranged side by side whose ages varied by hundreds of years. Then clay drums with labels in three languages showed up — the first known museum labels.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Woolley"&gt;Woolley, ''Ur of the Chaldees'' pp. 252–259&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these artifacts were:
* a [[kudurru]], Kassite boundary marker (carved with a snake and emblems of various gods).
* part of a statue of King [[Shulgi]].
* clay cone that was part of a building at [[Larsa]].&lt;ref Name="Casey"/&gt;

Museum-like behavior occurred as early as the 19th-century BCE which gave indications of steps of labeling and cataloging antiquities.&lt;ref Name="Woolley236"&gt;Woolley, Excavations at Ur: a record of twelve years' work., p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001410/141067e.pdf The Role of Museums and the Professional Code of Ethics], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
A "museum label" cylinder tablet describing 100-year-old antiquity objects of circa 2000 BCE read,{{cquote|These are copies from bricks found in the ruins of Ur, the work of [[Bur-Sin]] of Ur, which while searching for the groundplan (of the temple) the Governor of Ur found, and I saw and wrote out for the marvel of the beholder.''&lt;ref Name="Woolley236"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue14/14_feature_montebello.html Former Met director—and first-time professor—Philippe de Montebello takes the podium to explain how collectors have anointed “art” through the ages] '' An excavation at the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, in modern-day Iraq, found what is considered the oldest museum label: a 19th-century BCE tablet describing an object, then 100 years old, presented, as it read, “...for the marvel of the beholder.”''&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Future==
There are studies recently done that demonstrate the feasibility of a wireless Web-based tool for an in-gallery paperless digital label system, perhaps in the form of "Digital Label Towers" or wall mounted digital displays. Some concepts that could be used then is changing configurations of the museum labels, digitally updating the electronic museum label, usability on various display systems, and integrate third party content.&lt;ref Name="EnduringLabel"/&gt; 

Other advanced digital technology used by some museums is the use of [[barcode]]s on their museum labels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001410/141067e.pdf Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook], p. 30 describes bar codes in "museum labels".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenDJ''' is a [[directory server]] which implements a wide range of [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] and related standards, including full compliance with LDAPv3 but also support for [[Directory Service Markup Language]] (DSMLv2).&lt;ref name=ForgeRock&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenDJ|url=http://forgerock.com/products/open-identity-stack/opendj/|accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], OpenDJ offers [[multi-master replication]], access control, and many extensions.

OpenDJ began as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of '''OpenDS''', an LDAP / DSML server which originated in 2005 as an internal project at [[Sun Microsystems]] started by Neil A. Wilson, and later grew into an open source project, maintained by [[Oracle Corporation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.net/projects/opends|title=Opends &amp;mdash; Project Kenai|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; following Oracle's acquisition of Sun, OpenDJ is the main trunk developed [[ForgeRock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgerock.com/opendj.html|title=OpenDJ|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained by [[Open Identity Platform Community]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform|title=Open Identity Platform Community}}&lt;/ref&gt;. OpenDJ source code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ|title=OpenDJ Source code}}&lt;/ref&gt; and binary distribution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases|title=OpenDJ Releases}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available under the [[Common Development and Distribution License]] (CDDL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/blob/master/LICENSE.md|title=OpenDJ License}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The work on OpenDS started as an internal Sun project around February 2005. OpenDS was initially developed primarily by Neil A. Wilson. Wilson was joined by a small team of engineers from Sun's Directory Server team. The code was open-sourced in June 2006.

Sun increased the number of developers working on OpenDS technology after open-sourcing the code. Developers outside Sun also joined the new open-source project. Community members like Boni.org, Penrose, and JBoss began to use OpenDS in their projects. In early 2008 the OpenDS project had over 20 regular contributors.

In April 2007, the project owners modified the project governance. The text "This Project Lead, who is appointed by Sun Microsystems, is responsible for managing the entire project" was replaced by "This Project Lead, who is appointed and removed by a majority vote of the Project Owners, is responsible for managing the entire project".

In September 2007, the project owners were laid off from Sun Microsystems.

Late in 2007, questions arose as to whether the project was governed as an open source project. One of the project owners complained publicly that Sun Microsystems had required project owners to accept governance changes to the project in order to keep their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/an-open-letter-to-the-opends-community-and-to-sun-microsystems |title=An Open Letter to the OpenDS Community and to Sun Microsystems |accessdate=2016-08-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327142954/http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/an-open-letter-to-the-opends-community-and-to-sun-microsystems |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team resigned from their project owner role. [[Simon Phipps (programmer)|Simon Phipps]], Chief Open source Officer of Sun Microsystems, claimed that Sun was only reverting governance changes that had never been approved. John Waters also published an article on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/05/sun_opends_defining_terms/|title=Winners and losers in Sun's OpenDS spat|first1=Social networks talk hidden|last1=architectures|first2=you reeled: the year's most overused phrases|last2=They used 'em|first3=Tips from the top: cracking Christmas and New-Year|last3=books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenDJ began after the acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle. At that time, Oracle announced that Sun OpenDS Standard Edition was not seen as a strategic product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oracle.com.edgesuite.net/ivt/4000/8104/9236/12628/lobby_external_flash_clean_480x360/default.htm|title=Oracle + Sun: Identity Management Strategy (webcast)|format=Flash|at=around 8:30|accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the investment on the OpenDS source code would continue. Sun had supported commercial versions of Sun OpenDS Standard Edition since version 1.0 in 2008.

Mid-September 2010, Ludovic Poitou, then OpenDS community leader and co-project owner, left Oracle for [[ForgeRock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun.com/Ludo/entry/moving_on|title=Moving on... - Ludo's Sketches|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Oracle provided an OpenDS 2.2.1 update to the community with several fixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opends.org/|title=OpenDS : the Open Source Java LDAP Directory Service|accessdate=2011-02-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608092650/http://opends.org/|archivedate=2007-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ForgeRock released OpenDJ 2.4.0 including fixes and support for new features like Collective Attributes, Microsoft Active Directory Permissive Modification Control, and multiple objectclass inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaxenter.com/icefaces-2-0-0-and-opendj-2-4-0-released-33160.html|title=IceFaces 2.0.0 and OpenDJ 2.4.0 Released|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 2011 Matthew Swift, previously "responsible for the core server" of the OpenDS project joined ForgeRock to work on OpenDJ as product architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmink.com/2011/01/31/new-opendj-architect/|title=New OpenDJ Architect &amp;laquo; Wild Webmink|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in mid-February 2011, ForgeRock began to build an "OpenDJ product suite, comprising an open source LDAP Directory Server, client tools, and LDAP SDK" as a [[Apache Maven|Maven]] project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sources.forgerock.org/browse/opendj/trunk/opendj3/README?r=HEAD|title=FishEye: Annotated - opendj/trunk/opendj3/README|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the tools and SDK modules appearing first.

In 2011, a few months after the acquisition of [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] released [[Oracle Unified Directory]], based on OpenDS.

ForgeRock posted an OpenDJ roadmap through release 4, targeted for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENDJ/OpenDJ+Roadmap|title=OpenDJ Roadmap - OpenDJ - Confluence|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 2016, ForgeRock closed OpenDJ source code, renamed OpenDJ to [[Forgerock Directory Services]] and started to distribute it under commercial license.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | title=ForgeRock has shuttered the open-source community, and no longer allows new development on their platform under a permissive license | website=timeforafork | date=June 1, 2017 | url=http://www.timeforafork.com/ | ref={{sfnref | ForgeRock | 2017}} | accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest Forgerock release of OpenDJ is 3.0.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.forgerock.org/en/index.html?product=opendj|title=ForgeRock BackStage|first=|last=ForgeRock|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenDJ 3.0 is expected to include directory proxy services, but the support for LDAP Transactions that was originally planned was dropped due to the incompatibility with the loose consistency model of LDAP.

OpenDJ 3.1 and 3.2 are slated to include enhanced directory proxy services.

OpenDJ 4.1.4 resumed to maintain by [[Open Identity Platform Community]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform|title=Open Identity Platform Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued new release: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases|title=OpenDJ Downloads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alcatraz, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|The Parade Grounds is the flat area at the bottom of the cliff which contains [[Alcatraz Island Light]]]]
The '''Parade Grounds''' is a large concrete open area on the south end of  [[Alcatraz Island]], off the coast of [[San Francisco]], USA. They lie beyond [[Building 64]]. They were originally built in the 1860s on a barren site by the U.S. military who used the site for military drills and parades.&lt;ref name="Jr.2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr.|first=Jerry Lewis Champion|title=Alcatraz Unchained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQV5wM6qj1oC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=26 April 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-8753-1|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the island became a Federal Penitentiary in 1934, the Parade Grounds was used as a playground, especially on weekends and holidays, and was used host special events, often organized by the [[Social Hall (Alcatraz)|Officer's Club]].&lt;ref name="Albright2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Jim|title=Last Guard Out: A Riveting Account by the Last Guard to Leave Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmVGYLGkLl4C&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=30 March 2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4343-5077-0|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the nearby Building 64 aged and fell into disrepair, the operators of the prison funded several new residential blocks on the square.&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunbar|first=Richard|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoXM5O9glN8C&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-8029-940-0|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardens were developed around them, and handball and weightlifting facilities developed for the employees and their families.&lt;ref name="Jim8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Jim|title=Last Guard Out: A Riveting Account by the Last Guard to Leave Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmVGYLGkLl4C&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=30 March 2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4343-5077-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children living in the quarters on the Parade Ground were known to other children and their families on Alcatraz as "the topside kids" because they lived above those residing in Building 64 on the dock below.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=Gregory L.|title=A History of Alcatraz Island:: 1853-2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1duAUPaHSgcC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=28 May 2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-5815-8|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island ceased use as a jail in 1963 and the residential buildings and gardens which were added were razed to the ground by the [[General Services Administration]] in the 1970s, but the foundation marks can still be seen.&lt;ref name="Jim8"/&gt;

'''Pierre-Ange Vieillard de Boismartin''' (17 June 1778 – 12 January 1862) was a 19th-century French poet, playwright and literary critic.

== Biography ==
Vieillard was the son of [[Antoine Vieillard de Boismartin]], a lawyer at the [[Parlement]] of Rouen, then mayor of [[Saint-Lô]], known for his beautiful and generous defense of the Verdure family (1780-1789), earning him the direct praise of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], to whom he was introduced, and a kind of civic ovation in the midst of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], during the session of January 30, 1790.

A payor at the Treasure (1806), Royal censor (1820-1824), director of the mayors' newspaper (1822-1824), literary critic by the ''[[Le Moniteur Universel|Moniteur universel et officiel]]'', director and chief curator of the [[bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]], then librarian at the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] in 1854, where he succeeded [[Paul-Mathieu Laurent]], Vieillard began early in the dramatic career. He produced no less than 30 plays, 24 of which were presented in different theaters, such as the [[Paris Opéra|Opéra]], the [[Opéra-Comique]], the [[Théâtre-Français]] and the [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]].

The verve he spent in these various works, where he worked with [[Armand Gouffé]], [[Georges Duval]], [[René de Chazet]], [[Théophile Marion Dumersan|Dumersan]], Jules Merle and [[Joseph Pain]], did not prevent him to exploit the [[literary criticism]] which asked for more seriousness and a more complete maturity of mind on his part. Vieillard published in several newspapers, mainly in the former ''Moniteur universel'', many articles that reflected the breadth and variety of his knowledge.

He also became one of the principal editors of the ''Encyclopédie des gens du monde'', where he was specially commissioned to write biographies about famous men of the French Revolution. Well versed in the history of that time, which he lived, the moderation of his opinions and the uprightness of his character let him naturally assess accurately the events and actors. Thus he could believe he was authorized to contribute the ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' a series of studies on the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Histoire des Girondins|fr|3=Histoire des Girondins|lt=Girondins}}'' by [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]], a work interrupted by the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]].

Vieillard also had in the highest degree a feeling for music ; the last pamphlets he published in 1855 at the age of 78, testify of the passion of this dilettante. ''[[Étienne Nicolas Méhul|Méhul]]'', ''Madame Scio'', ''Vicissitudes d’un librettiste de l’ancien opéra'' are the titles of these curious and interesting studies reproduced by ''le Ménestrel''. Vieillard was particularly clever at finding a musical theme in a dramatic situation or a legend. At various occasions, the [[Académie des beaux-arts (France)|Académie des beaux-arts]] asked him seven [[cantata]]s. Only one was crowned and executed at the solemn session of the prize at the [[Institut de France|Institut]] in 1845. This time, the poet and the musician had drawn their inspirations in the ballad of Imogine, borrowed from ''[[the Monk]]'' by [[Matthew Gregory Lewis]].

Vieillard married Anaïs-Henriette Formey Saint-Louvent (16 February 1802, Saint-Lô – 16 November 1873, Versailles) 29 March 1826. He was made a chevalier of the [[Decoration of The Lily|Order of The Lily]] in 1814 and of the [[Légion d'honneur|ordre royal de la Légion d'honneur]] in 1815, and was also a member of the [[Académie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Caen|académies de Caen]] and [[Société nationale académique de Cherbourg|Cherbourg]].

Vieillard signed his works under different forms of his name or initials and the [[pen name]]s '''Madame P.V. de L.B.''' et '''Jules'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12240505q/PUBLIC Notice d'autorité personne de la BnF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pitești Prison''' ({{lang-ro|Închisoarea Pitești}}) was a penal facility in [[Pitești]], [[Romania]], best remembered for the [[Mind control|reeducation]] experiments (also known as ''Experimentul Pitești''&amp;nbsp;– the "Pitești Experiment" or ''Fenomenul Pitești''&amp;nbsp;– the "Pitești Phenomenon") carried out between December 1949 and September 1951, during [[Romanian People's Republic|Communist party rule]]. The experiment, implemented by a group of prisoners under the guidance of the prison administration, was designed as an attempt at violently "reeducating" the mostly young [[political prisoner]]s, primarily supporters of the ultra-nationalist [[Iron Guard]], as well as former members of the [[National Peasants' Party|National Peasants']] and [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] parties or [[Zionism|Zionist]] members of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]].&lt;ref&gt;Cesereanu; Cioroianu, pp. 316–317; Rusan; Wexler&lt;/ref&gt; Religious inmates also included Christian seminarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism|last=Bartosek|first=Karel|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-674-07608-7|location=Cambridge|pages=421|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment's goal was for prisoners to discard past political and religious convictions, and, eventually, to alter their [[Personality psychology|personalities]] to the point of absolute obedience.&lt;ref name="Rusan"&gt;Rusan&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for the total number of people passed through the experiment range from up to 1,000&lt;ref name="Rusan"/&gt; to 5,000.&lt;ref name="Popa"&gt;Popa&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the purging of Romanian leader [[Ana Pauker]], the experiment was halted as the Romanian communist regime was [[Romanianization|Romanianized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Romania|isbn=9780241291610|page=87|quote=The experiment was abandoned in 1952, when the Stalinist leader Ana Pauker was purged}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overseers were put under trial; while twenty of the participating prisoners were sentenced to death, prison officials were handed down light sentences.&lt;ref name="Rusan"/&gt;

Journalist and anti-communist activist [[Virgil Ierunca]] referred to the "reeducation experiment" as the largest and most intensive brainwashing torture program in the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Ierunca, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In even stronger terms, [[Nobel Laureate in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] and [[gulag]] survivor [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] called it "the most terrible act of barbarism in the contemporary world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2010/10/01/10th-edition-of-international-symposium-on-the-pitesti-experiment-re-education-through-torture-18-14-45|title=Agerpres|last=|first=|date=Oct 1, 2010|newspaper=|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|agency=Romanian National News Agency|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
The prison itself was built at an earlier stage. Work on it had begun in the late 1930s, under [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], and had been completed during [[Ion Antonescu]]'s rule (''see [[Romania during World War II]]'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The first political prisoners it housed arrived in 1942; these were high school students suspected of having taken part in the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionnaires' rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Laurenţiu Ungureanu, [http://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/video-nicolae-purcareasupravietuitor-fenomenului-pitesti-victima-refuzat-devina-calau-marturii-despre-reeducarea-printortura-1_5145820900f5182b851a2806/index.html "Nicolae Purcărea, supravieţuitor al 'Fenomenului Piteşti'"], ''Adevărul'', March 17, 2013; accessed March 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For a while after the proclamation of a Romanian [[People's Republic]], it continued to house primarily those found guilty of [[misdemeanor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Early attempts at "reeducation" had occurred at the prison in [[Suceava]], continuing in a violent manner in Pitești and, less violently, in [[Gherla prison]].&lt;ref name="Rusan"/&gt; The group of overseers had been formed from people who had themselves been arrested and found guilty of [[political crime]]s. Their leader, [[Eugen Țurcanu]], a prisoner and former member of the Iron Guard, who had also shortly joined the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] before being purged, dissatisfied with the progress in Suceava, proposed using violent means in order to enhance the process, obtaining the agreement of the Pitești prison administration.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; Ţurcanu, who was probably acting on the orders of [[Securitate]] deputy chief [[Alexandru Nikolski]],&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt; selected a tight unit of reeducation survivors as his assistants in carrying out political tasks. This group was called the ''Organizaţia Deţinuţilor cu Convingeri Comuniste'' (ODCC, "Organization of Convinced Communist Detainees"),&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.317"&gt;Cioroianu, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; and included the future [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest and [[dissident]] [[Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa]] and the Jewish Petrică Fux.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of "reeducation"===
The process begun after that date involved [[psychological punishment]] (mainly through humiliation) and physical [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;Cesereanu; Rusan&lt;/ref&gt;

Detainees, who were subject to regular and severe beatings, were also required to engage in torturing each other, with the goal of discouraging past loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p. 317; Rusan&lt;/ref&gt; Guards would force them to attend scheduled or ad-hoc political instruction sessions, on topics such as [[dialectical materialism]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s ''History of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU(B)]] Short Course'', usually accompanied by random violence and encouraged [[Delator|delation]] (''demascare'', lit. "unmasking") for various real or invented misdemeanors.&lt;ref name="Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt;

Each subject of the experiment was initially thoroughly [[interrogation|interrogated]], with torture applied as a mean to expose intimate details of his life ("external unmasking").&lt;ref name="Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p.317"&gt;Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, they were required to reveal everything they were thought to have hidden from previous interrogations; hoping to escape torture, many prisoners would confess imaginary misdeeds.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.317"&gt;Cioroianu, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase, "internal unmasking", required the tortured to reveal the names of those who had behaved less brutal or somewhat indulgently towards them in detention.&lt;ref name="Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt;

[[Public humiliation]] was also enforced, usually at the third stage ("public moral unmasking"),&lt;ref name="Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt; inmates were forced to denounce all their personal beliefs, loyalties, and values. Notably, religious inmates had to [[blaspheme]] religious symbols and sacred texts.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt; According to [[Virgil Ierunca]]—anti-communist activist and member of the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania—Christian baptism was gruesomely mocked.  Guards chanted baptismal rites as buckets of urine and fecal matter were brought to inmates. The inmate's head was pushed into the raw sewage. His head would remain submerged almost to the point of death. The head was then raised, the inmate allowed to breathe, only to have his head pushed back into the sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism. "The Other Europe: Central and Southeastern Europe." Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1999.  421. Print.|last=Bartosek|first=Karel|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Harvard University Press|pages=421|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ierunca further states that "prisoners' whole bodies were burned with cigarettes; their buttocks would begin to rot, and their skin fell off as though they suffered from leprosy.  Others were forced to swallow spoons of excrement, and when they threw it back up, they were forced to eat their own vomit." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism|last=Bartosek|first=Karel|work=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=421|quote="Prisoners' whole bodies were burned with cigarettes: their buttocks would begin to rot, and their skin fell off as though they suffered from leprosy.  Others were forced to swallow spoonfuls of excrement, and when they threw it back up, they were forced to eat their own vomit."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inmates were required to accept the notion that their own family members had various criminal and grotesque features; they were required to author false autobiographies, comprising accounts of deviant behavior.&lt;ref name="Cesereanu; Cioroianu, p.317" /&gt;

In addition to physical violence, inmates subject to "reeducation" were supposed to work for exhausting periods in humiliating jobs (for example, cleaning the floor with a rag clenched between the teeth). Inmates were [[Malnutrition|malnourished]] and kept in degrading and unsanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p. 318"&gt;Cioroianu, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]] argued that techniques used by the ODCC were ultimately derived from [[Anton Makarenko]]'s controversial [[pedagogy]] and [[penology]] principles in respect to [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt;

The prison also ensured a preliminary selection for the [[labor camp]]s at the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]], [[Ocnele Mari]], and other sites, where squads of former inmates were supposed to extend the experiment.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.317"/&gt;

===Ending and legacy===
In 1952, as [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] successfully maneuvered against the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] [[Teohari Georgescu]], the process was stopped by the authorities themselves.&lt;ref name="Rusan"/&gt; The ODCC secretly faced trial for [[abuse]], and over twenty [[death sentence]]s were handed out (Ţurcanu was held responsible for the murder of 30 prisoners, and the abuse exercised on 780 others);&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p. 318"/&gt; [[Securitate]] officials who had overseen the experiment, including Colonel Teodor Sepeanu, were tried the following year; all were given light sentences, and were freed soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Rusan; Wexler&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to new ideological guidelines, the court concluded that the experiment had been the result of successful infiltration of [[United States|American]] and [[Horia Sima]]'s Iron Guard agents into the Securitate, with the goal of discrediting Romanian law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 318; Rusan&lt;/ref&gt;

Abandoned and partially in ruin, the building was sold to a construction firm in 1991 (after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of 1989]]; several of the facilities have either been torn down or suffered major changes).&lt;ref name="Popa"/&gt; A memorial was built in front of the prison's entrance.&lt;ref name="Popa"/&gt;

According to the Romanian historian Mircea Stanescu, tens of people died in the "Pitești experiment", but its aim was not to kill the people, but to "reeducate" them.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Stănescu, Reeducare în România comunisă, Polirom, Iaşi, Vol. I: 2010, Vol. II:2010, vol.

[[File:Poltergeist-Therese Selles.jpg|thumb|Artist conception of poltergeist activity claimed by Therese Selles, a 14-year-old domestic servant of the Todescini family at Cheragas, Algeria. From the French magazine ''La Vie Mysterieuse'' in 1911.]]

In [[ghostlore]], a '''poltergeist''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|l|t|ər|ˌ|g|aɪ|s|t}}; German for "noisy ghost" or "noisy spirit") is a type of [[ghost]] or [[spirit]] that is responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed. They are purportedly capable of [[pinch (action)|pinch]]ing, [[biting]], [[hitting]], and tripping people. Most accounts of poltergeists describe the movement or [[levitation]] of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises such as knocking on doors.

They have traditionally been described as troublesome [[spirit]]s who haunt a particular person instead of a specific location. Such alleged poltergeist manifestations have been reported in many cultures and countries including the United States, India‚ Japan, Brazil, Australia, and most European nations. Early accounts date back to the 1st century.

==Etymology==
The word ''poltergeist'' comes from the [[German language]] words ''poltern'' ("to make sound" and "to rumble") and ''[[Geist]]'' ("ghost" and "spirit"), and the term itself translates as "noisy ghost", "rumble-ghost" or a "loud spirit". A synonym coined by [[René Sudre]] is ''thorybism'', from Greek ''thorybein'' ("to make noise or uproar; throw into confusion").

==Suggested explanations==

===Natural phenomena===
Many claimed poltergeist events have proved on investigation to be [[hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 98. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychical researcher [[Frank Podmore]] proposed the 'naughty little girl' theory for poltergeist cases (many of which have seemed to centre on an adolescent, usually a girl).&lt;ref name= "Hall 1958"&gt;[[Eric Dingwall|Dingwall, John]]; [[Trevor H. Hall|Hall, Trevor H]]. (1958). ''Four Modern Ghosts''. Duckworth. pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the centre of the disturbance was often a child who was throwing objects around to fool or scare people for attention.&lt;ref name= "Hall 1958"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Goldstuck|Goldstuck, Arthur]]. ''The Ghost that Closed Down the Town: The Story of the Haunting of South Africa''. Penguin Books. p. 275. {{ISBN|978-0143025054}} "Podmore advanced a 'naughty little girl' theory, suggesting that trickery accounted for nearly all poltergeist manifestations, and that the girls and boys who so often seemed to be the victims of poltergeists were actually pulling the strings."&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] says that claimed poltergeist incidents typically originate from "an individual who is motivated to cause mischief".&lt;ref name="Nickell2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Nickell|title=The Science of Ghosts: Searching for Spirits of the Dead|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGS67QhECywC&amp;pg=PT283|date=3 July 2012|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-586-6|pages=283–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nickell:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the typical poltergeist outbreak, small objects are hurled through the air by unseen forces, furniture is overturned, or other disturbances occur -- usually just what could be accomplished by a juvenile trickster determined to plague credulous adults."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nickell writes that reports are often exaggerated by credulous witnesses.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI&gt;{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Enfield Poltergeist, Investigative Files|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/enfield_poltergeist|work=August 2012|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Time and again in other “poltergeist” outbreaks, witnesses have reported an object leaping from its resting place supposedly on its own, when it is likely that the perpetrator had secretly obtained the object sometime earlier and waited for an opportunity to fling it, even from outside the room—thus supposedly proving he or she was innocent."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to research in [[anomalistic psychology]], claims of poltergeist activity can be explained by psychological factors such as [[illusion]], [[Memory#Failures|memory lapses]], and [[wishful thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Zusne|Zusne, Leonard]]; Jones, Warren H. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. p. 192. {{ISBN|978-0805805086}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study (Lange and Houran, 1998) wrote that poltergeist experiences are [[delusion]]s "resulting from the affective and cognitive dynamics of percipients' interpretation of ambiguous stimuli".&lt;ref&gt;Lange, R; Houran, J. (1998). ''Delusions of the paranormal: A haunting question of perception''. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 186 (10): 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Donovan Rawcliffe]] has written that almost all poltergeist cases that have been investigated turned out to be based on trickery, whilst the rest are attributable to psychological factors such as [[hallucination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donovan Rawcliffe|Rawcliffe, Donovan]]. (1988). Occult and Supernatural Phenomena. Dover Publications. pp. 377-378. {{ISBN|0-486-25551-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have also been made to scientifically explain poltergeist disturbances that have not been traced to fraud or psychological factors. Skeptic and magician [[Milbourne Christopher]] found that some cases of poltergeist activity can be attributed to unusual air currents, such as a 1957 case on [[Cape Cod]] where downdrafts from an uncovered chimney became strong enough to blow a mirror off of a wall, overturn chairs and knock things off shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=ESP, Seers &amp; Psychics: What the Occult Really Is | first=Milbourne | last=Christopher | location=New York | publisher=Crowell | year=1970 |page=142| isbn=978-0-690-26815-7 | oclc=97063 |quote=A heavy mirror fell from the bedroom wall and an ash tray that had been resting on a table with a glass top slammed against the surface with such force that the glass was shattered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unverified natural phenomena===

In the 1950s, Guy William Lambert proposed that reported poltergeist phenomena could be explained by the movement of underground water causing stress on houses.&lt;ref name="Wiseman 2011"&gt;Wiseman, Richard. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''. Macmillan. pp. 167-169. {{ISBN|978-0-230-75298-6}}
*Lambert, G. W. (1955). ''Poltergeists: A Physical Theory''. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 38: 49-71.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that [[Turbulence|water turbulence]] could cause strange sounds or structural movement of the property, possibly causing the house to vibrate and move objects. Later researchers, such as [[Alan Gauld]] and [[Tony Cornell]], tested Lambert's hypothesis by placing specific objects in different rooms and subjecting the house to strong mechanical vibrations.&lt;ref name="Wiseman 2011"/&gt; They discovered that although the structure of the building had been damaged, only a few of the objects moved a very short distance. The skeptic [[Trevor H. Hall]] criticized the hypothesis claiming if it was true "the building would almost certainly fall into ruins."&lt;ref&gt;Dingwall, Eric; Hall, Trevor H. (1958). ''Four Modern Ghosts''. Gerald Duckworth. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Wiseman]] the hypothesis has not held up to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Wiseman 2011"/&gt;

[[Michael Persinger]] has theorized that [[seismic activity]] could cause poltergeist phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Houran |title=From Shaman to Scientist: Essays on Humanity's Search for Spirits |location=Lanham |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |page=11 |isbn=0-8108-5054-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Persinger's claims regarding the effects of environmental geomagnetic activity on paranormal experiences have not been independently replicated and, like his findings regarding the [[God helmet]], may simply be explained by the suggestibility of participants.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{citation | title=The "Haunt" project: An attempt to build a "haunted" room by manipulating complex electromagnetic fields and infrasound | author=French, CC., Haque, U., Bunton-Stasyshyn, R., Davis, R. | journal=Cortex | volume=45 | issue=5 | pages=619–629 | year=2009 | doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.10.011 | pmid=18635163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, Richard. (2011). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_haunted_brain/ "The Haunted Brain"]. Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Turner, a retired physical chemist, suggested that [[ball lightning]] might cause the "spooky movement of objects blamed on poltergeists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Muir |first=Hazel |title=Ball lightning scientists remain in the dark |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1720 |publisher=New Scientist |date=2001-12-20 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paranormal===
Parapsychologists [[Nandor Fodor]] and [[William G. Roll]] suggested that poltergeist activity can be explained by [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fodor |first=N. |year=1964 |title=Between Two Worlds |location=West Nyack, NY |publisher=Parker Publishing |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houran, James; Lange, Rense. (2007). ''Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives''. McFarland. p. 290. {{ISBN|978-0786432493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poltergeist activity has often been believed to be the work of malicious [[spirit]]s by spiritualists.&lt;ref&gt;Goss, Michael. (1979). ''Poltergeists: An Annotated Bibliography of Works in English, Circa 1880-1975''. Scarecrow Press. p. 92. {{ISBN|978-0810811812}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of [[Spiritism]], poltergeists are manifestations of disembodied spirits of low level, belonging to the sixth class of the third order. Under this explanation, they are believed to be closely associated with the [[classical element|element]]s (fire, air, water, earth).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Kardec]], ''Le Livre des Esprits''. (2000). chapter 106, Jean de Bonnot. p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1889, the '''Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities''' was the [[United States]]' first statewide [[historic preservation]] group. In 2003 the organization adopted the new name '''APVA Preservation Virginia''' to reflect a broader focus on statewide Preservation and in 2009 it shortened its name to '''Preservation Virginia'''.  Preservation Virginia owns historic sites across Virginia including [[Historic Jamestowne]], located at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], site of the first permanent [[English people|English]] settlement in [[North America]], and the [[Cape Henry Light]], one of the first [[public works]] projects of the United States of America.

==Organization==
Preservation Virginia has helped preserve several key historic properties and items. Its 1889 rescue of the Powder Magazine in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] came decades before [[Colonial Williamsburg]]'s creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/42175.htm |title=Powder Magazine in Williamsburg |accessdate=2007-11-16 |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |work=On This Day: Legislative Moments in Virginia History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222521/http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/42175.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is similar to organizations such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the U.S. and The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], however Preservation Virginia also seeks to cultivate an awareness of the importance of Virginia's heritage as an "economic asset".

The organization's branches represent Preservation Virginia across the state; in Richmond, Preservation Virginia's self-governing affiliate is [[Historic Richmond Foundation]], which merged in July 2005 with Preservation Virginia's William Byrd Branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicrichmond.com/apva_merger.html|title=Historic Richmond Foundation and The William Byrd Branch of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities Announce Merger|accessdate=2007-11-16|publisher=Historic Richmond Foundation|year=2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043833/http://www.historicrichmond.com/apva_merger.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation Virginia also operates the statewide revolving fund, which protects historic properties with easements before placing them on the market, and organizes an annual Preservation Conference. Starting in 1994, a major archaeological campaign conducted by Preservation Virginia at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] known as [[Jamestown Rediscovery]] has discovered the remains of the original 1607 settlement, and greatly increased the knowledge of Jamestown.

===Revolving Fund Program===
Preservation Virginia has operated a revolving fund program since 1989. The program is dedicated to saving historic property in the state of Virginia that is at risk of destruction from either demolition or severe neglect.

The '''Proclamation to the Inhabitants of the Former Grand Duchy of Lithuania''' was a bilingual [[proclamation]], formulated by [[Józef Piłsudski]] and distributed mainly in [[Vilnius]] (Wilno) on April 22, 1919. The proclamation was printed in the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian language]]s after Polish forces captured Vilnius in the [[Vilna offensive]] during the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. It was a statement of Piłsudski's political intentions,&lt;ref name="Davies51"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Norman Davies | last = Davies | first = Norman | title = White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish Soviet War, 1919-20 | publisher = Pimlico |location=London | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-7126-0694-7 | origyear = 1972 | pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contained a blueprint for his [[Międzymorze]] federation. The declaration was sharply criticized by both Polish and Lithuanian nationalists.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book| title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;sig=ACfU3U2H_nQ_8H2AF0TrftErYmJzAE1XSw#PPA62,M1 |first=Timothy |last=Snyder |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-300-10586-X |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In issuing the proclamation bilingually, Piłsudski was appealing to the Lithuanians, hoping to recreate the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The style of the proclamation, the ideas contained within it, and the dramatic turn of phrase were definitely Piłsudski's, and reflected his position on the political and military situation he wished to resolve.&lt;ref name="Davies51"/&gt; Piłsudski pledged to ordain "elections which would take place on the basis of secret, universal and direct voting, without distinction between the sexes" and to "create an opportunity for settling your nationality problems and religious affairs in a manner that you yourself will determine, without any kind of force or pressure from [[Poland]]."&lt;ref name="Davies51"/&gt; 

Piłdudski's proclamation was aimed at showing good will both to [[Lithuanians]] and international diplomats. It succeeded with the latter, as the proclamation dealt a blow to the image of 'Polish conquest' and replaced it with the image of 'Poland fighting with [[Bolshevik]] dictatorship and liberating other nations'.&lt;ref name="Czub92"&gt;{{cite book |first=Antoni |last=Czubiński |title=Walka o granice wschodnie polski w latach 1918-1921 |publisher=Instytut Slaski w Opolu |location=Opole |oclc=30796654 |year=1993 |page=92|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lithuanians who demanded exclusive control over the city saw the proclamation as a facade for Polish imperialism.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; Piłsudski's words also caused much controversy on the Polish political scene as they were not debated in the [[Sejm]]. This caused much anger among Piłsudski's opponents from the [[National Democracy]] faction. Deputies from [[Polish People's Party]] demanded incorporation of the [[Vilnius Region]] into Poland, and even accused Piłsudski of treason. However Piłsudski's supporters in the [[Polish Socialist Party]] managed to deflect those attacks.&lt;ref name="Czub92"/&gt;

'''''S v Goliath'''''&lt;ref&gt;1972 (3) SA 1 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]]. It was heard in the Appellate Division on 24 September 1971, with judgment handed down on 20 March 1972.

On a charge of [[murder]], compulsion can constitute a complete defence. The court held that when an [[acquittal]] may occur on such a charge on such a ground will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. The whole factual complex must be carefully examined and adjudicated upon with the greatest care.

The state, the court held, had no full right of appeal. When it reserved a question of law under section 366 of the Criminal Procedure Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 55 of 1956&lt;/ref&gt; which was dependent upon the existence of certain facts, it was necessary for the state to set out those facts properly and in detail in the record as part of the setting out of the question of law.

'''Saracen''' was a term widely used among Christian writers in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. The term's meaning evolved during its history. In the early centuries of the [[Common Era]], Greek and Latin writings used this term to refer to the people who lived in desert areas in and near the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]], and in [[Arabia Deserta]].{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=53}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} In Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], the term came to be associated with [[tribes of Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377754/Saracens |title=Saracen |encyclopedia=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |year=2012 |access-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Saracen |archive-date=2018 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest source mentioning the term Saracen dates back to the 7th century. It was found in Doctrina Jacobi, a commentary that discussed the event of the Arab conquests on Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Déroche |first1=Vincent |last2=Dagron |first2=Gilbert |title=Doctrina Jacobi nuper Baptizati, "Juifs et chrétiens dans l'Orient du VIIe siècle" |date=1991 |pages=17-248 |edition=Edition of the Greek text with French translation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirby |first1=Peter |title=External references to Islam |url=http://www.christianorigins.com/islamrefs.html |website=External References to Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, "Saracen" had become synonymous with "[[Muslim]]" in [[Medieval Latin]] literature. Such expansion in the meaning of the term had begun centuries earlier among the [[Byzantine Greeks]], as evidenced in documents from the 8th century.{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=53}}{{sfn|Kahf|1999|p=181}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=96}} In the Western languages before the 16th century, "Saracen" was commonly used to refer to Muslim Arabs, and the words "Muslim" and "Islam" were generally not used (with a few isolated exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tolan |first=John V. |author-link=John V.

==Early usage and origins==
[[File:Anonymous Saracen reliquary of Saint Stanislaus.jpg|thumb|12th-century ''Reliquary of [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Saint Stanislaus]]'' in the [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Kraków]] is an example of Saracen art from [[Sicily]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].]] 

The [[Latin-language|Latin]] term ''Saraceni''  is of unknown original meaning. There are claims of it being derived from the Semitic [[triliteral root]] ''srq'' "to steal, rob, plunder", and perhaps more specifically from the noun ''sāriq'' ({{lang-ar|سارق}}), pl. ''sariqīn'' ({{lang|ar|سارقين}}), which means "thief, marauder, plunderer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shahîd |first=Irfan |author-link=Irfan Shahîd |year=1984 |title=Rome and the Arabs: A Prolegomenon to the Study of Byzantium and the Arabs |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=W4H97SA6pMAC&amp;pg=PA125 |publisher=[[Dumbarton Oaks]] |page=125 |isbn=0884021157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible Semitic roots are ''šrq'' "east" and ''šrkt'' "tribe, confederation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isabel |last=Toral-Niehoff |chapter=Saraca |title=Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World |volume=14 |editor-first=Hubert |editor-last=Cancik |editor2-first=Helmuth |editor2-last=Schneider |editor2-link=Helmuth Schneider |editor3-first=Christine F. |editor3-last=Salazar |editor4-first=David E. |editor4-last=Orton |editor4-link=David E.

[[Ptolemy]]'s [[2nd-century]] work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', describes ''Sarakēnḗ'' ({{lang-grc|Σαρακηνή}}) as a region in the northern [[Sinai Peninsula]].{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} Ptolemy also mentions a people called the ''Sarakēnoí'' ({{lang-grc|οἱ Σαρακηνοί}}) living in the northwestern [[Arabian Peninsula]] (near neighbor to the Sinai).{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} [[Eusebius]] in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical history]]'' narrates an account wherein [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]] mentions Saracens in a letter while describing the  persecution of Christians by the Roman emperor [[Decius]]: "Many were, in the Arabian mountain, enslaved by the barbarous 'sarkenoi'."{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} The ''[[Augustan History]]'' also refers to an attack by "Saraceni" on [[Pescennius Niger]]'s army in [[Egypt]] in 193, but provides little information as to identifying them.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=457}}

Both [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and Uranius mention three distinct peoples in Arabia during the first half of the third century: the "Taeni", the "Saraceni" and the "Arabes".{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} The "Taeni", later identified with the [[Arabs|Arab people]] called "[[Tayy]]", were located around [[Khaybar]] (an oasis north of Medina) and also in an area stretching up to the [[Euphrates]]. The "Saraceni" were placed north of them.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} These Saracens, located in the northern [[Hejaz]], were described as people with a certain military ability who were opponents of the [[Roman Empire]] and who were classified by the Romans as [[barbarian]]s.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}}

The Saracens are described as forming the "equites" ([[heavy cavalry]]) from [[Phoenicia]] and [[Thamud]].{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=464}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=465}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=466}} In one document the defeated enemies of [[Diocletian]]'s campaign in the [[Syrian Desert]] are described as Saracens. Other 4th-century military reports make no mention of Arabs but refer to as 'Saracens' groups ranging as far east as [[Mesopotamia]] that were involved in battles on both the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] and Roman sides.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=464}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=465}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=466}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=517}} The Saracens were named in the Roman administrative document ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''—dating from the time of [[Theodosius I]] in the [[4th century]]—as comprising distinctive units in the [[Roman army]]. They were distinguished in the document from Arabs.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=464}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=465}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=466}}

==Medieval usage==
[[File:Saracens Europe01 full.jpg|thumb|Saracens landing on a coast, 915]] 
Beginning no later than the early fifth century, Christian writers began to equate Saracens with Arabs. Saracens were associated with [[Ishmaelites]] (descendants of [[Abraham]]'s older son [[Ishmael]]) in some strands of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic genealogical thinking. The writings of [[Jerome]] (d. 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that Ishmaelites chose to be called Saracens in order to identify with Abraham's "free" wife [[Sarah]], rather than as Hagarenes, which would have highlighted their association with Abraham's "slave woman" [[Hagar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubenstein |first=Jay |author-link=Jay Rubenstein |date=1 November 2011 |title=Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=0-465-01929-3 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=KB-VaqOddn8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was popular during the Middle Ages, but derives more from Paul’s allegory in the New Testament letter to the Galatians than from historical data. The name "Saracen" was not indigenous among the populations so described but was applied to them by Greco-Roman historians based on Greek place names.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}}

As the Middle Ages progressed, usage of the term in the Latin West changed, but its connotation remained negative, associated with opponents of Christianity, and its exact definition is unclear.{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=246}} In an 8th-century polemical work, [[John of Damascus]] criticized the Saracens as followers of a false prophet and "forerunner[s] to the Antichrist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotark.org/upload/TheFountofKnowledge.pdf |title=The Fount of Knowledge |work=Gotiska Ärkestiftet av de Sanna ortodoxt kristna |date=28 April 2012 |access-date=30 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926212543/http://www.gotark.org/upload/TheFountofKnowledge.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2013 |format=PDF |last=Damascene |first=John |author-link=John Damascene |translator-last=Warwick |translator-first=G. N. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, Medieval Europeans had more specific conceptions of Islam and used the term "Saracen" as an ethnic and religious marker.{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=53}}{{sfn|Heng|2012|p=334}} In some Medieval literature, Saracens—that is, Muslims—were described as black-skinned, while Christians were lighter-skinned. An example is in ''[[The King of Tars]]'', a medieval romance.{{sfn|Heng|2012|p=231}}{{sfn|Heng|2012|p=422}}&lt;ref name="tars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/crusadesproject/tars.htm |title=The King of Tars |work=The Crusades Project |publisher=[[University of Rochester]] |date=28 April 2012 |access-date=30 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716175706/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/crusadesproject/tars.htm |archive-date=16 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', an [[Old French]] 11th-century heroic poem, refers to the black skin of Saracens as their only exotic feature.{{sfn|Kahf|1999|p=31}}

The 15th-century [[Mishnah]] commentator, Rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura|Ovadiah of Bertinora]], wrote that the word ''Saracen'' ({{Lang-he-n|סראקין}}) among Arabs had the connotation of "thieves" ({{lang-ar|سارقيِن}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Mishnah]], Commentary of Rabbi Ovadiah of Bertinora, s.v. ''Makhshirin'' 1:6&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Saracen" remained in widespread use in the West as a term for "Muslim" until the 18th century when the [[Age of Discovery]] led to it being gradually obsolete.

The '''Stallburg''' is a renaissance-style building in the [[Vienna]] city center located between [[Josefsplatz]] and Michaelerplatz. It is part of the [[Hofburg Palace]].

Formerly the living quarters of Archduke Maximilian , later [[Emperor Maximilian II]], it was built around 1558-1565 as a residence. From 1659 to 1776 it housed the art collection of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]], called the ''Stallburg gallery''. This collection forms the core of the later [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] from 1889. Later the building became the Imperial Stables used to house the imperial horses, and even today it is still used by the [[Spanish Riding School]] (Spanische Hofreitschule).

Before moving to Vienna in 1659, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm formed his art collection of 1400 paintings in [[Brussels]], where [[David Teniers the Younger]] painted views of his Brussels gallery, which are now spread among various collections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/en/visit/collections/picture-gallery/history-of-the-collection/ History of the collections] of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; He made many miniatures of the paintings for use as models by engravers and published a catalog of the Italian paintings in the 1660s called ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]''.

After Teniers, [[Anton Joseph von Prenner]] was the next to make an illustrated catalog of the paintings there in the 1720s, which included the additions of the Naples collection of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Charles VI commissioned Ferdinand Storffer to oversee color miniatures as well as engravings for it. The resulting document "The Newly Arranged Inventory of the Imperial Paintings Gallery in the Stallburg" appeared in four volumes from 1720 to 1733. Charles VI also commissioned [[Francesco Solimena]] to commemorate the re-arrangement of the gallery with a painting.

The name of the building comes from the horses of the imperial family, who were housed on the ground floor under the reign of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]]. The fountain with wrought iron railings in the middle of the yard was built in 1675. The building was heavily damaged in 1945 just before the end of the Second World War by bombs but was faithfully restored during the years 1947-1948. The passage to the arcades between Hofburg and Stallburg was opened on July 1, 1948.

Today [[Lipizzaner]]s of the Spanish Riding School are housed there, the associated stud is located in Piber in [[Styria]]. From Reitschulgasse one can see the yard. Next to it was the now closed [[Lipizzan Museum]].

'''Tate''' is an institution that houses, in a network of four art museums, the [[United Kingdom]]'s national collection of British art, and international modern and contemporary art. It is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the UK [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tate-trustee Tate Trustee], gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/funding Funding], Tate&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Tate" is used also as the operating name for the corporate body, which was established by the [[Museums and Galleries Act 1992]] as "The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery".

The gallery was founded in 1897, as the '''National Gallery of British Art.''' When its role was changed to include the national collection of modern art as well as the national collection of British art, in 1932, it was renamed the '''Tate Gallery''' after sugar magnate [[Henry Tate]] of [[Tate &amp; Lyle]], who had laid the foundations for the collection.  The Tate Gallery was housed in the current building occupied by Tate Britain, which is situated in [[Millbank]], London. In 2000, the Tate Gallery transformed itself into the current-day Tate, which consists of a network of four museums: Tate Britain, which displays the collection of British art from 1500 to the present day; Tate Modern, also in London, which houses the Tate's collection of British and international modern and contemporary art from 1900 to the present day; Tate Liverpool (founded in 1988), which has the same purpose as Tate Modern but on a smaller scale; and Tate St Ives in [[Cornwall]] (founded in 1993), which displays modern and contemporary art by artists who have connections with the area.  All four museums share the Tate Collection. One of the Tate's most publicised art events is the awarding of the annual [[Turner Prize]], which takes place at Tate Britain.

==History and development==
[[File:Tate Britain (5822081512) (2).jpg|thumb|The original Tate Gallery, now renamed "Tate Britain"]]
The original Tate was called the National Gallery of British Art, situated on [[Millbank]], [[Pimlico]], London at the site of the former [[Millbank Prison]]. The idea of a National Gallery of British Art was first proposed in the 1820s by [[John Leicester, 1st Baron de Tabley|Sir John Leicester, Baron de Tabley]]. It took a step nearer when [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]] gave his collection to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in 1847. A decade later John Sheepshanks gave his collection to the [[South Kensington Museum]] (later the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]), known for years as the National Gallery of Art (the same title as the Tate Gallery had). Forty years later [[Henry Tate|Sir Henry Tate]] who was a sugar magnate and a major collector of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, offered to fund the building of the gallery to house British Art on the condition that the State pay for the site and revenue costs. Henry Tate also donated his own collection to the gallery. It was initially a collection solely of modern British art, concentrating on the works of modern&amp;mdash;that is Victorian era&amp;mdash;painters. It was controlled by the National Gallery until 1954.

In 1915, [[Sir Hugh Lane]] bequeathed his collection of European modern art to Dublin, but controversially this went to the Tate, which expanded its collection to include foreign art and continued to acquire contemporary art. In 1926 and 1937, the art dealer and patron [[Joseph Duveen]] paid for two major expansions of the gallery building. His father had earlier paid for an extension to house the major part of the Turner Bequest, which in 1987 was transferred to a wing paid for by [[Charles Clore|Sir Charles Clore]]. Henry Courtauld also endowed Tate with a purchase fund. By the mid 20th century, it was fulfilling a dual function of showing the history of British art as well as international modern art. In 1954, the Tate Gallery was finally separated from the National Gallery.

[[File:Albert Docks Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Tate Liverpool opened in 1988.]]
During the 1950s and 1960s, the visual arts department of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] funded and organised temporary exhibitions at the Tate Gallery including, in 1966, a retrospective of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Later, the Tate began organising its own temporary exhibition programme. In 1979 with funding from a Japanese bank a large modern extension was opened that would also house larger income generating exhibitions. In 1987, the Clore Wing opened to house the major part of the Turner bequest and also provided a 200-seat auditorium. (The "Centenary Development," in 2001, provided improved access and public amenities)

[[File:Tate St Ives - geograph.org.uk - 1208300.jpg|thumb|left|Tate St Ives opened in 1993.]]
In 1988,  an outpost in north west England opened as Tate Liverpool. This shows various works of modern art from the Tate collection as well as mounting its own temporary exhibitions. In 2007, Tate Liverpool hosted the [[Turner Prize]], the first time this has been held outside London. This was an overture to Liverpool's being the [[European Capital of Culture]] 2008.

In 1993, another offshoot opened, [[Tate St Ives]]. It exhibits work by modern British artists, particularly those of the [[St Ives School]]. Additionally the Tate also manages the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum|Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden]], which opened in 1980.

[[File:Tate Modern viewed from Thames Pleasure Boat - geograph.org.uk - 307445.jpg|thumb|Tate Modern opened in 2000.]] 
Neither of these two new Tates had a significant effect on the functioning of the original London Tate Gallery, whose size was increasingly proving a constraint as the collection grew.  It was a logical step to separate the "British" and "Modern" aspects of the collection, and they are now housed in separate buildings in London. The original gallery is now called Tate Britain and is the national gallery for British art from 1500 to the present day, as well as some modern British art. [[Tate Modern]], in [[Bankside Power Station]] on the south side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], opened in 2000 and now exhibits the national collection of modern art from 1900 to the present day, including some modern British art. In its first year, the Tate Modern was the most popular museum in the world, with 5,250,000 visitors.

In the late 2000s, the Tate announced a new development project to the south of the existing building. According to the museum this new development would "transform Tate Modern. An iconic new building will be added at the south of the existing gallery. It will create more spaces for displaying the collection, performance and installation art and learning, all allowing visitors to engage more deeply with art, as well as creating more social spaces for visitors to unwind and relax in the gallery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/tate-modern-project|title=The Tate Modern Project - Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts philanthropist [[John Studzinski]] donated more than £6{{nbsp}}million to the project.&lt;ref name=tate2007&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/donation-provides-cornerstone-new-transforming-tate-modern "Donation provides cornerstone for new Transforming Tate Modern development"]. [[Tate Modern]]. 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tate2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nayeri, Farah. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-31/blackstone-s-studzinski-to-give-tate-1-57-million-more.html "Blackstone’s Studzinski to Give Tate $1.57 Million More"]. ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''. 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The extension to Tate Modern opened in 2016 as The Switch House and, in 2017, was renamed the Blavatnik Building after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir [[Leonard Blavatnik]], who contributed a "substantial" amount of its £260m cost.

==Tate Online==
Tate Online is the Tate's website. Since its launch in 1998, the site has provided information on all four physical Tate galleries (Tate Britain, Tate St Ives, Tate Liverpool and Tate Modern) under the same domain. Tate Online helps visitors prepare and extend visits to the physical sites but also acts as a destination in its own right. Other resources include illustrated information on all works in Tate's Collection of British and Modern international art, structured and informal e-learning opportunities for all visitors, over 600 hours of archived webcast events, all articles from the magazine ''[[Tate Etc.]],'' and a series of bespoke net art commissions. [[BT Group|BT]] was the primary sponsor of Tate Online from 2001 to 2009.

In addition to providing information about the galleries and organisation, Tate Online has been used as a platform for [[Internet art]] exhibits, termed ''Net Art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/intermediaart/archive/net_art_date.shtm|title=Intermedia Art Archive: Net Art by Date - Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are organised as part of Tate's ''Intermedia Art'' initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tate.org.uk/intermediaart/ Intermedia Art] Tate&lt;/ref&gt; covering [[new media art]]. So far, 13 net art exhibitions have been shown since the  initiative started in 2000 including Tate in Space&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tate.org.uk/space/ Tate in Space] Tate&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) which was nominated in the Interactive Art category for the 2003 [[BAFTA]] Interactive awards.

The Tate Online Shop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.tate.org.uk/|title=Tate Online Shop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sits under the main Tate site and offers a wide range of books, prints and products that reflect and support the primary goal of Tate: to promote the knowledge, understanding and enjoyment of art. Profits from the online shop help to support the work of the galleries.

==Administration and funding==
Tate receives annual funding from the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]]. It is administered by a board of trustees, who are responsible for the running of the gallery and appoint the Director (for a period of seven years). Under the [[Charities Act 2006|Charities Act 1993]], the Tate is an [[exempt charity]] accountable directly to Government rather than the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] for financial returns etc. However, the Trustees are still expected to follow the broad responsibilities of charity trustees, and may be subject to Charity Commission oversight on these elements of their activities.

Various bodies have been set up to support the Tate including Tate Members for the general public, where a yearly fee gives  rights such as free entry to charging exhibitions and members rooms. There is also Tate Patrons for a higher subscription fee and the Tate Foundation. There are a number of corporate sponsors. In addition individual shows are often sponsored.

Tate now spends around £1 million of its general funds each year on purchasing acquisitions and their related costs. The [[Outset Contemporary Art Fund]] was established in 2003, by Tate patrons [[Yana Peel]] and Candida Gertler. In collaboration with the [[Frieze Art Fair]], the fund buys works from the fair for the Tate's collections. Other funds for acquisitions are raised by Tate funding groups such as the Members, the Patrons and the American Patrons of Tate and its sub-committees, the North American Acquisitions Committee and Latin American Acquisitions Committee. The American Patrons were renamed in 2013 to reflect their expanding geographical base of support; since 1999, this support group alone has raised more than $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Dannatt (11 May 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Starry+night+for+Tate+in+New+York/29546 Starry night for Tate in New York] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a photography acquisitions committee was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Brown (11 May 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/11/tate-modern-10th-birthday-expansion Tate Modern marks 10th birthday by expanding collection] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Tate established a South Asian acquisitions committee to collect contemporary and modern art from India and surrounding countries, as well as a committee for works from Russia, Eastern Europe and the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States).&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris and Georgina Adam (12 October 2012), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate-to-launch-two-new-acquisitions-committees/27399  Tate to launch two new acquisitions committees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026043434/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate-to-launch-two-new-acquisitions-committees/27399 |date=26 October 2012 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

*In 1971, an exhibition by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] called Bodyspacemotionthings was closed after five days due to health and safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/apr/06/tate-modern-bodyspacemotionthings-turbine-hall Tate Modern's Turbine Hall recreates a 1971 art sensation] The Guardian, 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1972, the Tate Gallery purchased a work by [[Carl Andre]] called ''[[Equivalent VIII]].'' During a 1976 exhibition of the work, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper published an article using the work to complain about institutional waste of taxpayers' money. The article made the piece infamous and it was subjected to ridicule in the media and vandalism. The work is still popularly known as ''The Bricks'', and has entered the British public lexicon.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
*Each year, the [[Turner Prize]] is held at a Tate Gallery (historically at Tate Britain) and is awarded to an artist who is either British or primarily working in Great Britain. It is the subject of great controversy and creates much media attention for [[Art of the United Kingdom#Contemporary British art|contemporary British art]], as well as attracting [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstrations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chappet|first=Marie-Claire|title=The Turner Prize’s most controversial moments|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8834871/The-Turner-Prizes-most-controversial-moments.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1995, it was revealed that the Tate had accepted a gift of £20,000 from art fraudster [[John Drewe]]. The gallery had given Drewe access to its archives which he then used to forge documents authenticating fake modern paintings that he then sold.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R. G. (2007). Tainted archives: Art, archives, and authenticity. Archivaria, 63, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], director of Tate, conceived 'Operation Cobalt', the secret and ultimately successful buyback of two of the Tate's paintings by [[J.M.W. Turner]] that had been stolen from a German gallery in 1994. See [[Frankfurt art theft (1994)]].
*In 2006, it was revealed that the Tate was the only national-funded museum not to be accredited to the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA), as it did not wish to abide by guidelines that deaccessioned work should first be offered to other museums. The MLA threatened to bar the Tate from acquiring works under the [[Acceptance in Lieu]] (AIL) scheme, whereby works are given to the nation to settle [[Inheritance Tax in the United Kingdom|inheritance tax]]. A total of 1,800 museums were accredited with the MLA.&lt;ref name="artnewspaper"&gt;"Tate Is Not a Museum", ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 14 August 2006.

*Tate has been criticised for accepting sponsorship from [[BP]]. Justice and climate change campaigners including [[Platform (art group)|Platform London]], ''Art Not Oil'' and [[Liberate Tate]] have called for a protest against the petrol company's sponsorship of the gallery, including the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Needham|first=Alex|title=Tate may not renew BP sponsorship deal after environmental protests|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/dec/13/tate-bp-partnership-environmental-protests|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo and brand==
The Tate logo was designed by international brand consultancy [[Wolff Olins]] in 2000 as part of a larger rebranding effort focused around the idea "look again, think again."  The museum uses a range of logos that move in and out of focus, "suggesting the dynamic nature of Tate &amp;ndash; always changing but always recognizable"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolffolins.com/work/tate|title=Tate - Wolff Olins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations include a standard logo, a blurred version, a faded version and a halftone version consisting of dots rather than smooth fading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logodesignlove.com/tate-logo-design|title=How effective are the Tate logos? - Logo Design Love|date=6 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An update on the brand, designed by North, was released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_tate_by_north.php|title=Brand New: New Logo and Identity for Tate by North|first=UnderConsideration|last=LLC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends''''' is the blanket title for an American [[animated television series]] that originally aired from November 19, 1959, to June 27, 1964, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]] television networks. The current blanket title was imposed for home video releases over 40 years after the series originally aired and was never used when the show was televised; television airings of the show were broadcast under the titles of '''''Rocky and His Friends''''' from 1959 to 1961, '''''The Bullwinkle Show''''' from 1961 to 1964, and '''''The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show''''' (or '''''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle''''' or '''''The Adventures of Bullwinkle and Rocky''''') in syndication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle &amp; Friends – The Complete First Season|work= DVD Talk|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/print.php?ID=7232|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Jay Ward Productions]], the series is structured as a [[variety show]], with the main feature being the [[serial (radio and television)|serialized]] adventures of the two title characters, the [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[flying squirrel]] [[Rocky the Flying Squirrel|Rocky]] and [[moose]] [[Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle]]. The main [[antagonist|adversaries]] in most of their adventures are the two Russian-like spies [[Boris Badenov]] and [[Natasha Fatale]], both working for the [[dictator]] [[Fearless Leader]]. Supporting segments include [[Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties]] (a parody of old-time melodrama), [[Mister Peabody|Peabody's Improbable History]] (a dog named Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman traveling through time), and Fractured Fairy Tales (classic [[fairy tales]] retold in comic fashion), among others.&lt;ref name=ward /&gt;

''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' is known for quality writing and wry humor. Mixing [[pun]]s, cultural and topical [[satire]], and [[self-reference|self-referential humor]], it appealed to adults as well as children.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite news|title= Jay Ward: Masterful Humorist|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=October 15, 1989|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-15/opinion/op-128_1_jay-ward|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kids' TV Grows Up: The Path from Howdy Doody to SpongeBob|last=Holz|first=Jo|publisher=McFarland|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4766-6874-1|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also one of the first cartoons whose animation was outsourced; storyboards were shipped to Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio also employed by [[Total Television]]. The art has a choppy, unpolished look and the animation is extremely limited even by television animation standards at the time, yet the series has long been held in high esteem by those who have seen it; some critics described the series as a well-written radio program with pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/anderson/home.asp|title=Alex Anderson interview|date=26 October 2010|work=Hogan's Alley |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026035438/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/anderson/home.asp|archivedate=26 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was shuffled around several times (airing in afternoon, [[prime time]], and [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] timeslots), but was influential to other animated series from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/interview.html|title=Contributors|publisher=The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ |last=Marsh|first=Jeff|author2=Dan Abrams |year=1997|quote=It was always our intent to create shows that would be entertaining on many levels.

That is a hard job to do and we always strove to emulate that quality|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segments from the series were later recycled in the ''[[Hoppity Hooper]]'' show.

There have been numerous feature film adaptations of the series' various segments, such as the 2000 film ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (film)|The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'',  which blended live-action and computer animation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/adventures_of_rocky_and_bullwinkle/|title=The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle -- Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1999 live-action film ''[[Dudley Do-Right (film)|Dudley Do-Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dudley Do-Right|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dudley_doright/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both films received poor reviews and were financially unsuccessful. By contrast, an animated feature film adaptation of the "Peabody's Improbable History" segment, ''[[Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman]]'', was released to positive reviews in 2014. A [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] animated series also based on "Peabody's Improbable History", ''[[The Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Show]]'', debuted on Netflix in October 2015.&lt;ref name=TAGAnimationWork&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hulett|first1=Steve|title=Animation Work In And Around Los Angeles|url=http://animationguildblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/animation-work-in-and-around-los-angeles.html|publisher=The Animation Guild|accessdate=August 15, 2014|date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Netflix Reboots 'Mr. Peabody and Sherman' in Series from DreamWorks Animation (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/mr-peabody-and-sherman-netflix-show-dreamworks-animation-1201557948/|accessdate=August 7, 2015|work=Variety|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reboot animated series based on the main segment, ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (TV series)|The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' premiered on [[Amazon Video]] on May 11, 2018.

In 2013, ''Rocky and His Friends'' and ''The Bullwinkle Show'' were ranked the sixth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time by ''[[TV Guide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|date=24 September 2013|website=tvguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The idea for the series came from [[Jay Ward]] and [[Alex Anderson (cartoonist)|Alex Anderson]], who previously collaborated on ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]'', based upon the original property ''[[Frostbite Falls|The Frostbite Falls Revue]]''. This original show never got beyond the proposal stage. It featured a group of forest animals running a television station. The group included Rocket J. Squirrel (Rocky), Oski Bear, Canadian Moose (Bullwinkle), Sylvester Fox, Blackstone Crow, and Floral Fauna. The show in this form was created by Alex Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rock Lives|work= Entertainment Weekly|date=February 8, 1991|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313261,00.html|accessdate=2010-11-07|first=Jim|last=Farber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullwinkle's name came from the name of a car dealership in Berkeley, California, called Bullwinkel Motors. Anderson changed the spelling of the last two letters of the name and gave it to his moose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/24/AR2010102402638.html?full_summary=1|title=Alex Anderson, creator of Rocky and Bullwinkle, dies at 90|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=25 October 2010|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward wanted to produce the show in Los Angeles; however, Anderson lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and did not want to relocate. As a result, Ward hired [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]] as head writer and co-producer at Jay Ward Productions, and he wrote the ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' features. Ward was joined by writers [[Chris Hayward]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Chris Hayward, 81, TV Writer And a Creator of 'Munsters'|work= The New York Times|date=December 19, 2006|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C11F838550C7A8DDDAB0994DE404482|accessdate=2010-11-0007|first=Margalit|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Burns]]; the latter eventually became head writer for [[MTM Enterprises]]. In a 1982 interview, Scott said, "I got a call from Jay asking if I'd be interested in writing another series, an adventure script with a moose and a squirrel. I said, 'Sure.' I didn't know if I could write an adventure with a moose and a squirrel, but I never turned down a job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/bullwinkle-speaks-an-interview-with-bill-scott/|title=Bullwinkle Speaks! An Interview With Bill Scott|date=2 August 2012|website=cartoonician.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
The series began with the pilot, ''Rocky the Flying Squirrel''. Production began in February 1958 with the hiring of [[voice acting|voice actors]] [[June Foray]], [[Paul Frees]], Bill Scott, and [[William Conrad]]. Eight months later, [[General Mills]] signed a deal to sponsor the cartoon program, under the condition that the show be run in a late-afternoon time slot, when it could be targeted toward children. Subsequently, Ward hired the rest of the production staff, including writers and designers. However, no animators were hired. Ad executives at [[Dancer Fitzgerald Sample|Dancer, Fitzgerald, &amp; Sample]], the advertising agency for General Mills, set up an animation studio in Mexico called [[Gamma Productions]] S.A. de C.V., originally known as Val-Mar Animation. This [[outsourcing]] of the animation for the series was considered financially attractive by primary sponsor General Mills, but caused endless production problems. In a 1982 interview by animation historian Jim Korkis, Bill Scott described some of the problems that arose during production of the series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We found out very quickly that we could not depend on Mexican studios to produce anything of quality. They were turning out the work very quickly and there were all kinds of mistakes and flaws and boo-boos&amp;nbsp;... They would never check&amp;nbsp;... Mustaches popped on and off Boris, Bullwinkle's antlers would change, colors would change, costumes would disappear&amp;nbsp;... By the time we finally saw it, it was on the air.&lt;ref name="cataroo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cataroo.com/cst_ROCKY.html|title=Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Network television: 1959–1982 ===

The show was broadcast for the first time on November 19, 1959, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network under the title ''Rocky and His Friends'' twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, following ''[[American Bandstand]]'' at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]], where it was the highest-rated daytime network program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]] (2000).

St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-19922-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show moved to the [[NBC]] network starting September 24, 1961, broadcast in color, and first appeared on Sundays at 7 p.m. ET, just before ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''. ''Bullwinkle''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s ratings suffered as a result of airing opposite perennial favorite ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''. A potential move to [[CBS]]&lt;ref name="cataroo.com" /&gt; caused NBC to reschedule the show to late Sunday afternoons (5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET)&lt;ref name="cataroo.com" /&gt; and early Saturday afternoons in its final season. NBC canceled the show in the summer of 1964. It was shopped to ABC, but they were not interested. However, reruns of episodes were aired on ABC's Sunday morning schedule at 11 a.m. ET until 1973, at which time the series went into syndication. An abbreviated fifteen-minute version of the series ran in syndication in the 1960s under the title ''The Rocky Show''. This version was sometimes shown in conjunction with ''The King and Odie'', a fifteen-minute version of Total Television's ''[[King Leonardo and His Short Subjects]]''. ''The King and Odie'' was similar to ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' in that it was sponsored by General Mills and animated by Gamma Productions. NBC later aired ''Bullwinkle Show'' reruns at 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET Saturday afternoons during the 1981–1982 television season.

On cable, the series had extended runs on [[Nickelodeon]] (1990–1994), [[Cartoon Network]] (1993–2002) and [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] (early 2000s). Since the late 2000s, The Program Exchange has typically only licensed the series for short-term runs; nationally, the series has seen limited airings on [[WGN America]] (2009), [[VH1 Classic]] (2012) and Boomerang (2013).

''The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show'' remained in [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s and was still available for local television stations through [[The Program Exchange]] as late as 2016; [[WBBZ-TV]], for instance, aired the show in a [[strip programming|strip]] to [[counterprogramming|counterprogram]] [[late local news|10 PM newscasts]] in the [[Buffalo, New York]] market during the summer 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;Pergament, Alan (May 31, 2013).

Sponsor [[General Mills]] retained all United States television rights to the series. Two packages, each containing different episodes, are available. The syndicated version of ''The Bullwinkle Show'' contains 98 half-hour shows (#801–898).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programexchange.com/detail.aspx?c_id=1&amp;p_id=6|title=The Program Exchange|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513174609/http://www.programexchange.com/detail.aspx?c_id=1&amp;p_id=6|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 78 comprise the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle story lines from the first two seasons of the original series (these segments originally aired under the ''Rocky and His Friends'' title). Other elements in the half-hour shows (''[[#Supporting features|Fractured Fairy Tales]], [[Mister Peabody|Peabody's Improbable History]], [[Dudley Do-Right|Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties]], [[#Supporting features|Aesop and Son]]'', and short cartoons including ''[[Bullwinkle's Corner]]'' and ''[[Mr. Know-It-All]]'') sometimes appear out of the original broadcast sequence. The final 20 syndicated ''Bullwinkle Show'' episodes feature later ''Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle'' story lines (from "Bumbling Bros. Circus" through the end of the series, minus "Moosylvania") along with ''Fractured Fairy Tales, Bullwinkle's Corner'', and ''Mr. Know-It-All'' segments repeated from earlier in the syndicated episode cycle. Originally, many syndicated shows included segments of Total Television's ''[[Commander McBragg|The World of Commander McBragg]]'', but these cartoons were replaced with other segments when the shows were remastered in the early 1990s. A package, promoted under the ''Rocky and His Friends'' name but utilizing ''The Rocky Show'' titles, features story lines not included in the syndicated ''Bullwinkle Show'' series.&lt;ref name="The Program Exchange"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programexchange.com/detail.aspx?c_id=1&amp;p_id=12|title=The Program Exchange|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513175125/http://www.programexchange.com/detail.aspx?c_id=1&amp;p_id=12|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recently syndicated ''Rocky and His Friends'' package retains the 15-minute format, consisting of 156 individual episodes, but like ''The Bullwinkle Show'', the content differs from the versions syndicated in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="The Program Exchange" /&gt; The various supporting segments, including ''Fractured Fairy Tales'' (91), ''Peabody's Improbable History'' (91), and ''Aesop and Son'' (39) segments are syndicated as part of ''Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales'', and 38 of the 39 ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoons are syndicated as part of ''Dudley Do Right ''(sic)'' and Friends''. Syndicated versions of the shows distributed outside of the United States and Canada combine the various segments under the package title ''Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends''; it is this version of the show that is represented on official DVD releases through DreamWorks Classics and the official online version sold at websites such as [[Amazon Video]].

== Characters ==
[[File:Rocky bullwinkle peachfuzz.jpg|thumb|(From left to right) Rocky, Bullwinkle, and Captain Peter "Wrongway" Peachfuzz.]]
The lead characters and heroes of the series were [[Rocky the Flying Squirrel|Rocket "Rocky" J. Squirrel]], a flying squirrel, and his best friend [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]], a dim-witted but good-natured moose. Both characters lived in the fictional town of Frostbite Falls, [[Minnesota]], which was purportedly based on the real city of [[International Falls, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9704/9704West.html|title="Northern Exposure,"  University of Chicago Magazine, April 1997|website=magazine.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheming villains in most episodes were the fiendish spies [[Boris Badenov]], a pun on [[Boris Godunov]], and [[Natasha Fatale]], a pun on [[femme fatale]], forever attempting to "catch Moose and Squirrel". Other characters included [[Fearless Leader]], the dictator of the fictitious nation of [[Pottsylvania]] and Boris and Natasha's superior, [[Gidney &amp; Cloyd]], little green men from the moon who were armed with scrooch guns; [[Peter Peachfuzz|Captain Peter "Wrongway" Peachfuzz]], the captain of the S.S. ''Andalusia''; various U.S. government bureaucrats and politicians (such as Senator Fussmussen, a recurring character who opposed admitting [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] to the Union on the grounds of his own [[xenophobia]]); and the inevitable onlookers, Edgar and Chauncy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= PBS Special on Cartoon Says a Mooseful|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=March 7, 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-07/entertainment/ca-3515_1_pbs-special|accessdate=2010-11-07|first=Tom|last=Shales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
When first shown on NBC, the cartoons were introduced by a Bullwinkle puppet, voiced by Bill Scott, who would often lampoon celebrities, current events, and especially [[Walt Disney]], whose program ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Wonderful World of Color]]'' was next on the schedule. Compared with the dim-witted and lovable moose that most fans of the series would grow up with, in this short-lived version Bullwinkle was portrayed as a sarcastic smart-aleck. On one occasion, "Bullwinkle" encouraged children to pull the tuning knobs off the TV set. "In that way," explained Bullwinkle, "we'll be sure to be with you next week!" The network received complaints from parents of an estimated 20,000 child viewers who apparently followed Bullwinkle's suggestion. Bullwinkle told the children the following week to put the knobs back on with glue "and make it stick!" The puppet sequence was dropped altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Robinson (2002) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OLHd9Z6MrWkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Brought to You In Living Color: 75 Years of Great Moments in Television &amp; Radio From NBC]''. John Wiley and Sons. p. 83 {{ISBN|0-471-46921-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott later re-used the puppet for a segment called "Dear Bullwinkle," where letters written for the show were read and answered humorously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5RYoiylEH0|title=Dear Bullwinkle Shorts|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four episodes of "Dear Bullwinkle" are on the Season 1 DVD.

Each episode is composed of two ''Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle'' [[cliffhanger]] shorts that stylistically emulated early [[serial (radio and television)|radio and film serials]]. The plots of these shorts would combine into [[story arc]]s spanning numerous episodes. The first and longest story arc was ''[[Jet Fuel Formula]]'' consisting of 40 shorts (20 episodes). Stories ranged from seeking the missing ingredient for a rocket fuel formula, to tracking the monstrous whale ''Maybe Dick'', to an attempt to prevent mechanical, metal-munching, moon mice from devouring the nation's television antennas. Rocky and Bullwinkle frequently encounter the two Pottsylvanian nogoodniks, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.

At the end of most episodes, the narrator, [[William Conrad]], would announce two humorous titles for the next episode that typically were puns of each other (and usually related more to the current predicament than to the plot of the next episode). For example, during an adventure taking place in a [[mountain range]], the narrator would state, "Be with us next time for '[[Avalanche]] Is Better Than None,' or 'Snow's Your Old Man.'" Such a 'This,' or 'That' title announcement was borrowed from ''[[The Adventures of Sam Spade]]'' radio shows produced in 1946–1950. The narrator frequently spoke with the characters, thus breaking the [[fourth wall]].

Episodes were introduced with one of four opening sequences:
* Rocky flies about snow-covered mountains. Below him, hiking on a snowy trail, Bullwinkle is distracted by a billboard featuring his name, and walks off a ledge. He becomes a large snowball as he rolls downhill. Rocky flies to him and pushes against the snowball, slowing it to a halt at the edge of another cliff. Bullwinkle pops out of the snowball to catch the teetering squirrel at the cliff edge.
* In a circus, Rocky is preparing to jump from a high diving board into a tub of water tended by Bullwinkle. However, when Rocky jumps, he ends up flying around the circus tent, while Bullwinkle chases after him carrying the tub. As Rocky lands safely, Bullwinkle tumbles into the tub. This was the same intro used for the Buena Vista VHS series in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJIJvvNL6nE|title=Opening to The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle La Grande Moose (1991) VHS|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rocky is flying acrobatically about a city landscape. Bullwinkle is high atop a flagpole painting, and is knocked from his perch as the squirrel flies by. Rocky attempts to catch the plummeting moose with a butterfly net, but the moose falls through. Rocky then flies lower to find his friend suspended from a clothesline, having fallen into a pair of [[Long underwear|long johns]].
* Similar to the previous opening, Rocky is again flying about the city. Bullwinkle is suspended from a safety harness posting a sign on a large billboard. He loses his balance as the squirrel zooms past him and tumbles off the platform. The moose lands on a banner pole mounted on the side of a building, and the recoil springs him back into the air. He lands on a store awning, slides down, and drops a few feet to a bench on which Rocky is seated. The impact launches the squirrel off the bench, and Bullwinkle nonchalantly catches him in his left hand to end the sequence.

Episodes ended with a [[commercial bumper|bumper]] sequence in which a violent lightning storm destroys the landscape, appearing to engulf Rocky and Bullwinkle in the destruction and accompanied by dramatic piano music. The music would become more lighthearted, and the ground would scroll upward while the outlines of the heroes gradually appeared. We then see a smiling sun overlooking a barren field which rapidly fills with [[sunflower]]s until Rocky and Bullwinkle finally sprout from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNyB_URZLPQ|title=Rocky and Bullwinkle intermission|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporting features ==

The ''Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle'' shorts serve as "bookends" for popular supporting features, including:
* "'''[[Dudley Do-Right|Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties]]'''", a parody of early 20th century [[melodrama]] and [[serial film|silent film serials]] of the [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]]. Dudley Do-Right is a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mountie]] in constant pursuit of his nemesis, [[Snidely Whiplash]], who sports the standard "villain" attire of black top hat, cape, and large [[handlebar moustache]]. This is one of the few Jay Ward cartoons to feature a background music track. As is standard in Ward's cartoons, jokes often have more than one meaning. A standard gag is to introduce characters in an irised close-up with the name of the "actor" displayed in a caption below, a convention seen in some early silent films. However, the comic twist is using the captions to present silly names or subtle puns. Occasionally, even the scenery is introduced in this manner, as when "Dead Man's Gulch" is identified as being portrayed by "Gorgeous Gorge," a reference to professional wrestler [[Gorgeous George]].
* "'''Peabody's Improbable History'''" features a genius talking dog named [[Mister Peabody]] who has a pet boy named Sherman. Peabody and Sherman use Peabody's "[[WABAC machine]]" (pronounced "way-back", spelled WAYBAC in season 1, episode 4, and partially a play on names of early computers such as [[UNIVAC]] and [[ENIAC]]) to go back in time to discover the ''real'' story behind historical events, and in many cases, intervene with uncooperative historical figures to ensure that events transpire as history has recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Heather |last=Green |title=A Library as Big as the World |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=February 28, 2002 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2002/tc20020228_1080.htm |accessdate=2007-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Wayback Machine" is used to this day in Internet applications such as Wikipedia and the [[Internet Archive]] to refer to the ability to see or revert to older content. These segments are famous for including a pun at the end. For example, when going back to the time of Pancho Villa, they show Pancho a photo of a woman and he promptly feels the urge to take a nap. When Sherman asks why this is so, Peabody says that the woman's name is Esther, and whenever you "see Esther" (siesta) you fall asleep.  Mr. Peabody is named after a dog belonging to Scott's son John.  Sherman is named after UPA director Sherman Glas.
* "'''Fractured Fairy Tales'''" presented familiar fairy tales and children's stories, but with altered storylines and modernized for humorous effect. This segment was narrated by [[Edward Everett Horton]]; [[June Foray]], Bill Scott, Paul Frees, and an uncredited{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Daws Butler]] often supplied the voices.&lt;ref name="Scott2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Scott|title=The Moose That Roared: The Story of Jay Ward, Bill Scott, a Flying Squirrel, and a Talking Moose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KvcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT173|date=8 April 2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-6743-7|pages=173–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "'''Aesop &amp; Son'''" is similar to "Fractured Fairy Tales", complete with the same theme music, except it deals with [[fable]]s instead of fairy tales. The typical structure consists of Aesop attempting to teach a lesson to his son using a fable. After hearing the story, the son subverts the fable's moral with a pun. This structure was also suggested by the feature's opening titles, which showed Aesop painstakingly carving his name in marble using a mallet and chisel and then his son, with a jackhammer and raising a cloud of dust, appending "And Son." Aesop was voiced (uncredited){{citation needed|date=August 2015}} by actor [[Charles Ruggles|Charlie Ruggles]] and the son, Junior, was voiced by Daws Butler.
* "'''Bullwinkle's Corner'''" features the dimwitted moose attempting to introduce culture into the proceedings by reciting (and acting out) poems and [[nursery rhyme]]s, inadvertently and humorously butchering them. Poems subjected to this treatment include several by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] ("My Shadow", "The Swing", and "Where Go the Boats"); [[William Wordsworth]]'s [[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud|"Daffodils"]]; "[[Little Miss Muffet]]", "[[Little Jack Horner]]", and "[[Wee Willie Winkie]]"; [[John Greenleaf Whittier|J. G. Whittier]]'s "[[Barbara Frietchie]]"; and "The Queen of Hearts" by [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]. [[Simple Simon (nursery rhyme)|Simple Simon]] is performed with Boris as the pie man, but as a variation of the famous [[Abbott and Costello]] routine "[[Who's on First?]]".
* "'''[[Mr. Know-It-All]]'''" again features Bullwinkle posing as an authority on any topic. Disaster inevitably ensues.
* "'''The Bullwinkle and Rocky Fan Club'''", a series of abortive attempts by Rocky and Bullwinkle to conduct club business. The fan club consists only of Rocky, Bullwinkle, Boris, Natasha, and Captain Peter "Wrongway" Peachfuzz. These shorts portray the characters as somewhat out of character.
* "'''[[Commander McBragg|The World of Commander McBragg]]'''", short features on revisionist history as the title character would have imagined it; this was actually prepared for ''[[Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales]]'' (and later shown on ''[[Underdog (TV series)|The Underdog Show]]''). Although the shorts were animated by the same animation company, Gamma Productions, they were produced for Total Television, rather than Ward Productions. These segments were packaged with pre-1990 syndicated versions of ''The Bullwinkle Show'' and appear in syndicated episodes of ''The Underdog Show'', ''Dudley Do Right and Friends'', and ''Uncle Waldo's Cartoon Show''.

== Reception and cultural impact ==
* In 1962, as a publicity stunt, Ward leased a small island on a lake between Minnesota and Canada, which he named after "Moosylvania",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Katie|title=Happy 50th birthday, 'Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/26/rocky.bullwinkle.anniversary/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 16, 2015|date=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small island shown in the later ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cartoons. In a campaign to make the island into the 51st state, he and Scott drove a van across the country to about 50-60 cities collecting petition signatures. Arriving in Washington, DC, they pulled up to the [[White House]] gate to see [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], and were brusquely turned away. They learned that the evening that they had arrived was during the height of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyingmoose.org/moose/moose.htm |title=The Moosylvania Page|publisher=Flyingmoose.org|accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Hokey Smoke! Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle|title=Jay's Adventures "Moosylvania Statehood" |url=http://bullwinkle.toonzone.net/moosylvania.htm|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also in 1962, British Invasion band [[Herman's Hermits]] got its name because bandmates thought lead singer [[Peter Noone]] looked like Sherman of "Mr. Peabody" fame, and the name "Herman" was close enough to "Sherman" for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermanshermits.com/articles/misc/flashback10_p2.html |title=Herman's Hermits – Magazine Articles |publisher=Hermanshermits.com |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TSR, Inc.]] released ''[[Bullwinkle and Rocky Role-Playing Party Game|Bullwinkle &amp; Rocky]]''™ (1988), a roleplaying game based on the world of Rocky and Bullwinkle. The game consisted of rules, mylar hand puppets, cards, and spinners.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=2005-08-20| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Data East]] produced a [[pinball|pinball machine]] titled ''Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends'' (1993).
* In 1999, [[Mattel]] made Rocky and Bullwinkle-themed cars under its [[Hot Wheels]] line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

* In January 2009, [[IGN]] named ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'' as the 11th best animated television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/11.html|title=Video Games, Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News &amp; Videos – IGN|website=IGN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217233729/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/11.html|archivedate=2009-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To date, ''Rocky and Friends'' has aired in 100 countries.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

== Revival attempts ==
There were attempts to revive ''Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle'' throughout the 1970s. A revival in 1981 parodied the [[Super Bowl]]. A script was written, storyboards were produced, the network gave it a green light, but the project was canceled because of objections from the [[National Football League|NFL]]. (Actual team owners were parodied and Boris was [[Match fixing|fixing]] the game.)&lt;ref name="cataroo.com" /&gt;

Another revival attempt took place at Disney in the mid 1980s, back when they were distributing the show on VHS. Developed by Tad Stone and Michael Peraza, the revival was named ''The Secret Adventures of Bullwinkle'' and would have been a modern take on the old Bullwinkle show, with the return of characters like Mr. Peabody and Sherman and Dudley Do-Right and would have featured new segments like "Fractured Scary Tales", a parody of horror films, and a new "Mr Know It All" skit that, among other things, had Bullwinkle programming a VCR. Before the two presented their pitch, they soon found out Disney did not have the rights to the actual series, only to the video distribution of the old Bullwinkle show, and the concept was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peraza|first1=Michael|title=Bullwinkled|url=http://michaelperaza.blogspot.com/2010/08/bullwinkled.html|publisher=Blogspot|accessdate=August 21, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821215708/http://michaelperaza.blogspot.com/2010/08/bullwinkled.html|archivedate=August 21, 2011|date=August 14, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CED Videodisc releases ==
The program debuted on home video with two compilation [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]] Videodiscs released by RCA during the format's rise in the early 1980s, featuring complete, uncut story arcs and accompanying alternating segments and bumpers. Volume 1 contained the complete story for "Wossamotta U", while volume 2 contained "Goof Gas Attack" and "The Three Mooseketeers".

== VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc releases ==
[[Buena Vista Home Video]] released the show on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc in the early 1990s, under the title ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle''. These are presented differently from when broadcast. Two "Rocky and Bullwinkle" chapters were sometimes edited together into one (removing the "titles" for the next chapters as well as part of the recap at the beginning of the next), usually showing the storyline in four or five chapters per video. For example, the 12-episode [[Wossamotta U.]] adventure is reduced to seven episodes, and runs about seven minutes shorter. The "Bullwinkle Show" closing was used on these.

The first eight videos were released under the "Classic Stuff" banner, with covers and titles being parodies of famous paintings or painters. Four more videos were released under the "Funny Stuff" banner, but unlike the first eight, these were not numbered, the video titles matched the title of the featured "Rocky and Bullwinkle" storyline, and the covers represented scenes from shows (such as Bullwinkle pulling a rhino out of a hat as the cover for "Painting Theft"). (The change in the banner might have been due to a video magazine publishing a letter criticizing the editing.) ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle Season 1'' is available in Cracker Barrel for VHS.

=== Gray market releases ===
Years after the Buena Vista releases ended, another series of "Rocky and Bullwinkle" VHS tapes were released, both separately and as a boxed set. These videos included ''[[Upsidaisium]]'', ''[[The Last Angry Moose]]'', ''[[Metal-Munching Mice]]'', ''[[Mucho Loma|Much Mud]]'', and ''[[Rue Britannia]]''.  However, these were released through [[GoodTimes Home Entertainment|Goodtimes Video]] and were not authorized by Ward Productions.  The copies used were from 16&amp;nbsp;mm ''Bullwinkle Show'' prints.  Some other companies also released unauthorized editions of ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'', including Nostalgia Family Video which also released all 98 of ''The Bullwinkle Show'' package shows via 16&amp;nbsp;mm ''Bullwinkle Show'' prints and Bridgestone Multimedia released eight episodes as ''Rocky and his Friends'' using an old broadcast 16&amp;nbsp;mm print.

The copyright status of these 98 episodes (along with some episodes of ''[[Hoppity Hooper]]'') is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/question-about-syndicated-rocky-and-bullwinkle-episodes.4390521/|title=Question About Syndicated Rocky and Bullwinkle Episodes|website=toonzone.net}}{{better source|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the copyright is generally recognized as valid, and attempts to post the gray market releases on video sites have historically been greeted with [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] [[notice and take down|takedown notices]].

== DVD releases ==
In 2002, Jay Ward Productions established a partnership with [[Classic Media]] called [[Bullwinkle Studios]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} From 2003 to 2005, the partnership produced DVDs of the first three seasons of the series, which were renamed (for legal reasons) ''Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle &amp; Friends''. Releases then stalled until 2010, when season 4 was released, in part to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bullwinkle-Season-4/13733 |title=The Bullwinkle Show DVD news: Announcement for The Bullwinkle Show – Season 4 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013080954/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bullwinkle-Season-4/13733 |archivedate=2012-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete series was released on January 4, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rocky--bullwinkle--friends-complete-series-now-available-on-dvd-112892769.html |title=Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle &amp; Friends™ Complete Series Now Available on DVD – FROSTBITE FALLS, Minn., Jan. 4, 2011 /PRNewswire/ |location=Minnesota |publisher=Prnewswire.com |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking the debut of season 5 on DVD. A standalone release of season 5 was released on March 29, 2011.&lt;ref name="tvshowsondvd.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bullwinkle-Season-5/14898 |title=The Bullwinkle Show DVD news: Release Date for Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle &amp; Friends&amp;nbsp;— Complete Season 5 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=May 25, 2007 |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125506/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bullwinkle-Season-5/14898 |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVDs for the first 3 seasons were distributed by [[Sony Wonder]], while season 4, 5 and Complete Series sets are currently distributed by [[Vivendi Entertainment]].

The DVD releases differ somewhat from the originals. The original opening bumpers as seen on the network run were restored, but the title of the show was replaced with the name "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends" (never used during the show's television run) and a modern logo with styling inconsistent with the rest of the animation (pictured) somewhat clumsily inserted into the original bumpers.&lt;ref name="tvdvdreviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/rocky.html|title=Prosperity Power™ software :-)|website=www.tvdvdreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[William Conrad]] sound-alike was used to announce the new title, which some viewers found jarring.&lt;ref name="tvdvdreviews" /&gt; In addition, a semi-transparent "R&amp;B" logo appears for five seconds at the beginning of each segment in the lower right-hand corner. Some segments were moved from their position in the original episodes. Also, the season 5 shows on DVD recycle supporting features found on the DVDs for the first four seasons. Mathematically, this makes sense since the total number of supporting features (assuming two used per show) exactly equals the number of shows created during the first four seasons. The first set, most of the second set, and the fifth season set use the second opening and closing used for the ''Rocky and His Friends'' broadcast, while the last two story arcs in the second set, as well as the third and fourth season sets, use the original opening and closing from the ''Rocky and His Friends'' broadcast. Frank Comstock's musical themes are replaced on the sets with Fred Steiner's music produced for ''The Bullwinkle Show''. In addition, the first four season sets include optional Spanish-language audio tracks.

In 2005, Classic Media released a series of "best of" DVD compilations of popular segments of the series: two volumes of ''The Best of Rocky and Bullwinkle'', plus the single-volume ''The Best of Boris and Natasha'', ''The Best of Mr. Peabody and Sherman'', ''The Best of Fractured Fairy Tales'', and ''The Best of Dudley Do-Right''. These compilations contain episodes from the entire run of the show.

On October 30, 2012, Classic Media released a DVD called ''The Complete Fractured Fairy Tales'' which includes all 91 ''Fractured Fairy Tales'' segments.

During the time the show was available on [[Hulu]] (it was offered as a free series before it went to a subscription-only model), the DVD version of the episodes were used instead of the syndication prints.

=== Children's opera ===
* In 1997, The [[Los Angeles Opera]] toured a children's production, named ''Les Moose: The Operatic Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'', around various L.A. County Elementary Schools. The story followed Boris and Natasha as they tried to steal the formula for Mooseberry Rocket Fuel from Bullwinkle J. Moose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kids Tune In to Rocky, Bullwinkle--and Opera|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/22/local/me-56364|accessdate=October 1, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warrick|first1=Pamela|title=A 'Rocky' Road to Opera|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/09/news/cl-15305|accessdate=October 1, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=L.

=== Comics ===
* A syndicated daily newspaper comic strip titled ''Bullwinkle'' began on July 23, 1962, with original stories drawn by [[Al Kilgore]]. It was syndicated by the [[Bell Syndicate]] and ended in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;"1962 Timeline: July 23. A Bullwinkle newspaper strip by Al Kilgore, based on the animated series, makes its debut." ''American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960–64'' by John Wells. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2012, Page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rocky and Bullwinkle stories were published in [[Four Color]]
* Rocky and Bullwinkle comic books were published by [[Dell Comics]], [[Gold Key Comics]], [[Charlton Comics]] and [[Star Comics]] (an imprint of [[Marvel Comics]]). All were called ''Bullwinkle and Rocky''. The comics, although for children, did contain numerous references spoofing issues such as celebrity worship or the politics of the 1980s. In one Star Comics issue, Bullwinkle owns a small company, which makes him eligible to compete in a fun run in Washington DC for presidents of small companies. When Bullwinkle says he is there for the race, it is mistaken that he is campaigning for President. The comic also spoofed US President [[Ronald Reagan]], and he personally thanks Bullwinkle for stopping Boris &amp; Natasha by rewarding him with monogrammed [[jelly bean]]s. Another comic broke the fourth wall when the narrator is outraged at a plot of Boris', to which Boris claims he has control of everyone "by capturing the Marvel Comics building and tying up the editor". When the narrator comments on how this is morally wrong, Boris quiets him by saying, "You will agree or you will not find paycheck in mail this month!" The same issue made reference to the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], which Boris had engineering in [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]] in an attempt to steal its gold by carving all the bars into gold medals, as well as furnishing false information to every country so Pottsylvania would win all the gold medals (and thus take all true gold) by virtue of default. After Boris is foiled, the narrator comments that the games will go on as planned in real time in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].
* From 2013 to 2014 [[IDW Publishing]] with [[DreamWorks Classics]] and Bullwinkle Studios released comics of ''Rocky and Bullwinkle'', ''Dudley Do-Right'' and ''Peabody and Sherman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guerrero|first=Tony|title=C2E2 13: Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman and More Return to Comics|url=http://www.comicvine.com/articles/c2e2-13-rocky-bullwinkle-mr-peabody-sherman-and-mo/1100-146469/|accessdate=May 7, 2013|newspaper=Comic Vine|date=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 2017, [[American Mythology Productions]] took over the comic book license for Rocky and Bullwinkle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanmythology.net/product-page/rocky-bullwinkle-show-1-greenawalt-classic-cvr-pre-order&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music recordings ===
* Golden Records released a phonograph album of songs, ''Rocky the Flying Squirrel &amp; His Friends'' (1961), using [[voice actor]]s from the series. Boris and Natasha, for example, sing: "We will double, single and triple cross our very closest friends!"
* A 78rpm single (Golden 659) was released on yellow vinyl. This had Rocky singing "I Was Born To Be Airborne" on one side, backed with Bullwinkle singing "I'm Rocky's Pal". The single sold in grocery stores. Paul Parnes (who later wrote songs for ''[[Sesame Street]]'') is credited as composer. "Some nutty characters get together here for the benefit of the very young. Lots of laughs for the juvenile sense of humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Billboard| page= 78|date= September 18, 1961|title=Interview with composer Paul Parnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pseudonymously-named Boris Badenough released a record called "Hey Rocky!" on Trax Records in 1986. The record featured a house-music beat underneath clips from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Boris-Badenough-Hey-Rocky/release/31299|title=Boris Badenough – Hey Rocky!|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hero's Journey''''' is a 1987 [[biography]] of [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] (1904–1987), directed by Janelle Balnicke and David Kennard. In the years just before his death, Campbell was filmed in conversation with his friends and colleagues, discussing his own life and career in terms of the myths that he studied throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Film: 'Hero's Journey,' Documentary|author=Janet Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/04/movies/film-hero-s-journey-documentary.html |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=December 4, 1987  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Highway Code, front cover, 2018.png|thumb|''The Highway Code'', cover]]

'''''The Highway Code''''' is a set of information, advice, guides and mandatory rules for all road users in the [[United Kingdom]]. Its objective is to promote road safety. The Highway Code applies to drivers of [[animal]]s, [[pedestrian]]s, [[cyclist]]s, [[motorcyclist]]s and [[Driving|drivers]]. The 2004 version, for example, contained 307 numbered rules and 9 annexes. The Highway Code gives information on [[road signs in the United Kingdom|road signs]], [[road surface marking|road markings]], vehicle markings, and [[road-traffic safety|road safety]]. The annexes include information on vehicle maintenance, licence requirements, documentation, penalties, and vehicle security.

Any failure to comply with the Code is not an offence in itself, but can be taken into account by a court. The mandatory rules reflect the Statute Law, which may (and usually does) provide a separate penalty.

The highway code was first published in 1931 as a booklet and has been regularly updated to reflect current practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction |title=Introduction |work=Highway Code |publisher=HMSO |accessdate=2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is prepared by the [[Department for Transport]] and the [[Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency]], and is published by [[The Stationery Office]] in electronic form and as a printed book. Most copies are bought by learner drivers preparing for their [[United Kingdom driving test|driving test]]. In 2004, for example, over one million copies of the Highway Code were sold.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-history-highway-code/|title=History of the Highway Code|year=2012|accessdate=14 May 2012|publisher=[[Driving Standards Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Great Britain]] version, available in English and Welsh, applies to [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], but regional specific signs such as [[driver location signs]] in England or [[bilingual signs]] in Scotland and Wales are not covered. The [[Northern Ireland]] version, available in English and Irish, applies to Northern Ireland.

==History==
[[File:The Highway Code 1931.djvu|thumb|right|''The Highway Code'', first edition 1931.&lt;br&gt;''(Djvu file: click on the image to browse though the pages)'']]
Costing one [[British One Penny coin (pre-decimal)|penny]], the first edition of the Highway Code was published on 14 April 1931. It contained just 18 pages of advice, including the arm signals to be given by drivers and police officers controlling traffic.  The second edition, considerably expanded, appeared in 1934, and now illustrated road signs for the first time. During its preparation the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] consulted with the [[Living Streets (UK)|Pedestrians Association]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/index.php/download_file/-/view/872/ |title=The history of the Pedestrians Association |publisher=Living Streets |accessdate=2010-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807065046/http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/index.php/download_file/-/view/872/ |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further major revisions followed after the Second World War so that, for example, references to trams were still included in the 1954 version but disappeared after that (tramway rules returned to the Code in 1994, after the first modern tram systems in Britain had opened). Motorway driving was included in the fifth edition. The sixth edition, in 1968, used photographs as well as drawings for the first time, and also updated the illustrations of road signs to take the new 'continental' designs into account. The 70-page 1978 edition introduced the Green Cross Code for pedestrians and orange badges for less able drivers. The format was changed to a 'taller' size in the 1990s, and the Code caught up with developments in social media in 2011, when it joined Twitter and Facebook. A Highway Code app followed in 2012.

==Legal aspects==

Certain rules in the Highway Code are legal requirements and are identified by the words ‘must’ or ‘must not’. In these cases, the rules also include references to the corresponding legislation. Offenders may be cautioned, given licence penalty points, fined, banned from driving, or imprisoned, depending on the severity of the offence.   Although failure to comply with the other rules would not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, the Highway Code may be used in court under the Road Traffic Act to establish liability. These include advisory rules with wording ‘should’ and ‘should not’ or ‘do’ and ‘do not’. In general, only the latest official printed version of the Highway Code should be used but in legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal, the version current at the time of the incident would apply. 

The [[Road Traffic Act 1988]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A failure on the part of a person to observe a provision of ''The Highway Code'' shall not of itself render that person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind but any such failure may in any proceedings (whether civil or criminal, and including proceedings for an offence under the Traffic Acts, the [1981 c. 14.] Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 or sections 18 to 23 of the [1985 c. 67.] Transport Act 1985) be relied upon by any party to the proceedings as tending to establish or negative any liability which is in question in those proceedings.&lt;ref name="RTA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880052_en_2.htm#mdiv38|title=Road Traffic Act 1988 (c.52), s.38(7)|accessdate=3 August 2006|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"'''The Twelve Huntsmen'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] as tale number 67 in their ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''.  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]''.

It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 884, the forsaken fiancée.  Other tales which include this type as part of their plot are ''[[The True Bride]]'', ''[[The Two Kings' Children]]'', and ''[[Sweetheart Roland]]''.

==Synopsis==
Once there was a prince who was betrothed to a beautiful maiden whom he loved. One day, the prince was summoned to his father's deathbed and was so grief-stricken that he promised he would marry the [[false hero|neighboring princess]] whom his father wished he would marry. After his father died and the prince became king, he felt bound by his promise to marry the other princess. His fiancee heard of the new king's promise and asked her father for eleven maidens who looked exactly like her. Each maiden [[crossdressing|dressed]] as huntsmen went to the king's court.

At court, the king had a lion who knew everything. It told him that the huntsmen were women, and to test them, the king should put peas on the floor:  a man's firm step would crush them, while a woman's would make them roll. The maiden heard this and warned her companions to step firmly. And so, when the huntsmen stepped on the peas, they were crushed. The lion then said the king should put spinning wheels in the room, betraying the maidens' interest. Once again, the maiden learned of the lion's plan and warned her companions. The lion soon fell from favor as the king believed he did not know everything, as once thought. 

When the king's new bride entered court, the maiden fainted. Fearing that a faithful servant had fallen ill, the king came to her aid and found she had the ring he had given her. He dismissed the new bride and married the maiden, and restored the lion to favor as it had seen the truth.

'''Valerie Henitiuk''' (born 1963 in [[Manning, Alberta]]) is an award-winning scholar researching aspects of the intersection of translation studies, world literature, [[Inuit]] literature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/challenging-language-edmonton-academic-studies-versions-of-1st-inuit-novel-1.3849159 CBC News feature about Valerie Henitiuk’s work in Inuit Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;, Japanese literature, and women's writing. She is a Canadian citizen, currently Vice-President Academic &amp; Provost at [[Concordia University of Edmonton]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://concordia.ab.ca/cues-new-vice-president-academic-provost-dr-valerie-henitiuk/ News article about Valerie Henitiuk joining Concordia University of Edmonton]&lt;/ref&gt;. Henitiuk has been a [[visiting scholar]] at both [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia Universities]] in the USA and at [[Kokugakuin University]] in Japan. She was previously Executive Director of the Centre for the Advancement of Faculty Excellence and Professor of English at [[Grant MacEwan University]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], on the faculty of the [[University of East Anglia]] (UK) and Director of the British Centre for Literary Translation (BCLT).

== Early years ==
Henitiuk was born in [[Manning, Alberta|Manning]], Alberta in 1963, and grew up in various locations in western and northern Canada. An interest in acting led her to participate in a number of drama workshops while in her teens. Following extensive travels in USA and Central America she completed a BA (French + Latin, 1985) and MA (French Translation, 1988), was then employed by the Alberta Government Translation Bureau, and operated a freelance translation business. Ms. Henitiuk subsequently returned to the [[University of Alberta]], obtaining an MA in Japanese Literature in 2000 and a PhD in Comparative Literature in 2005.

== Educational background ==
Henitiuk has a PhD (Comparative Literature) from the University of Alberta. She also holds a Diplôme d'études linguistiques françaises, [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle|Université de la Sorbonne-Nouvelle]]. Her PhD was supported by [[Killam Prize]] and [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]]
(SSHRC) fellowships, the Dorothy J. Killam Memorial Graduate Prize, as well as an award allowing her to spend a year at Kokugakuin University in Japan conducting research (2002–03). Upon the completion of the PhD in 2005 Henitiuk was awarded the prestigious [[Governor General's Academic Medal|Governor General's Gold Medal]] as the foremost graduate at the University (all faculties).

In September 2005, Henitiuk began a two-year post-doctoral fellowship at The Center (now Institute) for Comparative Literature and Society directed by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]]. Her sponsor was David Damrosch. This research project investigated the process by which national literature becomes world literature. Her fellowship was funded by SSHRC and she was awarded the inaugural SSHRC Postdoctoral Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfu.ca/pamr/print/news_releases/archives/news12010501.htm Article about Valerie Henitiuk winning post-doctoral award]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15618">The '''vrykolakas''' ([[Modern Greek|Greek]] βρυκόλακας, pronounced {{IPA-el|vriˈkolakas|}}), also called '''vorvolakas''' or '''vourdoulakas''', is a harmful [[undead]] creature in [[Greek people|Greek]] [[folklore]]. It has similarities to many different [[legendary creature]]s, but is generally equated with the [[vampire]] of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the ''vrykolakas''.

==Etymology==
The word ''vrykolakas'' is derived from the [[South Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''[[vǎrkolak]]''. The term is attested in other [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] languages such as [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''[[:sr:Вукодлак|vukodlak]]'', ultimately derived from Proto-Slavic ''[[vьlkolakъ]]'', see Polish ''[[wilkołak]]'', and cognates can be found in other languages such as [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''[[:lt:vilkolakis|vilkolakis]]'' and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''[[:ro:vârcolac|vârcolac]]''. The term is a compound word derived from вълк (''vâlk'')/вук (''vuk''), meaning "wolf" and ''dlaka'', meaning "(strand of) hair" (i.e. having the hair, or fur, of a wolf), and originally meant "[[werewolf]]" (it still has that meaning in the modern Slavic languages, and a similar one in Romanian: see ''[[:ro:vârcolac|vârcolac]]''). It is also noteworthy that in the eighteenth century story ''Vrykolokas'' by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Pitton de Tournefort]], he refers to the revenant as a "werewolf" (loups-garous) which may have also been translated as ''[[bugbear|bug-bears]]'', a strange word that has nothing to do with bugs nor bears, but is related to the word ''bogey'', which means spook, spirit, hobgoblin, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Vampires, Burial, and Death-Folklore and Reality'' by Paul Barber (1988) Vali-Ballou Press, Birmingham, NY. p 26.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same word (in the form ''vukodlak'') has come to be used in the sense of "vampire" in the folklore of Western [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] (while the term "vampir" is more common in Eastern Serbia, and in [[Bulgaria]]). Apparently, the two concepts have become mixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svevlad.org.rs/knjige_files/petrovic_mitologija.html#vampir Петровић, Сретен. Српска митологиjа] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331041243/http://www.svevlad.org.rs/knjige_files/petrovic_mitologija.html |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Bulgaria, original folklore generally describes the ''vârkolak'' as a sub-species of the vampire without any wolf-like features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bgrod.org/Vjara/index.php?p=bogove&amp;page=vrkolak Иваничка Димитрова. Българска народна митология. С.1983.стр. 163-164] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227133758/http://bgrod.org/Vjara/index.php?p=bogove&amp;page=vrkolak |date=2016-02-27 }}. Compare alsohey the description in [[Naiden Gerov]]'s Dictionary of the Bulgarian Language ("Речник на блъгарский язик“) (1895–1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The [[Greeks]] traditionally believed that a person could become a ''vrykolakas'' after death due to a [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]] way of life, an [[excommunication]], a burial in [[Consecration|unconsecrated]] ground, or eating the meat of a sheep which had been wounded by a wolf or a werewolf. Some believed that a werewolf itself could become a powerful vampire after being killed, and would retain the wolf-like fangs, hairy palms, and glowing eyes it formerly possessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Summers| first = Montague| title = The Vampire in Lore and Legend| year = 2001| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-41942-8| page = xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of ''vrykolakas'' have the same distinctive characteristics as the bodies of vampires in Balkan folklore. They do not decay; instead, they swell and may even attain a "drum-like" form, being very large, they have a ruddy complexion, and are, according to one account, "fresh and gorged with new blood". People with red hair and gray eyes at this time in history were thought to be vampires according to accounts near the region of modern Serbia. The activities of the ''vrykolakas'' are nearly always harmful, verging from merely leaving their grave and "roaming about", through engaging in [[poltergeist]]-like activity, and up to causing epidemics in the community. Among other things, the creature is believed to knock on the doors of houses and call out the name of the residents. If it gets no reply the first time, it will pass without causing any harm. If someone does answer the door, he or she will die a few days later and become another ''vrykolakas''. For this reason, there is a [[superstition]] present in certain Greek villages that one should not answer a door until the second knock. Legends also say that the ''vrykolakas'' crushes or suffocates the sleeping by sitting on them, much like a [[Mara (folklore)|mara]] or [[Incubus (demon)|incubus]] (cf. [[sleep paralysis]]) — as does a vampire in Bulgarian folklore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulgarian-folklore.com/readarticle.php?article_id=226 Вампир. Из "Народна вяра и религиозни народни обичаи", Д. Маринов, 1994, БАН. Първо издание 1914.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imir-bg.org/imir/books/myusyulmani-Teteven.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629025108/http://www.imir-bg.org/imir/books/myusyulmani-Teteven.pdf |date=2007-06-29 }} Кюркчиева, Ива. 2004. Светът на българите-мюсюлмани от Тетевенско - преход към модерност&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''vrykolakas'' becomes more and more powerful if left alone, legends state that one should destroy its body. According to some accounts, this can only be done on Saturday, which is the only day when the vrykolakas rests in its grave (the same as with Bulgarian vampire legend)&lt;ref&gt;[http://bgrod.org/Vjara/index.php?p=bogove&amp;page=vampir Иваничка Димитрова. Българска народна митология. С.1983.стр. 153- 159] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024035846/http://bgrod.org/Vjara/index.php?p=bogove&amp;page=vampir |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done in various ways, the most common being [[Exorcism|exorcising]], [[Impalement|impaling]], [[beheading]], cutting into pieces, and especially [[cremation|cremating]] the suspected corpse, so that it may be freed from [[undead|living death]] and its victims may be safe.

==Archaeological evidence==
===Ancient Greece===


Ancient Greeks believed that the dead are able to reanimate and exist in a state that is neither living nor dead, but rather ‘undead.’  Burials of suspected [[revenant]]s have been discovered throughout the ancient Greek world.  The earliest examples are from [[Cyprus]] and date to the Neolithic period (ca. 4500–3900/3800 BCE).  At [[Khirokitia]], flexed bodies buried in pit graves were pinned by [[millstone]]s that were placed on either their heads or chests in order to trap the body in its grave.  Similar burials were found at [[Argolid]].  In the necropolis of the city of [[Kamarina, Sicily|Kamarina]], two burials were found which were different from the rest: the first contains an adult of indeterminate sex and stature.  The head and feet of the individual are completely covered by large [[amphora]] fragments.  The heavy amphora fragments found were presumably intended to pin the individual to the grave and prevent it from seeing or rising.  The second burial contains a child approximately 8 to 13 years old, also of indeterminate sex and stature.  Five large stones were placed on top of the child’s body.  These stones were used to trap the body in its grave.&lt;ref name="Walking Dead and Vengeful Spirits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/summer-2015/article/walking-dead-and-vengeful-spirits|title=Walking Dead and Vengeful Spirits|website=popular-archaeology.com|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine Greece===


On [[Attica]], found a limekiln served as a gravesite for two dismembered individuals. The first body belonged to a woman who was cut in half, with both halves placed parallel to one another in the prone position. Buried with her was a small jar containing a single coin from the reign of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] and a portion of the dismembered left leg of an adult male. After deposition, the skeletons were deliberately sealed in the limekiln by large rocks.&lt;ref name="Walking Dead and Vengeful Spirits"/&gt;

===Ottoman Greece===


At [[Lesbos]], a Turkish cemetery from the Ottoman period contained an isolated tomb of an adult who was pinned at the neck, pelvis and both feet with 20 cm nails. On another burial from the same island dating to the same period contained a man over the age of 60. He was found in a [[cist]] grave and had three bent 16 cm spikes mixed in with his bones.&lt;ref name="Walking Dead and Vengeful Spirits"/&gt;

==Apotropaics==
[[Apotropaic]]s are objects or practices that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant, or to occupy a revenant sufficiently enough that he will not harm the living. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles,&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Vampires, Burial and Death, pp. 50–51. 
&lt;/ref&gt; near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the Ancient Greek practice of placing an [[Charon's obol|obolus in the corpse's mouth]] to pay the toll to cross the [[River Styx]] in the underworld; it has been argued that instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the ''vrykolakas'', in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription "[[Jesus Christ]] conquers" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, John Cuthbert (1910). Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 405–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, [[millet]], or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied by counting the fallen grains at the rate of one grain per year,&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Vampires, Burial and Death, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating an association of vampires with [[arithmomania]]. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the [[India]]n subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.&lt;ref&gt;(Spanish) Jaramillo Londoño, Agustín (1986) [1967].

==Vrykolakas and the West==
The first Western accounts of belief in ''vrykolakas'' are from the mid 17th century, in compositions by authors such as the Greek librarian of the Vatican [[Leo Allatius]] (''De quorundam Graecorum Opinationibus'', 1645), and Father François Richard (''Relation de l'Isle de Sant-erini'', 1657), who tend to confirm the stories. The 1718 account of French traveller Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, who witnessed the exhumation and "slaying" of a suspected vrykolakas on the Greek island of [[Mykonos]] in 1701, became better known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://users.net1plus.com/vyrdolak/voyage.htm |title=Excerpted from: A Voyage Into the Levant...(etc) by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. 1718. English edition, London: printed for D. Midwinter, etc. 1741. Volume I, pp. 142-148. |access-date=2007-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107110045/http://users.net1plus.com/vyrdolak/voyage.htm |archive-date=2007-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''vrykolakas'' were identified as the equivalent of the Slavic vampire during the [[Vampire#Eighteenth century vampire controversy|''Eighteenth century vampire controversy'']], as exemplified in Johann Heinrich Zedler's ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon]]'' (1732–1754).

It has become normal, in translating vampire movies and the like into Greek, to translate "vampire" as "vrykolakas". Presumably Modern Greeks raised on [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] vampire movies would be just as likely, if not more so, to think of [[Dracula]], instead of the traditional Greek monster, when a ''vrykolakas'' is mentioned.

One of the few instances of the ''vrykolakas'' or ''vorvolaka'' being used in popular art and media is in the film [[Isle of the Dead (film)|''Isle of the Dead'']] (1945). Directed by [[Mark Robson]], the film centres around a group of people on a small island, whose lives are threatened by a force that some believe to be the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and others believe to be the work of a ''vorvolaka''.

Archaeological excavations on Lesbos at its capital Mytilene have uncovered two vrykolakas burials in early cemeteries. Both were middle aged men buried in special crypts with 20&amp;nbsp;cm spikes through neck, groin and ankles, a typical Balkan method of dealing with a suspected revenant.  The British Vice-Consul, Charles Newton, in his ''Travels and Discoveries in the Levant'' mentions an island off the coast of Lesbos on which the Greeks of his time (1850s) buried their vrykolakadhes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sir Charles Thomas Newton|author2=Sir Dominic Ellis Colnaghi | title = Travels and Discoveries in the Levant| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MkcXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212| year = 1865| publisher = Day &amp; Son, Limited| pages = 212–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and novels==
Several books and novels has been written by western authors on Vrykolakas. Recent development in this area is Adventures in Death and Romance: Vrykolakas Tales&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Death-Romance-Vrykolakas-Tales-ebook/dp/B01DAIPVH0&lt;/ref&gt; authored by historian  Monette Bebow-Reinhard.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Monette-L.-Bebow-Reinhard/e/B002BLL794/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary literature, [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s postmodern play [[With the People from the Bridge]] handles the theme of Vrykolakas in the context of greek folklore and tradition. Characteristically, the female undead character in the book is apotropaically handled on a Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;http://poeticsresearch.com/article/a-column-of-cloud-and-a-column-of-fire-dimitris-lyacos-poena-damni-by-robert-zaller/&lt;/ref&gt;
