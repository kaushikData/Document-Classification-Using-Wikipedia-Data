In the religion of [[Thelema]], it is believed that the history of humanity can be divided into a series of '''aeons''' (also written '''æons'''), each of which was accompanied by its own forms of "magical and religious expression".&lt;ref&gt;[[#DuQ03|DuQuette 2003]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first of these was the Aeon of Isis, which Thelemites believed occurred during prehistory and which saw mankind worshipping a Great Goddess, symbolised by the ancient Egyptian deity [[Isis]]. In Thelemite beliefs, this was followed by the Aeon of Osiris, a period that took place in the classical and mediaeval centuries, when humanity worshipped a singular male god, symbolised by the Egyptian god [[Osiris]], and was therefore dominated by patriarchal values. And finally the third aeon, the Aeon of Horus, which was controlled by the child god, symbolised by [[Horus]]. In this new aeon, Thelemites believe that humanity will enter a time of self-realization and self-actualization.

Within the Thelemite religion, each of these aeons is believed to be "characterized by their [own specific] magical formula", the use of which "is very important and fundamental to the understanding of Thelemic [[Magick (Thelema)|Magick]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#DuQ03|DuQuette 2003]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aeons==

===Aeon of Isis===
The first Aeon of Isis was maternal, where the female aspect of the Godhead was revered due to a mostly [[matriarchy|matriarchal society]] and the idea that "[[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]" nourished, clothed and housed man closed in the womb of Matrix. It was characterized by [[paganism|pagan worship]] of the Mother and Nature. In his ''Equinox of the Gods'' Crowley describes this period as "simple, quiet, easy, and pleasant; the material ignores the spiritual" (''Equinox of the Gods'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[Lon Milo DuQuette]] remarked that this aeon was "the Age of the Great Goddess", and that it had originated in prehistory, reaching its zenith at "approximately 2400 B.C." Continuing with this idea, he remarked that this period was when "the cult of the Great Goddess" was truly universal. She was worshipped by countless cultures under myriad names and forms.  It would also be a mistake for us to conclude that the magical formula of this period manifested exclusively through the worship of any particular anthropomorphic female deity. For, like every aeon, the magical formula of the Aeon of Isis was founded upon mankind's interpretation of the 'perceived facts' of nature, and our Isian-age progenitors perceived nature as a continuous process of spontaneous growth."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DuQ03|DuQuette 2003]]. pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeon of Osiris===
The [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[medieval]] Aeon of Osiris is considered to be dominated by the paternal principle and the formula of the [[Life-death-rebirth deity|Dying God]]. This Aeon was characterized by that of [[self-sacrifice]] and submission to the [[Father God]] while man spoke of his father and mother. Crowley says of this Aeon in his ''Heart of the Master'':
{{bq|1=Formula of Osiris, whose word is [[Magical formula|IAO]]; so that men worshiped Man, thinking him subject to Death, and his victory dependent upon Resurrection. Even so conceived they of the Sun as slain and reborn with every day, and every year.}}

Crowley also says of the Aeon of Osiris in ''Equinox of the Gods'':
{{bq|1=The second [Aeon] is of suffering and death: the spiritual strives to ignore the material. Christianity and all cognate religions worship death, glorify suffering, deify corpses.}}

===Aeon of Horus===
The modern Aeon of Horus is portrayed as a time of [[self-realization]] as well as a growing interest in all things [[spirituality|spiritual]], and is considered to be dominated by the principle of the child. The Word of its Law is [[Thelema]] (will), which is complemented by [[Agape]] (love), and its formula is [[Abrahadabra]]. [[Individuality]] and finding the individual's [[True Will]] are the dominant aspects; its formula is that of growth, in consciousness and love, toward self-realization. Concerning the Aeon of Horus, Crowley wrote:

{{bq|1=... the crowned and conquering child, who dieth not, nor is reborn, but goeth radiant ever upon His Way. Even so goeth the Sun: for as it is now known that night is but the shadow of the Earth, so Death is but the shadow of the Body, that veileth his Light from its bearer. (''Heart of the Master''){{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}}}

And also, in his ''[[Little Essays Toward Truth]]'':

{{bq|1=The Aeon of Horus is here: and its first flower may well be this: that, freed of the obsession of the doom of the Ego in Death, and of the limitation of the Mind by Reason, the best men again set out with eager eyes upon the Path of the Wise, the mountain track of the goat, and then the untrodden Ridge, that leads to the ice-gleaming pinnacles of Mastery!{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}}}

Lon Milo DuQuette commented on the connection that the Aeon of Horus had to the [[Age of Aquarius]] when he stated that "Yes, [the Aeon of Horus] is coincidental to what astrologers and songwriters call the Age of Aquarius and what millions of others refer to simply as the New Age. But it would be a mistake to view this new aeon simply as another tick on a great cosmic clock. The Age of Aquarius, profoundly significant as it is, is only one aspect of a far greater new spiritual age."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DuQ03|DuQuette 2003]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Aeons===
Some Thelemites believe that the Aeon of [[Ma'at]] will eventually replace the present one. According to one of Crowley's early students, [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] (a.k.a. Frater Achad), the Aeon of Ma'at has already arrived or overlaps the present Aeon of Horus.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

[[Chaos magic]] is seen by some as having evolved from portions of the Thelemic religion. Relevant personalities and organizations: [[Peter J. Carroll]], [[Ray Sherwin]], and the [[Illuminates of Thanateros]]. See  also Carroll's Liber Kaos.

==Differing views==
Not all Thelemites believe in a clear succession of Aeons. Sometimes Crowley compared the Word of Horus with other formulas, whose reigns appear to overlap with the Aeon of Osiris and/or Isis. From his ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'':

{{bq|1=There are many magical teachers but in recorded history we have scarcely had a dozen [[Thelemic mysticism#Magus and Ipsissimus|Magi]] in the technical sense of the word. They may be recognized by the fact that their message may be formulated as a single word, which word must be such that it overturns all existing beliefs and codes. We may take as instances the Word of [[Buddha]]-[[Anatta]] (absence of an [[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]] or soul), which laid its axe to the root of [[Hindu cosmology]], [[Hindu theology|theology]] and psychology, and incidentally knocked away the foundation of the [[caste system]]; and indeed of all accepted morality.}}

The '''Alianza Islámica''' is a [[Latino]]-[[Muslim]] organization in the [[United States]]. It was founded in 1987 by a group of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Muslim converts and was the United States' first Latino Muslim organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranks of Latinos Turning to Islam Are Increasing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/02/nyregion/02HISP.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Latino Muslims are part of US religious landscape|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/02/latino-muslims-part-religious-landscape-160202081705201.html|website = www.aljazeera.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders felt that neither the [[African-American]]-majority nor the [[immigrant]]-majority communities sufficiently addressed Latina/os' particular [[culture]], languages, social situations, and contributions to Islamic history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Latina/o Muslims Since 1920: From "Moors" to "Latino Muslims"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9809.12026/abstract|publisher=[[Journal of Religious History]]|accessdate=17 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In El Barrio, [[Spanish Harlem]], the Alianza has mediated between rival gangs, mentored jailed Latinos, provided education about [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], offered [[GED]] (General Education Development Test) courses, helped the sick get treatment, and given free meals during [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olé to Allah: New York's Latino Muslims|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2000/02/Ol-To-Allah-New-Yorks-Latino-Muslims.aspx|publisher=[[Beliefnet.com]]|accessdate=17 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alianza Islámica created the first masjid for the Spanish-speaking community. Through wedding celebrations, congregational prayers, English and Spanish sermons, sharing traditional Puerto Rican dishes without pork, music and poetry gatherings, etc., Alianza Islámica was able to present itself as an integral organization of the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alianza Islámica|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=EMAH0024&amp;DataType=AmericanHistory|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History]]|accessdate=14 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anandpur Sahib Resolution''', was a statement with a list of demands made by Punjab political party, the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], in 1973&lt;ref name="KhushwantSingh2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh | title=A History of the Sikhs: Volume 2 | chapter=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Presentation in 1973==
After being routed in [[Punjab Legislative Assembly election, 1972|1972 Punjab election]], the [[Akali Dal]] put forward the Anandpur Sahib Resolution resolution in 1973 to demand more autonomy to Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=The Anandpur Sahib Resolution and Other Akali Demands|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195673098.001.0001/acprof-9780195673098-chapter-20|work=oxfordscholarship.com/|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution included both religious and political issues. It asked for recognising Sikhism as a religion separate from Hinduism. It also demanded that power be generally devoluted from the Central to state governments.&lt;ref name="Jayanta484"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ray |first1=Jayanta Kumar |title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World |date=2007 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131708347 |page=484 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Nyk6oA2nOlgC&amp;q=khalistan#v=snippet&amp;q=khalistan&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for autonomy was phrased such a way that would have given more authority to the Sikhs than Hindus in Punjab.&lt;ref name="itp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/millennium/100people/jarnail.html|title=Prophet of Hate:J S Bhindranwale|last=Singh|first=Tavleen|publisher=India Today|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620164214/http://www.india-today.com/itoday/millennium/100people/jarnail.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==
The document was largely forgotten for some time after its adoption, but came into the limelight in the 1980s. The [[Akali Dal]] and  [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] joined hands to launch the [[Dharam Yudh Morcha]] in 1982 in order to implement the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. Thousands of people joined the movement, feeling that it represented a real solution to demands such as a larger share of water for irrigation and the return of [[Chandigarh]] to Punjab.&lt;ref name="Akshay1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akshayakumar Ramanlal Desai|title=Expanding Governmental Lawlessness and Organized Struggles | date=1 January 1991|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-529-2|pages=64–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indira Gandhi, the leader of the Akali Dal's rival [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], viewed the Anandpur Sahib Resolution as a [[Khalistan movement|secessionist]] document.&lt;ref name="Giorgio2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani | title=Sikh nationalism and identity in a global age | year=2008 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-42190-4 | pages=51–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing of the resolution would have allowed India to be divided, making a Khalistan for sikhs.&lt;ref name="NDTV_34year"&gt;{{cite news |title=34 Years On, A Brief History About Operation Bluestar, And Why It Was Carried Out |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-bluestar-34th-anniversary-a-brief-history-about-operation-bluestar-and-why-it-was-carried--1863385 |accessdate=5 July 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akali Dal officially stated that the Anandpur Sahib Resolution did not envisage an autonomous Sikh State of [[Khalistan]]. Its president [[Harchand Singh Longowal]] declared:&lt;ref name="Giorgio2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSBasran2003"&gt;{{cite book | author1=G. S. Basran | author2=B.

After the [[Operation Bluestar]],  [[Rajiv Gandhi]] reached a compromise with Longowal called [[Rajiv-Longowal Accord]], on 24 July 1985. The government accepted the demands of [[Akali Dal]] who in turn agreed to withdraw their agitation. The accord attracted opposition from several orthodox Sikh leaders of [[Punjab]] as well as from the politicians of [[Haryana]]. Some of its promises could not be fulfilled due to the disagreements. Harcharan Singh Longowal was assassinated by the Sikh militants opposed to the accord.&lt;ref name="LA_accord"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sikh Leader in Punjab Accord Assassinated |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-21/news/mn-1021_1_sikh-militants |accessdate=14 June 2018 |agency=Times Wire Services |publisher=LA Times |date=21 August 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The Shiromani Akali Dal shall ever strive to achieve the following aims:

1. Propagation of Sikhism, its ethical values and code of conduct to combat atheism.

2. Preservation and keeping alive the concept of distinct and sovereign identity of the [[Panth]] and building up of appropriate condition in which the national sentiments and aspirations of the Sikh Panth will find full expression, satisfaction and facilities for growth.

3. Eradication of poverty and starvation through increased production and more equitable distribution of wealth and also the establishment of a just social order sans exploitation of any kind.

4. Vacation of discrimination on the basis of caste, creed or any other ground in keeping with basic principles of Sikhism.

5. Removal of disease and ill health, checking the use of intoxicants and provision of full facilities for the growth of physical well-being so as to prepare and enthuse the Sikh Nation for the national defence. For the achievement of the aforesaid purposes, the Shiromani Akali Dal owed society as its primary duty to inculcate among the Sikh; religious fervour and a sense of pride in their great socio-spiritual heritage through the following measures:

(a). Reiteration of the concept of unity of God, meditation on His Name, recitation of [[ gurbani]], inculcation of faith in the Holy Sikh Gurus as well as in Guru Granth Sahib Ji and other appropriate measures for such a purpose.

(b). Grooming at the Sikh Missionary College the Sikh youth with inherent potential to become accomplished preachers, [[ragi (Sikhism)|ragis]], [[dhadi (music)|dhadis]] and poets so that the propagation of Sikhism, its tenets and traditions and its basic religious values could be taken up more effectively and vigorously.

(c). Baptising the Sikhs on a mass scale with particular emphasis on schools and colleges wherein the teachers as well as the taught shall be enthused through regular study circles.

(d). Revival of the religious institution of [[Dasvandh]] among the [[Sikhs]].

(e). Generating a feeling of respect for Sikh intellectuals including writers and preachers, who also would be enthused to improve upon their accomplishments.

(f). Streamlining the administration of the gurdwaras by giving better training to their workers. Appropriate steps would also be taken to maintain gurdwara building in proper condition. The representatives of the party in the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] would be directed to focus their resources towards these ends.

(g). Making suitable arrangements for error free publications of [[gurbani]], promoting research in the ancient and modern [[History_of_Sikhism|Sikh history]], translating [[gurbani|holy gurbani]] into other languages and producing first-rate literature on [[Sikhism]].

(h). Taking appropriate measures for the enactment of an All India Gurdwaras Act with a view to improving the administration of the gurdwaras throughout the country and to reintegrate the traditional preaching sects of Sikhism like [[Udasi]]s and [[Nirmala (sect)|Nirmalas]], without in any way encroaching upon the properties of their [[Matha|maths]].

(i). Taking necessary steps to bring the Sikh gurdwaras all over the world under a single system of administration with a view to running them according to the basic Sikh forms and to pool their resources for the propagation of Sikhism on a wider and more impressive scale.

(j). Striving to free access to all those holy Sikh shrines, including Nanakana Sahib, from which the Sikh [[Panth]] has been separated, for their pilgrimage and proper upkeep.

(k). Development of the farmers (kisan) of Punjab.

==Resolution==

{{move to Wikisource|This specific section}}
Resolutions adopted, in the light of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, at open session of the 18th All India Akali Conference held at Ludhiana on 28–29 October 1978, under the presidency of Jathedar Jagdev Singh Talwandi are as under:

'''Resolution No. 1'''

Moved by Sardar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, President, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.

The Shiromani Akali Dal realizes that India is a federal and republican geographical entity of different languages, religions and cultures. To safeguard the fundamental rights of the religious and linguistic minorities, to fulfill the demands of the democratic traditions and to pave the way for economic progress, it has become imperative that the Indian constitutional infrastructure should be given a real federal shape by redefining the Central and State relation and rights on the lines of the aforesaid principles and objectives.
The concept of total revolution given by Lok Naik Jaya Parkash Narain is also based upon the progressive decentralization of powers. The climax of the process of centralization of powers of the states through repeated amendments of the Constitution during the Congress regime came before the countrymen in the form of the Emergency (1975), when all fundamental rights of all citizens was usurped. It was then that the programme of decentralization of powers ever advocated by Shiromani Akali Dal was openly accepted and adopted by other political parties including Janata Party, C.P.I. (M), D.M.K., etc.
Shiromani Akali Dal has ever stood firm on this principle and that is why after a very careful consideration it unanimously adopted a resolution to this effect first at the All India Akali Conference, Batala, then at Anandpur Sahib which has endorsed the principle of State autonomy in keeping with the concept of federalism.

As such, the Shiromani Akali Dal emphatically urges upon the Janata Government to take cognizance of the different linguistic and cultural sections, religious minorities as also the voice of millions of people and recast the constitutional structure of the country on real and meaningful federal principles to obviate the possibility of any danger to the unity and integrity of the country and, further, to enable the states to play a useful role for the progress and prosperity of the Indian people in their respective areas by a meaningful exercise of their powers.

'''Resolution No. 2'''

This momentous meeting of the Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Government of India to examine carefully the long tale of the excesses, wrongs, illegal actions committed [against the Sikhs] by the previous Congress Government, more particularly during the Emergency, and try to find an early solution to the following problems:

(a) Chandigarh originally raised as a Capital for Punjab should be handed over to Punjab.

(b) The long-standing demand of the Shiromani Akali Dal for the merger in Punjab of the Punjabi-speaking areas, to be identified by linguistic experts with village as a unit, should be conceded.

(c) The control of headworks should continue to be vested in Punjab and, if need be, the Reorganization Act should be amended.

(d) The arbitrary and unjust Award given by Mrs. Indira Gandhi during the Emergency on the distributions of Ravi-Beas waters should be revised on the universally accepted norms and principles, and justice be done to Punjab.

(e) Keeping in view the special aptitude and martial qualities of the Sikhs, the present ratio of their strength in the Army should be maintained.

(f) The excesses being committed on the settlers in the Tarai region of the Uttar Pradesh in the name of Land Reforms should be vacated by making suitable amendments in the ceiling law on the Central guidelines.

'''Resolution No. 3'''
(Economic Policy Resolution)

The chief sources of inspiration of the economic policies and programme of the Shiromani Akali Dal are the secular, democratic and socialistic concepts of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh. Our economic programme is based on three principles:

   (a) Dignity of labor.
   (b) An economic and social structure which provides for the uplift of the poor and depressed sections of society.
   (c) Unabated opposition to concentration of economic and political power in the hands of the capitalists.

While drafting its economic policies and programme, the Shiromani Akali Dal in its historic Anandpur Sahib Resolution has laid particular stress on the need to break the monopolistic hold of the capitalists foisted on the Indian economy by 30 years of Congress rule in India. This capitalist hold enabled the Central government to assume all powers in its hands after the manner of Mughal imperialism. This was bound to thwart the economic progress of the states and injure the social and economic interests of the people. The Shiromani Akali Dal once again reiterates the Sikh way of life by resolving to fulfil the holy words of Guru Nanak Dev:
"He alone realizes the true path who labors honestly and shares with others the fruits of that labor."

This way of life is based upon three basic principles:
   i. Doing honest labor,
   ii. Sharing with others the fruits of this labor, and
   iii. Meditation on the Lord's Name.

The Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Central and the State governments to eradicate unemployment during the next ten years. While pursuing this aim, special emphasis should be laid on amelioration the lot of the weaker sections, scheduled and depressed classes, workers, landless and poor farmers and urban poor farmers and urban poor. Minimum wages must be fixed for all of them.

The Shiromani Akali Dal urges Punjab government to draw up such an economic plan for the state as would turn it into the leading state during the next ten years by raising per capita income to Rs. 3,000 and by generating an economic growth rate of 7% per annum as against 4% at the national level.
The Shiromani Akali Dal gives first priority to the redrafting of the taxation structure in such a way that the burden of taxation is shifted from the poor to the richer classes and an equitable distribution of national income ensured.
The main plank of the economic programme of the Shiromani Akali Dal is to enable the economically weaker sections of the society to share the fruits of national income.

The Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Central government to make an international airport at Amritsar which should also enjoy the facilities of a dry port. Similarly, a Stock Exchange should be opened at Ludhiana to accelerate the process of industrialization and economic growth in the State. The Shiromani Akali Dal also desires that suitable amendments should be made in the Foreign Exchange rules for free exchange of foreign currencies and thereby removing the difficulties being faced by the Indian emigrants.
The Shiromani Akali Dal emphatically urges upon the Indian government to bring about parity between the prices of the agricultural produce and that of the industrial raw materials so that the discrimination against such states that lack these materials may be removed.
The Shiromani Akali Dal demands that the exploitation of the produces of cash crops like cotton, sugarcane, oil seeds, etc., at the hand of traders should be stopped forthwith and for this purpose arrangements be made for purchase by government of these crops at remunerable prices. Besides, effective steps should be taken by government for the purchase of cotton through the Cotton Corporation.
The Shiromani Akali Dal strongly feels that the most pressing national problem is the need to ameliorate the lot of millions of exploited persons belonging to the scheduled classes. For such a purpose the Shiromani Akali Dal calls upon the Central and State governments to earmark special funds. Besides, the state governments should allot sufficient funds in their respective budgets for giving free residential plots both in the urban and rural areas to the Scheduled Castes.

The Shiromani Akali Dal also calls for the rapid diversification of farming. The shortcomings in the Land Reforms Laws should be removed, rapid industrialization of the State ensured, credit facilities for the medium industries expanded and unemployment allowance given to those who are unemployed. For remunerative farming, perceptible reduction should be made in the prices of farm machinery like tractors, tubewells, as also of the inputs.

'''Resolution No. 4'''

This huge gathering of the Shiromani Akali Dal regrets the discrimination to which the Punjabi language is being subjected in adjoining States of Himachal, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, etc. It is its firm demand that in accordance with the Nehru Language Formula, the neighboring states of Punjab should give "second" language status to Punjabi because of fairly large sections of their respective populations are Punjabi-speaking.

'''Resolution No. 5'''

The meeting regrets that against the "claims" of the refugees who had migrated to Jammu and Kashmir as a result of the partition of the country, no compensation had been provided to them even after such a long time and these unfortunate refugees had been rotting in the camps ever since then.
This Akali Dal session, therefore, forcefully demands that their claims should be settled soon and immediate steps should be taken to rehabilitate them even if it involves an amendment to section 370 of the Constitution.

'''Resolution No. 6'''

The 18th session of the All India Akali Conference take strong exception to the discrimination to which the minorities in other states are being subjected and the way in which their interests are being ignored.
As such, it demands that injustice against the Sikhs in other states should be vacated and proper representation should be given them in government service, local bodies and state legislatures, through nominations, if need be.

'''Resolution No. 7'''

The 18th session of the All India Akali Conference notes with satisfaction that mechanization of farming in the country has led to increase in the farm yield and as a result the country is heading toward self-sufficiency in foodgrain.
However, the session feels that poor farmers are unable to tale to mechanization because of the enormity of the cost involved.
As such, the Shiromani Akali Dal urges upon the Government of India to abolish the excise duty on tractors, so that with the decrease in their prices, the smaller farmers may also be able to avail themselves of farm machinery and contribute to increase in agricultural produce of the country.

'''Resolution No. 8'''

This conference of the Shiromani Akali Dal appeals to the Central and State governments to pay particular attention to the poor and laboring classes and demands that besides making suitable amendments in the Minimum Wages Act, suitable legal steps be taken to improve the economic lot of the laboring class, to enable it to lead respectable life and play a useful role in the rapid industrialization of the country.

'''Resolution No. 9'''

This session seeks permission from the Government of India to install a broadcasting station at the Golden Temple, Amritsar, for the relay of Gurbani Kirtan for the spiritual satisfaction of those Sikh who are living in foreign lands.
The session wishes to make it clear that the entire cost of the proposed broadcasting project would be borne by the Khalsa Panth and its over all control shall vest with the Indian Government. It is hoped that the Government would have no hesitation in conceding this demand after due consideration.

'''Resolution No. 10'''

This mammoth gathering of the Shiromani Akali Dal strongly urges upon the Government of India to make necessary amendments in the following enactment for the benefit of the agricultural classes who have toiled hard for the sake of larger national interests:
1. Hindu Succession Act be suitably amended to enable a woman to get rights of inheritance in the properties of her father-in-law instead of the father's.
2. The agricultural lands of the farmers should be completely exempted from the Wealth Tax and the Estate Tax.

'''Resolution No. 11'''

This vast gathering of the Shiromani Akali Dal strongly impresses upon the Government of India that keeping in vies that economic backwardness of the scheduled and non-scheduled castes, provisions proportionate to their population should be made in the budget for utilization for their welfare. A special ministry should be created at the Centre as a practical measure to render justice to them on the basis of reservations.
The session also calls upon the government that in keeping with the settlement already made, no discrimination should be made between the Sikh and Hindu Harijans in any part of the country.

'''Resolution No. 12'''

The Congress government is called upon to vacate the gross injustice, discrimination done to Punjab in the distribution of Ravi-Beas waters. The Central government must also give approval for the immediate establishment of six sugar and four textile mills in Punjab so that the State may be able to implement its agro-industrial policy.

== Early history ==
One of the early [[Bahá'í]] pioneers to come to [[Egypt]] in 1867 was Mirza Heyder Ali during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha]] circa 1860–70 who was arrested and banished to Sudan for 12 years soon after his entrance into Egypt.&lt;ref name="Bulletinhistory"&gt;*{{cite journal| title = History of the Cause in Egypt | journal = Bahá'í News |date=January 1930 | issue = 37 | page = 8 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=276}}

[[File:Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani-1.jpg|150px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl|Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl-i-Gulpáygání]]&lt;/center&gt;]] Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl-i-Gulpáygání, often called [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]], was one of the prominent Bahá'ís to [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] to Egypt and made some of the first big changes to the community. Abu'l-Fadl first came to [[Cairo]] in 1894 where he settled for several years. He worked at [[Al-Azhar University]] and was successful in converting more than fourteen&lt;ref name="hassal-egypt"/&gt; and up to thirty&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt; of the teachers and students including the first native Egyptians to convert to the religion. Abu'l-Fadl also became friends with writers and magazine publishers, and many articles that he authored appeared in the Egyptian press.  In 1896, when [[Nasser-al-Din Shah|Nasiru'd-Din Shah]] was assassinated in Iran, Za`imu'd-Dawlih used the rumour that the assassination had been performed by Bahá'ís to cause a massacre of the Bahá'ís in Egypt. Abu'l-Fadl stood up in defence for the Bahá'ís and stated that he himself was a Bahá'í and his allegiance became public. Two publications came out during this time from Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl:

*''Fara'id'' (The Peerless Gems): A book written in 1898 in reply to an attack on the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]] and published in Cairo.  Generally considered Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl's greatest work.
*''Al-Duraru'l-Bahiyyih'' (The Shining Pearls): Published in 1900, it is a collection of essays on the history of the Bahá'í Faith.  Since it was wrriten in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], it was responsible for making the Bahá'ís known in Egypt.

Following their publication al-Azhar University decreed that he was an [[infidel]]. From 1901 to 1904 at the request of `Abdu'l-Bahá he traveled and gave talks among the new Bahá'í community in the United States. Meanwhile, the Egyptian community continued to publish materials and from 1900 to 1910 several articles and books including official [[Bahá'í literature]] were published in Cairo.&lt;ref name="hassal-egypt"/&gt; Abu'l-Fadl died in 1914 is buried in the cemetery called Al-Rawda Al-Abadeyya, the Eternal Garden. &lt;!-- is this the name of the cemetery he was buried in or the one his remains were transferred to in 1942?

=== After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá ===
In the period between the world wars,public opposition to Bahá'ís became more widespread as the religion grew and in addition to growing, the Bahá'ís of Egypt began to publish materials to be more easily read. At the death of `Abdul-Bahá in 1921, Shoghi Effendi left England with the assistance of [[Lady Blomfield]] and stopped in Egypt to change boats for Haifa.&lt;ref name="BN515"/&gt;

==== Progress of the religion ====
The assembly of Alexandria was formed in 1924 for the first time and Subhê Eliçs was among the elected – he was re-elected until 1961 and left an oral history recorded from his experiences in the community in 1977.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 746–748 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/720-748.html  | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Instances of opposition ====
1924 began with an apparent triumph when following a controversy over a burial of a Bahá'í in a Muslim cemetery,&lt;ref name="egypt-today"/&gt; [[Egypt]] became the first Islamic state to legally recognize the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion separate from [[Islam]]&lt;ref name="buck"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Christopher | last = Buck | title = Islam and Minorities: The Case of the Bahá'ís | journal = Studies in Contemporary Islam | url = http://bahai-library.com/buck_islam_minorities | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–106 | year =2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creating two cemeteries for the Bahá'ís – one in Cairo and the other in Ismaïlia.&lt;ref name="egypt-today"/&gt; As a result of the decision when certain Muslims attacked Bahá'ís in Kom El-Sayeda the perpetrators were excommunicated from Islam for the attack.&lt;ref name="Bulletinhistory"/&gt; In 1936 following interest from citizens of [[Belqas]] as well as visitors from [[Tanta]] it became known that Saad Effendi Salim Nosseir was a Bahá'í and opposition was stirred up such that the interested citizens and Nosseir were unable to leave their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Persecutions in Egypt| journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1936 | issue = 104 | page = 8 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nossier, being a public servant, appealed for a change in residence and serve in another district and was at first refused despite his good reputation. However, in time he was transferred.&lt;ref name="36conv"/&gt; And in late 1938 there were extraordinary events concerning the burial of Mohammed Effendi Soliman of [[Ismaïlia]] who had died 9 December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Committee Appointments| journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1939 | issue = 127 | pages = 9–10 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having informed family and friends of his wish for a Bahá'í funeral, and drawing up a Will requiring his heirs to submit to the Local Assembly of Ismaïlia, the assembly informed the police of the papers and arrangements. A non-Bahá'í brother agitated against this funeral and became so threatening that he was detained by the police. However, when it came time to take the casket to the cemetery a large angry crowd made travel impossible despite police protection. That night the casket was transferred to police headquarters though fighting injured eight policemen. On the next day after midnight a truck took the casket out of town to be buried in the desert sands. The home of the deceased was attacked by a mob, and demonstnitions were continued in the streets throughout the night. In 1939, after the national assembly elections, petition was made to have Bahá'í marriage ceremonies legal in Egypt – as part of the justification a copy of a marriage contract issued by the Spiritual Assembly of Haifa and legalized by both Palestine authorities and the Egyptian Consulate in Jerusalem was enclosed.&lt;ref name="15thconv"/&gt; However, by 1944 a Bahá'í marriage was compulsorily annulled because the wife had originally been Moslem, in spite of her statement in court that she now considered herself a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="BN178"&gt;{{cite journal| title = News of Other Lands; Egypt| journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1945 | issue = 178 | page = 8 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabri Elias married and went on [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] and then returned to Ethiopia and then some years later went on to Djibouti.&lt;ref name="reaping"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]] came through Egypt during a personal trip with his wife [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] through Africa in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Hand of Cause 'Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum Dedicates Mother Temple of Africa; Teaching Conference| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1961 | issue = 361 | page = 5 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=05&amp;page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since a regime change in 1960, the Bahá'ís lost all rights as an organized religious community&lt;ref name="austr"/&gt; by Decree 263&lt;ref name="us_dos_egypt"/&gt; which specified a minimum sentence of six months' imprisonment or a fine for any assembly-related activities.&lt;ref name="hassal-egypt"/&gt; This law came into being seven years after the declaration of the Arab Republic of Egypt, at the decree of then-President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref name="us_dos_egypt_2001" /&gt; All Bahá'í community properties, including Bahá'í centers, libraries, and cemeteries, were confiscated by the government&lt;ref name="us_dos_egypt" /&gt; except the cemetery Al-Rawda Al-Abadeyya.&lt;ref name="egypt-today"/&gt; In obedience to the government is a core principal of the religion.&lt;ref name="amnesty1"&gt;{{cite web

Ramadan's first two books were short story collections - ''Khashab wa Nohass'' (''Brass and Wood'', 1995) and ''Manazel el-Kamar'' (''Phases of the Moon'', 1999). Her first novel ''Awraq Al-Nargis'' (''Leaves of Narcissus'') was published to great acclaim in 2001 and won the [[Naguib Mahfouz Medal]]. It was then translated into English by [[Marilyn Booth]] and is available from the [[AUC Press]].

Ramadan has also worked extensively as a translator. Among her notable translations is [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''A Room of One's Own''. She is a founding member of the Women and Memory Forum, a non-profit organisation, and teaches English and Translation at the National Academy of Arts in Cairo.

=== Hussein Bikar ===
[[Hussein Bikar]] was born in [[Alexandria]] in 1912 and was one of the most famous Egyptian portrait painters. A member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] he was arrested in the 1980s by the state security investigation bureau in a clamp-down on Bahá'ís in Egypt. Nevertheless, Bikar received the State Merit Award in 1978, the Merit Medal in 1980 and, in 2000, shortly before his death, the Mubarak Award.&lt;ref name="other"/&gt;  The [[Universal House of Justice]], the highest governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, paid tribute to his contributions to Egyptian society after his death in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Message to the Baha'is of Egypt from the Universal House of Justice| newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service    | pages =    | date = 26 December 2006| url = http://news.bahai.org/story/499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification Controversy ===
{{main article|Egyptian identification card controversy}}

The controversy resulted from a ruling of the [[Supreme Administrative Council of Egypt]] on 16 December 2006 against the Bahá'ís stating that the government may not recognize the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in official identification cards.&lt;ref name="eipr2"/&gt;

The ruling left Bahá'ís unable to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle.&lt;ref name="hor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Human Rights Caucus, House of Representatives |accessdate=2006-12-29 |date=16 November 2005 |url=http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227195313/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human%2BRights%2BCaucus/Briefing%2BTestimonies/11-17-05%2BTestimony%2Bof%2BKit%2BBigelow%2BEgypt%2BBriefing.htm |archivedate=27 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a 2008 ruling accepted the compromise solution offered by the Bahá'ís, allowing for them to obtain identification papers without the Bahá'í Faith being officially recognized,&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news |author = AFP |title= Egypt's Bahais score breakthrough in religious freedom case |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gQ9bxTaqTTvqBMu-r5srjd5d1KBA|publisher=AFP |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080208150506/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gQ9bxTaqTTvqBMu-r5srjd5d1KBA| archivedate= 8 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Egypt court upholds Baha'i plea in religious freedom cases | date = 29 January 2008 | accessdate = 30 January 2008 | publisher = Bahá'í World News Service | author = BWNS | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/600}}&lt;/ref&gt; however through February 2009 there have been appeals and procedural choices made trying not to give such cards.&lt;ref name="vict"/&gt; The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís, though, under the new policy on 8 August 2009.&lt;ref name="bns-cardissued"&gt;{{cite web | title = First identification cards issued to Egyptian Bahá'ís using a "dash" instead of religion | author = | date = 14 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-08-16 | publisher = Bahá'í News Service | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are recent reports of 500&lt;ref name="out"/&gt; to 2,000&lt;ref name="egypt-today"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bikya"/&gt; or even more than 3000 or so&lt;ref name="Shahat"/&gt; Bahá'ís in Egypt. The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated over 7227 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;

'''Baruch Abuhatzeira''' ({{lang-he-n|ברוך אבוחצירא}}; born 1941), also known as '''Baba Baruch''', is an [[Israel]]i [[Kabbalist]] rabbi and spiritual adviser who operates in [[Netivot]], a blue-collar town in southern Israel. He is the son of the leading Moroccan [[Sephardic]] rabbi Israel Abuhatzeira, also known as the [[Baba Sali]].&lt;ref name="shaping"&gt;The Shaping of Israeli Identity: Myth, Memory and Trauma. Robert Wistrich, David Ohana (ed.) p. 224-226&lt;/ref&gt;

Baruch was born in [[Arfoud]] in the [[Meknès-Tafilalet]] of the [[Maghreb]] region in eastern [[Morocco]]. There, he was educated by his father. During his youth Baruch spent several years in [[Paris]]. In the mid-1960s, Baruch emigrated to Israel with his father, and he decided to pursue a political career. He was elected  deputy mayor in [[Ashkelon]]. Abuhatzeira was later tried and sentenced to five years in prison for corruption and bribery connected to his role as deputy mayor. After obtaining an early release, Abuhatzeira joined Baba Sali, and was with his father during the last three months of the Rabbi's life.&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt;

'''Caodaism''' ({{cjkv|v=Đạo Cao Đài}}, [[Chữ nôm]]: 道高臺) is a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Religious syncretism|syncretic]] religion officially established in the city of [[Tây Ninh]] in southern Vietnam in 1926. The full name of the religion is '''''Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ''''' ('''The Great Faith [for the] Third Universal Redemption''').{{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|p=3}}

''Cao Đài'' ({{IPA-vi|kāːw ɗâːj|lang|Cao Dai audio.ogg}}, literally the "Highest Lord" or "Highest Power"){{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|p=3}} is the supreme deity, believed by Caodaists to have created the universe.{{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|p=3}}{{sfn|Oliver|1976|p=7}} Caodaists often use the term ''Đức Cao Đài'' (''Venerable High Lord'') as the abbreviated name, whose full title is "Cao Đài Tiên Ông Đại Bồ Tát Ma Ha Tát" ("The Highest Power [the] Ancient Immortal [and] Great Bodhisattva"). The symbol of the faith is the Left Eye of God, representing the [[yin and yang|yang]] (masculine, ordaining, positive and expansive) activity of the male creator, which is balanced by the yin (âm) activity of Mother Goddess, the Queen Mother of the West (Diêu Trì Kim Mẫu, Tây Vương Mẫu), the feminine, nurturing and restorative mother of humanity.{{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|pp=3–4}}

Adherents engage in practices such as prayer, veneration of ancestors, [[nonviolence]], and vegetarianism with the goal of union with God and freedom from [[saṃsāra]].{{sfn|Hoskins|2015|pp=1–28}} Estimates of the number of Caodaists in Vietnam vary; government figures estimate 4.4 million Caodaists affiliated to the [[Tây Ninh church]], with numbers rising up to 6 million if other branches are added.{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|2014-07-31}}{{sfn|Hoskins|2015|p=4; 239}}{{sfn|Eller|2014|pp=184–186; 188}}{{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|p=4}}{{sfn|Hoskins (b)|2012}} An additional number of adherents in the tens of thousands, primarily ethnic Vietnamese, live in North America, Europe, and Australia. The design, shape and coloring of Caodaist temples is quite standard around the world and includes the incorporation of sacred images, symbols, and colors.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==History==
{{POV-section|date=September 2014}}

[[Ngô Văn Chiêu]], a district head of the French administration in [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], was the first to worship and receive messages from Cao Đài in 1921.&lt;ref name="The Colors of Cao Dai2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelstarchristy.com/2015/11/the-religious-colors-of-cao-dai.htm|title=The Colors of Cao Dai|date=12 November 2015|publisher=Angelstan Christy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a vision of the Divine Eye which is now the symbol for Cao Đài as well as the focus for worship on all Cao Đài altars.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Adherents maintain that on Christmas Eve 1925, God identified Himself to the first group of Cao Đài mediums, which included [[Phạm Công Tắc]], [[Cao Quỳnh Cư]], and [[Cao Hoài Sang]]. These three figures were to play an essential role in the growing religion as the three founding spirit mediums of the Hiệp Thiên Đài or "Palace Uniting Heaven and Earth".  Phạm Công Tắc was the head spirit medium or Hộ Pháp  ("Defender of the Dharma), while  Cao Quỳnh Cư was the Thượng Phẩm (his Sacred Assistant) and Cao Hoài Sang was the Thượng Sanh (his Secular Assistant). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wrldrels.org/2017/08/10/caodaism/|title=Caodaism – WRSP|author=|date=|website=wrldrels.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429155901/https://wrldrels.org/2017/08/10/caodaism/|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 Oct 1926, [[Lê Văn Trung]] (a former elected official of the Colonial Council of [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]] and a member of the Conseil de Gouvernement de l'Indochine), and a leading group of 27 Caodaists, the first disciples of Cao Đài, signed the "Declaration of the Founding of the Cao Đài Religion" and presented it to the French Governor of Cochinchina. The Cao Đài faith brought together a number of once underground [[sect]]s into a new [[National church|national religion]].

Officially called the "Great Way of the Third Time of Redemption" (''Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ''), it became popular in its first few decades, gathering over a million members and converting a fifth to a fourth of the population of Cochinchina by 1940.{{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|p=4}}

In the 1930s, the leader criticized the French colonial regime, though he also emphasized dialogue with the French. This stance was controversial, and contrasted with the liturgy of dozens of "dissident" branches of Caodaism that followed a more [[Taoist]] model.{{sfn|Hoskins (a)|2012|p=4}}

During the [[First Indochina War|First]] and [[Vietnam War|Second Indochina Wars]], members of Cao Đài (along with several other Vietnamese sects, such as [[Hòa Hảo]]) were active in political and military struggles against both French colonial forces and South Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Ngô Đình Diệm]].{{sfn|Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|2014-07-31}}{{sfn|Vietnam Timeline 1955}}

Their critique of the [[communist]] forces until 1975 was a factor in their repression after the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975, when the incoming [[Communism in Vietnam|communist government]] banned the practice of Caodaism.{{sfn|Cao Dai Overseas Missionary|2008-01-07}} In 1997, Caodaism was granted legal recognition and unrestricted practice once again.{{sfn|Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|2014-07-31}}

[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are One'', a painting in the ''litang'' style portraying three men laughing by a river stream. 12th century, [[Song Dynasty]]]]
[[File:Bức_Họa_Tam_Thánh_012014.JPG|thumb|Three Saints and the Divine Covenant]]

The official name of the Cao Đài religion (or Caodaism) is ''Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ''. Translated directly it means: The Third Great Universal Religious Amnesty. (''Đại Đạo'' – "Great Faith", ''Tam Kỳ'' – "Third Period", ''Phổ'' – "to announce" and ''Độ'' – "to save"). 

According to Cao Đài's [[dogma]], this Third Period will be of intense religious activity which will unite God and humanity in ways not yet imagined. Cao Đài also states that the Third Amnesty will establish a new great faith for the  salvation of living beings before the universal destruction. The primary objective of the Third Amnesty is the unity of all religions, which will bring mankind together in a universal family for universal peace.{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (a)}}

Caodaism teaches that, throughout human history, God the Father has revealed his truth many times through the mouths of many prophets, but these messages were always either ignored or forgotten due to humanity’s susceptibility to secular desires. Adherents believe that the age has now come when God speaks to humanity directly.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the nineteenth century, [[Spiritism]] became established in [[Europe]]. The likes of [[Madam Blavatsky]], [[Allan Kardec]] and [[Victor Hugo]] championed new religious possibilities. In [[Vietnam]], the age-old traditions of Asian [[divination]] and [[mediumship]] began to mix with the new traditions of European Spiritism.

To highlight this objective of unity, there is a representation of the Divine Covenant of The Third Amnesty (The Third Alliance) inside every Cao Đài Temple. This Covenant between Heaven and Earth is written and presented to humanity by the Venerable Saints – [[Victor Hugo]], [[Sun Yat Sen]] and Trạng Trình [[Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm]]. Their mission is said to guide humanity into the way of the Third Amnesty. The Covenant is written in French: "''Dieu et Humanité Amour et Justice''; and in Chinese: 天上天下 博愛公平. This translates into English as: "God and Humanity [for] Love and Justice."{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (a)}}

==Theology and Theosophy==

===God===
[[File:Eight Trigrams.jpg|thumb|right|The Eight Trigrams (''Bagua'', 八卦) in Caodaism, borrowed from [[Taoism]]]]
"Cao Đài" refers to God the Father (the Supreme Being, the Creator, the Ultimate Reality of the Universe). ''Cao Đài Tiên Ông Đại Bồ Tát Ma Ha Tát'', as God's full title, indicates a combination of the three main religions – [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]].
* ''Cao Đài'' [[File:Cao Dai audio.ogg|thumb|right|Pronunciation of "Cao Đài" in Vietnamese]]  literally means "High Tower/Palace", that is, the place where God reigns over the universe. These words represent Confucianism.
[[File:Tien Ong.ogg|thumb|right|Pronunciation of 'Tiên Ông' in Vietnamese]]
* ''Tiên Ông'' is the largest rank in Taoism.
[[File:Dai Bo Tat Ma Ha Tat.ogg|thumb|right|Pronunciation of the third phrase in Vietnamese]]
* ''Đại Bồ Tát Ma Ha Tát'' literally means Great Bodhisattva the Great Being (Mahasattva) in Buddhism.
Together, they represent not only the unification of the three main religions but also the humility of God who presents himself as the lowest rank of Divinity.{{sfn|Tam|2000}}{{Request quotation|date=March 2016}}

===Cosmology===
[[File:Divine Eye sphere.jpg|The Divine Eye|thumb|right|A sphere inside the Tây Ninh Holy See, representing the Left Eye of God.]]
Caodaists adopt the traditional Chinese idea of ''âm'' (yin) and ''dương'' (yang) duality constituting the harmonious balance of the universe. Before the creation of the universe there was the "dao", the infinite, nameless, formless, unchanging, eternal source. The negative and positive principles of the universe are the components of the eternal nature.{{sfn|Oliver|1976|p=8}}

There are two main Gods, the ''Cao Đài'' ("Highest Lord") and the ''Diêu Trì Kim Mẫu'' or ''Đức Phật Mẫu'' ("Holy Mother"). They represent respectively the yang and yin forces. ''Cao Đài'' is viewed as the heart of the universe, the common Father of all beings. He imparts part of Him into each living being, including even rocks, in the form of conscience. ''Đức Phật Mẫu'' is venerated as the Mother of the universe, responsible for giving visible forms, consciousness and emotions to all life.{{sfn|Oliver|1976|p=8}} Ultimately, She has to follow the orders of "Đức Cao Đài", who is revered as the Supreme Being of both Heaven and Earth.

All other Divine Beings are to obey the orders of these two Creators during the course of evolution of the universe. Each of them carries a specific role as designated by their Father and Mother. Any being who falls out against them is considered devils in nature. These devils are led by the most powerful being, named Kim Quang Sứ (Satan).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In terms of the cosmos, faithful Caodaists believe there are heaven and hell, which are the main destinations for souls after death. Heaven consists of thirty six planes and many heavenly realms upon each of them, e.g. the Realm of Saints, the Realm of the Holy Mother, the Realm of the Perfect Beings, the Divine Court Realm, The Paradise of Extreme Joy, Nirvana, etc. Meanwhile, hell has ten key realms to carry out punishments in accordance with sins of souls.

In order to go to heaven, souls are required to cultivate their virtues and/or devote themselves to spiritual causes. Without merit from the latter, they cannot escape the cycle of birth and death, but can improve their virtues and merit gradually to reach better places in the universe, including the 72 planets (ours is the 68th), the 3,000 worlds, the four great cosmic regions, and the thirty six heavenly planes. True liberation can only be attained when souls reach Nirvana, i.e. the realm of Divine Beings with the most virtues, merits, and wisdom.

===Three-fold revelation===
The father of the universe, Cao Đài, is believed to have communed with men since the beginning of times, revealing his will. According to Cao Đài doctrine, history is divided into three times (''tam kỳ'') of revelation. In the first two periods, there were teachings of [[Dipankara Buddha]], sages, [[Fu Xi|Phục Hy]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Laozi]], [[Confucius]] and [[Jesus]], who received the will of the Highest Power, and founded their respective religions to serve and/ or educate humanity. But due to the frailty of the messengers and the common men, the will of the Highest Power was misled into corrupted forms. Caodaists also believe that former revelations were culture-bound, being applicable only for certain ethnicities, and primarily intended for specific ages. The third and final form of revelation is disclosed through the teachings of the Cao Đài faith.{{sfn|Oliver|1976|p=9}}

===Twelve-fold hierarchy===
Caodaists believe that there are various ranks of divine spirits: ''Thần'' ("angels"), ''Thánh'' ("saints"), ''Tiên'' ("Immortals"), and ''Phật'' ("Buddhas"). Each of these ranks can be further divided in the three grades of ''Thiên'' (Heavenly), ''Nhân'' (Human) and ''Địa'' (Earthly), forming a twelve-fold hierarchy that reflects the twelve-fold earthly hierarchy of the Caodaist church. Below those ranks are the spirits of matters, plants, animals and humans. All spirits may evolve to attain higher rank based on present deeds. Disembodied spirits fulfill a number of roles: they are benefactors of mankind, messengers and instructors of the truth.{{sfn|Oliver|1976|p=10}} [[Guanyin|Quan Âm]] is regarded as the exemplary goddess of the Buddhas, [[Li Bai|Lý Bạch]] of the Immortals, and [[Guan Yu|Quan Vũ]] of the Saints.

Unknown to most outsiders, [[Joan of Arc]] is worshipped in the Cao Đài pantheon. She is seen as having guided the Faith at its inception and promoted full equality for women (via séances).{{sfn|Biederman|2006-01-07}}{{sfn|Hoskins|2015|pp=10; 16–17; 83–85; 135; 241}} The Cao Đài pantheon also has many other well-known figures, including [[Muhammad]], [[Moses]], [[Louis Pasteur]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].{{sfn|Hoskins|2015|pp=83–85}} [[Victor Hugo]] is probably the most important European figure to play a role in the Caodai pantheon, since he gave many teachings and also the text of a number of important prayers. He himself practiced spiritism on the island of Jersey from 1852 to 1855, and predicted that he would become the prophet of a new religion to merge European and Asian mysticism.{{sfn|Hoskins|2015|pp=99–110}} Reports that [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] were also "saints" are based on an inaccurate 1956 ''Time'' magazine article, since both of them were still alive at the time.{{sfn|Hoskins|2015|p=249}}

==Fundamental rules and values==
The [[doctrine]]s of the Cao Đài faith tends not only to reconcile all religious views, but also to adapt itself to all degrees of spiritual evolution. A basic principle of Caodaism is "All Religions are One". Cao Đài has been described from five different points of view:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
# From a moral point of view, Cao Đài Religion reminds people of their duties towards themselves, their family, their society (a broader family), then toward humanity (the universal family).
# From a philosophical point of view, Cao Đài Religion preaches renunciation of honors, riches and luxury, in other words, deliverance from servitude to materialism in the attainment of full spiritual quietude of soul.
# From the point of view of worship, Cao Đài Religion prescribes the adoration of God, the veneration of Divine Beings and the worship of ancestors.
# From a spiritual point of view, Cao Đài Religion confirms, in harmony with other religions, the existence of the spirits and the soul, their survival beyond the physical body, and their evolution by successive [[reincarnation]]s, according to the Karmic Law.
# From the initiates' point of view, Cao Đài Religion communicates to worthy adherents and reveals teachings that enable them, by a process of spiritual evolution, to reach the ecstasies of happiness.

==Worship rituals==
Believers worship God the Father, Holy Mother and the Divine Beings with all their heart. They also venerate the Great Religious Prophets of history and honour the ancestors.

There are four daily ceremonies, that is, at 06:00, Midday, 18:00 and midnight, either at the temple or in front of the home altar. Monthly rituals take place on midnight of the 1st and 15th days of the lunar month. There is also a special anniversary ceremony once a year for God the Father, the Holy Mother, the five founders of the world’s major religions, and the founders of the Cao Dai religion.{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (a)}}
The rituals differ between places, depending on who they pray to.
* At the Holy See: Prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer to the [[Jade Emperor]] (God the Father), prayer to Dipankara Buddha (Buddhism), prayer to Thái Thượng Lão Quân or [[Taishang Laojun]] (Taoism), prayer to Confucius (Confucianism), one of the three jewel offering prayers (flower, wine, and tea), and the five pledges.
* At the Holy Mother temple: Prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer describing the role of the Holy Mother, prayer to express gratitude to the Holy Mother, one the three jewel offering prayers (flower, wine, and tea), and the five pledges.
There are also differences between monthly rituals, and anniversary ones.

Ceremonial prescriptions such as actions, dress and music were organized in detail by God the Father. These include ceremonies for initiations, marriages and funerals. Particular attention is paid to death, and it has been revealed to the religion how the soul journeys towards heaven and how, on earth, co-religionists can pray for souls to help them on their way.{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (a)}}

==Symbols==
Cao Đài temples and religious buildings host a rich array of symbols, all of which are instructed by either God the Father or Divine Beings. No symbol is redundant, and none is meaningless. They each tell a different story that reveals the beliefs, values, cosmic secrets, prophecies, etc. When combined, they lay out the journey of the Tao throughout the history of mankind and the universe, as well as its way forward.

===The Divine Eye===
In spirit and in pictorial representation, the Eye serves to remind Cao Đài believers that the God witnesses everything, everywhere, constantly. At the Holy See, there are in total 50 Divine Eyes of five different shapes; each carrying a different meaning related to various spiritual aspects. The One on the globe shows the Supreme Being above the North Star in the Ursa Minor constellation. The One on the façade of the Holy See has 35 rays of light which represent the three major religions and five main religious doctrines of the world. At the local Cao Đài Temples, the Divine Eye has 16 rays of light emanating from it. Nine radiate upward representing the nine levels of heaven, and seven radiating downward representing the seven emotions, which believers must control.{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (c)}}

===The religious banner and emblem===

In accordance with the religious mission, the three colors of Cao Đài banner represent the three main religions of the world; yellow stands for Buddhism, blue for Taoism, and red for Confucianism. Under the Divine Eye is the religious emblem which also represents the essence of the three religions; the bowl of charity for Buddhist compassion and asceticism, the feather duster for Taoist purification; the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] for Confucianist virtue and love.{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (a)}}

==Holy scriptures==
There are various Caodaist scriptures. Some of those belonging to the Holy See of Tây Ninh are: ''Kinh Thiên Đạo Và Thế Đạo'' ("Prayers of the Heavenly and the Earthly Way"),{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (d)}}{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}} ''Pháp Chánh Truyền'' ("the Religious Constitution of Cao Đài Religion"),{{sfn|Tâm|1996}} ''Tân Luật'' ("The Canonical Codes"), {{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (e)}} and ''Con Đường Thiêng Liêng Hằng Sống'' ("Divine Path to Eternal Life").{{sfn|Hộ-Pháp Phạm Công Tắc}} Other sects have additional scriptures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===The Canonical Codes===
This scripture sets out the rules and boundaries for different aspects of the religion, from a believer to the Pope, from education to marriage, etc. There are ten sections in the scripture with the following content:
# Hierarchy of religious dignitaries
# Initiation and ranks of believers
# Establishment of a parish
# The five interdictions
# The four commandments
# Education
# Sanctions
# Promulgation of laws and regulations
# Secular rules
# The house of meditation

===The Religious Constitution===
The Phap-Chanh-Truyen (The Religious Constitution of Caodaism) was delivered to the religion as a series of divine messages. These are the guiding texts of the religion's organisation, stipulating the authority, responsibility, limits, as well as religious vestment for each rank in the religion.

==Organisational structure==
[[File:Cao Dai temple (Vietnam).jpg|thumb|Inner hall the Tây Ninh Holy See temple.]]
[[File:Cao Dai monks.jpg|thumb|Caodaists worshipping in a temple. Priests are dressed in red, blue and yellow, followers in white.]]
The organisational structure of the Caodaist church has similarities with that of a state. There are similarities between the hierarchy of the Caodaist clergy and that of the [[Catholic Church]]. Besides the [[Pope#In new religious movements|Pope]], the Caodaist hierarchy has Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and further ranks.

Caodaism stresses equality among men and women in society. However, in the spiritual domain, ordained women may not attain the two highest positions: the Legislative Cardinal and the Pope. The church claims this is ordered by the Highest Lord, who declared that because ''Dương'' (Yang) represents male and ''Âm'' (Yin) corresponds to female, Yin cannot dominate Yang spiritually or else chaos ensues.

The Religion is governed by two powers, the spiritual and earthly ones.

The spiritual power (Bát Quái Đài): This is the heavenly council, that is, the Spirit and Soul of the New Religion. The council directs all activities of the universe. The council is the invisible part, made up of the Divine Beings, and directed by Duc Cao Dai (God the Father). The Divine Beings represent different religions of the world, including:
* Founders of five religions: [[Shakyamuni]] (Buddhism), [[Lao Tze]] (Taoism), [[Confucius]] (Confucianism), [[Jesus Christ]] (Christianity), [[Jiang Ziya]] (Geniism).
* Founders and teachers of Caodaism, who represent the doctrines of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism: [[Guanyin]] (Buddhism), [[Li Bai]] (Taoism), [[Guan Yu]] (Confucianism).

The earthly power: To avoid dictatorship, God divided the earthly power into two bodies – an Executive Body (Cửu Trùng Đài) headed by the Pope, and a Legislative Body (Hiệp Thiên Đài) headed by the Hộ Pháp (Protector of Laws and Justice). The former takes charge of the administration of the Religion and its missionary activities, while the latter oversees legislation, jurisdiction and communication with God or Divine Beings. There is also the Charitable Body placed under the supervision of the Legislative Body, and a Lay Committee of selected professional specialists among worthy followers.{{sfn|Sydney Centre of Studies in Caodaism (f)}}

===The Executive Body (Cửu Trùng Đài)===
The ''Cửu Trùng Ðài'' is the Executive Body of Caodaism which takes charge of the administration of the Religion and missionary activities. Head of ''Cửu Trùng Ðài'' is ''Giáo-Tông'' (Pope).
{{quote|The Giáo-Tông (Pope) represents God to watch over the preservation of His Religion in this world. Whatever his age, he is eldest brother and acts as a guide for the children of God. The Spiritual Power has decided that this is so. The Giáo-Tông (Pope) has the same powers as God to teach Virtue to all His Disciples. He is concerned with each one of them, he guides each one and takes care to ensure that each one does not transgress the Divine Laws (Thiên Điều). He obliges all disciples of God to conform strictly to the prescriptions of the New Codes (Tân Luật)... Since the Giáo-Tông (Pope) has full powers to replace God he must try to transform the life of suffering into an existence marked by happiness. This is the Exalted Task of the Giáo-Tông (Pope).{{sfn|Tâm|1996}}}}

There are nine ranks in its hierarchy:
* One Pope
* Three Censor Cardinals
* Three Cardinals
* Thirty six Archbishops
* Seventy two Bishops
* Three thousand Priests
* Student Priest (no limit)
* Subdignitaries (no limit)
* Followers (no limit)

For male dignitaries of the Executive Body, from the rank of Censor Cardinal to that of Student Priest, each echelon is subdivided into three branches corresponding to the three principal religions:
* Buddhist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in yellow.
* Taoist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in azure.
* Confucianist Branch: These dignitaties are dressed in red.
Dignitaries of the same echelon, either Confucianist, Taoist or Buddhist, have the same attributes.

At the Holy See, there are three governing councils:
* The Popular Council: composed of Student Priests, Sub-dignitaries and representatives of adherents in the ratio of one delegate per 500 members. The Popular Council makes plans for the future.
* The Sacerdotal Council: composed of Priests, Bishops, Archbishops and Principal Archbishops. The Sacerdotal Council examines the plans made by the Popular Council.
* The High Council: composed of Cardinals, Legislative Body Cardinals and the Pope.
All plans made by the Popular Council and favoured by the Sacerdotal Council are submitted to High Council for approval.

In addition, there is also a Central Administration body chaired by three Cardinals. Each of them is assisted by three Principal Archbishops to oversee three religious ministries:
* The Principal Archbishops of the Buddhist branch take care of finances, supply, and public works.
* The Principal Archbishops of the Taoist branch take care of education, health, and agriculture.
* The Principal Archbishops of the Confucianist branch take care of interior, rites, and justice.

The administrative network which functions throughout Vietnam consists of:
* The Religious Region (''Trấn Đạo'') comprising several provinces, headed by a Bishop who is called the Regional Religious Chief/ Khâm Trấn Đạo.
* The Religious Province (''Châu Đạo'') comprising several districts/delegations, headed by a Priest who is called Provincial Religious Chief/ Khâm Châu Đạo.
* The Religious District (''Họ Đạo'') comprising several villages, headed by a Student Priest who is called the Religious Chief of Delegation (''Đầu Tộc Đạo/ Đầu Họ Đạo/ Đầu Phận Đạo'').
* The Religious Village (''Hương Đạo'') headed by a Sub-dignitary who is called Village Religious Chief (''Đầu Hương Đạo''). He is assisted by one (or more) ''Phó Trị Sự'' (Deputy Chief for Administration of a religious village) representing the Executive Body and one (or more) ''Thông Sự'' representing the Legislative Body. The Religious Village is made up of Religious Hamlets (''Ấp Đạo'').{{sfn|Sydney Centre of Studies in Caodaism (f)}}

===The Legislative Body (Hiệp Thiên Đài)===
This Body has the duty of communicating with Divine Beings, to preserve the religious laws and listen to the complaints of the unhappy. It is headed by the ''Hộ Pháp'' (protector of laws and justice), and assisted by the ''Thượng Phẩm'' (Director of religious affairs) and ''Thượng Sanh'' (Director of secular affairs).
* ''Hộ-Pháp'' (護法) (The head of Legislative Body Affairs), is the one who unveils the Mystery of the Invisible and is the Maintainer of the Rules and Laws of the New Religion. He is the one who pronounces judgments on the dignitaries and adepts, elevates the dignity of the fervent through their merit and brings sanctions against those who have committed faults. The Hộ-Pháp holds control over the Legislative Body Power both exoterically and esoterically. He watches over the positive progress of the disciples in the Way of God, and guides all evolved souls to Bát-Quái-Đài for the union with Angels, Saints, Immortals and Buddhas.
* ''Thượng-Phẩm'' (上品) (The head of Religious Affairs), is the Representative of the Ho-Phap in the formation of virtuous souls of the Sacerdotal Council. He depends on the Hộ-Pháp in all his missions. In a word, the Thượng-Phẩm helps the Cửu Trùng Đài to live in an atmosphere of happiness; he reveals the Heavenly Voice to virtuous souls, and guides them to the Divine Phase of the Great Spirits, while closing behind them the door of regression. He considers the priestly laws to take up the defence of all office-bearers and adepts; he prevents all perversion of the Divine Rules, and helps all initiates to attain their aim. He is simultaneously the President of the Hall of Defence and protector of all disciples. The Thượng-Phẩm is "Leader of the Spiritual Power".
* ''Thượng–Sanh'' (上生) (The head of Secular Affairs), has control of all the laws and rules which relate to the worldly life of all adepts to guide them out of the sea of sufferings. He may present a formal complaint before the religious Tribunal against all those who impede the faithful as they move along the Way of God. He is the President of the Hall of Accusation.

Four "zodiacal dignitaries" under each of these branches carry the four key responsibilities of conservation, renovation, reformation, and legislation. They are further assisted by twelve technical academicians, including Bảo Huyền Linh Quân (Theosophy), Bảo Tinh Quân (Astronomy), Bảo Cô Quân (Orphanage), Bảo Văn pháp quân (Culture), Bảo Học Quân (Education), Bảo Y Quân (Health), Bảo Vật Quân (Science and Industry, Bảo Sĩ Quân (Literature), Bảo Sanh Quân (Social work), Bảo Nông Quân (Agriculture), Bảo Công Quân (Public Works), [[Bảo Thương Quân]] (Economics).{{sfn|Sydney Centre of Studies in Caodaism (f)}}

==Community structure==
Any local area having more than 500 believers is authorized to establish a Parish (Họ Đạo/ Tộc Đạo) with a Thánh-Thất (Temple, Church, Holy House) which is led by the authority of a dignitary.
Parish/Parishes can be established only with the permission and authority of the Giao-Tong/ Pope.

Twice a month, the first and the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, the believers must meet at the Thánh-Thất (Temple, Holy House) of the local area to attend the ceremony and listen to the teachings. Exception can be made for those with reasonable excuses{{sfn|Sydney Centre for Studies in Caodaism (e)}}

==The Holy See==
Ninety kilometres north-west of Saigon in Tây-Ninh Province is the Caodaist Holy See. At the centre of this city stands the Great Divine Temple. This temple, like the religion, is a fusion of world influences. As well as being a major centre of pilgrimage, the Caodaist Holy See is also one of Vietnam's major tourist attractions.{{sfn|Tam|2000}}

==Branches==
In total, there are six different officially recognized branches of the Caodaist religion in southern Vietnam, as well as several others that remain unrecognized. These sects generally divide along geographic lines. The largest is based in Tây Ninh Province, where the religion was founded in 1926 and where the seat of the Caodaist authority is located.

The Caodaist Executive Council of Tây Ninh Province received official government recognition in 1997. Independent Caodaist groups allege that government interference has undermined the independence of the Tây Ninh group, and it no longer faithfully upholds ''Cao Đài'''s principles and traditions. Religious training takes place at individual temples rather than at centralized seminaries. Some Caodaist sects that have broken away from the Tây Ninh Holy See are Chiếu Minh, Bến Tre, and Đà Nẵng. Ngô Văn Chiêu founded Chiếu Minh when he left the original church structure, refusing his appointment as Caodaism's first pope.

[[File:Inscrição dos sacerdotes arvais.jpg|alt=Inscription of the Carmen Arvale|thumb|Inscription of the ''Carmen Arvale'']]
The '''''Carmen Arvale''''' is the preserved chant of the [[Arval priest]]s or ''[[Fratres Arvales]]'' of ancient [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, L.R. (1954) [repr. 2001] ''The Latin Language'' (London: Bristol Classical Press) 62-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arval priests were devoted to the [[goddess]] [[Dia (mythology)|Dia]], and offered sacrifices to her to ensure the [[fertility rite|fertility]] of ploughed fields ([[Latin]] ''arvum'').  There were twelve Arval priests, chosen from [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] families.  During the [[Roman Empire]] the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] was always an Arval priest.  They retained the office for life, even if disgraced or exiled.  Their most important festival, the [[Ambarvalia]], occurred during the month of May, in a grove dedicated to Dia.

The ''Carmen Arvale'' is preserved in an inscription dating from 218 AD which contains records of the meetings of the Arval Brethren. It is written in an archaic form of [[Old Latin]], likely not fully understood any more at the time the inscription was made.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1954) ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its interpretations goes as follows:{{refn|group=note|The inscription itself contains no spaces, the following transcription may therefore not reflect the original text. An image of the carving can be found in Baldi (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Baldi, P. (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=baldi+%22carmen+arvale%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_i0DFxrECZ&amp;sig=_LNAGKGL-xzTNBKJgpxk-dazc20&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=V9NWTNTTH6eHOKfSqZ8O&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ The foundations of Latin] - Foreign Language Study.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While passages of this text are obscure, the traditional interpretation makes the chant a prayer to seek aid of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the [[Lares]] (''lases''), beseeching Mars not to let plagues or disasters overtake in the fields, asking him to be satiated, and dance, and call forth the "Semones", who may represent sacred sowers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic de Forest Allen]], ''Remnants of Early Latin'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Heath 1880 and Ginn &amp; Co 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;  (Cf. [[Semo Sancus]], a god of good faith.) [[Semones]] are minor [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]], in particular [[Sancus]], [[Priapus]], [[Faunus]], all [[Vertumnus|Vertumni]], all [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvani]], [[Bona Dea]].&lt;ref&gt;Semo Sancus has no known relation to agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt;The semones are probably the hidden life forces residing in seeds: they were presented only offers of milk in the earliest tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Dahrenberg et Saglio ''Dictionnaire des antiquités grecques et romaines'' s.v. Semo Sancus; U. Pestalozza ''Iuno Caprotina'' in "Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni" 1934 p. 64, citing [[Nonius Marcellus]] ''De Compendiosa Doctrina'' (Müller) I p. 245: "Rumam veteres dixerunt mammam. Varro ''Cato'' vel ''De liberis educandis'': dis Semonibus lacte fit, non vino; Cuninae propter cunis, Ruminae propter rumam, id est, prisco vocabulo, mammam...".&lt;/ref&gt;

''limen sali, sta'' means ''jump over the beam of the threshold/door/lintel, stand'' in standard Latin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lubotsky, M. De Vaan ''Etymological Dictionary of Latin and The Other Italic Languages'' Leiden 2008, p. 342 s.v. limen.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carmilla''''' is a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novel]]la by Irish author [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]] and one of the early works of [[vampire fiction]], predating [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) by 26 years. First published as a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] in ''[[The Dark Blue]]'' (1871–72),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Fanu |first=Sheridan |date=1871-72 |title=Carmilla |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra82AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=The Dark Blue |volume=2 |issue=September 1871 to February 1872 |pages=434-448, 592-606, 701-714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Fanu |first=Sheridan |date=1872 |title=Carmilla |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUgxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=the+dark+blue+fanu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkvL_Qvv3dAhXilOAKHVbfBm0Q6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=The Dark Blue |volume=3 |issue=March |pages=59-78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the story is narrated by a young woman preyed upon by a female [[vampire]] named Carmilla, later revealed to be Mircalla, Countess Karnstein (Carmilla is an anagram of Mircalla). The character is a prototypical example of the [[lesbian vampire]], expressing romantic desires toward the protagonist, and is depicted as a trait of antagonism inline with the contemporary views of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="KEESEY"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keesey, Pam |date=1993|title=Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Vampire Stories|publisher= Cleis|isbn= 0-939416-78-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEXUALITY"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7342924/Female_Sexuality_as_Vampiric_in_Le_Fanu_s_Carmilla|title=Female Sexuality as Vampiric in Le Fanu’s Carmilla|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is often [[Anthology|anthologized]] and has been adapted many times in film and other media.

==Publication==
''Carmilla'', serialized in the literary magazine ''The Dark Blue'' in late 1871 and early 1872,&lt;ref&gt;The story ran in one issue of 1871 (December, pp. 434–448) and in three issues of 1872 (January, pp. 592–606; February, pp. 701–714; and March, pp. 59–78).&lt;/ref&gt; was reprinted in Le Fanu's short story collection ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'' (1872). Comparing the work of two [[illustrators]] to the story, [[David Henry Friston]], with that of Michael Fitzgerald, whose work appears in the magazine article, but not in modern printings of the book, reveals inconsistencies in the characters' depictions. Consequently, confusion has arisen relating the pictures to the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haslam|first=Richard|date=September 1, 2011|title=Theory, empiricism, and "providential hermeneutics": reading and misreading Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla and "Schalke the painter"|url=http://up7af9tu5s.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Theory%2C+empiricism%2C+and+%27providential+hermeneutics%27%3A+reading+and+misreading+Sheridan+Le+Fanu%27s+Carmilla+and+Schalken+the+Painter&amp;rft.jtitle=Papers+on+Language+%26+Literature%3A+a+quarterly+journal+for+scholars+and+critics+of+language+and+literature+%28Southern+Illinois+Univ.%2C+Edwardsville%29&amp;rft.au=Haslam%2C+Richard&amp;rft.date=2011&amp;rft.issn=0031-1294&amp;rft.volume=47&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=339&amp;rft.externalDocID=R04619526&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Papers on Language &amp; Literature|volume=47, 4|pages=339-362|via=OmniFile Full Text Select (H.W.

==Plot summary==
Le Fanu presents the story as part of the casebook of Dr. Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first [[occult detective]] in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=gwthomas.org|url=http://www.gwthomas.org/hesselius.htm|title=Dr Martin Hesselius|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113160200/http://www.gwthomas.org/hesselius.htm|archivedate=2009-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laura, the teenage protagonist, narrates, beginning with her childhood in a "picturesque and solitary" castle amid an extensive forest in [[Styria]], where she lives with her father, a wealthy [[English people|English]] widower retired from service to the [[Austrian Empire]]. When she was six, Laura had a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been punctured in her breast, although no wound was found.

Twelve years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter from his friend, General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.

Laura, saddened by the loss of a potential friend, longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the "dream" they both had when they were young.

Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves, she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past, or herself, and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.

Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself, despite questioning by Laura. Her secrecy is not the only mysterious thing about Carmilla; she never joins the household in its prayers, she sleeps much of the day, and she seems to sleepwalk outside at night.

Meanwhile, young women and girls in the nearby towns have begun dying from an unknown malady. When the funeral procession of one such victim passes by the two girls, Laura joins in the funeral hymn. Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura, complaining that the hymn hurts her ears.

When a shipment of restored [[heirloom]] paintings arrives, Laura finds a portrait of her ancestor, Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck. Carmilla suggests that she might be descended from the Karnsteins even though the family died out centuries before.

During Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares of a large cat-like beast entering her room. The beast springs onto the bed and Laura feels something like two needles, an inch or two apart, darting deep into her breast. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. In another nightmare, Laura hears a voice say, "Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin," and a sudden light reveals Carmilla standing at the foot of her bed, her nightdress drenched in blood. Laura's health declines, and her father has a doctor examine her. He finds a small blue spot, an inch or two below her collar, where the creature in her dream bit her, and speaks privately with her father, only asking that Laura never be unattended.

Her father then sets out with Laura, in a carriage, for the ruined village of Karnstein, three miles distant. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses to follow once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla awakes. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story:

At a costume ball, Spielsdorf and his niece Bertha had met a beautiful young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother. Bertha was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.

[[Image:Fitzgerald, funeral from Carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Funeral'', illustration by Michael Fitzgerald for ''Carmilla'' in ''The Dark Blue'' (January 1872)]]

Bertha fell mysteriously ill, suffering the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially-ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid with a sword and waited until a large black creature of undefined shape crawled onto his niece's bed and spread itself onto her throat. He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the creature, which had then taken the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died before the morning dawned.

Upon arriving at Karnstein, the General asks a woodman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodman says the tomb was relocated long ago by the hero, a Moravian nobleman, who vanquished the vampires that haunted the region.

While the General and Laura are alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other, and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla disarms the General and disappears. The General explains that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.

The party is joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died and became one of the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An Imperial Commission exhumes the body of  Mircalla/Millarca/Carmilla. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.

Afterward, Laura's father takes his daughter on a year-long tour through Italy to regain her health and recover from the trauma, which she never fully does.

==Sources==
[[File:Dom Augustin Calmet.jpeg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Dom Calmet]].]]
As with ''[[Dracula]]'', critics have looked for the sources used in the writing of ''Carmilla''. One source used was from a dissertation on magic, vampires and the apparitions of spirits written by [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Dom Augustin Calmet]] entitled ''[[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, %26c. | Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenants de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.]]'' (1751). This is evidenced by a report analyzed by Calmet, from a priest who learned information of a town being tormented by a vampiric entity three years earlier. Having traveled to the town to investigate and collecting information of the various inhabitants there, the priest learned that a vampire had tormented many of the inhabitants at night by coming from the nearby cemetery and would haunt many of the residents on their beds. An unknown Hungarian traveler came to the town during this period and helped the town by setting a trap at the cemetery and decapitating the vampire that resided there, curing the town of their torment. This story was retold by LeFanu and adapted into the thirteenth chapter of Carmilla &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LeFanu|first1=J. Sheridan|title=Carmilla: Annotated with Notes|date=2016|isbn=978-1-5394-0617-4|pages=114–115;146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Calmet, Antoine Augustin|date=1746|url=https://archive.org/details/dissertationssu00conggoog |title=Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des demons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Boheme, de Moravie, et de Silesie|location=Paris|publisher= De Bure l'aîné|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

According to Matthew Gibson, [[Sabine Baring-Gould|the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s ''The Book of Were-wolves'' (1863) and his account of [[Elizabeth Báthory]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' (Part 1, 1797 and Part 2, 1800), and Captain [[Basil Hall]]'s ''[[Schloss]] [[Leitersdorf im Raabtal|Hainfeld]]; or a Winter in [[Lower Styria]]'' (London and Edinburgh, 1836) are other sources for Le Fanu's ''Carmilla''. Hall's account provides much of the Styrian background and, in particular, a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure of [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|Jane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibson, Matthew |url=http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html |title=Jane Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall: A Possible Inspiration for Le Fanu's ''Carmilla'' |journal=Le Fanu Studies |date=November 2007 |issn=1932-9598 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304171734/http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html |archivedate=2009-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gibson, Matthew |date=2006|title=Dracula and the Eastern Question: British and French Vampire Narratives of the Nineteenth-century Near East|isbn=1-4039-9477-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Carmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female and [[lesbian vampire]]s. Though Le Fanu portrays his vampire's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the circumspection that one would expect for his time, it is evident that [[lesbian]] attraction is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:&lt;ref name="KEESEY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SEXUALITY" /&gt;

{{quotation|Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "You are mine, you ''shall'' be mine, and you and I are one for ever." (''Carmilla'', Chapter 4).}}

When compared to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had [[nocturnal]] habits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in ''Dracula''. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. ''Carmilla'' works as a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Auerbach |first=Nina |title=Our Vampires, Ourselves |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1995 |location= |page=42 |isbn= 0-2260-3202-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, among them [[William Veeder]], suggest that ''Carmilla'', notably in its outlandish use of narrative frames, was an important influence on [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1898).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veeder|first1=William|title=Carmilla: The Art of Repression|date=1980|publisher=University of Texas Press|edition=Vol. 22, No. 2|jstor=40754606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''===
Although ''Carmilla'' is a lesser known and far shorter [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] vampire story than the generally considered master work of that genre, ''Dracula'', the latter is heavily influenced by Le Fanu's novella. Stoker's posthumously published [[short story]] "[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]" (1914), known as the deleted first chapter to ''Dracula'', shows a more obvious and intact debt to ''Carmilla'':
* In the narrative, an Englishman finds himself in Germany midway upon his journey from England to the castle of Dracula; stumbles upon a tomb of a female vampire whose inscription reads: Countess Dolingen of Gratz / in Styria / sought and found death / 1801. 
* Both stories are told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]]. ''Dracula'' expands on the idea of a first person account by creating a series of journal entries and logs of different persons and creating a plausible background story for their having been compiled. 
* Both authors indulge the air of mystery, though Stoker takes it further than Le Fanu by allowing the characters to solve the enigma of the vampire along with the reader.
* The descriptions of the title character in ''Carmilla'' and of Lucy in ''Dracula'' are similar, and have become archetypes for the appearance of the waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being rosy-cheeked, slender, languid, and with large eyes, full lips, and soft voices.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Additionally, both women [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]].
*Stoker's Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a direct parallel to Le Fanu's vampire expert Baron Vordenburg: both characters used to investigate and catalyse actions in opposition to the vampire, and symbolically represent knowledge of the unknown and stability of mind in the onslaught of chaos and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Fanu, J.S.|author=Sullivan, Jack (Editor)|work=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural|page= 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Books===
(alphabetical by author's last name)
* In the Japanese [[light novel]] series ''[[High School DxD]]'', written by [[Ichiei Ishibumi]] and illustrated by [[Miyama-Zero]], the vampires are depicted as having a society divided among two major factions: The Tepes and the Carmilla. The Carmilla faction favors a matriarchal society for the world of vampires while the Tepes prefer a patriarchal government.
* ''Carmilla: A Dark Fugue'' is a short book by David Brian. Although the story is primarily centered around the exploits of General Spielsdorf, it nonetheless relates directly to events which unfold within ''Carmilla: The Wolves of Styria''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
* The novel ''Carmilla: The Wolves of Styria'' is a re-imagining of the original story. It is a derivative re-working, listed as being authored by [[J.S.

*[[Ro McNulty]]'s novella, ''Ruin: The Rise of the House of Karnstein,'' is a sequel to Le  Fanu's novella and takes place over 100 years later. Carmilla continues to play games with mortals, inserting herself into their lives and breaking them to her will. She settles herself around a teacher and his family, feeding on his baby daughter.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 
* A vampire named Baron Karnstein appears in [[Kim Newman]]'s novel ''[[Anno Dracula series#Anno Dracula|Anno Dracula]]'' (1992). Carmilla herself is mentioned several times as a former (until her death at the hands of vampire hunters) friend of the book's vampire heroine Geneviève. Some short stories set in the Anno Dracula series universe have also included Carmilla.
* Author [[Anne Rice]] has cited ''Carmilla'' as an inspiration for ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', her ongoing series beginning in 1976 with ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]''.
* Christopher Thomason identified ''Carmilla'' as a key influence for his 2015 novel ''For The Want Of Beauty.''

===Comics===
(alphabetical by series title)
* In 1991, Aircel Comics published a six-issue black and white miniseries of ''Carmilla'' by Steven Jones and [[John Ross (artist)|John Ross]]. It was based on Le Fanu's story and billed as "The Erotic Horror Classic of Female Vampirism". The first issue was printed in February 1991. The first three issues adapted the original story, while the latter three were a sequel set in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fuziondigital.com/SPJ/creditscomics.htm |author=Jones, Steven Philip |title=Previous Credits in comics |website=Fuzi On Digital |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062031/http://fuziondigital.com/SPJ/creditscomics.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=28117 |website=The Grand Comics Database Team|title= Carmilla (1991 Series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
(chronological)
* [[Danes|Danish]] director [[Carl Dreyer]] loosely adapted ''Carmilla'' for his film ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932) but deleted any references to lesbian sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grant |first=Barry Keith |authorlink= |last2=Sharrett |first2=Christopher |author2-link= |title=Planks of Reason: Essays on the Horror Film |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |location= |page=73 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=QHg7m_ESR54C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-8108-5013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credits of the original film say that the film is based on ''In a Glass Darkly''. This collection contains five tales, one of which is ''Carmilla''. Actually the film draws its central character, Allan Gray, from Le Fanu's Dr. Hesselius; and the scene in which Gray is buried alive is drawn from "The Room in the Dragon Volant".
* [[French people|French]] director [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Blood and Roses|Et mourir de plaisir]]'' (literally ''And to die of pleasure'', but actually shown in the UK and US as ''Blood and Roses'', 1960) is based on ''Carmilla'' and is considered one of the greatest of the vampire genre. The Vadim film thoroughly explores the lesbian implications behind Carmilla's selection of victims, and boasts cinematography by [[Claude Renoir]]. The film's lesbian eroticism was however significantly cut for its US release. [[Mel Ferrer]] stars in the film.
* A more-or-less faithful adaptation starring [[Christopher Lee]] was produced in Italy in 1963 under the title ''[[La cripta e l'incubo]]'' (''Crypt of the Vampire'' in English). The character of Laura is played by Adriana Ambesi, who fears herself possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor.
* The British [[Hammer Film Productions]] also produced a fairly faithful adaptation of ''Carmilla'' titled ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970) with [[Ingrid Pitt]] in the lead role, [[Madeline Smith]] as her victim/lover, and Hammer's regular [[Peter Cushing]]. It is the first installment of the [[Karnstein Trilogy]].
* ''[[The Blood Spattered Bride]]'' (''La Novia Ensangrentada'') is a 1972 Spanish [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Vicente Aranda]], is based on the text. The film has reached cult status for its mix of horror, vampirism and seduction with lesbian overtones.
* ''Carmilla'' (1980) is a black-and-white made-for-television adaptation from Poland, starring singer [[Izabela Trojanowska]] in the title role and Monika Stefanowicz as Laura.
* The 2000 Japanese anime film ''[[Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]]'' features Carmilla "the Bloody Countess" as its primary antagonist. Having been slain by Dracula for her vain and gluttonous tyranny, Carmilla's ghost attempts to use the blood of a virgin to bring about her own resurrection. She was voiced by [[Julia Fletcher]] in English and Beverly Maeda in Japanese.
* In the direct-to-video movie, ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'' (2005), Carmilla Karnstein is mentioned as [[Count Dracula]]'s bride, who had been incinerated by sunlight years ago. Dracula hoped to revive her by sacrificing [[Vicki Vale]]'s soul, but the ritual was stopped by the [[Batman]].
* The book is directly referenced several times in the 2011 film, ''[[The Moth Diaries (film)|The Moth Diaries]]'', the film version of [[Rachel Klein (novelist)|Rachel Klein's]] novel. There are conspicuous similarities between the characters in "Carmilla" and those in the film, and the book figures into the film's plot. 
* Carmilla is featured as the main antagonist in the movie ''[[Lesbian Vampire Killers]]'' (2009), a comedy starring [[Paul McGann]] and [[James Corden]], with [[Silvia Colloca]] as Carmilla.
* ''[[The Unwanted]]'' (2014) from writer/director Brent Wood relocates the story to the contemporary southern United States. 
* ''The Curse of Styria'' (2014), alternately titled ''Angels of Darkness'' is an adaptation of the novel set in late 1980s with [[Julia Pietrucha]] as Carmilla and [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Lara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1764614/ |author=IMDB |title= Styria (2014) |website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also the first director for Hillel in the state of Florida at the [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville and [[Florida State College for Women]] in Tallahassee.

In 1941, Eichhorn enlisted in the [[Army]] as a [[Military Chaplain|chaplain]].

He was also the president of the Association of Jewish Chaplains of the Armed Forces from 1953–1955.  He retired from the military with the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in 1968.

{{clarify|reason=may need clean-up. This should be more about Eichhorn, less about Temple Israel unless he made the decisions/took the action, etc.|date=September 2014}}
Temple Israel was founded in about 1965 or 66. It met in a church in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]] until a permanent home was found. Land was purchased on [[Merritt Island, Florida]].

The '''{{lang|la|Fanum Voltumnae}}''' (‘[[shrine]] of [[Voltumna]]’) was the chief [[sanctuary]] of the [[Etruscans]]; ''[[fanum]]'' means a sacred place, a much broader notion than a single temple.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[temenos]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous sources refer to a [[Etruscan civilization#Etruscan League|league]] of the “Twelve Peoples” (''[[lucumonies]]'') of [[Etruria]], formed for religious purposes but evidently having some political functions. The Etruscan league of twelve city-states met annually at the Fanum, located in a place chosen as [[omphalos]] (sacred navel), the geographical and spiritual centre of the whole Etruscan nation. Each spring political and religious leaders from the cities would meet to discuss military campaigns and civic affairs and pray to their common gods. Chief amongst these was Voltumna (or [[Veltha]]), possibly state god of the [[Etruria]].

Roman historian [[Titus Livius]] mentioned the Fanum Voltumnae five times in his works&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe condita,'' IV, 23, 25, 61; V, 17, VI, 2. The events are referred, respectively to the years 434, 433, 405, 397 and 389 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicated "...''apud Volsinios''..." as the place where the shrine was located. Modern historians have been looking for the Fanum since at least the 15th century  but the exact location of the shrine is still unknown, though it may have been in an area near modern [[Orvieto]], believed by many to be the ancient [[Volsinii]].  Livy describes the meetings that took place at the Fanum between Etruscan leaders. Livy refers in particular to a meeting in which two groups applied to assist the city of [[Veii]] in a war it was waging. The council's answer was no, because Veii had declared war without first notifying it. Livy also says that Roman merchants who travelled to a huge fair attached to the meeting acted as spies, reporting back on Etruscan affairs to authorities in the city-state of Rome. Livy was alone in mentioning the god [[Voltumna]], whereas [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] indicated a god-prince of Etruria. The Latin elegiac poet [[Propertius]] writes of an Etruscan god taken to Rome from [[Velzna]] (the town of [[Orvieto]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altatuscia.info/2010/07/etruria-fanum-voltumnae.html |title=L'Etruria ed il Fanum Voltumnae |website=Alta Tuscia, Terra Antica |language=Italian |date=5 July 2010 |accessdate=2015-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818005457/http://www.altatuscia.info/2010/07/etruria-fanum-voltumnae.html |archivedate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That the Fanum was somewhere in [[central Italy]] in the area between Orvieto and [[Viterbo]] is probable enough, but as Livy gave no clue to its locality, and as no inscriptions have thrown light on the subject, at the current time it can be but pure conjecture to assign to it this or that particular site.

==Hypotheses==

===Orvieto===
The most credited hypothesis places the shrine in Orvieto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vetralla Pictures |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uf10DPYBFA&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Fanum Voltumnae? |publisher=YouTube |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Urbs Vetus'' of the [[Middle Ages]] is identified with the Etruscan [[Velzna]] by scholars, the Latin [[Volsinii]], conquered by the Romans in 264 BC. [[Livy]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Florus]], [[Horace]], [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]], all belonging to the 2nd century BC, clearly speak of ancient Volsinii, but never in relation to the Fanum Voltumnae. In the late 19th-century archaeologists uncovered parts of the walls and found large quantities of earthenware, and based on these findings in 1930s the archeologist Geralberto Buccolini set out the hypothesis that the Fanum was situated at the foot of Orvieto's [[tuff]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://storiaromana.blogspot.com/2008/04/orvieto-emerge-dagli-scavi-il-fanum.html Francesco Scanagatta, "Orvieto:  emerge dagli scavi il Fanum Voltumnae"] (in Italian) 22 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the Temple of Belvedere was discovered and identified as the Temple of [[Nortia]].

In September 2006, Simonetta Stopponi, professor of Italic [[Archaeology]] and [[Etruscology]] at [[University of Macerata|Macerata University]] (Italy), after extensive digs (begun in 2000 and financed by the [[Banca Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena|Monte dei Paschi di Siena Bank]], with ministerial permission) at a site near the hill town of Orvieto ([[esplanade]] ''Arcone'', former ''Campo della Fiera'', smallholding ''Giardino della Regina'') announced that the site at the feet of the [[Umbrian]] town probably was the location of the Fanum Voltumnae.&lt;ref&gt;David Willey, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7028330.stm Ancient world treasure unearthed.] 4 October 2007 bbc.co.uk (Stopponi, also spelled Stoppani)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-archaeology.com/features/fanum-voltumnae-parliament-of-the-etruscan-league.htm Fanum Voltumnae: Parliament of the Etruscan League.] World Archaeology 2007 Issue 26&lt;/ref&gt; "It has all the characteristics of a very important shrine, and of that shrine in particular" she said.

Listing some of those characteristics, she mentioned "the scale of the construction, its intricate structure and layout, the presence of wells and fountains and the central temple building".

Structures of various periods have been identified, distributed over a very large area (a retaining wall in polygonal masonry, a paved street, etc.), and many fragments of architectural [[terracottas]] have been recovered (among which are some similar to those in Berlin), datable from Late Archaic period to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]]. Also supporting the claim that this is the Fanum Voltumnae is the fact that the area was used continuously for religious purposes right from the 6th century BC up to the 15th century. Roman temples were built on it in later centuries and the last church was erected there in the 12th century.

In November 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adnkronos.com/intrattenimento/cultura/2014/11/20/trovata-orvieto-testa-del-dio-degli-etruschi_jH9urNOXaUjPwDoDLnFDfO.html |title=Trovata a Orvieto la testa del Dio degli Etruschi |work=adnkronos |language=Italian |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Stopponi announced finding a head of the god of the Etruscans in the area of Orvieto. It is a polychrome terracotta male head. "The head is very nice and well kept - said Professor Stopponi - An important discovery as well as that of the temple which measures 12 feet by 18". A main temple and a sacred way have also been excavated.

===Bagnoregio===
Some modern scholars have hypothesized that the location of Fanum Voltumnae was at [[Bagnoregio]] (probably on the hill of [[Civita di Bagnoregio]]), past possession of Orvieto and Etruscan walled town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tuscia.rgpsoft.it/2010/06/ritrovamenti-etruschi-bagnoregio.html |title=Ritrovamenti Etruschi a Bagnoregio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuscania===
Before the discoveries in the Orvieto area, the archaeological site of [[Guado Cinto]], a [[necropolis]] including the ''Tomb of the Queen'' near [[Tuscania]], was one of the most credited locations of Fanum Voltumnae.

===Viterbo===
This hypothesis, presented in the 1950s by [[Mario Signorelli]] (1905-1990), an Italian music teacher, identified the sacred wood of the Etruscans in the peripheral areas of [[Viterbo]] named ''Riello'' and ''Macchia grande''. This area was central to the sacred wood, protected by four guardian towns which prevented it from being disclosed to the profane. The four towns were: Ferente (i.e. [[Ferentium]]), Axia (i.e. [[Castel d'Asso]]), Vrcle (Orcla, the centre of today's [[Norchia]]), Luserna (i.e. [[Musarna]]). The works of Signorelli followed the writings of the fifteenth-century forger [[Annio da Viterbo]] (1432–1502), who devoted his life to collecting legends and traditions ascribed to the Etruscans, and to inventing documents to support his histories.

Viterbo's heraldic badges are surrounded by the letters FAVL (read as FAUL), which appear like a ciphered globe. It is unclear what they refer to, but some claim that they are the initials of the guardian towns and some others that they are in reference to the initial [[syllables]] of Fanum Voltumnae. The latter was affirmed  in the nineteenth century by Francesco Orioli, who also surmised that the [[Viterbo Cathedral]] was built on the site of the Fanum, in the Roman settlement [[Castrum Herculis]]. Viterbo, inasmuch as it contains a church named [[Santa Maria in Volturna]], may be considered as having some claims to the Fanum.

===Montefiascone===
[[Annio of Viterbo]], in his 17 volumes of ''Antiquities'' (published in 1498) attributed the foundation of the Etruscan Fanum Voltumnae to the ancient population known as [[Falisci]] (allies of the Etruscans, along with [[Capenates]], at the time of the wars between Rome and Veii, 406–396 BC). The town [[Montefiascone]] was named after them (''Mons Faliscorum'', that is, Mountain of the [[Falisci]]). The British explorer [[George Dennis (explorer)|George Dennis]], though without any documentary evidence, supported Montefiascone as the sacred site where the states of the Etruscan league met periodically to discuss  military and political affairs and choose a ''lucumo'' (the equivalent of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'').

===Latera===
In spring 1988, news was published that Fanum Voltumnae was at last discovered on the volcanic [[ridge]] of [[Lake Bolsena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stampalternativa.it/wordpress/2010/03/04/voltumnia-alla-ricerca-del-tempio-perduto |title=Voltumnia: alla ricerca del tempio perduto : Fronte della comunicazione |website=Stampalternativa.it |language=Italian |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hill (633 m a.s.l.), known as ''Poggio Evangelista'' (commune of [[Latera]]), retains the ruins of a temple, visibly located on a strategic place, with a wide view over [[Umbria]], Lazio and [[Tuscany]] (Berlingo and Timperi, 1995). It is likely a sacred Etruscan place of worship dating back to the 6th – 4th centuries BC.

===Valentano===
In 1976 and 1977, [[Denmark|Danish]] excavations were carried out at ''Monte Becco'' (at 556&amp;nbsp;m a.s.l.), in the area of [[Valentano]], near to the [[Lake Mezzano]] (ancient Lacus Statoniensis).&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, 1979–1980&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of the Etruscan presence, including walls, bronze tools, and roof tiles were found during the study mission. One of the tiles was found to be incised with all the characters of the Etruscan [[alphabet]]. This site has been also indicated as one of the possible locations of the Fanum.

===Bolsena===
This hypothesis is supported by Angelo Timperi, inspector and archeologist of ''[http://www.etruriameridionale.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/1/home Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici dell'Etruria Meridionale]'', with roles and responsibilities for the eastern side of Lake Bolsena and the archaeological area of ''Poggio Moscini'' in [[Bolsena]]. His idea is that Fanum Voltumnae was a large area centred on the ancient Etruscan, and later Roman town of [[Velzna]], situated on the shore of ''Lacus Volsiniensis'' (modern [[Lake Bolsena]]). This conclusion is based on both archaeological and epigraphical discoveries, also supported by stratigraphic reconstructions and archival records.&lt;ref&gt;Timperi, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Lorenzo Nuovo===
Another hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Pelosi and Fortunati, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the federal shrine of the Etruscans was located to the northern coast of [[Lake Bolsena]], in a place known as ''Civita di Grotte di Castro'', a plain area close to the church of San Giovanni in Val di Lago (currently in the commune of [[San Lorenzo Nuovo]]). This hypothesis (also supported by Luigi Catena&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Fanum Voltumnae 06092006.pdf|''Corriere di Viterbo'', 6 September 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;) comes out of another study based on the so-called ''Rescritto di [[Spello]]''&lt;ref&gt;Coarelli, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospello.it/documents/Rescritto.pdf ''Il Rescritto di Costantinoin favore di Spello''] (Original Latin &amp; translation in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Rescript]] of Hispellum) issued by emperor [[Constantine I]] in a date between 333 and 337 AD to authorize the [[Umbrians]]' annual celebration:

{{bq|1=We — Emperor Caesar [[Constantine I|Flavius Constantine]] ''Maximus Germanicus Sarmaticus Maximus Gothicus Victor Triumphator Augustus'' and [his sons] [[Constantine II (emperor)|Flavius Constantine]] and [[Constantius II|Flavius Julius Constantius]] and [[Constans|Flavius Constans]] — encompass with our untiring attention and care everything, indeed, that benefits human society; but this is the greatest task for our forethought: that all the cities whose splendid appearance and beauty distinguish them in the eyes of all provinces and of all regions not only shall keep their former dignity, but also shall be promoted to a still greater esteem by the grant of our Beneficence.

Since, indeed, you aver that you have been annexed to Tuscia in such a way that by the established practice of ancient custom priests are created every other year in turn by you and by the aforesaid people of Tuscia, who exhibit stage plays and a gladiatorial show at Volsinii, a city of Tuscia; but that, because of the steepness of the mountains and the difficulties of the paths through the forests thither, you most earnestly request that permission shall be granted to your priest to abandon the necessity of going to Volsinii to celebrate the exhibition; and that we shall give a name from our [[cognomen]] to the community, which now has the name ''Hispellum'' and which you state is contiguous to and lying along the [[Flaminian Way]] and in which a temple of the Flavian Family is being built, of truly magnificent workmanship worthy of the greatness of its name; and that there that priest, whom Umbria selects annually, shall exhibit a festival of both stage plays and gladiatorial shows; and that this custom shall remain as regards Tuscia: that the priest created at Volsinii shall celebrate, as has been his wont, the observation of the aforesaid exhibitions at that place: our assent is gladly granted to your prayer and desire.

For from our own name we vouchsafe to the community of Hispellum an eternal designation, an appellation to be venerated, so that hereafter the aforesaid city shall be called ''Flavia Constans''; and in its center we wish, as you desire, the temple of our Flavian Family to be completed of magnificent workmanship, but with this regulation added: that no temple dedicated in our name shall be defiled by the deceptions of any contagious and unreasonable religious belief; and so we also permit you to stage exhibitions in the aforesaid community, although in such manner that, as has been said, the celebration of Volsinii also shall not fall into disuse through the ages, but that there the aforesaid celebration also must be staged by priests chosen from Tuscia.

Thus, indeed, it will not appear that our actions especially derogate anything from old customs; and you, who are suppliants to us for the aforesaid causes, will rejoice that you have gained those things for which you have earnestly asked.}}

This is the first document that allows one to situate the Fanum at Volsinii – or at least in the Volsiniese territory. It is said in the document that the annual Etruscan feast (''concilium principum Etruriae'') was celebrated near ''Volsinios'', including games and combats of [[gladiator]]s, and election of the federal ''sacerdos''. The document dates 4th century AD, thus the geographical indication in it can only refer to ''Volsinii Novi'', i.e. [[Bolsena]], and not to [[Velzna]] (Latinized to ''Volsinii Veteres'', currently [[Orvieto]]), the town the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had conquered and destroyed more than five centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;In the words of the medieval [[Byzantine]] writer [[Zonaras]], ''Epitome storica'', 8, 7, 4–8&lt;/ref&gt; New light is being brought into this area by British and Danish studies.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Barbano, [http://www.patrimoniosos.it/rsol.php?op=getarticle&amp;id=34524 Scavi archeologici nell'alta Tuscia], ''[[Il Messaggero]]'', 11 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred [[rescript]], found in 1733, was claimed false by the Italian historian [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]] in his ''Novus Thesaurus Veterum Inscriptionum'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;1791–1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fanumvoltumnae.myblog.it |title=Fanum Voltumnae a Tarquinia - Un altro blog di MyBlog |website=Fanumvoltumnae.myblog.it |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
New discoveries from ongoing excavations have been made in location "Alfina" and "Monte Landro"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orvietonews.it/it/index.php?id%3D28243#.TgWUZLJkqsI.facebook |accessdate=25 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322151143/http://www.orvietonews.it/it/index.php?id=28243 |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a team coordinated by [http://www.unive.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=82525&amp;persona=000899&amp;vista=curr Adriano Maggiani] (teacher of [http://www.unive.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=69032&amp;af_id=109720 Etruscology and Italic Archaeology] at [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]]), which may shed new lights on Etruscan culture at San Lorenzo Nuovo [e.g. Maccarino's tomb and other Etruscan tombs at San Lorenzo Nuovo &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1917934528467327&amp;set=pcb.1917901018470678&amp;type=3&amp;theater &lt;/ref&gt;]. An [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10212022952474056&amp;set=a.10208950814392524&amp;type=3&amp;theater Etruscan mirror] exhibited in the [[British Museum]] was found in a tomb on the territory of San Lorenzo Nuovo.

===Bisentina island===
Within Lake Bolsena, the [[Lake Bolsena#Bisentina|Bisentina island]] (commune of [[Capodimonte, Lazio|Capodimonte]]) is also regarded as a sacred isle of the Etruscans, possible site for the Fanum, and gate to the underground world of [[Agartha|Agharti]]. A [[sanctuary]] located on an island not situated at the sea would have been accessible to priests and kings of the 12 cities (with their closest entourages), their protection being granted during the religious and political meetings by a handful of armed men.
An Italian television program [http://www.voyager.rai.it Voyager] (1 October 2003) supported this hypothesis, suggesting for the Etruscans a parallelism to the [[Incas]] populations, who had also chosen one of [[Lake Titicaca]]'s islands as their [[omphalos]].

Indeed, not only the Incas but, for the same reasons, various peoples have decided to erect their most eminent sanctuary on sacred islands: the [[Egyptians]] at [[Philae]]; the [[Greeks]] at [[Delos]]; the [[Germans]] at [[Helgoland]] in the [[North Sea]] and on the island of the goddess [[Nerthus]], in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; the [[Celts]] at [[Gavrinis]], near to the [[Brittany|Breton]] coast in France, at [[Iona]] in Scotland, etc. This hypothesis finds a type of confirmation in the poem the[[Theogony]], by the Greek oral poet [[Hesiod]] (8th-7th century BC) : "They ruled over the famous Tyrenians, very far off in a recess of the holy islands".

===Pitigliano===
In ''Geografia sacra'', Giovanni Feo (professor at [http://www.dpm.unibo.it/DPM/default.htm Department of Paleography and Medieval Studies], [[University of Bologna]], Italy) presents his studies&lt;ref&gt;Feo, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; conducted over the [[Fiora River]] valley, in the comune of [[Pitigliano]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Fanum Feo 02042007.pdf|''Corriere di Viterbo'', 2 April 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; A set of [[megalith]]ic relics with astronomic functions was found out here, along with engraved rocky structures for cultural use. Such discoveries testify of the existence of a sacred area, originally developed by a pre-etruscan civilization settled down near to [[Lake Bolsena]] and later elected by the Etruscans as their religious centre.
Giovanni Feo also pointed out the borders of this sacred area, which delimited the Fanum, divided into four parts centred around the intersection point between the earth and heaven gods.

===Farnese===
In the commune of [[Farnese, Lazio|Farnese]], deep in the [http://www.parks.it/riserva.selva.lamone ''Selva del Lamone''], location [http://www.parks.it/riserva.selva.lamone/operatore.php?progressivooperatore=1951&amp;ap=Selva_del_Lamone Voltone] is assumed to get its name from the sacred temple dedicated to Voltumna. The Voltone is surrounded by numerous archaeological sites, such as [[Sovana]], [[Castro (city)|Castro]], [[Vulci]], and [[Tarquinia]], which testify of the culture of the Etruscans.

===Tarquinia===
According to Alberto Palmucci,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/autori/VETRINA%20DEGLI%20AUTORI/PALMUCCI.htm |title=ALBERTO PALMUCCI - Op. filologiche |website=Digilander.libero.it |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fanum Voltumnae could be the renowned temple of ''[[:it:Ara della Regina|Ara della Regina]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Palmucci, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the biggest temple of [[Etruria]], consecrated to [[Tinia]], god of the sky and the highest god in Etruscan mythology (equivalent to the Roman [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and the Greek [[Zeus]]).
The only representation of this god is one on a mirror, showing him attending the lesson in [[divination]] ([[haruspicy]]) given, in [[Tarquinia]], to the [[culture hero]] [[Tarchon]] by [[prophet]] [[Tages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originietruschi.it/public/origini/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3.Tagete-Tuscania.jpg |accessdate=30 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326104152/http://www.originietruschi.it/public/origini/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3.Tagete-Tuscania.jpg |archivedate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek historian [[Strabo]] supports that symbols of Etruscan federal power were transferred to Rome from Tarquinia.

In the archaeological museum of Tarquinia is an Etruscan vessel (early seventh century BC) with a dedication to god Vertun (Latin: Vertumnus, Voltumna). It comes from the nearly Etruscan cemetery.

'''Gymnosophy''' (from Greek γυμνός ''gymnós'' "naked" and σοφία ''sophía'' "wisdom") was a movement and a philosophy practiced in Europe and the USA from the end of the 19th century to the mid 20th century.  The practice involved [[nudity]], [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]].

==History==
In the early 20th century, the term was appropriated by several groups to denote a broad philosophy that included as a central thought that the nude human body is a natural condition and should be widely acceptable for the betterment of society. This philosophy is related closely, and often interchangeably, with [[nudism]] and [[naturism]], and has close connection to the [[hippie]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=243 ''Hippie Roots &amp; The Perennial Subculture'', 2003.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024110448/http://www.hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=243 |date=2016-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://frieze-magazin.de/archiv/features/kalifornication/?lang=en Kalifornication, ''Frieze magazine'', 9, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is known by mainly three organisations, the [[English Gymnosophical Society]], Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie and the [[American Gymnosophical Association]]. In 1919, the Yoga teacher [[Pierre Bernard (yogi)|Blanche DeVries]] opened a ''Yoga Gymnosophy Institute'' in New York that combined Oriental Dance and Yoga. The ''[[English Gymnosophical Society]]'' was founded in 1922 and became ''The New Gymnosophy Society'' in 1926. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club', ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as this was illegal in England until 1951. The ''Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie'' was founded in 1926 in France.

Dr. [[Maurice Parmelee]] (1882-1969), professor of sociology at the City College of New York, wrote from 1923 to 1924 a book, ''The New Gymnosophy'',&lt;ref name="Parmelee1927"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmelee|first=Maurice |title=The new gymnosophy: the philosophy of nudity as applied in modern life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9yBAAAAMAAJ|year=1927|publisher=F. H. Hitchcock|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the title was changed to ''Nudism In Modern Life'' in later editions.&lt;ref name="Parmelee2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmelee|first=Maurice |title=Nudism in Modern Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRd-CgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Read Books Limited|isbn=978-1-4733-8770-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Adventures in Many Lands an Autobiographical Memoir |first=Maurice|last= Parmelee|publisher=Unpublished manuscript, Parmalee Papers, Mnuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the founding of the ''[[American Gymnosophical Association]]'' 1930. 

In 1932, ''Rochester Gymnosophy League'' in Bushnell’s Basin was founded.&lt;ref name="Poray2016"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Naked Truth about Bushnell’s Basin |last=Poray |first=Bill |work=Fairport-ER Post |date=11 August 2016 |access-date=27 August 2018 |url= http://www.perinton.org/files/Data/Documents/Historian/columns/The%20Naked%20Truth%20about%20Bushnell.pdf |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 the ''Dunedin Gymnosophy Club'' in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="EP1933"&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Nudist Club formed in Dunedin - Police Approval? |author= |work=Wellington Evening Post |date=24 November 1933 |p=5 |access-date=27 August 2018 |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/document/38037/ridiculing-naturism |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemist and historian [[Joseph Needham]] was known to practice gymnosophy.&lt;ref name="chinesehsc.org"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-Djen |author= |publisher=The History of Chinese Science and Culture Foundation |date=n.d. |access-date=27 August 2018 |url= http://www.chinesehsc.org/joseph_needham_lu_gwei-djen.shtml |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade, the word gymnosophy has begun to be used as a term for a new, more spiritual and holistic, free body culture.&lt;ref name="Carr-Gomm2007"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Gymnosophy for Beginners |last=Carr-Gomm |first=Philip |work= |date=12 November 2007 |access-date=27 August 2018 |url= https://www.philipcarr-gomm.com/gymnosophy-for-beginners/ |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The word "gymnosophy" in literature ==
A reputed poem from the book [[Non Serviam (book)|Non Serviam]], 1945, by the Swedish author [[Gunnar Ekelöf]] is named "Gymnosofisten", (the gymnosophist).

In [[Don Quixote]]: "…in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced…"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">'''''Shamayim''''' (&lt;span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew, Ezra SIL SR, Ezra SIL, Cardo, Chrysanthi Unicode, TITUS Cyberbit Basic, Arial Unicode MS, Narkisim, Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;big&gt;שָׁמַיִם&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), the [[Hebrew]] word for "[[heaven]]" (literally ''heavens'', plural), denotes one component of the three-part [[biblical cosmology]], the other elements being ''erets'' (the earth) and ''[[sheol]]'' (the [[underworld]]). ''Shamayim'' is the dwelling place of [[God in Judaism|God]] and other heavenly beings, ''erets'' is the home of the living, and ''sheol'' is the realm of the dead, including, in post-[[Hebrew Bible]] literature (including the New Testament), the [[Bosom of Abraham#Abode of the righteous dead|abode of the righteous dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fretheim|2003|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Hebrew word ''shamayim'' is constructed of two parts: ''sham'' (&lt;span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew, Ezra SIL SR, Ezra SIL, Cardo, Chrysanthi Unicode, TITUS Cyberbit Basic, Arial Unicode MS, Narkisim, Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;big&gt;שָׁמַ)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; derived from Akkadian ''samu'' meaning "sky" or "lofty", and Hebrew ''mayim'' (&lt;span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew, Ezra SIL SR, Ezra SIL, Cardo, Chrysanthi Unicode, TITUS Cyberbit Basic, Arial Unicode MS, Narkisim, Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;big&gt;מַיִם)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; meaning "water". In [[Genesis 1:6]] Elohim separated the "water from the water". The area above the earth was filled by sky-water (''sham-mayim'') and the earth below was covered by sea-water ([http://biblehub.com/text/genesis/1-10.htm ''yam-mayim'']). The Hebrew word for the sun is ''[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8121.htm shemesh]''. It follows the same construction, where "shem" or "sham" (Akkadian: ''samu'') means "sky" and ''[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/784.htm esh]'' (Akkadian: ''ish'') means "fire", i.e., "sky-fire".

==Description==
The Biblical authors pictured the earth as a flat disk floating in water, with the heavens above and the underworld below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aune|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[raqiya]]'' ([[firmament]]), a solid inverted bowl above the earth, coloured blue by the [[cosmic ocean]], kept the waters above the earth from flooding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 300 BCE a newer Greek model largely replaced the idea of a three-tiered [[cosmos]]; the newer view saw the earth as a sphere at the centre of a set of seven concentric heavens, one for each visible planet plus the sun and moon, with the realm of God in an eighth and highest heaven, but although several Jewish works from this period have multiple heavens, as do some New Testament works, none has exactly the formal Greek system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aune|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the course of the 1st millennium CE Jewish scholars developed an elaborate system of [[Seven Heavens]], named:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1521&amp;letter=A#4364&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Vilon''''' (וִילוֹן) or '''''Araphel''''' (עֲרָפֶל)
* '''''Raqia''''' (רָקִיעַ)
* '''''[[Third Heaven|Shehaqim]]''''' (שְׁחָקִים)
* '''''[[Heaven#Kabbalah Jewish mysticism|Zebul]]''''' (זִבּוּל)
* '''''Maon''''' (מִעוּן)
* '''''Makon''''' (מִכּוּן)
* '''''Araboth''''' (עֲרֵבוּת), the location of the [[ophanim]], the [[seraphim]], the [[hayyoth]] and the [[Throne of God|throne of the Lord]]

Medieval Jewish [[Merkabah#Ma.27asei_Merkavah|Merkavah and Heichalot]] literature focussed on discussing the details of these heavens, sometimes in connection with traditions relating to Enoch, such as the [[3 Enoch|Third Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Howard Washington Thurman''' (November 18, 1899 – April 10, 1981) was an African-American author, philosopher, theologian, educator, and [[civil rights]] leader. As a prominent religious figure, he played a leading role in many [[social justice]] movements and organizations of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Thurman served as dean of [[Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel, Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall, Founders Library|Rankin Chapel]] at [[Howard University]] from 1932 to 1944 and as dean of [[Marsh Chapel]] at [[Boston University]] from 1953 to 1965.

Howard Thurman died on April 10, 1981 in San Francisco, California.

==Early life and education==
Howard Thurman was born in 1899 in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Florida]], probably in [[West Palm Beach]]. He spent most of his childhood in [[Daytona, Florida]], where his family lived in Waycross, one of Daytona's three all-black communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Nancy Ambrose and Thurman's mother, Alice, were members of Mount Bethel Baptist Church in Waycross and were women of deep Christian faith. Thurman's father, Saul Thurman, died of pneumonia when Howard Thurman was seven years old. After completing eighth grade, Thurman attended the [[Florida Memorial University|Florida Baptist Academy]] in Jacksonville. One hundred miles from Daytona, it was one of only three high schools for African Americans in Florida at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Thurman traveled broadly, heading Christian missions and meeting with world figures such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1944, Thurman left his tenured position at Howard to help the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] establish the [[Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples]] in San Francisco. It was the first racially integrated, intercultural church in the United States. He served as co-pastor with a white minister, Dr. Alfred Fisk. Many of their congregation were African Americans who had migrated to San Francisco from [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] for jobs in the defense industry. The church helped create a new community for many in San Francisco.

Thurman was invited to [[Boston University]] in 1953, where he became the dean of [[Marsh Chapel]] (1953–1965). He was the first black Dean of Chapel at a majority-white university or college in the United States. In addition, he served on the faculty of [[Boston University School of Theology]]. Thurman was also active and well known in the Boston community, where he influenced many leaders.

During his tenure at Boston University, the "Good Friday Experiment" (also called the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]]) was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This was a controversial experiment on the effects of hallucinogenic drugs on religious experience.

After leaving Boston University in 1965, Thurman continued his ministry as chairman of the board and director of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust in San Francisco until his death in 1981.

Thurman was a prolific author, writing twenty books on theology, religion, and philosophy. The most famous of his works, ''[[Jesus and the Disinherited]]'' (1949), deeply influenced [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and other leaders, both black and white, of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Thurman had been a classmate and friend of King's father at Morehouse College. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited Thurman while he attended Boston University, and Thurman in turn mentored his former classmate's son and his friends. He served as spiritual advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Sherwood Eddy]], [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]], [[A. J. Muste]], and [[Pauli Murray]]. At Boston University, Thurman also taught Reb [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], who cited Thurman as among the teachers who first compelled him to explore mystical trends beyond [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schachter-Shalomi|first1=Reb Zalman|last2=Gropman|first2=Daniel|title=The First Step: A Guide For the New Jewish Spirit|date=1983|publisher=Bantam|location=Toronto|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Thurman married Katie Kelley on June 11, 1926, less than a month after graduating from seminary. Katie was a 1918 graduate of the Teacher's Course at Spelman Seminary (renamed Spelman College in 1924). Their daughter Olive was born in October 1927. Katie died in December 1930 of tuberculosis, which she had probably contracted during her anti-tuberculosis work. On June 12, 1932, Thurman married Sue Bailey, whom he had met while at Morehouse, when Sue was a student at Spelman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibid.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=lxii-lxiii, lxvii, lxix-lxxii.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard and [[Sue Bailey Thurman.|Sue Bailey Thurman's]] daughter Anne was born in October 1933. Sue Bailey Thurman was an author, lecturer, historian, civil rights activist, and founder of the ''Aframerican Women's Journal''. She died in 1996.

==Honors and legacy==
[[Image:howard thurman house.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Howard Thurman House]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]]]
Thurman was named honorary Canon of the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]], New York City, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Howard Thurman to Charles G. Proffitt, March 29, 1974 (Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston Univ.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Ebony Magazine]]'' called Thurman one of the 50 most important figures in African-American history. In 1953 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' rated Thurman among the twelve most important religious leaders in the United States.

In 1986, Dean Emeritus George K. Makechnie founded the Howard Thurman Center at [[Boston University]] to preserve and share the legacy of Howard Thurman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/thurman/ |title=Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/ Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center] at Boston University holds the Howard Thurman Papers and the Sue Bailey Thurman Papers, where they are catalogued and available to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome - Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center|url = http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/web/howard-thurman/home|website = hgar-srv3.bu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Howard Thurman Papers Project was founded in 1992. The Project's mission is to preserve and promote Thurman's vast documentary record, which spans 63 years and consists of approximately 58,000 items of correspondence, sermons, unpublished writings, and speeches. The Howard Thurman Papers Project is located at Boston University School of Theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Howard Thurman Papers Project  {{!}} Boston University|url = http://www.bu.edu/htpp/|website = www.bu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Thurman's poem '[http://www.allianceofhope.org/blog_/2011/12/i-will-light-candles-this-christmas.html I Will Light Candles This Christmas]' has been set to music by British composer and songwriter Adrian Payne, both as a song and as a choral (SATB) piece. The choral version was first performed by Epsom Choral Society in December 2007. An arrangement for school choirs, which can be performed in one or two parts with piano accompaniment, was first performed in December 2010.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}{{Importance inline}}

'''Irreligion in the United Kingdom''' refers to the [[agnosticism]], [[atheism]], [[nontheism]], [[humanism]], [[secularism]], or, more generally, the lack of a [[religion]] in the country. Historically, the growth of irreligion in the UK has followed a European-wide pattern of [[secularisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Europe and the legend of secularization|publisher= The New York Times|date=2006-03-31|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/arts/31iht-idlede1.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2012-08-12|first=Mark|last=Lilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British census to gather data on religion, [[2001 United Kingdom census|in 2001]], showed that there were 7.7 million irreligious people in the country. The wording of the question was criticised by humanist groups, and a revised question in the next census in 2011 counted 14.1 million irreligious people. This made irreligion the second-largest viewpoint on religion after Christianity, larger than the combined populations of non-Christian religions in the UK, and also the largest growth between the two censuses. [[Humanists UK]] is the charity that provides services for this community and lobbies government on their behalf.

Freedom to be irreligious had been limited by the country's [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|blasphemy law]], which punished criticism and mockery of [[Christianity]], particularly the state [[Church of England]]. The last conviction was in [[Whitehouse v Lemon|1977]], with the law being abolished in England and Wales in 2008. Similar offences remain in statute in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and remain theoretically incompatible with the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. 

==1700–1850==
Organized activism for irreligion in the United Kingdom derived its roots from the legacy of British [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]]. The [[South Place Ethical Society|South Place Religious Society]], which would later become associated with the Ethical movement, was founded in 1793 as an organization of [[Philadelphians]] or Universalists.

''[[The Oracle of Reason]]'', the first avowedly-atheist periodical publication in British history, was published from 1841 to 1843 by [[Charles Southwell]]. It suffered from numerous imprisonments of its staff, including Southwell, George Holyoake and [[Thomas Paterson (publisher)|Thomas Paterson]], for missives deemed "blasphemous" by the authorities (Holyoake was the last person in Britain convicted of blasphemy in a public lecture). Holyoake took to publishing ''[[The Movement (magazine)|The Movement]]'' (1842-1845) following his six-month sentence, which later became ''[[The Reasoner]]'' (1845-1860) and shifted to a larger focus on social issues facing the British working class, increasing the publication's readership. It was during this time that Holyoake developed his idea for the replacement of Christianity with an ethical system based upon science and reason, terming his proposal "secularism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRholyoak.htm |title=George Holyoake : Biography |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1850–1900==
[[File:Charles Bradlaugh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Northampton]] and founder of the [[National Secular Society]] in 1866.]]
[[George Holyoake]]'s coining of the word ''[[secularism]]'' in 1851 offered the English-speaking world the clarification of the nascent movement for separation of religion and state. The [[National Secular Society]], founded in 1866 by politician [[Charles Bradlaugh]], spearheaded the advocacy for freeing citizens from absolute government requirements involving religious observances; the [[Leicester Secular Society]] was founded in 1851. Bradlaugh's 1880 election to Parliament brought on a decade-long dispute over the demanded right to affirm declarations of office rather than swear oaths, as he was denied his seat for five years by a ruling that he had no right to affirm and resolutions preventing him from swearing an oath. When Bradlaugh was ultimately admitted in 1886, he took up the issue and saw the [[Oaths Act 1888]] passed, which confirmed the right to optionally affirm declarations for inaugurations to office and offering testimony to government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oY0nsXwPJ3AC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Irreligion+in+the+netherlands&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8y5AblhMnz&amp;sig=Cszqj6FdZGj8OaIOWTChKZKtIJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=roTvT5bsMoKe0QW8qZSSDg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Irreligion%20in%20the%20netherlands&amp;f=false |title=Religion and Mental Health - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1881, ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' began circulation as Britain's longest-running humanist periodical. In 1891, the [[British Humanist Association|Union of Ethical Societies]] was formed in the United Kingdom by American [[Stanton Coit]] as a union of British [[Ethical movement]] societies; this group would later become known as the Ethical Union and the British Humanist Association.&lt;ref name="humanism.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.humanism.org.uk/about/our-history-since-1896/ |title= Our History since 1896 |accessdate= 2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the [[Rationalist Association|Rational Press Association]] was formed by a group of free-thinkers including [[Charles Albert Watts]] and George Holyoake.

Meanwhile, the South Place Religious Society became further aligned with organized secularist advocacy during the tenure of [[Moncure D. Conway]] as minister of the congregation; Conway, an American Unitarian minister who served from 1864–1885 and 1892–1897, moved the congregation further away from doctrinal Unitarianism, and spent the break in his tenure (during which Stanton Coit served in his stead) writing a biography of American revolutionary ideologue [[Thomas Paine]]. In 1888, the South Place Religious Society became the South Place Ethical Society, now known as the [[Conway Hall Ethical Society]].

==20th century==
[[File:Richard Dawkins Cooper Union Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Richard Dawkins]] has been a significant figure in irreligion since the 1970s]] 
The 1960s were a significant time for irreligion, as the Ethical Union rebranded as the British Humanist Association, which went on to co-found the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and create a symbol for [[secular humanism|humanism]], the [[Happy Human]].&lt;ref name="humanism.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.humanism.org.uk/about/our-history-since-1896/ |title= Our History since 1896 |accessdate= 2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasters such as [[Margaret K. Knight]] sensationalised Britain with open advocacy of non-religious values and secular education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/20th-century-humanism/margaret-knight/|title=Margaret Knight|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior figures in the British humanist movement went out to take on leading roles in institutions such as [[UNESCO]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://david-pollock.org.uk/welcome/humanism/humanism-beliefs-and-values/|title=Humanism: Beliefs and Values|last=Pollock|first=David|authorlink=David Pollock (humanist)|work=david-pollock.org.uk|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[John William Gott]], a working man of [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]], attacked religion, especially [[Christianity]], seeing it as reducing the opportunity for a [[socialist]] revolution. His lectures on rationalism and scepticism, and anti-Christian pamphlets, saw him jailed for blasphemy in 1911. Liberal Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] was one of a group of Members of Parliament who proposed an ultimately unsuccessful piece of legislation to abolish blasphemy offences. Gott was jailed again ten years later for a pamphlet showing [[Jesus]] as a [[clown]], and died in 1922 soon after his nine-month sentence which included hard labour despite his worsening physical condition. There was a public backlash against his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/47/101047693/ |title=John Gott |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gott was the last Briton jailed for blasphemy, but the offence remained a technical crime through [[common law]] until being abolished in the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].

Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], who first came to prominence in 1976 following the release of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', increasingly figured in British irreligion with the release of his 1986 work ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', in which he argued in favour of evolutionary natural selection as opposed to [[intelligent design]] and [[creationism]].

==21st century==
[[File:West from castle mound.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The City of [[Norwich]], according to the United Kingdom's 2011 census, is the most irreligious local authority in England, with 42.5% professing no religious affiliation.]]
In the 21st century, [[New Atheism]] became a popular topic of debate, support and critique in the United Kingdom. Dawkins' 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and [[Christopher Hitchens]]' 2007 book ''[[God Is Not Great]]'' were considered emblematic works of the era among British authors, and Dawkins advocated for the [[Brights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Wood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/26/james-wood-the-new-atheism |title=The New Atheism &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2011-08-26|accessdate=2012-08-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atheist Bus Campaign]] was inaugurated during this time, in which advertisements on double-decker buses were purchased by the [[British Humanist Association]] in order to advocate non-belief in the supernatural; the campaign caused controversy and complaints to authorities, but soon spread to other countries and continents, taking root in the United States as a variety of [[atheist billboard]] campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/apr/26/persistence-superstition-irreligious-britain |title=The persistence of superstition in an irreligious Britain &amp;#124; Andrew Brown &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-08-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism is expected to be the dominant position on the existence of God by 2038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/atheists-likely-to-outnumber-christians-in-england-in-20-years/2012/03/09/gIQA2Bqb1R_story.html |title=Atheists likely to outnumber Christians in England in 20 years |publisher=Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09 |first=Al |last=Webb&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey of 1,000 teenagers aged 13 to 18 reports that two-thirds of British teenagers do not believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=22 Jun 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5603096/Two-thirds-of-teenagers-dont-believe-in-God.html |title=Two thirds of teenagers don't believe in God |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2012-08-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irreligious British politicians==
Non-religious people have risen to the highest ranks of UK politics, including at least three Prime Ministers, one Deputy Prime Minister, and several Leaders of the Opposition. [[Clement Attlee]], Prime Minister for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 1945 to 1951, rejected organised religion and claims of the supernatural his whole life, despite growing up in a Christian household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/05/clegg-atheism-attlee |title=The politics of faith &amp;#124; Nick Spencer &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date= 2010-05-05|accessdate=2013-08-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Callaghan]], also of Labour, was Prime Minister from 1976 to 1979. He left the [[Baptist Church]] as a young man when he became more involved in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobritain.co.uk/James_Callaghan.htm |title=James Callaghan |publisher=Infobritain.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] (1940&amp;ndash;1945 and 1951&amp;ndash;1955) was an atheist, saying  "I do not accept the Christian or any other form of religious belief".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin (1991). ''Churchill: A Life.'' London: Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-434-29183-8}}. Page 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Past Opposition [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leaders [[Michael Foot]] and [[Neil Kinnock]] were also atheists and humanists. Foot, much like Neil and [[Glenys Kinnock]], was a patron of [[Humanists UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/patrons/rt-hon-lord-kinnock-pc/|accessdate=5 March 2018|work=[[Humanists UK]]|title=Rt Hon Lord Kinnock PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2010/03/03/news-494/|title=BHA mourns Rt Hon Michael Foot, activist, journalist and humanist (1913-2010)|work=[[Humanists UK]]|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhodri Morgan]], former MP and [[First Minister of Wales]] from 2000 to 2009, was an atheist and a humanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2017/05/31/public-humanist-funeral-for-rhodri-morgan-at-national-assembly-for-wales/|title=Public humanist funeral for Rhodri Morgan at National Assembly for Wales|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Humanists UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-40099436|work=[[BBC Wales News]]|title=Rhodri Morgan funeral to be held at the Senedd, Cardiff|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential atheists and humanists in British history include NHS founder [[Nye Bevan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/TUbevan.htm|title=History of Socialism: Aneurin Bevan|work=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "father of the [[welfare state]]" [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref name="Harris1-323"&gt;Jose Harris, ''William Beveridge: a biography'' (1997) pp 1, 323. &lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary British atheist politicians include [[Ken Livingstone]] of Labour, who was [[London]]'s first mayor between 2000 and 2008. He left Christianity at the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1640_ken_livingstone_inte.htm |title=Ken Livingstone interview |publisher=Somethingjewish.co.uk |date=2005-11-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] (2010&amp;ndash;2015) is an [[agnostic atheist]].&lt;ref name="typepad1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/election10/2010/04/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-nick-clegg.html |title=Election '10: 10 things you didn't know about Nick Clegg |work=The Times |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419151357/http://timesonline.typepad.com/election10/2010/04/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-nick-clegg.html |archivedate=19 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peev |first=Gerri |url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/I-don39t-believe-in-God.3607087.jp |title=Religion: I don't believe in God |work=The Scotsman |date= 20 December 2007|accessdate=14 April 2010 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Miliband]], a former leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 2010 to 2015, is also a [[Jewish atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/8032163/Ed-Miliband-I-dont-believe-in-God.html |title=Ed Miliband: I don't believe in God |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of elected politicians, [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Downing Street Director of Communications|Director of Communications]] [[Alastair Campbell]] is an atheist and was infamous during his time in post for once telling a journalist "We don't do god".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christiantoday.com/article/alastair.campbell.im.a.profaith.atheist/31205.htm|title=Alastair Campbell: I'm a pro-faith atheist|accessdate=5 March 2018|work=Christian Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 100 Parliamentarians in the UK are members of the [[All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group]], which means the non-religious have substantial representation among MPs and Lords.&lt;ref name="BHA-APPHG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanists in Parliament|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/humanists-in-parliament/|work=British Humanist Association|publisher=British Humanist Association|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2265">The '''Kalabaz''' are a [[Hindu]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India. They have [[Scheduled Caste]] status.

== Origin ==

The word ''kalabaz'' in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] means an acrobat, and the Kalabaz are an [[endogamy|endogamous]] sub-group within the larger [[Nat (caste)|Nat]] [[caste]] of [[North India]]. Like other Nats, they claim to have originally  been [[Rajput]]s, who lost caste after their defeat at the hands of the [[Mughal Empire]]. Those Nats who became acrobats over time evolved into a distinct community. Historically, the Kalabaz were a nomadic community, but have now been settled by the Indian government. They speak Hindi but have their own particular dialect.&lt;ref name="ppi"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 673 to 676 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

The Kalabaz are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]] and practice clan [[exogamy]]. They are further divided into a number of exogamous sub-divisions, known as [[gotra]]s, namely the Bakiya, Dariyabadi, Dibichia, Ghughasia, Goojre, Gulal, Jharbheria, Kala, Kingiriya, Kulba, Marora, Panchiya, Paharia and Sati. The main function of the gotra is to trace descent and to regulate their marriage alliances.&lt;ref name="ppi"/&gt;

The Kalabaz are a landless community, and are still involved in their traditional occupation of acrobatic performances. Many have seen a decline in their traditional occupation, and are employed as day labourers. Like other Hindu castes, each Kalabaz settlement contains a biradari [[panchayat]], an informal caste association, which acts as an instrument of social control.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Kalabaz, who were classified as a Scheduled Caste having a population of 11,199.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix - Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct road from [[Gandhara]] to China remained under Kushan control for more than a century, encouraging travel across the Karakoram and facilitating the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|spread of Mahayana Buddhism]] to China.

The Kushan dynasty had diplomatic contacts with the [[Roman Empire]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian Persia]], the [[Aksumite Empire]] and [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] of [[Han Dynasty|China]]. While much philosophy, art, and science was created within its borders, the only textual record of the empire's history today comes from inscriptions and accounts in other languages, particularly Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 36 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kushan empire fragmented into semi-independent kingdoms in the 3rd century AD, which fell to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] invading from the west, establishing the [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom]] in the areas of [[Sogdiana]], [[Bactria]] and [[Gandhara]]. In the 4th century, the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], an Indian dynasty also pressed from the east. The last of the Kushan and Kushano-Sasanian kingdoms were eventually overwhelmed by invaders from the north, known as the [[Kidarites]], and then the [[Hepthalites]].&lt;ref name="lcwb2"/&gt;

==Origins==
Chinese sources describe the ''Guishuang'' (貴霜), ''i.e.'' the Kushans, as one of the five aristocratic tribes of the [[Yuezhi]], with some people claiming they were a loose confederation of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples,&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/kush/hd_kush.htm |title=Kushan Empire (ca. 2nd century B.C.&amp;#150;3rd century A.D.) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many scholars are still unconvinced that they originally spoke an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]. As the historian John E. Hill has put it: "For well over a century ... there have been many arguments about the ethnic and linguistic origins of the Great Yuezhi or Da Yuezhi (大月氏), Kushans (貴霜), and the Tochari, and still there is little consensus".&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Koshanoy.jpg|thumb|left|The [[ethnonym]] "KO[[Sho (letter)|Ϸ]][[Sho (letter)|Ϸ]]ANOV" (''Koshshanou'', "Kushans") on a coin of the first known Kushan ruler [[Heraios]] (1st century CE).]]
The Yuezhi were described in the ''[[Records of the Great Historian]]'' 史記 and the ''[[Book of Han]] 漢書'' as living in the grasslands of [[Gansu]], in the northwest of modern-day China, until their King was beheaded by the Huns from Siberia (the [[Xiongnu]] 匈奴) who were also at war with China, which eventually forced them to migrate west in 176–160&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael A.N. |last=Loewe |chapter=Introduction |pages=1–70 |title=China in Central Asia: The Early Stage: 125 BC – AD 23; an Annotated Translation of Chapters 61 and 96 of the History of the Former Han Dynasty |editor-first=Anthony François Paulus |editor-last=Hulsewé |publisher=Brill |year=1979 |isbn=978-90-04-05884-2}} pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The five tribes constituting the Yuezhi are known in Chinese history as ''Xiūmì'' (休密), ''Guìshuāng'' (貴霜), ''Shuāngmǐ'' (雙靡), ''Xìdùn'' (肸頓), and ''Dūmì'' (都密).

The Yuezhi reached the Hellenic kingdom of [[Greco-Bactria]] (in northern Afghanistan and Uzbekistan) around 135&amp;nbsp;BC. The displaced Greek dynasties resettled to the southeast in areas of the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Indus river|Indus]] basin (in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan), occupying the western part of the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek Kingdom]].

==Early Kushans==
[[File:KushanHead.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Head of a Kushan prince ([[Khalchayan]] palace, [[Uzbekistan]])]]
Some traces remain of the presence of the Kushans in the area of Bactria and [[Sogdiana]]. Archaeological structures are known in Takht-I-Sangin, [[Surkh Kotal]] (a monumental temple), and in the palace of [[Khalchayan]]. Various sculptures and friezes are known, representing horse-riding archers,&lt;ref&gt;Lebedynsky, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and, significantly, men with [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially deformed skulls]], such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan&lt;ref&gt;Lebedynsky, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; (a practice well attested in nomadic Central Asia). The Chinese first referred to these people as the Yuezhi and said they established the Kushan Empire, although the relationship between the Yuezhi and the Kushans is still unclear. On the ruins of ancient Hellenistic cities such as [[Ai-Khanoum]], the Kushans are known to have built fortresses.

[[File:Heraios profile.jpg|thumb|The first known Kushan king [[Heraios]] (1-30 CE)]]
The earliest documented ruler, and the first one to proclaim himself as a Kushan ruler, was [[Heraios]]. He calls himself a "[[tyrant]]" in [[Greco-Bactria|Greek]] on his coins, and also exhibits skull deformation. He may have been an ally of the Greeks, and he shared the same style of coinage. Heraios may have been the father of the first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises.

[[Ban Gu]]'s [[Book of Han]] tells us the Kushans (Kuei-shuang) divided up Bactria in 128&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]]'s [[Book of the Later Han]] "relates how the chief of the Kushans, Ch'iu-shiu-ch'ueh (the Kujula Kadphises of coins), founded by means of the submission of the other Yueh-chih clans the Kushan Empire, known to the Greeks and Romans under the name of Empire of the [[Indo-Scythians]]."&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Hou Hanshu]] 後漢書 chronicles gives an account of the formation of the Kushan empire based on a report made by the Chinese general [[Ban Yong]] to the Chinese Emperor c. 125&amp;nbsp;AD:

{{quote|More than a hundred years later [than the conquest of Bactria by the Da Yuezhi], the prince [''xihou''] of Guishuang ([[Badakhshan]]) established himself as king, and his dynasty was called that of the Guishuang (Kushan) King. He invaded Anxi (Indo-Parthia), and took the Gaofu ([[Kabul]]) region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda (Paktiya) and Jibin (Kapisha and [[Gandhara]]). Qiujiuque (Kujula Kadphises) was more than eighty years old when he died. His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahk (tu) or, possibly, his brother Sadaṣkaṇa], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi.|Hou Hanshu&lt;ref name="Hill 2009, p. 29"&gt;Hill (2009), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chavannes (1907), pp. 190–192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Diverse cultural influences==
[[File:Kushan script.jpg|thumb|[[Greek alphabet]] (narrow columns) with Kushan script (wide columns)]]
[[File:KushanDevoteeFullLength.jpg|thumb|150px|A Buddhist devotee in Kushan dress, Mathura, 2nd century. The Kushan dress is generally depicted as quite stiff, and it is thought it was often made of leather (Francine Tissot, "Gandhara").]]
In the 1st century BCE, the ''Guishuang'' (Ch: 貴霜) gained prominence over the other Yuezhi tribes, and welded them into a tight confederation under ''yabgu'' (Commander) Kujula Kadphises. The name ''Guishuang'' was adopted in the West and modified into ''Kushan'' to designate the confederation, although the Chinese continued to call them ''Yuezhi''.

Gradually wresting control of the area from the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythian]] tribes, the Kushans expanded south into the region traditionally known as [[Gandhara]] (an area primarily in [[Pakistan]]'s [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothowar]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] region but going in an arc to include the Kabul valley and part of [[Qandahar]] in Afghanistan){{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and established twin capitals in [[Begram]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Frederick Starr, ''Lost Enlightenment: Central Asia's Golden Age from the Arab Conquest to Tamerlane''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2013, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peshawar]], then known as Kapisa and Pushklavati respectively.

[[File:Sho uc lc.svg|thumb|left|100px|The Kushan writing system used the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of the letter [[Sho (letter)|Sho]] (associated with the Greek [[Sampi]]).]]
The Kushans adopted elements of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture of Bactria. They adopted the [[Greek alphabet]] to suit their own language (with the additional development of the letter Þ "sh", as in "Kushan") and soon began minting coinage on the Greek model. On their coins they used Greek language legends combined with Pali legends (in the [[Kharoshthi]] script), until the first few years of the reign of Kanishka. After that date,{{Vague|date=April 2010}}{{When|date=April 2010}}{{Dubious|date=April 2010}} they used Kushan language legends (in an adapted Greek script), combined with legends in Greek (Greek script) and legends in Prakrit (Kharoshthi script).

The Kushans "adopted many local beliefs and customs, including [[Zoroastrianism]] and the two rising religions in the region, the Greek cults and [[Buddhism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Starr, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of [[Vima Takto]], many Kushans started adopting aspects of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] culture, and like the Egyptians, they absorbed the strong remnants of the Greek culture of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, becoming at least partly [[Hellenise]]d. The great Kushan emperor [[Vima Kadphises]] may have embraced [[Shaivism]] (a sect of [[Hinduism]]), as surmised by coins minted during the period.{{sfn|Bopearachchi|2007|p=45}} The following Kushan emperors represented a wide variety of faiths including [[Mahayana|Buddhism]], Zoroastrianism and [[Shaivism]].

The rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the [[Indian Ocean]] with the commerce of the [[Silk Road]] through the long-civilized [[Indus Valley]]. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely ruled a territory that extended to the [[Aral Sea]] through present-day [[Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]] into northern India.

The loose unity and comparative peace of such a vast expanse encouraged long-distance trade, brought Chinese silks to [[Rome]], and created strings of flourishing urban centers.

==Territorial expansion==
[[File:Kushan king or prince.jpg|thumb|upright|Kushan king or prince, [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], 2nd-3rd century CE]]
Rosenfield notes that archaeological evidence of a Kushan rule of long duration is present in an area stretching from Surkh Kotal, [[Begram]], the summer capital of the Kushans, Peshawar, the capital under Kanishka I, [[Taxila]], and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], the winter capital of the Kushans.&lt;ref name="Rosenfield, p. 41"&gt;Rosenfield, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of probable rule include [[Khwarezm]],&lt;ref name="Rosenfield, p. 41"/&gt; [[Kausambi]] (excavations of Allahabad University),&lt;ref name="Rosenfield, p. 41"/&gt; [[Sanchi]] and Sarnath (inscriptions with names and dates of Kushan kings),&lt;ref name="Rosenfield, p. 41"/&gt; [[Malwa]] and [[Maharashtra]],&lt;ref&gt;For "Malwa and Maharashtra, for which it is speculated that the Kushans had an alliance with the [[Western Kshatrapas]]", see: Rosenfield, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Odisha]] (imitation of Kushan coins, and large Kushan hoards).&lt;ref name="Rosenfield, p. 41"/&gt;

[[File:A picture of Sirsukh Texila by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of a Kushan fortress in [[Sirsukh]], [[Pakistan]]]]
Kushan [[invasions]] in the 1st century CE had been given as an explanation for the [[Human migration|migration]] of [[Indian people|Indians]] from the [[Indian Subcontinent]] toward [[Southeast Asia]] according to proponents of a [[Greater India]] theory by 20th-century Indian [[nationalists]]. However, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=D.G.E.|title=A History of South-East Asia, Fourth Edition|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan Education Ltd.|location=Hong Kong|isbn=0-333-24163-0|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recently discovered [[Rabatak inscription]] confirms the account of the Hou Hanshu, [[Weilüe]], and inscriptions dated early in the Kanishka era (incept probably 127 CE), that large Kushan dominions expanded into the heartland of northern India in the early 2nd century CE. Lines 4 to 7 of the inscription&lt;ref&gt;For a translation of the full text of the Rabatak inscription see: Mukherjee, B.N., "The Great Kushana Testament", Indian Museum Bulletin, Calcutta, 1995. This translation is quoted in: Goyal (2005), p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; describe the cities which were under the rule of Kanishka, among which six names are identifiable: [[Ujjain]], [[Kundina]], Saketa, Kausambi, [[Pataliputra]], and [[Janjgir-Champa|Champa]] (although the text is not clear whether Champa was a possession of Kanishka or just beyond it).&lt;ref&gt;For quotation: "The Rabatak inscription claims that in the year 1 Kanishka I's authority was proclaimed in India, in all the satrapies and in different cities like Koonadeano (Kundina), Ozeno (Ujjain), Kozambo (Kausambi), Zagedo (Saketa), Palabotro (Pataliputra) and Ziri-Tambo (Janjgir-Champa). These cities lay to the east and south of Mathura, up to which locality Wima had already carried his victorious arm. Therefore they must have been captured or subdued by Kanishka I himself." see: Goyal, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the analysis of Sims-Williams and J. Cribb, specialists of the field, who had a central role in the decipherment: "A new Bactrian inscription of Kanishka the Great", in ''Silk Road Art and Archaeology'' No. 4, 1995–1996. pp.75–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Kushan state was bounded to the south by the [[Paratarajas|Pārata state]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], western [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]].

Northward, in the 2nd century AD, the Kushans under Kanishka made various forays into the [[Tarim Basin]], where they had various contacts with the Chinese. Both archaeological findings and literary evidence suggest Kushan rule, in [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], and [[Hotan|Khotan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/33275660/The_Sino-Kharosthi_coins_of_Khotan_part_2_Numismatic_Chronicle_1984_pp.129-152 The Sino-Kharosthi coins of Khotan part 2, Numismatic Chronicle (1984), pp.129-152., by Joe Cribb]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kujula Kadphises (c. 30 – c. 80)===
{{quote|...the prince [elavoor] of Guishuang, named thilac [Kujula Kadphises], attacked and exterminated the four other xihou. He established himself as king, and his dynasty was called that of the Guishuang [Kushan] King. He invaded Anxi [Indo-Parthia] and took the Gaofu [Kabul] region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda [Paktiya] and Jibin [Kapisha and Gandhara]. Qiujiuque [Kujula Kadphises] was more than eighty years old when he died."|Hou Hanshu&lt;ref name="Hill 2009, p. 29"/&gt;}}

These conquests probably took place sometime between 45 and 60 and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire which was rapidly expanded by his descendants.

Kujula issued an extensive series of coins and fathered at least two sons, [[Sadashkana|Sadaṣkaṇa]] (who is known from only two inscriptions, especially the Rabatak inscription, and apparently never ruled), and seemingly Vima Takto.

Kujula Kadphises was the great-grandfather of Kanishka.

===Vima Taktu or Sadashkana (c. 80 – c. 95)===
Vima Takto (Ancient Chinese: 閻膏珍 ''Yangaozhen'') is mentioned in the Rabatak inscription (another son, Sadashkana, is mentioned in an inscription of Senavarman, the King of Odi). He was the predecessor of Vima Kadphises, and Kanishka I. He expanded the Kushan Empire into the northwest of South Asia. The Hou Hanshu says:

{{quote|"His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahk (tu) or, possibly, his brother Sadaṣkaṇa], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi."|Hou Hanshu&lt;ref name="Hill 2009, p. 29"/&gt;}}

===Vima Kadphises (c. 95 – c. 127)===
[[Vima Kadphises]] (Kushan language: Οοημο Καδφισης) was a Kushan emperor from around 90–100 CE, the son of Sadashkana and the grandson of Kujula Kadphises, and the father of Kanishka I, as detailed by the Rabatak inscription.

Vima Kadphises added to the Kushan territory by his conquests in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. He issued an extensive series of coins and inscriptions. He issued gold coins in addition to the existing copper and silver coinage.

===Kanishka I (c. 127 – c. 140)===
{{Main|Kanishka}}
[[File:Kanishka enhanced.jpg|thumb|upright|Kanishka, [[Mathura art]], [[Mathura Museum]]]]
The rule of [[Kanishka I|Kanishka the Great]], fifth Kushan king, lasted for about 13 years from c.&amp;nbsp;127. Upon his accession, Kanishka ruled a huge territory (virtually all of northern India), south to Ujjain and Kundina and east beyond Pataliputra, according to the Rabatak inscription:
[[File:Qila Mubarak in Bathinda.jpg|thumb|The [[Qila Mubarak]] fort at [[Bathinda]], India was built by Kanishka the Great.]]
{{Quote|In the year one, it has been proclaimed unto India, unto the whole realm of the governing class, including Koonadeano (Kaundiny, Kundina) and the city of Ozeno (Ozene, Ujjain) and the city of Zageda (Saketa) and the city of Kozambo (Kausambi) and the city of Palabotro (Pataliputra) and so long unto (i.e., as far as) the city of Ziri-tambo (Sri-Champa).|Rabatak inscription, Lines 4–6}}

His territory was administered from two capitals: Purushapura (now Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan) and Mathura, in northern India. He is also credited (along with [[Raja Dab]]) for building the massive, ancient [[Fort at Bathinda]] ([[Qila Mubarak]]), in the modern city of [[Bathinda]], Indian [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].

The Kushans also had a summer capital in [[Bagram]] (then known as Kapisa), where the "Begram Treasure", comprising works of art from Greece to China, has been found. According to the Rabatak inscription, Kanishka was the son of Vima Kadphises, the grandson of Sadashkana, and the great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises. Kanishka's era is now generally accepted to have begun in 127 on the basis of Harry Falk's ground-breaking research.&lt;ref name="Falk 2001, pp. 121–136"&gt;Falk (2001), pp. 121–136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falk (2004), pp. 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Kanishka's era was used as a calendar reference by the Kushans for about a century, until the decline of the Kushan realm.

===Vāsishka (c. 140 – c. 160)===
[[Vāsishka]] was a Kushan emperor who seems to have had a 20-year reign following Kanishka. His rule is recorded as far south as Sanchi (near [[Vidisa]]), where several inscriptions in his name have been found, dated to the year 22 (the Sanchi inscription of "Vaksushana" – i.e., Vasishka Kushana) and year 28 (the Sanchi inscription of Vasaska – i.e., Vasishka) of the Kanishka era.

===Huvishka (c. 160 – c. 190)===
[[Huvishka]] (Kushan: Οοηϸκι, "Ooishki") was a Kushan emperor from about 20 years after the death of Kanishka (assumed on the best evidence available to be in 140) until the succession of [[Vasudeva I]] about thirty years later. His rule was a period of retrenchment and consolidation for the Empire. In particular he devoted time and effort early in his reign to the exertion of greater control over the city of Mathura.

===Vasudeva I (c. 190 – c. 230)===

[[Vasudeva I]] (Kushan: Βαζοδηο "Bazodeo", Chinese: 波調 "Bodiao") was the last of the "Great Kushans". Named inscriptions dating from year 64 to 98 of Kanishka's era suggest his reign extended from at least 191 to 225&amp;nbsp;AD. He was the last great Kushan emperor, and the end of his rule coincides with the invasion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] as far as northwestern India, and the establishment of the [[Indo-Sasanians]] or ''Kushanshahs'' in what is nowadays Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India from around 240&amp;nbsp;AD.

==Kushan deities==
[[File:Kumara, The Divine General LACMA M.85.279.3.jpg|thumb|upright|Kumara/[[Kartikeya]] with a [[Kushan]] devotee, 2nd century CE]]
[[File:Gandhara, omaggio di un re kushana al bodhisattva, II-III sec.JPG|thumb|Kushan prince making a donation to a [[Boddhisattva]]]]
The Kushan religious [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] is extremely varied, as revealed by their coins that were made in gold, silver, and copper. These coins contained more than thirty different gods, belonging mainly to their own Iranic, Greek, and Indo-Aryan worlds as well. Kushan coins had images of Kushan Kings, Buddha, and figures from the Indo-Aryan and Iranian&lt;!-- Bactrian/Arachosian/etc == Eastern Iranian, which is _not_ "Persian", which is western Iranian--&gt; pantheons.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on early coins. During Kanishka's reign, the language of the coinage changes to [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] (though it remained in Greek script for all kings). After Huvishka, only two divinities appear on the coins: ''Ardoxsho'' and ''[[Oesho]]'' (see details below).

The Iranic entities depicted on coinage include:
*Αρδοχþο (''ardoxsho'', [[Ashi Vanghuhi]])
*Aþαειχþo (''ashaeixsho'', [[Asha Vahishta]])
*Αθþο (''athsho'', [[Atar]])
*Φαρρο (''pharro'', [[Khwarenah]])
*Λροοασπο (''lrooaspa'', [[Drvaspa]])
*Μαναοβαγο, (''manaobago'', [[Vohu Manah]])
*Μαο (''mao'', [[Mah]])
*Μιθρο, Μιιρο, Μιορο, Μιυρο (''mithro'' and variants, [[Mithra]])
*Μοζδοοανο (''mozdooano'', [[Ahura Mazda|Mazda *vana]] "Mazda the victorious?")
*Νανα, Ναναια, Ναναϸαο (variations of pan-Asiatic ''nana'', Sogdian ''nny'', [[Nana (Kushan goddess)|Nana]])
*Οαδο (''oado'' [[Vata-Vayu|Vata]])
*Oαxþo (''oaxsho'', "Oxus")
*Ooρoμoζδο (''ooromozdo'', [[Ahura Mazda]])
*Οραλαγνο (''orlagno'', [[Verethragna]])
*Τιερο (''tiero'', [[Tishtrya|Tir]])

Representation of entities from Greek mythology and Hellenistic syncretism are:
*Ηλιος ([[Helios]]), Ηφαηστος ([[Hephaistos]]), Σαληνη ([[Selene]]), Ανημος ([[Anemos]]). Further, the coins of Huvishka also portray the demi-god ''erakilo'' [[Heracles]], and the Egyptian god ''sarapo'' [[Sarapis]]

The Indic entities represented on coinage include:
*Βοδδο (''boddo'', [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]])
*Μετραγο Βοδδο (''metrago boddo'', bodhisattava [[Maitreya]])
*Mαασηνo (''maaseno'', [[Kartikeya|Mahasena]])
*Σκανδo koμαρo (''skando komaro'', [[Murugan|Skanda]] Kumara)
*þακαμανο Βοδδο (''shakamano boddho'', [[Shakyamuni Buddha]])
*Οηϸο (''oesho''), long considered to represent Indic [[Shiva]],&lt;ref&gt;Sivaramamurti, p. 56-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sino-platonic.org"&gt;Loeschner, Hans (2012) [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp227_kanishka_stupa_casket.pdf The Stūpa of the Kushan Emperor Kanishka the Great] Sino-Platonic Papers, No. 227 (July 2012); page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bopearachchi, O. 2007"&gt;Bopearachchi, O.

*Two copper coins of Huvishka bear a 'Ganesa' legend, but instead of depicting the typical [[theriomorphic]] figure of [[Ganesha]], have a figure of an archer holding a full-length bow with string inwards and an arrow. This is typically a depiction of [[Rudra]], but in the case of these two coins is generally assumed to represent Shiva.

==Kushans and Buddhism==
[[File:Kanishka-Inaugurates-Mahyana-Buddhism.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Kanishka the Great]] inaugurates [[Mahayana Buddhism]].'' Illustration from 1910]]
[[File:BuddhistTriad.JPG|thumb|Early Mahayana Buddhist triad. From left to right, a Kushan devotee, [[Maitreya]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and a Buddhist monk. 2nd–3rd century, Gandhara]]

The Kushans inherited the [[Greco-Buddhist]] traditions of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] they replaced, and their patronage of Buddhist institutions allowed them to grow as a commercial power.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the mid-1st century and the mid-3rd century, Buddhism, patronized by the Kushans, extended to China and other Asian countries through the [[Silk Road]].

Kanishka is renowned in Buddhist tradition for having convened a [[Buddhist Councils#The fourth Buddhist council|great Buddhist council]] in [[Kashmir]]. Along with his predecessors in the region, the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (Milinda) and the Indian emperors [[Ashoka]] and [[Harsha|Harsha Vardhana]], Kanishka is considered by Buddhism as one of its greatest benefactors.

During the 1st century AD, Buddhist books were being produced and carried by monks, and their trader patrons. Also, monasteries were being established along these land routes that went from China and other parts of Asia. With the development of Buddhist books, it caused a new written language called Gandhara. Gandhara consists of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Scholars are said to have found many Buddhist scrolls that contained the Gandhari language.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of Huvishka corresponds to the first known epigraphic evidence of the Buddha [[Amitabha]], on the bottom part of a 2nd-century statue which has been found in Govindo-Nagar, and now at the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] Museum. The statue is dated to "the 28th year of the reign of Huvishka", and dedicated to "Amitabha Buddha" by a family of merchants. There is also some evidence that Huvishka himself was a follower of [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahāyāna Buddhism]]. A [[Sanskrit]] manuscript fragment in the [[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Collection]] describes Huvishka as one who has "set forth in the Mahāyāna."&lt;ref&gt;Neelis, Jason. ''Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks.'' 2010. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kushan art===
[[File:Taxila. Standing Female. 88.194.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Standing Female, 1st century CE Terracotta. This lively female figure comes from an area of Pakistan where merchants from around the Mediterranean had long maintained trading posts. The area, known in antiquity as Gandhara, developed an unusual hybrid style of art and culture that was at once Hellenic and Indic. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The art and culture of Gandhara, at the crossroads of the Kushan hegemony, continued the traditions of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] and are the best known expressions of Kushan influences to Westerners. Several direct depictions of Kushans are known from Gandhara, where they are represented with a tunic, belt and trousers and play the role of devotees to the Buddha, as well as the [[Bodhisattva]] and future Buddha Maitreya.

During the Kushan Empire, many images of [[Gandhara]] share a strong resemblance to the features of Greek, Syrian, Persian and Indian figures. These Western-looking stylistic signatures often include heavy drapery and curly hair,&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art: guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=51|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a composite (the Greeks, for example, often possessed curly hair).

In the iconography, they are never associated however with the very Hellenistic "Standing Buddha" statues, which might therefore correspond to an earlier historical period.

==Contacts with Rome==
{{Main|Roman trade with India}}
[[File:BegramGladiator.JPG|thumb|150px|Greco-Roman [[gladiator]] on a glass vessel, Begram, 2nd century]]
Several Roman sources describe the visit of ambassadors from the Kings of Bactria and India during the 2nd century, probably referring to the Kushans.

[[File:TrajanCoinAhinposhBuddhistMonasteryAfghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Coin of the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], found together with coins of Kanishka the Great at the [[Ahin Posh]] Monastery]]
[[Historia Augusta]], speaking of [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]] (117–138) tells:

{{quote|''Reges Bactrianorum legatos ad eum, amicitiae petendae causa, supplices miserunt''
"The kings of the Bactrians sent supplicant ambassadors to him, to seek his friendship."}}

Also in 138, according to [[Aurelius Victor]] (''Epitome''‚ XV, 4), and [[Appian]] (''Praef.'', 7), [[Antoninus Pius]], successor to Hadrian, received some Indian, Bactrian, and [[Hyrcanian]] ambassadors.

{{quote|"Precious things from ''Da Qin'' [the Roman Empire] can be found there [in Tianzhu or Northwestern India], as well as fine [[cotton]] cloths, fine wool carpets, perfumes of all sorts, [[sugar candy]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[ginger]], and black salt."|Hou Hanshu&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The summer capital of the Kushan Empire in Begram has yielded a considerable amount of goods imported from the Roman Empire--in particular, various types of glassware.

==Contacts with China==
[[File:Eurasia in 2nd Century.png|thumb|Map showing the four empires of Eurasia in 2nd Century AD. Kushan shared a border with the Chinese empire of Han.]]
[[File:KanishkaICoinFoundInKhotan.jpg|thumb|A bronze coin of Kanishka the Great found in [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]], [[Tarim Basin]]]]
During the 1st and 2nd century, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the Tarim Basin, their original grounds, putting them at the center of the profitable Central Asian commerce with the Roman Empire. They are related to have collaborated militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly when they collaborated with the [[Han Dynasty]] general [[Ban Chao]] against the Sogdians in 84, when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of Kashgar.&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 5-6"&gt;de Crespigny, Rafe. (2007). ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220&amp;nbsp;AD)''. Leiden: Koninklijke Brill. page 5-6. {{ISBN|90-04-15605-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 85, they also assisted the Chinese general in an attack on [[Turpan]], east of the Tarim Basin.

[[File:Lokaksema.jpg|thumb|140px|left|The Kushan Buddhist monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], first known translator of Buddhist [[Mahayana]] scriptures into Chinese, c. 170]]
In recognition for their support to the Chinese, the Kushans requested a Han princess, but were denied,&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 5-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=torday1997-393&gt;Torday, Laszlo. (1997). ''Mounted Archers: The Beginnings of Central Asian History''. Durham: The Durham Academic Press. page 393. {{ISBN|1-900838-03-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even after they had sent presents to the Chinese court. In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in 86 with a force of 70,000, but were defeated by a smaller Chinese force.&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 5-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=torday1997-393/&gt; The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire during the reign of emperor [[Emperor He of Han China|He of Han]] (89–106).

Later, around 116, the Kushans under Kanishka established a kingdom centered on Kashgar, also taking control of Khotan and Yarkand, which were Chinese dependencies in the Tarim Basin, modern Xinjiang. They introduced the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] script, the Indian Prakrit language for administration, and expanded the influence of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] which developed into [[Serindian art]].

[[File:Eastern Han ingot imprints with barbarous Greek inscriptions.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern Han]] inscriptions on lead ingot, using barbarous Greek alphabet in the style of the [[Kushans]], excavated in [[Shaanxi]], 1st-2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Cribb, 1974, "Chinese lead ingots with barbarous Greek inscriptions in Coin Hoards" pp.76-8 [https://www.academia.edu/33859218/Chinese_lead_ingots_with_barbarous_Greek_inscriptions_in_Coin_Hoards_vol.IV_London_1978_pp.76-8?auto=download]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Kushans are again recorded to have sent presents to the Chinese court in 158–159 during the reign of emperor [[Emperor Huan of Han China|Huan of Han]].

Following these interactions, cultural exchanges further increased, and Kushan Buddhist missionaries, such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], became active in the Chinese capital cities of [[Loyang]] and sometimes [[Nanjing]], where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They were the first recorded promoters of Hinayana and Mahayana scriptures in China, greatly contributing to the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]].

==Decline==
[[File:Hormizd I Kushanshah on the Naqsh-e Rustam Bahram II panel.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hormizd I Kushanshah]] (277-286 CE), king of the [[Indo-Sasanians]], maintained [[Sasanian]] rule in former Kushan territories of the northwest. [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] [[Bahram II]] panel.]]
After the death of Vasudeva I in 225, the Kushan empire split into western and eastern halves. The Western Kushans (in Afghanistan) were soon subjugated by the Persian [[Sasanian Empire]] and lost [[Sogdiana]], [[Bactria]], and [[Gandhara]] to them. The Sasanians deposed the Western dynasty and replaced them with Persian vassals known as the [[Kushansha]]s (also called [[Indo-Sasanians]] or [[Kushano-Sasanians]]).

The Eastern Kushan kingdom was based in the Punjab. Around 270 their territories on the Gangetic plain became independent under local dynasties such as the [[Yaudheyas]]. Then in the mid-4th century they were subjugated by the Gupta Empire under [[Samudragupta]].

In 360 a [[Kidarites|Kidarite Hun]] named [[Kidara]] overthrew the [[Indo-Sasanians]] and remnants of the old Kushan dynasty, and established the [[Kidarite Kingdom]]. The Kushan style of Kidarite coins indicates they claimed Kushan heritage. The Kidarite seem to have been rather prosperous, although on a smaller scale than their Kushan predecessors.

These remnants of the Kushan empire were ultimately wiped out in the 5th century by the invasions of the [[Hephthalites]], the [[Alchon Huns]] and the [[Nezak Huns]] in the northwest, and the rise of the [[Gupta Empire]] in the east.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16612">This page shows the '''best-selling Christmas singles in the United States'''. It includes artists from around the world, but it only reflects sales in the [[United States of America]].  According to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" by Bing Crosby is not only the best-selling Christmas/holiday single in the United States, but also the best-selling single of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=Guinness07&gt;[http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3315/guinness2007.pdf Guinness Book of Records, 2007 Edition, page 187] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319072130/http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3315/guinness2007.pdf |date=2015-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/8412/guinness2008.pdf Guinness Book of Records, 2008 Edition, page 181]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guinness09&gt;[http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/4387/guinness2009.pdf Guinness Book of Records, 2009 Edition, pages 14, 15 &amp; 169] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226005314/http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/4387/guinness2009.pdf |date=2013-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite news  |author=Roy J.

Its unorthodox, melancholy melody—and mere 54 words, expressing the simple yearning for a return to happier times—sounded instantly familiar when sung by America's favorite crooner. But 67 years after its introduction, some still are surprised to learn that Bing Crosby's recording of the Irving Berlin ballad "White Christmas" became not only the runaway smash-hit for the World War II holidays, but the best-selling record of all time. |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 5, 2009 |accessdate=December 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to March 1, 1991, the only means of tracking sales figures for record albums and singles in the United States was via the certification system of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), based specifically on shipments (less potential returns) on a long-term basis.  From March 1, 1991, through the present day, the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] tracking system has been more widely used to accurately track sales of record albums and singles at the [[point of sale]] (POS) based on inventory bar code scans, as well as digital music download sales starting in 2003.  As of November 25, 2016, the holiday single with the most digital downloads is [[Mariah Carey]]'s 1994 track "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]," which SoundScan estimates as having sold 3,200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite web|author= Billboard Staff|date= November 25, 2016 |title= What Are the Top-Selling Holiday Songs? |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7588783/what-are-the-top-selling-christmas-music-holiday-songs |work= Billboard Magazine |accessdate= November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Best-selling Christmas/holiday singles since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began==

This is a list of the top ten best-selling Christmas singles of the [[SoundScan]] era in the [[United States]] according to the [[Nielsen Company]], as last updated on November 25, 2016.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital download sales data at the end of June 2003.

[[File:Marbas Seal.jpg|thumb|The [[Sigil (magic)|Sigil]] of Marbas. ]]
In [[demonology]], '''Marbas''' or '''Barbas''' is a [[demon]] described in the [[Ars Goetia]].  He is described as the Great President of [[Hell]] governing thirty-six legions of demons. He answers truly on hidden or secret things, causes and heals diseases, teaches medical arts, and changes men into other shapes. He is depicted as a great lion that, under the conjurer's request, changes shape into a man.

The name Barbas also comes from the [[Latin]] "barba", beard, [[hellebore]] (a plant used in [[witchcraft]], especially to invoke demons), and also a male name. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== In popular culture ==
* Marbas is the name of a demon in [[The Priests (film)|''The Priests'']].
* Bob Barbas is the name of a demon in [[DmC: Devil May Cry|''DmC Devil May Cry'']].
* Barbas is the name of the dog which accompanies the daedric prince Clavicus Vile in ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' series.

'''''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''''' ([[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 56), the English-language [[oratorio]] composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] in 1741, is [[Structure of Handel's Messiah|structured]] in three parts. This listing covers '''Part II''' in a table and comments on individual movements, reflecting the relation of the musical setting to the text. [[Messiah Part I|Part I]] begins with the prophecy of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|his birth]], shows the [[annunciation to the shepherds]] and reflects the Messiah's deeds on earth. Part II covers the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in nine movements including the oratorio's longest movement, an [[Aria|air]] for [[alto]] '''''He was despised''''', then mentions death, resurrection, [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]], and reflects the spreading of the Gospel and its rejection. The part is concluded by a scene called "God's Triumph" that culminates in the ''[[#44|Hallelujah Chorus]]''. [[Messiah Part III|Part III]] of the oratorio concentrates on [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s teaching of the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the dead: 12-58|resurrection of the dead]] and Christ's [[Book of Revelation#Outline|glorification in heaven]].

== Messiah, the oratorio ==

[[File:Christopher Hogwood 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Christopher Hogwood in rehearsal in 2014]]
The [[libretto]] by [[Charles Jennens]] is entirely drawn from the Bible, mostly from the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]], whereas several [[psalms]] are taken from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].{{r|Vickers 2012}}{{r|Powell 2009}} The librettist commented: "... the Subject excells every other Subject. The Subject is Messiah ...".{{r|Heighes 1997}} ''Messiah'' differs from Handel's other oratorios by telling no story, instead offering reflections on different aspects of the Christian [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]]. [[Christopher Hogwood]] comments:

{{quote
| ''Messiah'' is not a typical Handel oratorio; there are no named characters, as are usually found in Handel’s setting of the Old Testament stories, possibly to avoid charges of blasphemy. It is a meditation rather than a drama of personalities, lyrical in method; the narration of the story is carried on by implication, and there is no dialogue.

=== Structure and concept ===

{{main|Structure of Handel's Messiah}}

The oratorio's structure follows the [[liturgical year]]; Part I corresponding with [[Advent]], Christmas and the life of Jesus, Part II with [[Lent]], Easter, [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]], Part III with the end of the church year, dealing with the end of time, the [[1 Corinthians 15#Resurrection of the dead: 12-58|Resurrection of the dead]] and Christ's [[Book of Revelation#Outline|glorification in heaven]]. The sources are drawn mostly from the [[Old Testament]].{{r|Powell 2009}} Even the birth and death of Jesus are told in the words of the prophet [[Isaiah]], the most prominent source of the libretto. The only true scene of the oratorio is taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]], the [[annunciation to the shepherds]].{{r|Luckett 1992}} The imagery of shepherd and lamb features prominently, in the aria "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd", the only extended piece to talk about the Messiah on earth, in the opening of Part II, "Behold the Lamb of God", in the chorus "All we like sheep", and in the closing chorus of the work, "Worthy is the Lamb". Occasionally verses from different biblical sources are combined in one movement, but more often a coherent text section is set in different consecutive movements, such as the first "[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|scene]]", the annunciation of [[Christian salvation]], as a sequence of three movements, [[recitative]], [[aria]] and [[Choir|chorus]].

=== Music ===

When Handel composed ''Messiah'' in London, he was already a successful and experienced composer of Italian operas. He had started in 1713 to also compose sacred music on English texts, such as the ''[[Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate]]''. He set many [[oratorio]]s on English [[Libretto|libretti]]. In ''Messiah'' he used practically the same musical means as for those works, namely a structure based on chorus and solo singing. Only a few movements are a [[duet]] or a combination of solo and chorus. The solos are typically a combination of recitative and aria. The arias are called Air or Song, some of them have [[da capo]] form, but rarely in a strict sense, repeating a first section after a sometimes contrasting middle section. Handel finds various ways to use the format freely, in order to convey the text. The movements marked "Recitative" (Rec.) are "secco", only accompanied by the [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]. Recitatives marked "Accompagnato" (Acc.) are accompanied by additional string instruments. Handel uses four voice parts in both solo and chorus, [[soprano]] (S), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). Only once is the chorus divided in an upper chorus and a lower chorus, it is [[SATB]] otherwise. The orchestra scoring is simple: [[oboe]]s, [[String instrument|strings]] and basso continuo of [[harpsichord]], [[violoncello]], [[violone]] and [[bassoon]]. Two trumpets and [[timpani]] highlight selected movements, such as the closing movements of Part II, ''Hallelujah''. Handel uses a [[cantus firmus]] on long repeated notes especially to illustrate God's speech and majesty, such as "King of Kings" in the ''Hallelujah chorus''.{{r|Burrows 1991}}

=== General notes ===

The following table is organized by movement numbers. There are two major systems of numbering the movements of ''Messiah'': the historic [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]] edition of 1959 (which is based on earlier editions and contains 53 movements), and the [[Bärenreiter]] edition of 1965 in the [[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]. Not counting some short recitatives as separate movements, there are therefore 47 movements. In the table below, the Novello number (Nov) is given first and is the index for the notes to individual movements in the "movements" section, then the Bärenreiter number (Bär).

To emphasise the movements in which the oboes (ob) and the rarely used trumpets (tr) and timpani (ti) play, the summary below does not mention the regular basso continuo and the strings in movements. Details on the development of [[Key signature|key]]s, different [[tempo]] markings  [[Time signature|time]]s within a movement are given in notes on the individual movements. Movements originally in Italian (It) are indicated in the Source column, however the exact origin is supplied in the notes on the movement.

== Part II movements ==

=== Scene 1 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 1]] is the longest scene of the oratorio and reflects the Passion, in Jennens' words "Christ's Passion; the scourging and the agony on the cross", in nine individual movements, including the longest one, the Air for alto "[[#23|He was despised]]".{{r|Heighes 1997}} Part II is the only part opened by a chorus, and continues to be dominated by choral singing. Block observes that the emphasis on the Passion differs from modern western popular Christianity, which prefers to stress the nativity of the Messiah.{{r|Block 2001}}

==== 22 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 22 behold the lamb of god.ogg|title=''Behold the Lamb of God'' (3:16)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, William Cutter directing}}
'''Behold the Lamb of God'''

The opening chorus "Behold the Lamb of God" begins like a [[French overture]] in [[G minor]], a key of "tragic presentiment", according to [[Christopher Hogwood]].{{r|Hogwood 1991}} The continuo drops an [[octave]], then the violins rise an octave, to express "Behold". After only three instrumental measures the voices proclaim the Testimony of [[John the Baptist]], {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = John | chapter = 1 | verse = 29 }}, which recalls [[Isaiah 53]].{{r|Block 2001}} The alto begins, followed after half a measure each by the soprano, the bass, and finally the tenor. After the initial rise, the melody falls in dotted rhythms, but rises on "that taketh away the sin of the world". The melody shows similarity to the beginning of "[[Messiah Part I#20|He shall feed his flock]]", but "sharpened" from [[Major scale|major]] to [[Minor scale|minor]], from [[Triplet (music)|triplets]] to dotted rhythm, and by the octave leap in the beginning.

==== 23 ====

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Man of Sorrows with Hands Bound - WGA7346.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Man of sorrows|Schmerzensmann]]'', [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
'''He was despised'''

Isaiah wrote in his [[Servant songs|Songs of the suffering servant]] in the [[Servant songs#The fourth song|fourth song]] about the [[Man of Sorrows]]: "He was despised, rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 53 | verse = 3 }}). Isaiah states in his songs that "the Messiah will play a substitutionary sacrificial role on behalf of his people".{{r|Block 2001}} Handel gives the pitiful description to the alto solo in the longest movement of the oratorio in terms of duration.{{r|Heighes 1997}} It is a [[da capo aria]], showing two contrasting moods, set in [[E flat major]] in the first section, [[C minor]] in the middle section. The vocal line begins with an ascending [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] on "he was" and adds another one on "despi-sed", ending as a sigh. The signal of a fourth has been observed by musicologist Rudolf Steglich as a unifying motif of the oratorio.{{r|Luckett 1992}} Handel breaks the beginning of the text up to a stammering "He was despised, – despised and rejected, – rejected of men, ... – despi-sed – rejected", the words interspersed with rests as long as the words, as if exhausted. Soft sighing [[Motif (music)|motif]]s of the violins, an echo of the singing, drop into these rests. Hogwood interprets the unaccompanied passages as emphasizing "Christ's abandonment".{{r|Hogwood 1991}} The middle section is also full of dramatic rests, but now the voice is set on a ceaseless agitated pattern of fast dotted notes in the instruments, illustrating the hits of the smiters in text from the [[Servant songs#The third song|third song]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 50 | verse = 6 }}), where the words appear in the first person: "He gave his back – to the smiters – ... and His cheeks – to them – that plucked off the hair. – He hid – not his face – from shame – and spitting."

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 24 surely he hath borne our griefs.ogg|title=''Surely he hath borne our griefs'' (1:29)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Surely, He hath borne our griefs'''

The dotted rhythm returns in instruments and voices in the chorus "Surely, He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows", the continuation of Isaiah's text, set in [[F minor]]. The chorus continues with the remainder of Isaiah 53:5 and ends on the words "the chastisement of our peace was upon him".

==== 25 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 25 and with his stripes.ogg|title=''And with his stripes'' (1:48)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''And with His stripes we are healed'''

In the same key the chorus continues with a [[fugue]] "And with His stripes we are healed". The theme begins with a sequence of five long notes, which Mozart quoted in the [[Kyrie]]-fugue of his ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]''. The characteristic ascending fourth opens the countersubject. The word "healed" is later stressed by both long [[melisma]]s and long notes.

==== 26 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 26 all we, like sheep.ogg|title=''All we, like sheep'' (3:58)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''All we like sheep'''

Still continuing Isaiah's text, "All we like sheep, have gone astray" is set as a fast chorus in F-major on a walking bass with irregular patterns and leaps. The voices utter twice together "All we like sheep", then two voice parts move simultaneously in different directions on "have gone astray", with the last syllable extended to eleven notes. The next bit of the text "we have turned" is illustrated by fast coloraturas, lacking direction. In a dramatic sudden adagio, full of [[chromatic]] tension, the movement ends on "and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all". Myers comments about the chorus, which seems out of place at first sight: "In Handel’s famous chorus sin glories in its shame with almost alcoholic exhilaration. His lost sheep meander hopelessly through a wealth of intricate semi quavers, stumbling over decorous roulades and falling into mazes of counterpoint that prove inextricable. A less dramatic composer than Handel would scarcely have rendered his solemn English text with such defiance, for the discrepancy between the self-accusing words and his vivacious music is patent to any listener emancipated from the lethargy of custom."{{r|Manson Myers 1948}} The movement is based on the final section of the duet for two sopranos "Nò, di voi non vo' fidarmi" (HWV 189, July 1741).{{r|compositionslist}}

==== 27 ====

'''All they that see Him, laugh Him to scorn'''

The thought "All they that see Him, laugh Him to scorn" is taken from [[Psalm 22]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 22 | verse = 7 }}), the psalm from which Jesus quoted on the cross, according to [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] and [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]. The text is set as a short tenor accompagnato, again based on a pattern of dotted notes in the instruments. The strings through in violent figures after "laugh Him to scorn" and "shoot out their lips", similar to an outburst of laughter. The key of [[B flat minor]] is termed "remote and barbarous" by Hogwood.{{r|Hogwood 1991}}

==== 28 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 28 he trusted in god.ogg|title=''He trusted in god'' (2:08)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''He trusted in God, that He would deliver Him'''

What they say is given to the chorus as a strict fugue in [[C minor]]: "He trusted in God, that He would deliver Him, if He delight in Him." [[Jonathan Keates]] observes that Handel depicts the mocking, menacing crowd here, comparable to the [[turba]]e in [[Passions (Bach)|Bach's Passions]].{{r|Keates 2007}}

==== 29 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 29 thy rebuke hath broken his heart.ogg|title=''Thy rebuke hath broken his heart'' (1:47)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Thy rebuke hath broken His heart'''

The tenor returns to sing a verse of the Psalm 69: "Thy rebuke hath broken His heart" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 69 | verse = 20 }}). Aching chromatic chords picture the broken heart. The accompagnato begins in [[A flat major]], shifts without stability and ends in [[B major]]. The tenor voice, going to report death and resurrection in scene 2, is comparable to the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]] in the [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]] of Bach.{{r|Keates 2007}}

==== 30 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 30 behold and see.ogg|title=''Behold and see'' (1:23)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''Behold, and see if there be any sorrow'''

The tenor [[arioso]] "Behold, and see if there be any sorrow" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Lamentations | chapter = 1 | verse = 12 }}) is based on text from the [[Book of Lamentations]] which is frequently associated with [[Good Friday]], both Jesus and his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], although it originally lamented the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destruction of Jerusalem]]. In the short movement in [[E minor]], the accompaniment pauses rather regularly on the first and third beat of a measure.

=== Scene 2 ===
[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 2]] covers death and resurrection in two tenor solo movements.

==== 31 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 31 he was cut off.ogg|title=''He was cut off'' (1:12)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''He was cut off out of the land of the living'''

In a restrained way, the death of the Messiah is told in another tenor accompagnato, as foretold by Isaiah, "He was cut off out of the land of the living" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 53 | verse = 8 }}). Long chords begin in [[B minor]] and end in [[E major]].

==== 32 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 32 but thou didst not leave.ogg|title=''But thou didst not leave'' (1:32)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''But Thou didst not leave his soul in hell'''

His resurrection is again told by the tenor in an Air according to [[Psalm 16]], "But Thou didst not leave his soul in hell" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 16 | verse = 10 }}).

=== Scene 3 ===
[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 3]] refers in a chorus to the ascension.

==== 33 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 33 lift up ye heads, o ye gates.ogg|title=''Lift up ye heads, o ye gates'' (3:13)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''Lift up your heads'''

"Lift up your heads" is a line from [[Psalm 24]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 24 | verse = 7 | range = –10 }}). Since the text has questions ("Who is the King of Glory?") and answers ("He is the King of Glory"), Handel divides the choir in the first section to a high, announcing group (sopranos I and II, alto) and a low, questioning group (alto, tenor, bass).

=== Scene 4 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 4]] covers the Messiah's position in heaven, following the teaching from the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in two verses, {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Hebrews | chapter = 1 | verse = 5 | range = –6 }}.

==== 34 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 34 unto which of the angels.ogg|title=''Unto which of the angels'' (0:20)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter.}}
'''Unto which of the angels said he at any time'''

In a short recitative the tenor renders the first verse, quoting [[Book of Hebrews|Hebrews]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Hebrews| chapter = 1 | verse = 5 }}), "Unto which of the angels said he at any time", about the Messiah as the begotten [[Son of God]].

==== 35 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 35 let all the angels of god worship him.ogg|title=''Let all the angels of god worship him'' (1:41)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Let all the angels of God worship Him'''

The second verse "Let all the angels of God worship Him" (Hebrews 1:6) is a festive chorus in [[D major]].

=== Scene 5 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 5]] alludes to [[Pentecost]] and the beginning of preaching the Gospel.

==== 36 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 36 thou art gone up on high.ogg|title=''Thou art gone up on high'' (3:32)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Thou art gone up on high'''

Pentecost is referred to rather indirectly, without naming the Holy Spirit. "Thou art gone up on high" from [[Psalm 68]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 68 | verse = 18 }}) reflects "gifts for men" and "that God might dwell among them", expressed in swinging 3/4 time. Originally written for bass, Handel rewrote the Air in London in 1750 for the castrato [[Gaetano Guadagni]].{{r|Keates 2007}} However, the earlier editions (Novello, Best and Prout) all give this air to the Bass, in D minor; the current Novello edition by Watkins Shaw, as well as the Bäreneiter edition by John Tobin and the CF Peters edition by Donald Burrows all give the air to Alto (in D minor), and they provide transpositions for Soprano and Bass as well.

==== 37 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 37 the lord gave the word.ogg|title=''The lord gave the word'' (1:18)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''The Lord gave the word'''

The thoughts are continued in an earlier verse from the same psalm ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 68 | verse = 11 }}) as a chorus in [[B flat major]]. "The Lord gave the word" is sung by just two voice parts, "Great was the company of the preachers" expanded for four parts with long coloraturas on "company".

==== 38 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 38 how beautiful are the feet.ogg|title=''How beautiful are the feet'' (3:01)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''How beautiful are the feet of Him'''

The preachers are described tenderly in a duet in D minor and 3/4 time, as written first by Isaiah ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Isaiah | chapter = 52 | verse = 7 }}) and quoted by Paul in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Romans | chapter = 10 | verse = 15}}: "How beautiful are the feet of Him". Two alto voices begin and are joined by the choir, stressing "good tidings", "break forth into joy" and culminating on a [[cantus firmus]] of one repeated note: "Thy God reigneth!" Block, quoting {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Genesis | chapter = 18 | verse = 2 }}, reflects that you see the feet of a messenger if you "fall prostrate before a superior. In the Bible, when people are confronted by a heavenly messenger (angel) the natural response is to fall down on one’s face before the messenger."{{r|Block 2001}} Handel's original version, a duet in D minor for two altos and chorus or soprano, alto and chorus, was later rewritten by him in 1749 as an aria for soprano in G minor and 12/8 time and in 1750 transposed for alto in C minor.

==== 39 ====
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 39 their sound is gone out.ogg|title=''Their sound is gone out'' (1:37)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Their sound is gone out into all lands'''

Based on a number of Bible references, a tenor arioso describes the preachers further: "Their sound is gone out into all lands" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Romans | chapter = 10 | verse = 18 }}, {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 19 | verse = 4 }}). In another Handel's version (so called version B), which is commonly preferred by performers now, the same text is set to new music and scored for chorus.

=== Scene 6 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 6]] shows the difficulties and rejection of the preaching, based on four consecutive verses from [[Psalm 2]], {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 2 | verse = 1 | range = –4 }}. It is the first text in the oratorio actually referring to the Messiah, the "anointed one" (verse 2).{{r|Block 2001}}

==== 40 ====

'''Why do the nations so furiously rage together'''

An Air for bass in [[C major]], accompanied by an orchestra in continuous motion, tells of the difficulties. "Why do the nations so furiously rage together". The term "rage" is expressed by a long melisma in [[Triplet (music)|triplets]].

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 41 let us break their bonds asunder.ogg|title=''Let us break their bonds asunder'' (1:54)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Let us break their bonds asunder'''

The choir continues the thought; the intention "Let us break their bonds asunder" is expressed in a fast succession of entries of the voices.

'''He that dwelleth in heaven'''

The text continues in a short tenor recitative: "He that dwelleth in heaven".

=== Scene 7 ===

[[Structure of Handel's Messiah#Scenes|Scene 7]] is called "God's triumph" by Jennens.

'''Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron'''

A forceful Air for tenor tells of God's power against enemies, again taken from Psalm 2: "Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron" ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Psalms | chapter = 2 | verse = 9 }}).

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=''Hallelujah'' (3:47)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
'''Hallelujah'''

Part II closes with the chorus ''[[Hallelujah]]'', in the key of [[D major]] with trumpets and timpani. The choir introduces in [[homophony]] a characteristic simple [[Motif (music)|motif]] on the word, playing with the interval of a [[Interval number|second]], which re-appears throughout the piece. Several lines from the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Revelation | chapter = 19 | verse = 6 | range = ,16 }}, {{Sourcetext | source = Bible | version = King James | book = Revelation | chapter = 11 | verse = 15 }}) are treated differently, as in a [[motet]], but unified by "Hallelujah" as a conclusion or as a countersubject in a fugal section. The line "for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth" is sung by all voices, first in [[unison]], then in imitation with Hallelujah-exclamations interspersed. The second line "The kingdom of this world is become" is sung in a four-part setting like a [[chorale]]. The third idea "and he shall reign for ever and ever" starts as a fugue on a theme with bold leaps, reminiscent in sequence of [[Philipp Nicolai]]'s [[Lutheran chorale]] "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme|Wachet auf]]".{{r|Hogwood 1991}} As a countersubject, the words "for ever – and ever" assume the rhythm of the Hallelujah-motif. The final acclamation "King of Kings...and Lord of Lords" is sung on one note, energized by repeated calls "Hallelujah" and "for ever – and ever", raised higher and higher (the sopranos and the trumpets part), up to a rest full of tension and a final solemn "Hallelujah".

}}'''''Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Simpsons-Sears Ltd''''', [1985] 2 SCR 536 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision where the Court first acknowledged the existence of indirect [[discrimination]] through conduct that creates prejudicial effect.

==Background==
Theresa O'Malley was a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] who was employed by the retailer [[Sears Canada|Simpsons-Sears]]. As part of her religion, she was forbidden from working from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. There were no full-time shifts available that did not require work on Friday and Saturday, so the company terminated her employment.

Simpsons-Sears argued that by requiring all its employees to work Fridays and Saturdays, it was not intentionally trying to discriminate against her; rather, it was a neutral requirement it imposed on all employees.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the requirement that all employees work on Friday and Saturday was discriminatory against her religion.

==Opinion of the Court==
McIntyre J, writing for a unanimous Court, held Simpons-Sears had discriminated against O'Malley. Despite the reasonable basis for the requirement, the company did not try to make any changes to the work schedule to accommodate O'Malley's religious requirements.

[[File:Our Lady of Lebanon church, Harissa, Jounieh, Lebanon.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of Lebanon captured from above, by Mikhael Bitar]]
The '''Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon''' ({{lang-ar|سيدة لبنان}}, ''Sayyidat Lubnān''; {{lang-fr|Notre Dame du Liban}}) is a [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Marian]] shrine and a pilgrimage site in [[Lebanon]].

The shrine belongs to the [[Maronite Church#Patriarchate|Maronite Patriarchate]] who entrusted its administration to the [[Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries]] since its foundation in 1904. It is one of the most important shrines in the world honoring Mary, Mother of Jesus. The shrine is highlighted by a huge, 15-ton bronze statue. It is 8.5 m high, and has a diameter of five meters. The Virgin Mary stretches her hands towards Beirut. 

The Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon draws millions of faithful both Christians and Muslims from all over the world. The 50th jubilee in 1954 was also the hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. During these celebrations, Pope [[Pius XII]] sent his representative, Cardinal Angelo Roncalli (later to become Pope [[John XXIII]]) to Lebanon. Pope [[John Paul II]] visited Our Lady of Lebanon in 1997. 

The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries, responsible for the administration, works at reinforcing relations among all local Churches, Christian communities and apostolic movements.

The [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] as well as the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]] have a special devotion to Mary, Mother of Jesus. The [[Maronite Patriarchs|Maronite Patriarch of Antioch]] named her the "Queen of Lebanon" in 1908 upon completion of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryourmother.net/Lebanon.html Lebanon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Overlooking the bay of [[Jounieh]], the shrine has become a major tourist attraction where tourists take the [[gondola lift]], the ''[[Téléphérique (Jounieh)|Téléphérique]]'', from the city of [[Jounieh]] to [[Harissa, Lebanon|Harissa]].

==History==
[[File:Harissa at night (4012881822).jpg|thumb|Shrine at night]]
The Statue of Our Lady of Lebanon is a French-made, 13-ton statue, made of bronze and painted white,&lt;ref&gt;Jousiffe, Ann.  ''Lebanon'', page 146&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]. It was erected in 1907 on top of a hill, 650 meters above sea level, in the village of Harissa, 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Beirut]] in honor of Our Lady of Lebanon. The land was donated by Yousef [[Khazen]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://khazen.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=599%3Acheikh-francis-abee-nader-and-his-son-yousef&amp;catid=114&amp;Itemid=216 Francis Abee Nader and his son Yousef]". Khazen.org.&lt;/ref&gt; It was made up of seven sections that were assembled on top of the stone base, which had a bottom perimeter of 64m, an upper perimeter of 12m and with an overall height of 20m.  The height of the statue is 8.50m while its perimeter is 5.50m. The statue and the shrine were inaugurated in 1908, and it has become a major pilgrimage destination.

==Papal Visit==

Pope [[John Paul II]] visited the shrine when he made an official visit to [[Lebanon]] on May 10, 1997.  He conducted a mass in the modern [[Basilica]]. On December 8, 1998, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the World Day of the Sick would be celebrated on February 11, 1999 at Our Lady of Lebanon in Harissa.&lt;ref name="VII World Day of the Sick, 1999"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/sick/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_09121998_world-day-of-the-sick-1999_en.html VII World Day of the Sick, 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pope John Paul II prayed that Our Lady of Lebanon who had watched over the agonizing suffering of the Lebanese people could help all those who were suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="VII World Day of the Sick, 1999"/&gt;

Pope [[Benedict XVI]] launched an appeal for peace in Lebanon and Gaza by invoking the protection of Our Lady of Lebanon on January 28, 2007.  He said, "To Christians in Lebanon, I repeat the exhortation to be promoters of real dialogue between the various communities, and upon everyone I invoke the protection of Our Lady of Lebanon."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The [[Apostolic Nuncio]] to Lebanon as well as the residences of four [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] patriarchs reside in the vicinity of the shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teleferiquelb.com/profile.htm Profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008121353/http://www.teleferiquelb.com/profile.htm |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, he joined the reporting team of the travel magazine ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'', based out of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].

He also taught American studies at the [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name=gale2006/&gt;

=== Writing ===
{{As of|2014}}, Hendrickson has written five nonfiction books, including a memoir and biographies about [[Marion Post Wolcott]], [[Robert McNamara]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]].

;''Seminary: A Search''
His first book, ''Seminary: A Search'', was published in 1983. A memoir, the work presented his early life studying for the priesthood in Alabama during the 1950s and 1960s. In October 1982, ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy Magazine]]'' printed an excerpt of the book entitled "Fear of Faggotry: Growing Up in the Seminary". The magazine named the book the best nonfiction work of the year.&lt;ref name=gale2006/&gt;

;''Looking For The Light: The Hidden Life and Art of Marion Post Wolcott''
His second book, ''Looking For The Light: The Hidden Life and Art of Marion Post Wolcott'' (1992), gained  critical acclaim. It was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.&lt;ref name="upenn1"/&gt;

;''The Living and the Dead: Robert McNamara and Five Lives of a Lost War'' (1996)
''The Living and the Dead: Robert McNamara and Five Lives of a Lost War'' was published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the book as "a work that approaches a Shakespearean tragedy". [[Steve Weinberg (journalist)|Steve Weinberg]] of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' said that it was "meticulously reported, exquisitely written".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Carlin |url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-12-15/living/25641288_1_first-novel-returns-home-john-edgar-wideman |title=A Drift Of Words The Books That Made A Difference This Year - Philly.com |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=1996-12-15 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was named a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] and recognized as a [[New York Times Notable Book]], while [[Salon.com]] ranked it as the Nonfiction Book of the Year.&lt;ref name=gale2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Salon+Book+Award |title=Salon Book Award &amp;#124; Awards |publisher=LibraryThing |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.gov/writers-corner/bio/paul-hendrickson |title=Paul Hendrickson &amp;#124; NEA |publisher=Arts.gov |date=1968-02-27 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Sons of Mississippi: A Story of Race and Its Legacy''
{{Main|Sons of Mississippi}}
''Sons of Mississippi'' deals with seven white sheriffs photographed by [[Charles Moore (photographer)|Charles Moore]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], on September 27, 1962. The first part of the book examines each of the sheriffs individually, in relation to their families and their home counties, and in the context of the segregated ("totalitarian") society of the time in [[Mississippi]]. The second part focuses on [[James Meredith]], the first black student at the University of Mississippi. When he was admitted, the sheriffs were convened to deal with issues at the university. In the third segment, Hendrickson discusses the descendants of these sheriffs.&lt;ref&gt;See: Review by William Lawson, Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 9.3 (2006) 516-518. Accessed [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rap/summary/v009/9.3lawson.html via Project Muse].&lt;/ref&gt;

While researching and writing the book, Hendrickson was financially supported through fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] and [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. Published in 2003, the book received the ''Chicago Tribune's'' Heartland Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award.&lt;ref name=gale2006/&gt;

;''Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934-1961''
''Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934-1961'' (2011) was published by Knopf. While Hendrickson reportedly spent seven years writing the book, he began informal research in 1980, when he met [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s younger brother, [[Leicester Hemingway|Leicester]] on a [[seaplane]] flight to the Bahamas. During their vacation in the Caribbean, Hendrickson and his wife had the opportunity to spend time with Leicester Hemingway, while researching and learning about the life of the deceased author. Seven years later, while Hendrickson was at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', he began an in-depth two-part series for the newspaper, which focused on the lives of author Hemingway's three children. Based on his 1980 Bahamas research and personal encounter with Leicester, along with the Hemingway series for the ''Post'', Hendrickson eventually began writing his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/09/18/hemingway_s_boat/ |title=Can we ever really know Ernest Hemingway? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2011-09-18 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Allan Massie]] in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Hendrickson spent at least 30 years contemplating the life of Hemingway, prior to writing his book. He spent time researching the life of Hemingway by reading biographies and articles written about the author. He also discussed the subject's life with Hemingway's sons and some of his grandchildren, friends, and associates. Massie surmised that Hendrickson most likely knows more about Hemingway than anyone living today or during Hemingway's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massie |first=Allan |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576572741010152296 |title=Book Review: Hemingway's Boat - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2011-09-24 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their "Best Nonfiction of 2011" roundup, the ''Wall Street Journal'' named the work the best biography of 2011, additionally stating that in Hendrickson's book, "Hemingway has never seemed so vivid or his work so heroic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203518404577097100562141244 |title=The Best Nonfiction of 2011 - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2011-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller]]. It was on bestseller lists around the US, while the UK edition reached No. 3 on the London bestseller list. It was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, while ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' honored it with the 2012 [[Heartland Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/oct/13/finest-life-you-ever-saw/?pagination=false |title=‘The Finest Life You Ever Saw’ by James Salter &amp;#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, the work has gone to seven printings in hardcover. [[Howell Raines]] of ''The Washington Post'' in his review of the work stated that "in the academic field of Hemingway studies, the book will stand as an indispensable document".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/hemingways-boat-everything-he-loved-in-life-and-lost-1934-1961-by-paul-hendrickson/2011/09/12/gIQAM5KVoK_story.html |title="Hemingway’s Boat: Everything He Loved in Life and Lost, 1934-1961," by Paul Hendrickson |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivia Laing of ''[[The Guardian]]'' states that Hendrickson is "a miraculously lovely writer."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Olivia Laing |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/08/ernest-hemingway-boat-hendrickson-review |title=Hemingway's Boat by Paul Hendrickson – review &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review of ''Hemingway's Boat'', she reflects on his style of writing as "twists and turns through time, moving sensitively between the books and life. He understands too the deep allure the ocean held for Hemingway".&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

'''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya''' (Purushartha Siddhyupaya) is a major [[Jain text]] authored by Acharya [[Amritchandra]].{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=xiii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4nAAAAYAAJ|title=The archeology of world religions|author1=Finegan|first1=Jack|date=1952-08-01|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acharya Amritchandra was a [[Digambara Acharya]] who lived in the tenth century ([[Vikram Samvat]]). ''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya'' deals with the conduct of householder (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|sravak]]'') in detail.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=xiv}} Another major Jain text that deals with householder's conduct is [[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]. ''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya'' also deals extensively with the Jain concept of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cj2PZR_vsKkC&amp;q=amritchandra&amp;dq=amritchandra|title=Studies in Jainism|isbn=9780962610523|author1=Duli C Jain|date=1 June 1997 |p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Like all Jain texts first ''sloka'' ([[aphorism]]) of ''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya'' is an invocation:{{quote|Victory to the Supreme Effulgence (Omniscience – the infinite and all-embracing knowledge) that images, as it were in a mirror, all substances and their infinite modes, extending through the past, the present, and the future.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=1}}}}

== Ahimsa ==
{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
Puruşārthasiddhyupāya deals extensively with the Jaina concept of ahimsa (non-injury) particularly in reference to its observance as a minor vow (''anuvrata'') by the ''Śrāvaka''. In "Verse 43" deliberate himsa (injury) is defined as “acting under the influence of passions, an injury caused to physical or psychical vitalities” (verse 43).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33-34}} Acharya Amritchandra then elaborates on the observances that help the householder in abiding by his minor vow of ahimsa. 
Eleven verses (79-89), cautions the householder regarding certain misconstrued notions that people put forward to justify their acts of himsa.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=55-60}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6878">'''James Rand Hummel''' (born September 18, 1956) is an [[United States|American]] [[author]], [[preacher]] and camp administrator. He has worked for many years as Assistant Director of [[The Wilds Christian Association|The Wilds Christian Camp/Conference Center]] in [[Brevard, North Carolina]] and in 2007, he was named Director of [[The Wilds Christian Association|THE WILDS of New England]] in [[Deering, New Hampshire]].

==Biography==
Rand Hummel was raised in [[Orangeville, Pennsylvania]] and became a [[Christian]] at the age of 6. He came from a broken family and for many years lived with his Grandparents. Despite growing up with a lot of anger problems, Rand continued to attend church. Although not a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] at first, he became unimpressed with what he perceived as a casual attitude toward God among many Christians. This led him to fundamentalism, and eventually, [[Bob Jones University]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].

Rand received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Bob Jones University|Bob Jones]] in 1978. Immediately after graduation, he went to work at [[The Wilds Christian Association|The Wilds]], a Christian camp in [[Brevard, North Carolina]] specializing in teen ministry. He was the Program Director there for 25 years. Describing his work, he said "a lot of my job is simply the teens. I preach to them, counsel them, hang out with them, run the games... We actually have the best job on the campsite." Every summer Rand speaks to around 15,000 teenagers who come to the Wilds. He later became the Assistant Director, and in 2007 was appointed Director of The Wilds of New England.

Maintaining a busy itinerary throughout the year, Rand preaches about 350 times annually. He has also written several books and Bible study guides. Much of his speaking and writing focuses on evangelism, the knowledge of God through personal daily devotions, and moral purity.

He has also been part of the [[Bob Jones University|BJU]] Seminary's [[adjunct faculty]] since 1999. He received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the school in 2004.

Rand and his wife Amber have had two [[miscarriages]] and one [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. He said that these experiences drew them closer to God. The Hummels also have two grown children.

In early March 2012, Rand suffered a mild [[heart attack]] and spent several days in the [[hospital]]. He has since recovered and is reported to have returned home in full health.

==Quotes==
* "Make it hard to sin and easy to do right!" (Romans 13:14)
* "You can be as close to God as you want to be!" (James 4:8)
* "Why do we throw a pair of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi’s]] on Christ and bring Him down to our level? He’s a holy God."
* "People say, 'What’s the difference &amp;ndash; 25 years ago and now?' Easy &amp;ndash; sin is not sinful any more. And nothing is that bad. So we need to help them to understand the seriousness and the wickedness of our sin, and see it through the eyes of God."
* "God wants the best for my life." ''(Common sermon theme, often having the audience repeat it with him)''
* "When you put your stick in the fire, you don’t get a big ‘S’ on your shirt or your blouse and you’re a super-Christian and never sin again because you will sin again. This just simply means that I’ve committed my life to the Lord, and it’s a testimony of what God has already done in my heart.” ''(Said at the Friday campfire service during the summer camp program; in lieu of testimonies, campers are encouraged to throw a stick into the campfire to symbolize submission to God.)''
* "Lord, help us to hate sin and love you more." (Common theme in prayer.)

[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in [[Ghana]], with approximately 71.2% of Ghana's population being member of various [[Christian denomination]]s as of 2010 census.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+gh0059)&lt;/ref&gt; The religious composition of [[Ghana]] in the first postindependence population census of 1960 was 25 percent Muslim, 23 percent traditionalist, 41 percent Christian, and the rest (about 9 percent) other. A breakdown of the 1960 population according to Christian sects showed that 25 percent were Protestant (non-Pentecostal); 13 percent, Roman Catholic; 2 percent, Protestant (Pentecostal); and 1 percent, Independent African Churches. The 1970 population census did not present figures on the religious composition of the nation.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;Owusu-Ansah (1994), "Religion and Society".&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious tolerance in Ghana is very high. The major Christian celebrations of Christmas and Easter are recognized as national holidays. In the past, vacation periods have been planned around these occasions, thus permitting both Christians and others living away from home to visit friends and family in the rural areas. Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, is observed by Muslims in Ghana and important traditional occasions are celebrated. These festivals include the Adae, which occur fortnightly, and the annual Odwira festivals. There is also the annual Apoo festival activities, which is a kind of Mardi Gras and is held in towns across Ghana.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

There is no significant link between ethnicity and religion in Ghana.&lt;ref name="stte.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71304.htm | title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | publisher=USA state.gov | accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{main article|Christianity in Ghana}}
{{see also|Methodist Church Ghana|Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana|Roman Catholicism in Ghana}}
[[File:Ghana Mission 247.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Accra Ghana Temple]] in [[Accra]] is the 117th operating temple of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Ghana]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church)]]
The presence of [[Christian]] missionaries on the coast of [[Ghana]] has been dated to the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the fifteenth century. It was the Basel/Presbyterian and Wesleyan/Methodist missionaries, however, who, in the nineteenth century, laid the foundation for the [[Christian]] church in Ghana. Beginning their conversions in the coastal area and amongools as "nurseries of the church" in which an educated African class was trained. There are secondary schools today, especially exclusively boys and girls schools, that are mission- or church-related institutions. Church schools have been opened to all since the state assumed financial responsibility for formal instruction under the Education Act of 1960.&lt;ref name=ci&gt;Owusu-Ansah (1994), "Christianity and Islam in Ghana".&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Christian denominations]] are represented in Ghana, including [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana|Evangelical Presbyterian]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=ci/&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), in addition to chapels, has a [[Accra Ghana Temple|temple]] in Accra, one of only three LDS temples on the African continent.

The unifying organization of Christians in the country is the [[Christian Council of Ghana|Ghana Christian Council]], founded in 1929. Representing the [[Methodist]], [[Anglican]], [[Mennonite]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana|Evangelical Presbyterian]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church of Zion|African Methodist Episcopal Zionist]], [[Methodist Church Ghana|Christian Methodist]], [[Evangelical Lutheran]], and [[Baptist]] churches, and the [[Society of Friends]], the council serves as the link with the [[World Council of Churches]] and other ecumenical bodies. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, not a member of Christian Council, has a strong presence in Ghana. The Church opened the premier private and Christian University in Ghana.&lt;ref name=ci/&gt;

The [[National Peace Council of Ghana|National Catholic Secretariat]], established in 1960, also coordinates the different in-country dioceses. These [[Christian]] organizations, concerned primarily with the spiritual affairs of their congregations, have occasionally acted in circumstances described by the government as political. Such was the case in 1991 when both the [[National Peace Council of Ghana|Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and the [[Christian Council of Ghana|Ghana Christian Council]] called on the military government of the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] (PNDC) to return the country to constitutional rule. The [[List of newspapers in Ghana|Roman Catholic newspaper]], [[List of newspapers in Ghana|The Standard]], was often critical of government policies.&lt;ref name=ci/&gt;

A 2015 study estimates some 50,000 Christians from a Muslim background in the country, though not all of them are necessarily citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane Alexander|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretic religion===

The rise of Apostolic or [[Pentecostal]] churches across the nation partly demonstrates the impact of social change and the eclectic nature of traditional cultures. Some establishments have drum societies and singing groups and the [[African initiated church|independent African]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches reflected in figures for membership that rose from 1 and 2 percent, respectively, in 1960, to 14 and 8 percent, respectively, according to a 1985 estimate.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;Owusu-Ansah (1994), "Traditional Religion".&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Islam==
{{main article|Islam in Ghana}}
[[File:Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosque.Tamale.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ahmadiyya]] Central [[Mosque]], [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]], [[Kingdom of Dagbon (Northern Territories)|Dagbon]].]]

In the north, [[Islam]] is represented and the spread of Islam into [[Kingdom of Dagbon (Northern Territories)|Dagbon]], was mainly the result of the commercial activities of [[North Africa]]n Muslims. Islam made its entry into the [[Kingdom of Dagbon (Northern Territories)|northern territories]] of modern Ghana around the fifteenth century. [[Berber people|Berber]] traders and clerics carried the religion into the area.&lt;ref name=ci/&gt; Most Muslims in Ghana are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], following [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation] retrieved 4 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those following the Maliki version of Islamic law and [[Sufism]], involving the organization of mystical brotherhoods (tariq) for the purification and spread of Islam, is not widespread in Ghana. The [[Tijaniyah]] and the [[Qadiriyah]] brotherhoods are represented. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], a sect originating in nineteenth-century India, is the only non-Sunni order in the country.&lt;ref name=ci/&gt; 

Despite the spread of Islam in the Middle East and North Africa since the mid-1970s, Muslims and Christians in Ghana have had excellent relations. Guided by the authority of the Muslim Representative Council, religious, social, and economic matters affecting Muslims have often been redressed through negotiations. The Muslim Council has also been responsible for arranging pilgrimages to Mecca for believers who can afford the journey. Nevertheless, there remains a gap between Muslims and Christians in Ghana. As society in Ghana modernized, Muslims were blocked from taking part in the modernization process. This is largely because access to jobs required Western education, and this education was only available in missionary schools. Many Muslims feared that sending their children to missionary schools may result in religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Weiss (2004), "Variations in the Colonial Representation of Islam and Muslims in Northern Ghana, ca. 1900-1930".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional religion==
Traditional religions in Ghana have retained their influence because of their intimate relation to family loyalties and local mores. The traditional cosmology expresses belief in a supreme being referred as [Nyogmo-Ga, Mawu -Dangme and Ewe, Nyame-Twi] and the supreme being is usually thought of as remote from daily religious life and is, therefore, not directly worshipped.&lt;ref name="tr"/&gt; 

There are also the lesser gods that take "residency" in streams, rivers, trees, and mountains. These gods are generally perceived as intermediaries between the supreme being and society. Ancestors and numerous other spirits are also recognized as part of the cosmological order.&lt;ref name="tr"/&gt; The spirit world is considered to be as real as the world of the living. The dual worlds of the mundane and the sacred are linked by a network of mutual relationships and responsibilities. The action of the living, for example, can affect the gods or spirits of the departed, while the support of family ancestors ensures prosperity of the lineage or state.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; 

Veneration of departed ancestors is a major characteristic of all traditional religions. The ancestors are believed to be the most immediate link with the spiritual world, and they are thought to be constantly near, observing every thought and action of the living.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; To ensure that a natural balance is maintained between the world of the sacred and that of the profane, the roles of the family elders in relation to the lineage within society are crucial. The religious functions, especially lineage heads, are clearly demonstrated during such periods as the Odwira, Homowo, or the Aboakyir, that are organized in activities that renew and strengthen relations with ancestors.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt;

==Rastafarian religion==

The [[Rastafari]] movement is a movement that arose in Jamaica in the 1930s. Its adherents worship [[Haile Selassie I]], Emperor of Ethiopia (1930–1974), as God incarnate, the Second Advent, or the reincarnation of Jesus. According to beliefs, Haile Selassie was the 225th in an unbroken line of Ethiopian monarchs of the Solomonic Dynasty. This dynasty is said to have been founded in the 10th century BC by Menelik I, the son of the Biblical King Solomon and Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, who had visited Solomon in Israel.

The Rastafari movement encompasses themes such as the spiritual use of cannabis and the rejection of western society, called 'Babylon'. It proclaims Africa, also known as 'Zion' as the original birthplace of mankind. Another theme is Royalty, with Rastas seeing themselves as African royalty and using honorifics such as Prince or King in order to give royalty to their names.

Many Rastas say that it is not a "religion" at all, but a "Way of Life". Rastafari are generally monotheists, worshipping a singular God whom they call Jah. Rastas see Jah as being in the form of the Holy Trinity, that is, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Rastas say that Jah, in the form of the Holy Spirit, lives within the human.

[[Afrocentrism]] is another central facet of the Rastafari culture. They teach that Africa, in particular Ethiopia, is where Zion, or paradise, shall be created. As such, Rastafari orients itself around African culture. Rastafari holds that evil society, or "Babylon", has always been white-dominated, and has committed such acts of aggression against the African people as the Atlantic slave trade. Despite this Afrocentrism and focus on people of the black race, members of other races, including whites, are found and accepted by Blacks among the movement, for they believe Rasta is for all people.

There are Rasta communities all around the world. In Ghana, particularly in the coast, there are many Rastafari places of worship. The Rasta community around Kokrobite is well known throughout Ghana. Many Rasta music festivals occur and Rasta objects are sold.

==Hinduism==
{{main article|Hinduism in Ghana}}

Hinduism has been practiced in Ghana since 1947. Hinduism is spread in Ghana actively by Ghana's Hindu Monastery headed by [[Swami Ghanananda (Ghana)|Swami Ghananand Saraswati]] and [[Hare Krishnas]]. [[Sathya Sai Organisation]], [[Ananda Marga]] and [[Brahma Kumaris]] are also active in Ghana. [[Hindu temples]] have been constructed in Accra.There are about 25,000 or 0.1% [[Hindus]] in the country.

==Afrikania Mission==

Afrikania Mission is a Neo-Traditional Movement established in Ghana in 1982 by a former Catholic Priest, Kwabena Damuah, who resigned from the church and assumed the traditional priesthood titles, Osofo Okomfo. The Mission aims to reform and update African traditional religion, and to promote nationalism and Pan-Africanism. Rather than being a single new religious movement, Afrikania also organizes various traditional shrines and traditional healers into associations bringing unity to a diffused system and thereby a greater voice in the public arena. Afrikania has instituted an annual convention for the traditional religion. 

It has become a mouthpiece of traditional religion in Ghana through its publications, lectures, seminars, press conferences, and radio and television broadcast in which it advocates a return to traditional religion and culture as the spiritual basis for the development of Africa. The Mission is also known by other names such as AMEN RA (derived from Egyptian religion, and interpreted to mean ‘God Centred’), Sankofa faith (implying a return to African roots for spiritual and moral values) and Godian Religion, which it adopted briefly during a period of association with Godianism, a Nigerian-based neo-traditional Movement.

==Buddhism==
In 1998 the first Nichiren Shoshu Temple in Africa was opened in Accra.   Ghana has the largest Nichiren Shoshu Temple outside of Japan. The temple is located at Anyaa-Ablekuma Road at the Fan Milk Junction in Accra. There are other small Buddhist prayer spaces in larger cities, and with a proper request and a small donation, you would be welcome for meditation and chanting.

==Irreligion==
{{main article|Irreligion in Ghana}}

[[Atheism]] and [[Agnosticism]] is difficult to measure in Ghana.

==Freedom of religion==
{{See|Human rights in Ghana}}

Freedom of religion exists in Ghana. A Religious Bodies (Registration) Law 1989 was passed in June 1989 to regulate churches. By requiring certification of all Christian religious organizations operating in Ghana, the government reserved the right to inspect the functioning of these bodies and to order the auditing of their financial statements. The Ghana Council of Churches interpreted the Religious Bodies Law as contradicting the concept of religious freedom in the country. According to a government statement, however, the law was designed to protect the freedom and integrity of genuine religious organizations by exposing and eliminating groups established to take advantage of believers. The PNDC. repealed the law in late 1992. Despite its provisions, all orthodox Christian denominations and many spiritual churches continued to operate in the country.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31613">'''School prayer''', in the context of religious liberty, is state-sanctioned or mandatory [[prayer]] by students in public [[schools]]. Depending on the country and the type of school, state-sponsored prayer may be required, permitted, or prohibited. Countries which prohibit or limit school prayer often differ in their reasons for doing so: In the United States, school prayer cannot be required of students in accordance with the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. In [[Canada]], school-sponsored prayer is disallowed under the concept of [[Freedom of conscience]] as outlined in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter on Rights &amp; Fundamental Freedoms]]. School-sponsored prayer is disallowed in [[France]] as a byproduct of its status as a [[laicism|laïcist]] (religiously neutral) nation. Countries that allow or require school and other state-sponsored prayer include [[Greece]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], [[Australia]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

== Countries that prohibit school-sponsored prayer ==

=== United States ===
{{Main|Education in the United States|Religion in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] are banned from conducting religious observances such as prayer. The legal basis for this prohibition is the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the United States Constitution, which requires that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first part of the amendment ("Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion") is known as the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment, while the second part ("or prohibiting the free exercise thereof") is known as the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause]].

Though each of these clauses originally applied only to the central [[Federal government of the United States|US government]], the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the scope of the entire First Amendment to all levels of government, including the state level,&lt;ref name="mar"&gt;Marshall, W. P. (1999). The School Prayer Decisions. Constitutional Commentary, 16(3), 535. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; thus compelling states and their subject schools to adopt an equally detached approach to [[religion]] in schools.

==== School prayer prior to 1962 ====
In the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, it was common practice for public schools to open with an oral [[prayer]] or [[Bible]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgerton Bible Case]] (Weiss v. District Board [1890]): case in 1890 centering around ''in-school prayer''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in ref|date=February 2016}} Catholics would sometimes object to the distinct Protestant observations performed in the local schools. For instance, in the [[Edgerton Bible Case]] (''Weiss v. District Board'' (1890)), the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of [[Catholics]] who objected to the use of the [[King James Bible]] in [[Wisconsin]] public schools.  This ruling was based on the state constitution and only applied in Wisconsin.

==== A Turning Point: The "Regents' Prayer" and ''Engel v. Vitale'' ====
The media and popular culture often erroneously credit atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] with removing school prayer from US public schools, when the [[Abington School District v. Schempp|case against recitation of the Lord's Prayer in Baltimore schools]] was decided by the Supreme Court in 1963. A more significant case had reached the Supreme Court one year prior, suddenly changing the legal climate for school prayer in the US.&lt;ref name="LAATS, ADAM 1963"&gt;LAATS, ADAM. "Our Schools, Our Country: American Evangelicals, Public Schools, And The Supreme Court Decisions Of 1962 And 1963." Journal of Religious History 36.3 (2012): 319-334. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the [[New York Board of Regents]] developed a [[prayer]] recommended (but not required) for the school districts under its purview. The prayer was relatively short: "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence on Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country."&lt;ref name ="mar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston, Rob 2012"&gt;Boston, Rob. "How Five New York Families Ended Coercive Prayer In America's Public Schools." Church &amp; State 65.6 (2012): 12. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The board stated that the prayer would "combat juvenile delinquency and counter the spread of Communism."&lt;ref name="Boston, Rob 2012"/&gt;

Seven years later, Steven I. Engel, a Jew, was upset to see his son’s hands clasped and his head bent in prayer. He told his son that this was “not the way we say prayers.” Engel, a founding member of the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], brought action along with Daniel Lichtenstein, Monroe Lerner, Lenore Lyons, and Lawrence Roth, all parents of children in the Long Island, New York public school system, against [[Herricks Union Free School District|Union Free School District No. 9]] for its adoption and subsequent prescription of the so-called "[[Christian child's prayer#Regent's prayer|Regent's prayer]]", arguing that it constituted the state-sponsored establishment of religion in violation of citizens’ [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Engel v. Vitale. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930–1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the Regent's prayer was initially upheld in both [[New York State Unified Court System|New York State Court]] and in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], prompting Engels to petition the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in the ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' case in 1962. With its 8–1 vote to make public recitation of the Regents' Prayer in public schools unlawful, the U.S. Supreme Court made its first-ever decision on prayer in public schools. It made its second in 1963—the ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' ruling, which made the corporate reading of the Bible and recitation of the Lord's Prayer unlawful in public schools.&lt;ref name="LAATS, ADAM 1963" /&gt;

==== 1963 and after ====
In these two landmark decisions, ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) and ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' (1963), the Supreme Court established what is now the current prohibition on state-sponsored prayer in US schools. While the ''Engel'' decision held that the promulgation of an official state-school prayer stood in violation of the First Amendment’s [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] (thus overruling the [[New York State Unified Court System|New York Courts]]’ decisions), ''Abington'' held that [[Bible]] readings and other public school-sponsored religious activities were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;''School District of Abington Township, Pennsylvania v. Schempp''. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930–1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; Madalyn Murray's lawsuit, ''Murray v. Curlett'', contributed to the removal of compulsory Bible reading from the public schools of the United States, and has had lasting and significant effects.

Until the lawsuit, it was commonplace for students to participate in many types of religious activities while at school, including religious instruction itself. Nonreligious students were compelled to participate in such activities and were not usually given any opportunity to opt out. The Murray suit was combined with an earlier case, so the Court might have acted without Murray's intervention. With the success of the lawsuit, the intent of the Constitution with regard to the relationship between church and state again came under critical scrutiny and has remained there to this day. While students do continue to pray in public schools, even in organized groups such as "[[See You at the Pole]]", the lawsuit disallowed schools from including prayer as a compulsory activity required of every student. The success of O'Hair's lawsuit led to subsequent lawsuits by Mormon and Catholic families in Texas in 2000 to limit compulsory prayer at school-sponsored football games.

Following these two cases came the Court's decision in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), a ruling that established the [[Lemon test]] for religious activities within schools. The Lemon test states that, in order to be constitutional under the Establishment Clause, any practice sponsored within state-run schools (or other public state-sponsored activities) must adhere to the following three criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Lemon v. Kurtzman. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930–1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Have a secular purpose;
# Must neither advance nor inhibit religion; and
# Must not result in an excessive entanglement between government and religion.

==== Controversy ====
Reactions to ''Engel'' and ''Abington'' were widely negative, and many school districts and states have attempted to reestablish school-sponsored prayer in different forms since 1962.&lt;ref name ="wal"&gt;Wallace v. Jaffree. Great American Court Cases. Ed. Mark Mikula and L. Mpho Mabunda. Vol. 1: Individual Liberties. Detroit: Gale, 1999. Gale Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 7 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, controversy in the courts has tended to revolve around prayer at school-sponsored extracurricular activities. Examples can be seen in the cases of ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992) and ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]]'' (2000), where public prayers at graduation ceremonies and those conducted via public address system prior to high school games (at state school facilities before a school-gathered audience) were, respectively, ruled unconstitutional.

Despite their attempts to present a clear stance on school-sponsored religious activity, ''Engel'', ''Abington'', and the cases for which these serve as [[precedent]] are cited by some proponents of school prayer as evidence of a contradiction between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee v. Weisman. Great American Court Cases. Ed. Mark Mikula and L. Mpho Mabunda.
Vol. 1: Individual Liberties. Detroit: Gale, 1999. Gale Opposing Viewpoints In Context.
Web. 7 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Establishment Clause proscribes the state sponsorship of religion, the Free Exercise Clause forbids state interference in individual religious exercise. Where a state entity moves to accommodate the right to individual religious expression under the latter clause, opponents of that "expression" may cite such accommodation as state "promotion" of one religious activity over another.&lt;ref&gt;Establishment Clause. (2006). In L. J. Fundukian &amp; J. Wilson (Eds.), American Law Yearbook 2005 (pp. 60-64). Detroit: Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Free Exercise Clause, the courts have consistently stated that students' setting forth of religious views through prayer cannot be forbidden unless such activity can be shown to cause disruption in the school, yet it remains beyond the scope of the state to require such practice.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;Preface to "Does Separation of Church and State Threaten Religious Liberty?" (2003). In J. D. Torr (Ed.), Current Controversies. Civil Liberties. San Diego: Greenhaven Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, anyone is allowed to pray in schools in the United States, as long as it is not officially sponsored by the school and it does not disrupt others from doing their work.

''The United States Supreme Court: A Political and Legal Analysis'' discussed the results of a 1991 survey, stating that: "The Court's school prayer decisions were, and still are, deeply unpopular with the public, many politicians and most religions organizations. 95 percent of the population believe in God and some 60 percent belong to a religious organization. In a 1991 opinion poll, 78 percent of Americans support the reintroduction of school prayer."&lt;ref&gt;McKeever, Robert J. ''The United States Supreme Court: A Political and Legal Analysis''. Manchester University Press. 1997. p 34.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of public support for school prayer in the United States, ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' reports, "the public's support for school prayer was translated by various state legislatures into statutes aiding religious schools and practices."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kermit. Ely, James W.  Grossman, Joel B. ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p 1061.&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of multiple polls since the 1970s by sociologist Philip Schwadel showed support for school prayer dipped slightly but remains popular with the majority of Americans, with a recent 2011 poll showing 65 percent support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/03/study-catholic-protestant-support-for-in-school-prayer-falls|title=Study: Catholic, Protestant Support for In-School Prayer Falls|author=Jason Koebler|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American Public Opinion ====
Questions regarding whether prayer should be present or absent in the United States public school system have been causing controversy for decades due to the need to allow religious freedom and guarantee the rights of the first amendment in the United States constitution. Although the topic has many opponents as well as those who are indifferent to the issue, a 2014 Gallup poll indicates that the majority of Americans, 61%, are in favor of daily prayer in the classroom and 37% oppose daily worship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/what-americans-think-about-the-state-of-education-school-prayer-and-math/432687/|title=What Americans Think About the State of Education, School Prayer, And Math|last=Vasilogambros|first=Matt|date=2015-09-01|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results show that those who attend church on a regular basis are 33% more likely to support prayer in schools than those who rarely attend church (82% and 49%, respectively).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/177401/support-daily-prayer-schools-dips-slightly.aspx|title=In U.S., Support for Daily Prayer in Schools Dips Slightly|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, political ideology also plays a role in determining attitudes towards prayer in schools. Those who identify as Republican are more inclined to support daily prayer than Democrats and Independents, as 80% of Republicans, 64% of Independents, and 45% of Democrats are in favor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies show that these numbers have been steadily dropping since 2001, but the majority of Americans continue to support having religion in the education system.

==== British Columbia ====
Prior to 1944, in [[British Columbia]], the ''Public Schools Act'' (1872) permitted the use of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in opening or closing school. In 1944, the government of [[British Columbia]] amended the ''Public Schools Act'' to provide for compulsory [[Bible]] reading at the opening of the school day, to be followed by a compulsory recitation of the [[Lord’s Prayer]]. This amendment appeared as section 167 of the ''Public Schools Act'', and read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bccla.org/positions/freespeech/69religion.html "BCCLA Position Paper Religion in public schools, 1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110224340/http://www.bccla.org/positions/freespeech/69religion.html |date=2010-01-10 }} Retrieved December 04,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;167. All public schools shall be opened by the reading, without explanation or comment, of a passage of Scripture to be selected from readings prescribed or approved by the Council of Public Instruction. The reading of the passage of Scripture shall be followed by the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, but otherwise the schools shall be conducted on strictly secular and non-sectarian principles. The highest morality shall be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed shall be taught. 1948, c.42, s.167&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The compulsory nature of the [[Bible]] reading and prayer recitation was slightly modified by regulations drawn up by the Council of Public Instruction. These regulations provided that either a teacher or student who has conscientious ground for objecting to the religious observances may be excused from them. The procedure to be followed in such cases was outlined in the regulations, which follow in full:&lt;blockquote&gt;Division (15)—Scripture Readings (Section 167)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;15.01 Where a teacher sends a written notice to the Board of School Trustees or official trustee by whom he is employed that he has conscientious objections to conducting the. ceremony of reading prescribed selections from the Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer (as provided by Section 167 of the Public Schools Act), he shall be excused from such duty, and in such case it shall be the duty of the Board of School Trustees or official trustee concerned to arrange with the Principal to have the ceremony conducted by some other teacher in the school, or by a school trustee, or, where neither of these alternatives is possible, by one of the senior pupils of the school or by some other suitable person other than an ordained member of a religious sect or denomination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;15.02 Where the parent or guardian of any pupil attending a public school sends a written notice to the teacher of the pupil stating that for conscientious reasons he does not wish the pupil to attend the ceremony of reading prescribed selections from the Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer at the opening of school, the teacher shall excuse the pupil from attendance at such ceremony and at his discretion may assign the pupil some other useful employment at school during that period, but the pupil so excused shall not be deprived of any other benefits of the school by reason of his non-attendance at the ceremony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1982, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] received royal assent. Section 2 of the charter guaranteeing freedom of conscience and freedom of religion trumped Section 167 of the ''Public Schools Act'' (1872). Sixteen years later in 1996, based on precedent that would be established in [[Ontario]] (1989), required recitation of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] as outlined in the ''Public Schools Act'' would be held to violate the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==== Ontario ====
The challenges to [[Christian]] opening and closing exercises occurred mainly in [[Ontario]] with the crucial case being fought in The [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="chr"&gt;*[http://web.efc-canada.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=734&amp;srcid=190&amp;__nccssubcid=61&amp;__nccsct=Charter+section+2(a)+cases "Charter section 2(a) cases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715001037/http://web.efc-canada.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=734&amp;srcid=190&amp;__nccssubcid=61&amp;__nccsct=Charter+section+2(a)+cases |date=2007-07-15 }} Retrieved December 04, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education (Director)''' The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the use of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in opening exercises in public schools offended the Charter s. 2(a). 1988. (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 641, 29 O.A.C. 23 (C.A.). Education regulations did not require the use of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and there was an exemption provision. The [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal]] ruled that the regulation infringed religious freedom because schools could use only the [[Lord's Prayer]] rather than a more inclusive approach. It was argued that the exemption provision effectively stigmatized children and coerced them into a religious observance which was offensive to them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal]] was persuaded by the argument that the need to seek exemption from [[Christian]] exercises is itself a form of religious discrimination. The judges described as insensitive the position of the respondents that it was beneficial for the minority children to confront the fact of their difference from the majority.

==== Russow v. British Columbia ====
In 1989, [[Joan Russow]] challenged, in the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|British Columbia Supreme Court]], the ''Public Schools Act’s'' requirement that in [[British Columbia]] all public schools were to be opened with the Lord’s Prayer and a Bible reading. The argument was similar to the ''Zylberberg'' case and the result was the same: The offending words in the ''Public Schools Act'' were removed as being inconsistent with [[freedom of conscience]] and religion guarantees in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Further following the ''Zylberberg'' case to strike down use of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in schools,&lt;ref&gt;Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education [Director], 1989, and Russow v. AG [BC], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|British Columbia Supreme Court]] incorporated the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal's]] decision in ''Zylberberg'' in its entirety.

From 1871 to 1989, observance of school prayer had declined.

With the unfavorable court decision, the requirement for [[Christian]] morning exercises was replaced with the following clauses found in the ''School Act'' (1996) in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Act|url=http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/legislation/schoollaw/|work=British Columbia Revised School Statues}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Conduct:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;76 (1) All schools and Provincial schools must be conducted on strictly secular and nonsectarian principles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(2) The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is to be – taught in a school or Provincial school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== France ===
As a secular state ([[laïcité]]), [[France]] has no school prayers. Instead, public servants are advised to keep their religious faith private, and may be censured if they display it too openly. The [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]] goes beyond restricting prayer in schools and bans the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols by pupils in public [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education in France|secondary schools]].

=== Turkey ===
The predominantly [[Muslim]] country of [[Turkey]]  is in the public sphere a strongly [[Secular state|secular]] nation. In this regard, it is much like [[France]], on whose system of [[Laïcité|laïcism]] its founder [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] modelled the rules on religion when he reformed his country in the early 20th century. School prayer is therefore unknown, and suspected religious motivations can cause serious difficulties for public servants. Despite its primarily secular stance, however, courses of religion and morals (which are dominantly [[Islam]]ic) are compulsory to all students during the last years of elementary and throughout high school. In these instances, various [[Salat|Islamic prayers]] and verses are both taught and tested for.

== Countries that permit school-sponsored prayer ==

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Education in the United Kingdom|Religion in the United Kingdom}}{{Outdated section|date=March 2018}}
In [[England and Wales]], the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] states that all pupils in [[state schools]] must take part in a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], unless their parents request that they be excused from attending.&lt;ref name="BHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/education/parents/worship-your-rights|title="Collective Worship" and school assemblies: your rights|publisher=British Humanist Association|accessdate=2009-04-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423190617/http://humanism.org.uk/education/parents/worship-your-rights|archivedate=2009-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of these acts of collective worship are required to be "wholly or mainly of a broadly [[Christianity|Christian]] character", with two exceptions:
* Religious schools, which should provide worship appropriate to the school's religion (although most religious schools in the UK are Christian.)
* Schools where the [[local education authority]]'s [[Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education]] has determined that Christian worship would not be appropriate for part or all of the school.

Despite this statutory requirement for schools to hold a daily act of collective worship, most do not. [[Ofsted]]'s 2002-03 annual report, for example, stated that 80% of [[secondary schools]] were not providing daily worship for all pupils.&lt;ref name="Ofsted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/ofsted/170/05-secondary.html|title=Standards and Quality 2002/03|date=2004-02-04|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=2009-04-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030003158/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/ofsted/170/05-secondary.html|archivedate=2010-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education in England states that all schools must maintain religious prayer in schools in order to reflect the beliefs and traditions of the country, which is predominantly of the Christian faith. However, a recent BBC radio study shows that 64% of children (out of 500) do not attend or participate in daily acts of worship or prayer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14794472|title=Schools 'not providing worship'|date=2011-09-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding public opinion in the United Kingdom for mandated school prayer, the numbers are relatively similar. In fact, a 2011 survey conducted by BBC found that 60% of parents (out of the 1,743 questioned) believed that the legislation that requires group worship should not be enforced at all.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although parents do retain the right to officially keep their children from taking part in daily worship, there are critics who claim the legislation should be changed or discarded completely in order to allow for religious freedom and cater to the wants of parents, children, and staff.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ongoing debate ==

=== Arguments for and against school prayer ===
The issue of school prayer remains contentious even where courts as diverse as those in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[Poland]] attempt to strike a balance between religious and secular activity in state-sponsored arenas.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; Some arguments have held that religion in schools is both an effective sociomoral tool&lt;ref&gt;There Should Be Prayer and Bible Study in Public Schools.

Prayer and psychological health: A study among sixth-form pupils attending Catholic and Protestant schools in Northern Ireland. Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture, 11(1), 85-92.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposing side, others have argued that prayer has no place in a classroom where impressionable students are continually subject to influence by the majority.&lt;ref name="chr" /&gt; The latter view holds that, to the extent that a public school itself promotes the majority religion, the state is guilty of coercive interference in the lives of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Dierenfield, B. J. (2007). "The Most Hated Woman in America": Madalyn Murray and the Crusade against School Prayer.

In recent years [[Yoga as exercise|yoga exercise]] has been introduced into some public schools in the U.S., despite modern yoga's historical roots as a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious practice. Advocates for the programs say they help children to relax and concentrate, but critics counter that the programs violate the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="yoga in school"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yoga causes controversy in public schools|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16859368/ns/health-childrens_health/t/yoga-causes-controversy-public-schools/#.UAsSaWE7Xko|newspaper=Associated Press|date=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yoga in NY schools"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents, Religious Leaders Want Yoga Out of New York High School |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432044,00.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Moment of silence" ===
Despite ongoing debate, there are some instances where religious freedom and secular stability have been temporarily balanced. In the [[United States]], some administrations have introduced a "[[moment of silence]]" or "moment of reflection" in which a student may, if he or she wishes to, offer a silent [[prayer]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' (1984) held that a [[moment of silence]] in schools for the purpose of individual [[prayer]] or [[meditation]] constituted a valid application of the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause]], while a [[moment of silence]] for the clear intended purpose of a state-approved devotional activity constituted a violation of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name="wal" /&gt; In this same case, the issue of school prayer was further complicated by a distinction made between a public assembly attended by participants of their own free will, and a public event where attendance is legally required. A voluntarily attended [[United States Congress|Congress]] may open [[United States Congress#Sessions|sessions]] with a prayer, but schools full of public pupils may not. Here the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has interpreted the issue as revolving around the degree of a government’s ability to indoctrinate its citizens.&lt;ref name="wal" /&gt;  If it appears that participants at a state-sponsored event are more likely to influence the State itself, courts may treat prayer as "legislative prayer". If, on the other hand, the State is more likely to influence participants at its events, courts may treat prayer as "state-sponsored" prayer and thereby rule it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;School Board Meeting Prayer Ruled Unconstitutional.

'''Scientology''' and its perspectives on '''[[sexual orientation]]''' are based on the writings of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of the [[Church of Scientology]]. His statements about homosexuality have led critics to assert that [[Scientology]] promotes [[homophobia]], though these allegations are disputed by some Scientologists.

==Classification==
In 1950 Hubbard published ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', introducing his "science of the mind," [[Dianetics]]. He classified homosexuality as an illness or [[sexual perversion]], citing contemporary psychiatric and psychological textbooks to support his view:
{{quote|The sexual pervert (and by this term Dianetics, to be brief, includes any and all forms of deviation in Dynamic II [i.e. sexuality] such as homosexuality, lesbianism, sexual sadism, etc., and all down the catalog of [[Havelock Ellis|Ellis]] and [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]]) is actually quite ill physically...he is very far from culpable for his condition, but he is also far from normal and extremely dangerous to society...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hubbard | title=Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health | pages=122–123 | publisher=Church of Scientology of California | year=1978 | isbn=0-88404-000-3 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard further defined perversion in his 1951 book ''[[Science of Survival|Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior]]'', where he introduced the concept of the "[[Emotional tone scale|tone scale]]", a means of classifying individuals and human behavior on a chart running from +40 (the most beneficial) to -40 (the least beneficial). Sexual perversion, a category in which he included homosexuality, was termed "covert hostility" and given a score of 1.1, "the level of the pervert, the hypocrite, the turncoat, ...the subversive." He considered such people to be "skulking coward[s] who yet contain enough perfidious energy to strike back, but not enough courage ever to give warning."&lt;ref name="sos1"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hubbard | title=Science of Survival | pages=88–90 | publisher=Church of Scientology of California | year=1975 | isbn=0-88404-001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He characterized "promiscuity, perversion, sadism, and irregular practices" as well as "[[free love]], easy marriage and quick divorce" as being undesirable activities, "since it is non-survival not to have a well ordered system for the creation and upbringing of children, by families." Such "sexual perverts" engaged in "irregular practices which do anything but tend toward the creation of children" and "efforts [which] tend not towards enjoyment but toward the pollution and derangement of sex itself so as to make it as repulsive as possible to others and so to inhibit procreation."&lt;ref name="sos2"&gt;{{harvnb|Hubbard|1975|pp=114–115, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's 1951 book ''Handbook for Preclears'' likewise classified homosexuality as "about 1.1 (covert hostility) on the tone scale", along with "general promiscuity". He set out what he saw as the cause of homosexuality: a mental "aberration", with the result that "an individual aberrated enough about sex will do strange things to be a cause or an effect. He will substitute punishment for sex. He will pervert others. Homosexuality comes from this manifestation and from the manifestation of life continuation for others." The "aberration" was caused by a child trying to "continue the life" of a dominant parent of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Hubbard, ''Handbook for Preclears'', p. 64. Scientific Press, Wichita, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's views on homosexuality were further explained in a 1972 book by Scientologist Ruth Minshull, ''How To Choose Your People'', which was published through the Church of Scientology, copyrighted to Hubbard, and given "issue authority" by the Scientology hierarchy. Scientology churches sold the book alongside the works of Hubbard until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Townsend, ''The Sad Tales of Scientology'', p. 65. Anima Publishing, 1985. {{ISBN|0-9510471-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minshull described the "gentle-mannered homosexual" as a classic example of the "subversive" 1.1 personality, commenting that they "may be fearful, sympathetic, propitiative, griefy  or apathetic. Occasionally they manage an ineffectual tantrum." Minshull claimed they were social misfits:
{{quote|Homosexuals don't practice love; 1.1s can't. Their relationships consist of: 1) brief, sordid and impersonal meetings or 2) longer arrangements punctuated by dramatic tirades, discords, jealousies and frequent infidelity. It could hardly be otherwise since the tone is made up of suspicion and hate, producing a darling sweetness interspersed with petty peevishness. Their "love" turns to deep contempt eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Minshull, ''How To Choose Your People'', chapter 9. Scientology Ann Arbor, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Homosexuals had no redeeming "social value," in Minshull's view. She cautioned that "homosexuals should not be abused or ridiculed. But a society bent on survival must recognize any aberration as such and seek to raise people out of the low emotion that produces it."

[[Jon Atack]] notes that L. Ron Hubbard's son [[Quentin Hubbard]] was homosexual.&lt;ref name=Atack /&gt; According to Atack, L. Ron Hubbard had repeatedly announced that his son Quentin would succeed him after his death, but Quentin died of an apparent suicide in 1976.&lt;ref name=Atack&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = [[A Piece of Blue Sky|A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed]] |publisher = Lyle Stuart / Carol Publishing Group |isbn=0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to cure homosexuality==
There is some evidence that Hubbard's Dianetics movement sought to use Dianetics to [[Sexual orientation change efforts|"cure" homosexuality]]. In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of [[Elizabeth, NJ]] published ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', a booklet providing the results of [[psychometric tests]] conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of X-ray plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured "aberrations" including [[bipolar disorder]], asthma, arthritis, [[colitis]], and "overt homosexuality," and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized [[IQ test]].&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Peggy; Ibanex, Dalmyra.; Southon, Gordon; Southon, Peggy. ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hubbard's 1951 book ''Handbook for [[Preclear]]s'', he set out instructions for Dianeticists to "cure" homosexuality. After claiming that the cause of homosexuality was a fixation on a dominant parent of the opposite sex, he advised, "Break this life continuum concept by running sympathy and grief for the dominant parent and then run off the desires to be an effect and their failures and the homosexual is rehabilitated."&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

Hubbard urged society to tackle the issue of "sexual perversion" (including homosexuality), calling it "of vital importance, if one wishes to stop immorality, and the abuse of children." In ''Science of Survival'', he called for drastic action to be taken against sexual perverts, whom he rated as "1.1 individuals":
{{quote|Such people should be taken from the society as rapidly as possible and uniformly [[psychiatric hospital|institutionalized]]; for here is the level of the contagion of immorality, and the destruction of ethics; here is the fodder which secret police organizations use for their filthy operations. One of the most effective measures of security that a nation threatened by war could take would be rounding up and placing in a [[cantonment]], away from society, any 1.1 individual who might be connected with government, the military, or essential industry; since here are people who, regardless of any record of their family's loyalty, are potential traitors, the very mode of operation of their insanity being betrayal. In this level is the slime of society, the sex criminals, the political subversives, the people whose apparently rational activities are yet but the devious writhings of secret hate.&lt;ref name="sos1" /&gt;}}

In later years, Hubbard sought to distance himself from efforts to regulate the sexual affairs of lay Scientologists. In a 1967 policy letter, he declared: "It has never been any part of my plans to regulate or to attempt to regulate the private lives of individuals. Whenever this has occurred, it has not resulted in any improved condition...Therefore all former rules, regulations and policies relating to the sexual activities of Scientologists are cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=L. Ron Hubbard |title="Second Dynamic Rules", HCOPL of 11 August 1967 |publisher=Hubbard Communications Office |date=1967-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Sea Org]] remained under strict rules according to a 1978 order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=L.

==Current Scientology viewpoints==
Although Hubbard's views on homosexuality remain unamended in modern editions of Scientology books, gay Scientologists have argued that Hubbard and the Church have set aside any anti-homosexual views expressed in the past. In 2003, in the city of Los Angeles, the Church of Scientology sponsored a Multathlon for Human Rights and Tolerance. Keith Relkin, a gay activist and Scientologist, turned over a rainbow flag to the team captain who was running 250 miles through the metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_scie.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The American Church of Scientology published a press release on its website quoting gay activist Keith Relkin as saying, "Over the years I have worked with the Church of Scientology for greater inclusion of gay people like me, and today represents a milestone in that progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/news/2002/021211.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030425104544/http://www.scientology.org/en_US/news-media/news/2002/021211.html | archivedate=2003-04-25| title=Human Rights "Multathlon" Running Team Presented with Rainbow Flag in West Hollywood | publisher=Church of Scientology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Haggis]], a Hollywood screenwriter and director, publicly left Scientology in October 2009, claiming that the San Diego branch of the Church of Scientology gave its support to California [[Proposition 8]], which sought to ban same-sex marriage. Haggis wrote to [[Thomas W. Davis|Tommy Davis]], the Church's spokesman, and requested that he denounce their support for Prop 8. However, the Church disputes this, with Davis stating, "Church of Scientology San Diego had been put on a list of churches that supported Proposition 8 out in California. It was incorrectly included and named when it should have never been on the list to begin with." Davis also stated that the inclusion of the San Diego branch on the list supporting Prop. 8 was the work of a single employee, who was removed from his post and the Church's name taken off the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Hazlett| first =Courtney | title =Spokesman Scientologists aren’t anti-gay | publisher =NBC News | date =October 28, 2009 | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33498755/site/todayshow/ns/today-entertainment/t/spokesman-scientologists-arent-anti-gay/#.UUhNjRzqlX4 | accessdate = 2013-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianprop8"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Brooks | first = Xan | title = Film-maker Paul Haggis quits Scientology over gay rights stance | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = October 26, 2009 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/26/paul-haggis-scientology-prop-8 | accessdate = October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ortega"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ortega |first=Tony |title='Crash' Director Paul Haggis Ditches Scientology |work=Runnin' Scared |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |date=October 25, 2009 |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/10/crash_director.php |accessdate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027221550/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/10/crash_director.php |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphprop8"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Moore| first = Matthew | title = Crash director Paul Haggis quits Church of Scientology over gay marriage opposition | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 26 October 2009 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6436548/Crash-director-Paul-Haggis-quits-Church-of-Scientology-over-gay-marriage-opposition.html | accessdate = 26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 article in the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported that the Church defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=About Scientology |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/18/Tampabay/About_Scientology.shtml |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2004-07-18 |accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melissa M. Wilcox, notes in ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'' that while present-day detractors of Scientology accuse it of homophobia, government suspicion in the early days of Scientology apparently included accusations of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V.; Ashcraft, Michael (2006).

{{quote|The Church of Scientology does not dictate sexual preferences. Scientology is a practical method of improving conditions in life and works to increase a person's abilities, give higher [[IQ]] and better reaction time, greater ability to solve his problems in life – things of this nature."&lt;ref name=Wilcox /&gt;}}

An official Scientology website states, "The second dynamic is the urge toward existence as a future generation. It has two compartments: sex; and the family unit, including the rearing of children. A culture will go by the boards if its basic building block, the family, is removed as a valid building block. So one can be fairly sure that he who destroys marriage destroys the civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =The Dynamics | publisher =[[Church of Scientology International]] | url =http://www.scientologyhandbook.org | accessdate = 2012-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shaktyavesh Avatar''' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|शक्त्यावेश अवतार}}, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|śaktyāveśa avatāra}}'') is a type of incarnation, [[Avatar]] of God as per Hinduism.  "Whenever the Lord is present in someone by portions of His various potencies, the living entity representing the Lord is called a śaktyāveśa-avatāra — that is, an incarnation invested with special power."&lt;ref&gt;Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta Madhya 20.373 | {{cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/373/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824023528/http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/373/en |archivedate=2008-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike other avatars which are expansions (amsas) or expansions of expansions (amsaamsa) of the Lord Himself, a Shaktyavesha avatar is when the Lord empowers a living entity (jiva) with the potency of God Himself.

Shakti means Power; Avesha means endowed; [[Avatar]] means one who descends from the spiritual realm, incarnation. So a Sakthiavesha avatar means a Spiritual person who is empowered (temporarily) by the God to do a specific task. [[Parasurama]] Avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]] is one of the most famous Sakthiavesha Avatar. He was specifically empowered to destroy rogues, demons and evils. He was empowered by the "duṣṭa-damana-śakti" - the power to destroy great evils of Lord [[Vishnu]]. Sakthiavesha Avatar usually happens when the world, especially nature (Prakriti) or righteousness (Dharmma) is in great peril due to the menace of large number of relatively less powerful demonic entity's, be it human or non-human. When extremely powerful evil wreak havoc on world, God himself will appear or appear in his Purna Avatar form to crush it.

The following description of the various types of avatars is given in the ancient Garga Samhita.
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|
Text 16 Sri Närada said: In the Smrti-çästra the great sages who have Vyäsa as their leader explain that the Lord descends in six kinds of forms: 1. amsamsa (a part of a part), 2. amsa (a part), 3. ävesha (entrance into a jiva), 4. kalä (a full part), 5. pürna (full), and 6. paripürnatama (most full).&lt;br /&gt;
Text 17 The amsamsa incarnations begin with Marici, the amsä incarnations begin with Brahmä, the kalä incarnations begin with Kapila and Kürmä, and the ävesha incarnations begin with Parashuräma. &lt;br /&gt;
Text 18 The Smrti-shästra explains that the pürna incarnations are 1. Nrsimha, 2. Räma, 3. Lord Hari, the ruler of Shvetadvépa, 4. Vaikuntha, 5. Yajna, and 6. Nara-Näräyana.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 19 The paripürnatama form of the Lord is Sri Krishna, who is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. He is the master of countless universes. He is splendidly manifest in the realm of Goloka.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 20 The amsa incarnations are said to oversee the execution of the Lord's mission (in the world). The amsämsa incarnations are understood to perform the work of executing those missions.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 21 O great soul, O king, please know that in the various äveça incarnations Lord Vishnu enters (a jiva), executes His mission, and then departs.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 22 Millennium after millennium Lord Hari's kalä incarnations teach and establish the principles of religion, and then disappear.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 23 The pürna incarnations are said to include the catur-vyüha incarnations. They are said to be the places where heroic powers and the nine rasas are seen.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 24 Others say that the form of the Lord where all powers and glories enter is His paripürnatama form, the original form of the Lord Himself.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 25 The transcendental qualities people see distributed among the Lord's pürna incarnations are all present in the Lord's original, paripürnatama form.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 26 The Lord's original, paripürëatama form is Sri Krishna and no one else. Coming (to this world) to execute one mission, He executes millions of missions.&lt;br /&gt;
Text 27 He is perfect and complete. He is the oldest. He is the most exalted of exalted persons. He is greater than the greatest. He is the Supreme Person. He is the master of the exalted. Of He who is full of bliss, who is jewel-mine of mercy, who is a jewel-mine of transcendental virtues, I take shelter.

It is stated in the Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta Madhya 20.246

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|guṇāvatāra, āra manvantarāvatāra

yugāvatāra, āra śaktyāveśāvatāra

"There are incarnations that control the material qualities [guṇa-avatāras], incarnations who appear during the reign of each Manu [manvantara-avatāras], incarnations in different millenniums [yuga-avatāras] and incarnations of empowered living entities [śaktyāveśa-avatāras]." &lt;br /&gt;'''Purport''' The śaktyāveśa-avatāras are categorized into (1) forms of divine absorption (bhagavad-āveśa), such as Kapiladeva or Ṛṣabhadeva, and (2) divinely empowered forms (śaktyāveśa), of whom seven are foremost: (1) Śeṣa Nāga in the Vaikuṇṭha world, empowered for the personal service of the Supreme Lord (sva-sevana-śakti), (2) Anantadeva, empowered to bear all the planets within the universe (bhū-dhāraṇa-śakti), (3) Lord Brahmā, empowered with the energy to create the cosmic manifestation (sṛṣṭi-śakti), (4) Catuḥsana, or the Kumāras, specifically empowered to distribute transcendental knowledge (jñāna-śakti), (5) Nārada Muni, empowered to distribute devotional service (bhakti-śakti), (6) Mahārāja Pṛthu, specifically empowered to rule and maintain the living entities (pālana-śakti) and (7) Paraśurāma, specifically empowered to cut down rogues and demons (duṣṭa-damana-śakti).

and also in that same chapter it is stated:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|CC Madhya 20.367: "There are unlimited śaktyāveśa-avatāras of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Let Me describe the chief among them.

CC Madhya 20.368: "Empowered incarnations are of two types — primary and secondary. The primary ones are directly empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are called incarnations. The secondary ones are indirectly empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are called vibhūti.

CC Madhya 20.369: "Some śaktyāveśa-avatāras are the four Kumāras, Nārada, Mahārāja Pṛthu and Paraśurāma. When a living being is empowered to act as Lord Brahmā, he is also considered a śaktyāveśa-avatāra.

CC Madhya 20.370: "Lord Śeṣa in the spiritual world of Vaikuṇṭha and, in the material world, Lord Ananta, who carries innumerable planets on His hoods, are two primary empowered incarnations. There is no need to count the others, for they are unlimited.

CC Madhya 20.371: "The power of knowledge was invested in the four Kumāras, and the power of devotional service was invested in Nārada. The power of creation was invested in Lord Brahmā, and the power to carry innumerable planets was invested in Lord Ananta.

CC Madhya 20.372: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead invested the power of personal service in Lord Śeṣa, and He invested the power to rule the earth in King Pṛthu. Lord Paraśurāma received the power to kill rogues and miscreants.

CC Madhya 20.373: "'Whenever the Lord is present in someone by portions of His various potencies, the living entity representing the Lord is called a śaktyāveśa-avatāra — that is, an incarnation invested with special power.'

[[Image:Baba dictating.jpg|thumb|Meher Baba dictating a letter on his alphabet board, 1936]]

'''Silence Day''' is the name the followers of Indian spiritual master [[Meher Baba]] give to their practice of commemorating July 10 of each year by maintaining verbal silence for twenty-four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/8625404/Sandi-Toksvig-Sssh-its-Silence-Day.html ''The Telegraph'' 10 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 10, 1925 until his death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/674313 University of Chicago Journals, ''Signs and Society'', Vol. 2 S 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Charles C. (1993). ''Meher Baba, the Awakener''. Avatar Foundation, Inc. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba''. Manifestation p.738&lt;/ref&gt; He communicated first by using an alphabet board, and later by [[sign language|hand gesture]]s which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his ''[[Mandali (Meher Baba)|mandali]]'' (devoted disciples), usually by his disciple Eruch Jessawala. For many years, Baba asked his followers to undertake various austerities on this date. In addition to keeping silence, Baba sometimes asked his followers to fast, to pray, to repeat the names of God, and similar practices. In his last request to his followers on the subject, in 1968, he asked only that they observe silence.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba''. Manifestation p. 6633 - "I want all my lovers to observe complete silence for twenty-four hours, from midnight of July 9th to midnight of July 10th, 1968."&lt;/ref&gt; 

While Meher Baba did not establish any ongoing requirement, even after his death the majority of his followers voluntarily keep silent on July 10. 

About his silence Meher Baba wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Man’s inability to live God’s words makes the [[Avatar]]’s teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man has given way to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.&lt;ref&gt;The Universal Message, ''The God Man'', by C. B. Purdom, Second Edition, second printing with corrections (2010), Copyright © Meher Spiritual Centre, Inc. p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tattva vision''' is a technique developed by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] to aid with the development of the faculty of astral [[clairvoyance]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Dawn: A Complete Course in Practical Ceremonial Magic'' as revealed to Israel Regardie with further revision, expansion, and additional notes by Israel Regardie, Chris Monnastre, and others, under the editorship of Carl Llewellyn Weschke (6th edition, (Llewellyn, 1989) {{ISBN|0-87542-663-8}}, Volume IV, book 7, "Clairvoyance, talismans, sigils, tattwas", p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; They were probably derived from the elements, or [[Tattva]] [also known as [[Tattwas]]], of the [[Samkhya]] version of [[Hindu Philosophy]].

==Constructing tattva cards==
''Tattva cards'' can be constructed by cutting the tattva symbols out of coloured paper or card, and pasting on to small cards of about 6&amp;nbsp;inches by 6&amp;nbsp;inches in size. Alternatively the tattva symbols may be painted onto the cards, or a commercial set of cards may be obtained.

'''The Golden Bough''' is one of the episodic tales written in the epic ''[[Aeneid]]'', book VI, by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] (70–19 BC), which narrates the adventures of the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]] after the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="Stookey"&gt;Stookey, Lorena Laura (2004); p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
While [[Troy]] was being destroyed in its last battle against the Greeks, Aeneas left the city and led a quest to find a new and [[wikt:Hesperia|Hesperia]]n home.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007);  pp. 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In this mission, guided by the prophet [[Helenus]], Aeneas arrived in Italy where he intended to found a city for his people. Once there, [[Cumaean Sibyl|Deiphobe]], the [[Sibyl]] of [[Cumae]], then an old woman over seven hundred years old, at the Temple of [[Apollo]], consented to escort him on a journey into the underworld to comply with his wish to see the "[[spirit|shade]]" of his deceased father.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007);  pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stookey"/&gt;

[[File:Aeneas and Charon by Wenceslas Hollar.jpg|thumb| left|''Aeneas and Charon'' by [[Wenzel Hollar]], 17th century.]]

Before entering the [[greek underworld|underworld]], Deiphobe told Aeneas he must obtain the bough of gold which grew nearby in the woods around her cave, and must be given as a gift to [[Proserpina]], the queen of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], king of the underworld. In the woods, Aeneas's mother, the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], sent two doves to aid him in this difficult task, and these helped him to find the tree. When Aeneas tore off the bough, a second golden one immediately sprang up, which was a good omen, as the sibyl had said that if this did not happen the coming endeavor would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007);  p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stookey"/&gt;

Soon after they started their descent into the Underworld, the Sibyl showed the golden bough to [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] who only then allowed them to enter his boat and cross the [[River Styx|Stygian river]]. On the other side, she cast a drugged cake to the three-headed watchdog [[Cerberus]], who swallowed it and fell asleep.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007);  pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Underworld, Aeneas tried talking to some shades, and listened to the Sibyl speak of places, like [[Tartarus]], where he saw a large prison, fenced by a triple wall, with wicked men being punished, and bordered by the fiery river [[Phlegethon]]. At Pluto’s palace, Aeneas put the golden bough on the arched door, and went through to the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]], the abode of those who led just and useful lives.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007);  pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stookey"/&gt;

[[Anchises]], the father of Aeneas, was finally located in the green and sunny Elysium, where the beautiful river [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanus]] flows. Aeneas attempted three times to hug his father, but had no success as his father's shade was like thin air, or empty dreams.

In spite of this, they had a happy encounter and Anchises told his son about the nearby river [[Lethe]], the river of forgetfulness, on the other side of which were a multitude of spirits waiting to be born  on Earth. Over there were those who would be the descendants of Aeneas, and those who would live in the future [[Roman Empire]], such as [[Romulus]], [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], and the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]]. Anchises gave advice to Aeneas, and then led him  to the ivory gate, one of the gates of "Sleep", by which they return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael (2007); pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stookey"/&gt;

The [[swastika]] (from [[Sanskrit]] svástika) is an ancient [[Indo-European]] religious [[symbol]] that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross, with its four arms bent at 90 degrees in either right-facing (卐) form or its mirrored left-facing (卍) form.  The '''Swastika''' (also known outside the [[Indian subcontinent]] as the '''Hakenkreuz''', '''gammadion cross''', '''cross cramponnée''', '''croix gammée''', '''fylfot''', or '''tetraskelion''') (as a character 卐 or 卍) is an ancient Indo-European religious [[symbol]] originating from the Ukraine, that generally takes the form of an equilateral [[cross]] with four legs each bent at 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://sacred-texts.com/sym/mosy/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CambDict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDHCFSRmjSMC|title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|first=Cambridge University|last=Press|date=10 April 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a sacred and auspicious symbol in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] and dates back at least 11,000 years.&lt;ref name="p.97"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC|title=The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols|first=Robert|last=Beer|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments dates from the [[Neolithic]] period and was first found in the [[Mezine]], [[Ukraine]]. 

The [[swastika]] ([[gammadion]], "[[fylfot]]") [[symbol]] became a popular symbol of luck in the Western world in the early 20th century, as it had long been in Asia, and was often used for ornamentation. The [[Nazi Party]] adopted the symbol in the 1920s, and its use in Western countries faded after the Nazi association became dominant in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29644591|title=How the world loved the swastika - until Hitler stole it - BBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades many public swastikas have been removed or covered over, although others have been deliberately retained as part of debate about historical preservation.

== Background ==
[[File:Matilde Moisant (cropped).jpg|thumb|180px|The aviator [[Matilde Moisant]] (1878–1964) wearing a swastika square medallion in 1912. The symbol was popular as a good luck charm with early aviators. A swastika was also painted on the inside of the [[:Image:Spirit of St. Louis Nose Cone 1.jpg|nosecone of the Spirit of St. Louis]].]]

The discovery of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] group in the 1790s led to a great effort by European archaeologists to link the pre-history of European people to the hypothesised ancient "[[Aryan]]s" (variously referring to the [[Indo-Iranians]] or the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]).
Following his discovery of objects bearing the swastika square in the ruins of [[Troy]], [[Heinrich Schliemann]] consulted two leading [[Sanskrit]] scholars of the day, [[Emile Burnouf]] and [[Max Müller]]. Schliemann concluded that the Swastika square was a specifically Indo-European symbol, and associated it with the ancient migrations of Proto-Indo-Europeans. He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorised that the swastika square was a "significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors", linking Germanic, Greek and Indo-Iranian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Schliemann, H, ''Troy and its remains'', London: Murray, 1875, pp. 102, 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/072900tank-swastika.html|title=One of the World's Great Symbols Strives for a Comeback|first=Sarah|last=Boxer|date=2000-06-29|accessdate=2012-05-07|publisher=The New York Times|work=Think Tank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later discoveries of the motif among the remains of the Hittites and of ancient [[Iran]] seemed to confirm this theory, but the symbol was also known for its use by indigenous American Indians as well as Eastern cultures.

By the early 20th century it was used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck. The swastika's worldwide use was well documented in an 1894 publication by the [[Smithsonian]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas [http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/sw/ "Swastika the Earliest Known Symbol and its Migrations"]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol appeared in many popular, non-political Western designs from the 1880s to the 1920s, with occasional use continuing into the 1930s.

Western use of the motif was subverted in the early 20th century after it was adopted as the emblem of the [[Nazi Party]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei}}). The swastika was used as a conveniently geometrical and eye-catching symbol to emphasise the so-called Aryan-German correspondence and instill racial pride. Since World War II, most [[Western world|Westerners]] have known the swastika as a Nazi symbol, leading to confusion about its sacred religious and historical status.

== By country ==

=== Argentina ===

Several columns at the [[Retiro Mitre railway station|train station of Retiro]] in [[Buenos Aires]] are decorated with joint swastikas. The [[Estación Retiro]] opened in 1915.

=== Australia ===

Sydney has two notable buildings using the swastika as an architectural element. The 1920s-era Dymocks Building in George Street, Sydney includes a multi-level shopping arcade, the tiled floors of which incorporate numerous left-facing swastikas. A brass explanatory sign, probably dating to World War II, is affixed to the wall near the elevator doors on each floor of the building, and refers to it as a "fylfot", emphasising that its use in the building pre-dates any Nazi connotations or usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proswastika.org/print.php?news.385|title=Australia: Dymocks Building - Pro-Swastika|first=|last=IRM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nearby [[Circular Quay]], the [[Customs House, Sydney|Customs House]] also has fylfot tiles in the front entrance area dating from the same period, with a plaque to explain the symbols.&lt;ref&gt;TimeOutSydney.com.au, [http://www.timeoutsydney.com.au/thebridge/pleaseexplain/customs-house.aspx "Why does Customs House have Nazi swastikas on the floor?"], 26 December 2007 – 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Britain ===
[[Image:Kipling swastika.png|left|80px|Logo from a 1911 edition of [[Rudyard Kipling]].]]
[[File:Swastikas on the wedding dress, British colony, 1910.jpg|thumb|right|Swastikas on the wedding dress as symbols of luck, British colony, 1910]]
The Anglo-Indian author [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1865–1936), who was strongly influenced by [[India]]n culture, used a swastika as his personal [[emblem]] on the covers and flyleaves of many editions of his books, along with the elephant, signifying his affinity with India. With the rise of Nazism, Kipling ceased to use the swastika. One of his ''[[Just So Stories]]'', "The Crab That Played With The Sea", included an elaborate full-page illustration by Kipling including a stone bearing what was called "a magic mark" (a swastika); some later editions of the stories blotted out the mark on the stone, but left the caption unaltered, leaving readers puzzled.
[[File:1916 White swastika 6d war savings coupon.jpg|thumb | 70px | right | British national [[savings stamp]], 1916]]

During the First World War, the swastika was used as the emblem of the [[National Savings Movement|British National War Savings Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960612/debtext/60612-41.htm Hansard Debates for 12 June 1996 (pt 41)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035123/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960612/debtext/60612-41.htm |date=4 February 2012 }}. [http://itwasjohnson.impiousdigest.com/BritSawSM.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt;

The swastika was also used as a symbol by the [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]] in Britain, and worldwide. According to "Johnny" Walker, the earliest Scouting use was on the first Thanks Badge introduced in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscoutingmuseum.org/swastikas.shtml|title=Swastikas in Scouting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]]'s 1922 Medal of Merit design added a swastika to the Scouting [[fleur-de-lis]] as a token of good luck for the person receiving the medal. Like Kipling, Baden-Powell would have come across this symbol in India. During 1934 many Scouters requested a change of design because of the use of the swastika by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]]. A new British Medal of Merit was issued in 1935.

A bank in [[Bolton]] has refused to remove swastika mosaic tiles from the entry of a branch office constructed in 1927. A bank spokesperson replied to critics noting that "At that time, these symbols were commonly used as architectural decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Joffe-Walt,[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1761998,00.html  "The unfortunate Bolton swastika"], Guardian Unlimited, 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the [[Woodhouse Crag]], on the northern edge of [[Ilkley Moor]] in West Yorkshire there is a swastika-shaped pattern engraved in a stone, known as the [[Swastika Stone]]. The figure in the foreground of the picture is a 20th-century replica; the original carving can be seen a little further away, at the centre-left of the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin J Powell |url=http://www.aenigmatis.com/prehistoric-sites/england/england-3.htm |title=Megalithic Sites in England - Photo Archive |publisher=Aenigmatis.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are both left- and right-facing swastikas on the war memorial at the entrance to [[Balmoral Castle]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Aberdeenshire/BalmoralCastle.html |title=Balmoral Castle War Memorial |publisher=Roll-of-honour.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[druid]]s in the mid-1920s adorned their dress with swastikas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itwasjohnson.impiousdigest.com/luciferianism.htm |title=Freemasonry and 666, the Number of the Beast |publisher=Itwasjohnson.impiousdigest.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Detailed in the 2004 documentary 'The Occult History of the Third Reich'&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Fylfot made into the brickwork on a building inside the [[British Aerospace]] factory in [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] in Wales. It is unknown why the Fylfot was put on a brick but it has been suggested it was done so because it was an ancient Asian peace symbol. The current Broughton site which makes wings for the Airbus has a history of fighter plane construction going back to WWI.

The [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[No. 273 Squadron RAF|273 Squadron]] adopted a cruciform fylfot as opposed to the Nazi Swastika which was a reversed fylfot, which it used as a squadron badge. It was around since the earliest RAF in 1918 and was an emblem for the Ceylon Fighter Defence in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960612/debtext/60612-41.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 12 Jun 1996 (pt 41) |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035123/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960612/debtext/60612-41.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/h273.html|title=RAF - Page not found|first=RAF Details|last=here|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Essex County Council]] headquarters in [[Chelmsford]] features engraved swastika facing both left and right. Constructed beginning in 1928, the building was finished in 1939, the same year Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The architectural design had been finalized years before.

[[Swastika, Ontario|Swastika]] is the name of a small residential community in [[Northern Ontario|northern]] [[Ontario]], Canada, approximately 580 kilometres north of Toronto, and 5 kilometres west of [[Kirkland Lake]], the town of which it is now part. The town of Swastika was founded in 1906. Gold was discovered nearby and the Swastika Mining Company was formed in 1908. The government of Ontario attempted to change the town's name during World War II, but the town resisted and many posted signs "The hell with [[Hitler]]. We came up with our name first!". The Swastika United Church is located in [[Swastika, Ontario]], as is the Swastika Public School, Swastika Fire Hall and Swastika Laboratories, which provides [[assay|assaying services]] for the mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mileofgold.com/swas/100/index.php?id=home&amp;no_cache=1|title=Swastika 100th Anniversary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]], Nova Scotia, there was the [[Windsor Swastikas]] [[ice hockey]] team from 1905 to 1916, and their uniforms featured swastika symbols. There were also hockey teams named the Swastikas in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], Alberta (circa 1916), and the [[Fernie Swastikas]] in [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], British Columbia (circa 1922).

The [http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=6317&amp;pid=0 Traveller's Hotel] in downtown [[Ladysmith, British Columbia]], has a façade decorated with brickwork swastikas. Further north on [[Vancouver Island]], the Japanese cemetery in [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland]] has several grave markers decorated with swastikas.

A repeating pattern of swastikas appeared on a few [http://www.rpsc.org/Library/Swastika/Swastika.htm Canadian postage stamps] that were produced by commercial airlines from 1924–32.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Brown, [http://www.rpsc.org/Library/Swastika/Swastika.htm "The Swastika on Canadian and Newfoundland Stamps", March 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There used to be a swastika brick pattern located outside at the top of a house located at 75–81 Troy Street, in [[Verdun, Quebec|Verdun]], a borough of [[Montreal]], Quebec. A picture of this house appears on page 138 of Hélène-Andrée Bizier's Une Histoire du Québec en photos (2006, Éditions Fides).

The swastika was also used as border art for the weekly pet health column in the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' newspaper in the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Calgary Herald issues, 1914–1922&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===

The Danish brewery company [[Carlsberg Group]] used the swastika as a logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiveprime.org/hivemind/Tags/carlsberg,swastika |title=Flickr Album; "Probably the Best Photo's of Swastikas in the World" |publisher=Fiveprime.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 19th century until the middle of the 1930s, when it was discontinued because of association with the Nazi Party in neighbouring Germany. However, the swastika carved on elephants at the entrance gates of the company's headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] in 1901 can still be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Experience/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx Carlsberg Group Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229160418/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Experience/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx |date=29 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Finland]], the ''hakaristi'' (swastika) was used as the official national marking of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] between 1918 and 1945 and also of the [[Finnish Air Force]], anti-aircraft troops as a part of the air force and tank troops at that time. The swastika was also used by the [[Lotta Svärd]] organisation, Finnish paramilitary organisation for women, which was dissolved in 1944 according to the terms of the [[Moscow Armistice]].

Finnish heraldry does not distinguish between [[swastika]] and [[fylfot]]; they both are called ''hakaristi'' ("hook-cross"). Most ''hakaristi'' devices are actually [[fylfot]]s.

The Finnish Airforce units still wear a swastika on their [[colours, standards and guidons|colours]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilmavoimat.fi/index_en.php?id=624 Finnish Airforce FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025230002/http://www.ilmavoimat.fi/index_en.php?id=624 |date=25 October 2006 }} referenced on 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.fi./ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&amp;pid=36&amp;aid=537 |title=Puolustusvoimat: Ruotuväki -uutislehti |language=fi |publisher=Mil.fi. |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the shoulder insignia of the Airforce Headquarters bears a swastika design.&lt;ref name="Kunniakas hakaristimme"&gt;[http://www.virtualpilots.fi/feature/artikkelit/kunniakas_hakaristimme/ Kunniakas hakaristimme] Virtualpilots.fi {{fi}} Referenced on 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the Air Force changed its national emblem to a roundel but the use of swastika in some other insignia was continued. In 1958, the [[President of Finland]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] inaugurated the colours of the Air Force units which feature a swastika design. The latest colour of this pattern was inaugurated by president [[Tarja Halonen]] 25 October 2005 for the newly formed [[Air Force Academy, Finnish Air Force|Air Force Academy]].&lt;ref name="Kunniakas hakaristimme" /&gt; Also the [[Utti Jaeger Regiment]], responsible for training special forces, bears a swastika-like emblem ([[sun cross]]) on its colour.

The swastika has not disappeared in Finnish medals and decorations. The decorations of the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty]], designed by [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] – who also designed the emblem of the Finnish Air Force and the Finnish flight mark in 1918 – bears a fylfot laid on a George's Cross. The President of Finland uses a Cross of Liberty in the personal flag.

=== Iceland ===

[[Eimskipafélag Íslands]] (founded in 1914), a major shipping company in Iceland, once used a variation on the swastika as their company logo. The appearance was similar to a blue [[fylfot]] on a white circle. Usage continued after World War II – {{MV|Gullfoss}} in service from 1950 to 1972 had the symbol in a roundel on the ship's prow. Although they have since replaced their logo, the swastika remained on their old headquarters, located in downtown [[Reykjavík]]. When the [[Radisson SAS]] hotel franchise bought the building, the company was banned from destroying the symbol since the building was on the list of historical sites in Iceland. A compromise was made when the company was allowed to cover the symbol with the numbers 1919 which was the year when the building was erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.travelpn.com/images/reykjavik/hotel/0/065404/Exterior_F_1.jpg  "Symbol on Eimskip building covered"]. m.travelpn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Ancient swastikas are found sparingly throughout Ireland, starting in the 5th-7th centuries AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chapple|first1=Robert|title=always-remember-to-draw-swastika.html|url=http://rmchapple.blogspot.ie/2017/10/always-remember-to-draw-swastika.html|website=rmchapple.blogspot.ie|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Dublin]], Ireland, a laundry company known as the ''[[Swastika Laundry]]'' existed for many years in [[Dartry]] and [[Ballsbridge]] (both on the river [[River Dodder|Dodder]]) on the south side of the city. It was founded in 1888 as the Dublin Laundry Company.&lt;ref name="askaboutireland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/transport/20th-century-transport-in/electricbattery-powered-v/index.xml |title=Electric/Battery Powered Vehicles (a vehicle made up to look like such a van, for the purposes of a television drama) |publisher=Ask About Ireland |accessdate=13 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the outbreak of World War II
in 1939, the company's customers were concerned about the company's name. Accordingly, it was changed to "Swastika Laundry (1912) Ltd". The company's fleet of electric delivery vans were red, and featured a black swastika on a white background.&lt;ref name="askaboutireland"/&gt;

The business started in the early 20th century and continued up until recent times. The Laundry's tall chimneystack was emblazoned with a large white Swastika, a protected structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dublin City Development Plan 2005–2011: Volume 3  –  The Record of Protected Structures |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] |date=14 March 2005 |url=http://www.dublincity.ie/Planning/HeritageConservation/Conservation/Documents/VOLUME%203.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711030807/http://www.dublincity.ie/Planning/HeritageConservation/Conservation/Documents/VOLUME%203.pdf |archive-date=11 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was clearly visible from the surrounding streets. The name and logo eventually disappeared when the laundry was absorbed into the ''Spring Grove'' company.

In his [[Irish journal|''Irisches Tagebuch'' (''Irish Journal'')]], the future Nobel Laureate, [[Heinrich Böll]] writes about a year spent living in the west of Ireland in the 1950s. While in Dublin before heading to Co. Mayo, he…
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"was almost run over by a bright-red panel truck whose sole decoration was a big swastika.  Had someone sold ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' delivery trucks here, or did the ''Völkischer Beobachter'' still have a branch office here? This one looked exactly like those I remembered; but the driver crossed himself as he smilingly signalled to me to proceed, and on closer inspection I saw what had happened. It was simply the "Swastika Laundry", which had painted the year of its founding, 1912, clearly beneath the swastika; but the mere possibility that it might have been one of those others was enough to take my breath away."&lt;ref&gt;"Irish Journal" translated by Leila Vennewitz (Abacus, London, 1983) pp.21–2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Latvia ===

In [[Latvia]], too, the swastika (known as Fire Cross, {{lang-lv|ugunskrusts}}, or Thunder Cross, {{lang-lv|pērkonkrusts}}) was used as the marking of the [[Latvian Air Force]] between 1918 and 1934, as well as in insignias of some military units.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Gutterman, [http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/lv%5Eair.html Latvia: Aircraft Marking], 20 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as a symbol by the Latvian fascist movement [[Pērkonkrusts]], as well as by other organisations.

Latvian left-facing swastika or Thunder Cross dates back to [[Bronze Age]]. It is widely seen scratched on the surfaces like rocks, weapons and pottery as a protector sign. To avoid diplomatic embarrassment, Latvian officials were asked by [[NATO]] not to put swastikas on mittens and other gifts to delegates at a summit in the country in 2006.&lt;ref name=natomittens&gt;Laura Sheeter [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5268950.stm "No swastikas" for Nato mittens] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===

The iron balconies of the building facing Veiten in Bergen are also decorated with swastikas. One may think they date back from the war, as they face the old Gestapo headquarters in Bergen, but they are actually twenty years older.&lt;ref name=Swastikabalcony&gt;Kjell Tjensvoll [https://www.flickr.com/photos/tjensvoll/3597182327] Flickr Image&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
[[Image:KorpusowkaPodhalanczykow.png|thumb|60px|right|The ''highlander cross'' was the sign of Polish 21st and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions]][[Image:Herb Boreyko.jpg|left|90px|thumb|[[Boreyko Coat of Arms]]]] [[File:Kamień Karłowicza a1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Karłowicz's Stone in the Tatra Mountains.]]

Since the early [[Middle Ages]] the sign of the swastika was well established among all [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands. Known as ''swarzyca'',{{Citation needed|reason=This random site was in the text https://slowianskibestiariusz.pl/en/symbols/svarga-kolovrat/|date=January 2018}} it was primarily associated with one of the Slavic gods named [[Svarog]].

With time the association with Slavic gods faded, but the swastika was preserved both as a personal symbol of various personalities, such as the [[Boreyko Coat of Arms]], and in folk culture, for example, in the region of [[Podhale]], where the swastika was used as a [[Amulet|talisman]] well into the 20th century. As a solar symbol, it was painted or carved on various parts of houses in the [[Tatra Mountains]] and was thought to save the household from evil.

The ancient symbol used by the [[Góral]] societies was adopted by the [[Podhale rifles|Polish mountain infantry units]] in the 1920s.
It was adopted as a regimental insignia by the artillery units of the [[Polish 21st Infantry Division|21st]] and [[Polish 22nd Infantry Division|22nd Infantry Divisions]], as well as by the soldiers of the 4th Legions' Infantry, the 2nd and the 4th Podhale Rifles. A distinctive blue swastika was a background emblem of the Air defence and Anti-gas League (1928–1939, LOPP), which had circa 1.5 million members in 1937.

Outside of the military traditions, the mountaineer's swastika also influenced a number of other symbols and logos used on Polish soil. Among such was the logo of the IGNIS publishing company (est. 1822), and the personal symbol of [[Mieczysław Karłowicz]], a notable composer and admirer of the Tatras. After his death in the mountains in 1909, the place of his death was marked by a memorial stone and a swastika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawnetatry.pl/pomnik.htm|title=Z uroczystości odsłonięcia pomnika Mieczysława Karłowicza - Górale i Tatry na starych fotografiach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a painting of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Thor]] fighting [[Jötunn|jǫtnar]], by the Swedish artist [[Mårten Eskil Winge]] from 1872, a swastika is clearly visible in his belt.

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] company [[ASEA]], now a part of [[Asea Brown Boveri]], used the swastika in its logo from the 1890s to 1933, when it was removed from the logo.

=== United States ===

==== As a Native American symbol ====
[[Image:Arizona highway marker.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Arizona state highway marker from the late 1920s.]][[File:Basketball team on Home 1 Steps, 1909 - NARA - 251717.tif|120px|thumb|[[Chilocco Indian Agricultural School]] basketball team in 1909.]]

Because this was a popular symbol with the [[Navajo people]], the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] marked its state highways with signs featuring a right-facing swastika superimposed on an arrowhead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizonaroads.com/maps/ Maps], arizonaroads.com, accessed 5 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, after the United States entered World War Two, the department replaced the signs.

The original Penobscot Building in Detroit, Michigan, completed about 1906, "was named after the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot Indian tribe]] and region of [[Maine]], the boyhood home of one of the investors. An interesting feature in the Indian-themed detail of the building is the occasional appearance of a swastika, a symbol important to the Penobscots long before it was adopted by the Nazi party."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/~jimmoran/detphot/penobscot.html Merit Network Inc Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715203557/http://www.merit.edu/~jimmoran/detphot/penobscot.html |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative symbols feature right-facing arms and are tilted in the same manner as the Nazi flag, leading to confusion over their origin.

The [[U.S. Army]] [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry Regiment]] coat of arms includes a number of historic symbols. A tepee with small, left facing swastikas represents the unit's campaigns in the Indian Wars of the late 19th century. The Regiment fought German forces during World War II, landing on [[D-Day]] at [[Utah Beach]], through five European campaigns and received a Presidential Unit Citation for action during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

==== In popular culture ====

The swastika is seen on binders of pre-Nazi era publications of works by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Both left and right orientations were used.

Two white swastika symbols on an Indian blanket made an appearance in the 1922 [[Buster Keaton]] silent movie "[[The Paleface (1922 film)|The Paleface]]". A newspaper columnist noted Nazis had adopted the swastika in 1920, prior to the film's release but that "Only a bonehead would read anything sinister into that coincidence."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Iddings, The Muskegon Chronicle, Oct 10, 2011 [http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/muskegon/index.ssf/2011/10/extra_iiddings_a_cow_steals_th.html  "Extra Iddings: A cow steals the show. What's with the swastikas?" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Publisher [[Harold Hersey]] adopted a blue swastika as a symbol for his line of [[pulp magazines]], Magazine Publishers.
When the company was purchased by [[A. A. Wyn]] in 1929, the swastika was replaced with an [[Ace of Spades]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert

Swastika quilt patterns were popular in America prior to World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Nevada Department of Cultural Affairs, [http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/MUSEUMS/cc/russellexhibits/quilts/quilt2.htm Swastika quilt]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the [http://www.greeleygov.com/museums/default.aspx Greeley Museums] in [[Greeley, Colorado]] received a donated quilt covered in 27 swastikas, believed to date to around 1900. "The swastika [[quilt-block]] pattern is also known as the Battle X of Thor, Catch Me If You Can, Devil's Dark Horse, Whirligig and Zig Zag" according to the museum registrar. The quilt was not put on general display while museum officials considered how to provide context.&lt;ref&gt;Monte Whaley, "Swastika quilt donated to Greeley Museums is quirk of history," Denver Post, 28 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A quilt with swastika-like pattern dating to 1927 was removed from display from a [[Havre, Montana]] museum in December 2010 after complaints from the public. A group of residents of the Bear's Paw Mountains had embroidered their names in the historic quilt, a gift for an ill neighbor. "It was a very, very nice quilt and the story behind it was absolutely heartwarming" according to a member of the museum foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Leeds, [http://www.havredailynews.com/cms/news/story-209062.html "Swastika-like display causes controversy.

The printer responded, "I've used the swastika emblems for ballot borders long before the world ever knew Hitler."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 16 September 1937, quoted in [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Heller]], page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel [[The Great Gatsby]], the story of which takes place during the [[Roaring Twenties]], one of the characters runs a business called "The Swastika Holding Company."

==== Use by non-political clubs and organisations ====
The [[Ladies' Home Journal]] sponsored a Girl's Club with swastika membership pins, swastika-decorated handkerchief and a magazine titled, "The Swastika". Their version of the symbol was square with right facing arms. The club was formed at the beginning of the 20th century to encourage young women to sell magazine subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summerpearl.com/girlslhj.htm |title=Vintage KidStuff Online Museum |publisher=Summerpearl.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one [[minor league baseball]] team used the name: the Cañon City Swastikas represented [[Cañon City, Colorado]] in the Class D Rocky Mountain League in 1912. The team moved to [[Raton, New Mexico]] mid-season, then disbanded along with the league.

The "Swastika Club of Freedom Township" was formed in 1923 in rural [[Iowa]], a social club serving farm women. The group produced a "Swastika Club Cookbook" in 1934. Its name was changed to the "Freedom Township Women’s Club" in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Women's Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, [http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/FreedomTownship.htm "Freedom Township Women's Club"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another "Swastika Club" for women met in Howell County Missouri in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Missouri University of Science and Technology, Western Historical Manuscript Collection, [http://web.mst.edu/~whmcinfo/shelf44/r1083/info.html 1921 Pamphlet].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coins, tokens and watch fobs ====

Collectors have identified more than 1,400 different swastika design coins, souvenir or merchant/trade tokens and [[watch fob]]s, distributed by mostly local retail and service businesses in the United States. The tokens that can be dated range from 1885 to 1939, with a few later exceptions. About 57 percent have the swastika symbol facing to the left, 43 percent to the right. Most promise good luck or feature other symbols such as a horseshoe, four leaf clover, rabbit's foot, wishbone or keys.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Patterson, "United States Swastika 1907–1936"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Coca-Cola]] made a lucky watch fob in the shape of a swastika with right-facing arms and the slogan, "Drink Coca Cola five cents in bottles".

The [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] of [[Waterloo, Iowa]] offered a "Good Luck" token featuring a left facing swastika in addition to a four-leaf clover, horseshoe, wishbone and Plains Indian emblem. The company was sold in 1918 and became known as the [[John Deere Tractor]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Kruse, [http://www.bleedinggreen.com/GG2000/gg-09-25-00.html "A surprising symbol in John Deere's past"], Sept 25, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~hou00219 Harvard University Library] has a 1908 leather watch fob with a brass swastika that was created for the presidential campaign of [[William Jennings Bryan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~hou00219 Frederick Lieder political button collection], Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, website 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Swastika tiles ====

Ceramic tiles with a swastika design were produced by a number of North American manufacturers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were often installed in repeating patterns or in combination with related ancient symbols. In western architecture, pre-World War II swastika tiles are typically a minor decorative element and have only become prominent when their original intent or symbolic meaning has been re-interpreted.

Swastika tiles adorn the [[New Jersey Statehouse]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], in a room built in the 1930s. A newspaper article in [[The Press of Atlantic City]] notes that the statehouse tiles were created by the local Mueller Mosaic Company.&lt;ref&gt;John Brand, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224614/http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/newjersey/story/5608571p-5590985c.html "Swastika tiles in Statehouse symbolize luck, not genocide"], Press of Atlantic City website pressofatlancitcity.com, 2 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Herman Carl Mueller]], the firm used an innovative technique that combined [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]] and deep carving to create a photographic-like sense of depth. The tiles were installed throughout the United States and Canada. The swastika design was only one of many different symbols featured in the Mueller catalogue.

A [[Detroit]] columnist in 2015 began a campaign to remove swastika tiles from the [[Detroit Athletic Club]], designed by Jewish architect Albert Kahn in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Golden Nov 11, 2015 [http://detroit.curbed.com/2015/11/11/9901220/columnist-to-detroit-athletic-club-remove-the-swastikas|Curbed Detroit "Columnist to Detroit Athletic Club: Remove the Swastikas"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reprints of tile catalogues, including the 1930 Mueller Mosaic [[Faience]] Tile Inserts catalogue are available from the non-profit California based [[Tile Heritage Foundation]]. Swastika tiles are also featured in the 1920 catalogue from Wheatley Pottery Company of [[Cincinnati]] Ohio, the 1928 catalogue from the Cambridge-Wheatley Company of [[Covington, Kentucky]], which marketed Wheatley tiles and a 1930s catalogue from the Franklin Pottery Company of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania]].

'''Wŏn Buddhism''' ({{lang-ko|원불교}}Circle Buddhism) is a modernized form of [[Buddhism]] that seeks to make [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] possible for everyone and applicable to regular life. The scriptures are simplified so that they are easy to understand and their applications to life are made clear. [[Spiritual practice#Buddhism|Practice]] is simplified so that anyone, regardless of their wealth, occupation, or other external living conditions, can still practice Buddhism. Practices that are considered outdated, confusing, or unnecessary are removed. Because of the major changes that Won Buddhists have made to their practice, Won Buddhism can be regarded either as a [[new religious movement]] or as a form of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Won Buddhism as a Korean New Religion | journal = Numen | first = Michael | last = Pye | volume = 49 | issue = 2 |  date=2002|pages = 113–141 | jstor = 3270479 | doi=10.1163/156852702760186745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations of the name==
The name "Won Buddhism" comes from the [[Korean Language|Korean]] words 원/圓 ''won'' ("circle") and 불교/佛敎 ''bulgyo'' ("Buddhism"), literally meaning "Round Buddhism" or "Consummate Buddhism." By "consummate," Won Buddhists mean that they incorporate several different schools of Buddhist thought into their doctrine; that is, where some schools focus only on practicing meditation (''samādhi''), some schools devote themselves fully to studying scriptures (''prajñā''), and still others practice only their school's precepts (''śīla''), Won Buddhism believes in incorporating all three into daily practice.

==History==
{{unreferencedsection|date=November 2018}}
According to Won Buddhist sources, Bak Jungbin ({{hangul|박중빈}}, {{hanja|朴重彬}}, 1891–1943, aka Sotaesan) attained [[bodhi]] in 1916 and had a precognition of the world entering an era of advancing material civilization to which humans would be enslaved. The only way to save the world was by expanding spiritual power through [[faith in Buddhism|faith in genuine religion]] and training in sound morality. With the dual aims of saving sentient beings and curing the world of moral ills, Sot'aesan began his religious mission. He founded a new religious order with Buddhist teachings as its central doctrine, establishing the Society of the Study of the Buddhadharma at [[Iksan]], [[North Jeolla Province]], in 1924. Bak edified his followers with his new doctrine until his death in 1943. The central doctrine was published in the ''Bulgyo jeongjeon'' (''The Correct Canon of Buddhism'') in 1943.

In 1947, Song Gyu ({{hangul|송 규}}, 1900–1962), the second [[patriarch]], renamed the order "Won Buddhism" and published a new canon, ''Wonbulgyo gyojeon'' (''The Scriptures of Won Buddhism''), in 1962.

==Doctrine==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Won Buddhist doctrine is split into two gates by which enlightenment is attained. The first, the Gate of Faith, is made up of the Fourfold Grace and the Four Essentials, which together make up the necessary ''mindset'' of a practitioner. The second gate is the Gate of Practice, composed of the Threefold Study and the Eight Articles, which make up the necessary ''behaviors'' of a practitioner.
 
===Il-Won: The One Circle===
''Il-Won'' is the symbol that Won Buddhists use to represent the ultimate truth. This ultimate truth is said to be beyond the limits of what words can describe, so the circle is often said to be like a finger pointing at the Moon. In addition to representing the ultimate truth, ''Il Won Sang'' also represents everything we know, because for the ultimate truth to ''be'' ultimate, it must cover everything—therefore, everything must be a representation of the truth. As Buddhas' minds are one with the truth, [[Buddha-nature]], Il-Won is the symbol of the [[dharmakāya]] of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] and of all enlightened masters; it is the true nature of all sentient beings, regardless of whether they have awakened to it or not. That means it is the original source of the Four Graces (heaven and earth, parents, fellow beings, and laws) to which one owes one's life. The practice of Il-Won lies in wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]''), fostering concentration (''[[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]''), and using virtue (''[[śīla]]'') upon enlightenment to the Buddha-nature continuously in daily life.

===The Fourfold Grace===
The Four Graces are the embodiment of the ''Il-won'' in its different forms; that is, all that exists in the universe can be separated into the Four Graces. The Graces are written from the perspective of gratitude owed by the practitioner, so even though parents are a type of fellow being, the debt of gratitude owned by practitioners to their parents is special and different compared to the debt of gratitude owed to other fellow beings.  
# The Grace of Heaven and Earth, which is requited by harboring no thought after rendering beneficence, and no attachment to joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness;
# The Grace of Parents, which is requited by protecting the helpless; 
# The Grace of Fellow Beings, which is requited by learning to benefit oneself by benefiting others; 
# The Grace of Laws, which is requited by doing justice and forsaking injustice.

===The Four Essentials===
# Developing Self-Power;
# Primacy of the Wise; 
# Educating others' children; 
# Venerating the public-spirited.

===The Threefold Study===
* ''samādhi'', cultivation of spirit; 
* ''prajñā'', inquiry into facts and principles; and 
* ''śīla'', the heedful choice in [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] action.
The threefold practice is carried out through [[Zen]], which holds as its central principle that when the [[sadayatana|six sense organs]] are at rest, one should nourish the [[Awakening of Faith|One Mind]] by clearing the mind of worldly thoughts; when they are at work, one should forsake injustice and cultivate justice.

==Scriptures and writings==
Scriptures of Won Buddhism include ''The Principal Book of Won Buddhism'' (''Wonbulgyo chongjon'') and ''The Discourse of the Great Master Dharma Words'' (''Daejonggyeong'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.chollian.net/~cok6789/ Truth &amp; Grace of Won Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213212514/http://wonbuddhism.info/sd/sd_1.html The Principal Book of Won-Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to other Eastern philosophies==
In addition to combining Buddhist schools, Won Buddhism can also be considered an amalgamation of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="soren"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorensen|first=Henrik Hjort|title=Asian perceptions of nature|editor=Ole Bruun |editor2=Arne Kalland |editor3=Henrik Hjort Sorensen|publisher=Nordic Institute of Asian Studies|year=1992|isbn=978-87-87062-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to classical Jewish sources, the '''[[Hebrew year]] 6000''' (from sunset of 29 September 2239&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hebcal.com/converter/?gd=29&amp;gm=9&amp;gy=2239&amp;gs=on&amp;g2h=1|title=Hebrew Date Converter - 1st of Tishrei, 6000 {{!}} Hebcal Jewish Calendar|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hebcal.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; until nightfall of 16 September 2240&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hebcal.com/converter/?hd=29&amp;hm=Elul&amp;hy=6000&amp;h2g=1|title=Hebrew Date Converter - 29th of Elul, 6000 {{!}} Hebcal Jewish Calendar|website=www.hebcal.com|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[23rd century|Gregorian calendar]]) marks the latest time for the initiation of the [[Messianic Age]]. The [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashana 31a and Sanhedrin 97a&lt;/ref&gt; [[Midrash]],&lt;ref name="Rabbi Eliezer 1981, p. 141"&gt;Pirke De Rabbi Eliezer, Gerald Friedlander, Sepher-Hermon Press, New York, 1981, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kabbalistic work, the [[Zohar]],&lt;ref&gt;Zohar (1:117a) and Zohar Vayera 119a&lt;/ref&gt; state that the 'deadline' by which the [[Messiah]] must appear is 6,000 years from [[Anno Mundi|creation]]. According to tradition, the [[Anno Mundi|Hebrew calendar]] started at the time of Creation, placed at 3761 BC.&lt;ref&gt;World Book Encyclopedia, C-Ch, entry under 'Calendar'&lt;/ref&gt; The current ({{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}-3761}}/{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}-3760}}) Hebrew year is {{#time:xjY}}.

The belief that the seventh millennium will correspond to the [[Messianic Age]] is founded upon a universalized application of the concept of [[Shabbat]]—the 7th day of the week—the sanctified 'day of rest'.

The Ten Commandments state (Exodus 20:8):

“Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it. Six days shall you work and perform all of your labors. And on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath day unto the Lord your God, you shall do no work... For in six days God made the heavens and the earth, the oceans and all therein, and He rested on the seventh day. 
Therefore God hath blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it.”

This tradition maintains that each day of the week corresponds to one thousand years of creation: Just as the six days of the workweek culminate in the sanctified seventh day of [[Shabbat]], so too will the six millennia of creation culminate in the sanctified seventh millennium (Hebrew years 6000–7000) — the [[Messianic Age]].

Just as [[Shabbat]] is the sanctified 'day of rest' and peace, a time representing joyful satisfaction with the labors completed within the previous 6 days,&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 58:13-14&lt;/ref&gt; so too the seventh millennium will correspond to a universal 'day of rest' and peace, a time of 'completeness' of the 'work' performed in the previous six millennia.

The Talmud&lt;ref name="Sanhedrin 97a"&gt;Sanhedrin 97a&lt;/ref&gt; also draws parallels between the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical) year and the seventh millennium: For six 'years', or millennia, the earth will be worked, whilst during the seventh 'year', or millennium, the world will remain 'fallow', in a state of 'rest' and universal peace.

The reconciliation between the traditional Judaic age of the world and the current scientifically derived age of the world is beyond the scope of this article, with some taking a literal approach, as with [[Young Earth creationism]], and others, such as  [[Gerald Schroeder]], a scientific conciliatory approach.

==Talmud==
The [[Talmud]] comments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;R. Katina said, “Six thousand years the world will exist and one [thousand, the seventh], it shall be desolate (haruv), as it is written, ‘And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day’ (Isa. 2:11)... R. Katina also taught, “Just as the seventh year is the Shmita year, so too does the world have one thousand years out of seven that are fallow (mushmat), as it is written, ‘And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day’ (Isa. 2:11); and further it is written, ‘A psalm and song for the Shabbat day’ (Ps. 92:1) – meaning the day that is altogether Shabbat – and also it is said, ‘For one thousand years in Your [God's] eyes are but a day that has passed.’ (Ps.90:4) (Sanhedrin 97a).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Midrash==
The [[Midrash]] in [[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] comments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace. The seventh eon is entirely Shabbat and rest for life everlasting.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Eliezer 1981, p. 141"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kabbalah==
The [[Zohar]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the 600th year of the sixth thousand, the gates of wisdom on high and the wellsprings of lower wisdom will be opened. This will prepare the world to enter the seventh thousand, just as man prepares himself toward sunset on Friday for the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar 1:117a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Zohar explains further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The redemption of Israel will come about through the mystic force of the letter “Vav” [which has the numerical value of six], namely, in the sixth millennium…. Happy are those who will be left alive at the end of the sixth millennium to enter the Shabbat, which is the seventh millennium; for that is a day set apart for the Holy One on which to effect the union of new souls with old souls in the world (Zohar, Vayera 119a).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a kabbalistic tradition&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Vayera 119a, Ramban on Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; that maintains that each of the seven days of creation in Genesis chapter one corresponds to one millennium of the existence of natural creation.

The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal 'rest' - the Messianic Era.

==Rishonim and Acharonim==
Elaborating on the theme of the seventh millennium representing the [[Messianic Age]] are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including [[Rashi]],&lt;ref&gt;Rashi on Gemara Avoda Zara Folio 9a&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban on Genesis (2:3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaim Vital]],&lt;ref&gt;Likutim Chadashim - Drush 7 - https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?182277&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Abrabanel]],&lt;ref&gt;Abarbanel on Genesis 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban quoting Ibn Ezra at Leviticus (25:2)&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbeinu [[Bachya]],&lt;ref&gt;Bachya on Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yaakov Culi]] author of [[Me'am Lo'ez]], &lt;ref&gt; The Torah Anthology Me'am Lo'ez by Rabbi Yaakov Culi Translated by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan Exodus II page 117 Moznaim Publishing Corporation 1979&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vilna Gaon]],&lt;ref name="Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5"&gt;Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]],&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaSichos 5750:254&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ramchal]],&lt;ref&gt;Derech Hashem 4:7:2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aryeh Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7vxjgVY33LkC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=aryeh+kaplan+1840&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2_mGLTFniN&amp;sig=6dCWdOjPDl-YAyELmmdj-FBMHg0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GQo0TI6UOZSqcYaq0bsD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 318, The Real Messiah, oneline at]&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the idea of the seventh millennium representing the Messianic Age across the [[Ashkenazi]] - [[Sephardi]] divide, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassidim]] - [[Misnagdim]] divide, and across the rational [[Talmud]] and mystical [[Kabbalah]] perspectives, shows the centrality of this idea in traditional Judaism.

===Rashi===

Rashi draws a parallel between the tranquility experienced presently on the seventh day of the week, [[Shabbat]], and that which will be experienced in the seventh millennium:

The [[Talmud]] Avoda Zara folio 9a cites a teaching of the Academy of [[Elijah]] that "the world will exist for six thousand years". Rashi (s.v ששת אלפים שנים) comments on this: “The world is decreed to last for six thousand years, as the days of the week; the seventh day of the week is Shabbat, so too in the seventh millennium, will there be tranquility in the world.”

===Ramban===
In his Sha'ar Hagmul, [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] writes that the sixth millennium will see the advent of the Messiah and the seventh millennium will be the [[Shabbat]] of the 'World to Come', wherein the righteous will be resurrected and rejoice.&lt;ref name="Ramban, Shaar HaGemul, ch. 58"&gt;Ramban, Shaar HaGemul, ch. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramban further writes that the Scriptural verse, “And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it” (Gen. 2:3), refers to His blessing the World to Come which begins at the seventh millennium.&lt;ref name="Ramban, Shaar HaGemul, ch. 58"/&gt;

===Bachya===
In his commentary to Genesis 2:3, Rabbeinu [[Bachya]] writes that the seventh millennium will follow the Messiah and the resurrection, and will be a time of “great eternal delight” for those who merit resurrection.

This being the case, he explains, just as one prepares during the six days of the week for the Shabbat, so too one should prepare during the six thousand years for the seventh.&lt;ref&gt;R' Bachya to Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaim Vital===
[[Chaim Vital]] writes that whoever wants to know what will happen in the end days, should study the first seven days of creation. Each day of creation represents 1000 years, and the seventh 'day', beginning in the year 6000, represents the day of rest.&lt;ref&gt;Likutim Chadashim - Drush 7 - https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?182277&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abrabanel===
Don [[Isaac Abrabanel]] writes that similar to the structure of the week of Creation, so too the world will exist for six thousand years, with the seventh millennium being a Hefsek (break) and a Shvita (rest), like [[Shabbat]], [[Shmita]], and [[Yovel]].&lt;ref&gt;Abrabanel to Genesis 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbi Yaakov Culi===

In his famed work [[Me'am Lo'ez]], in a section elaborating on the parallels between the Exodus from Egypt and the Final Redemption, Rabbi [[Yaakov Culi]] writes: "It seems logical to assume that prayers said today for the redemption are more acceptable than those said in earlier times... In earlier times, the redemption was far in the future. Therefore, in order for their prayers to be have any effect, people had to pray intensely. In those days, people were a thousand years from the time in which the redemption had to take place. Now, however, we are only 500, or 200, years away from the time, and the closer it comes, the easier it is for prayers to be accepted". &lt;ref&gt; The Torah Anthology Me'am Lo'ez by Rabbi Yaakov Culi Translated by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan Exodus II page 117 Moznaim Publishing Corporation 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In the footnote to this statement, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan writes: "This was written in 5492 (1732). Since there was a tradition that the Messiah would have to come before the year 6000 (2240), there was only 500 years left until the redemption would have to come. There was also a tradition that the redemption would have to begin after 200 years, that is by 5700 (1940). This would seem to lend support to the contention that the formation of the modern state of Israel is the beginning of the redemption". &lt;ref&gt; The Torah Anthology Me'am Lo'ez by Rabbi Yaakov Culi Translated by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan Exodus II page 381 footnote 71 Moznaim Publishing Corporation 1979&lt;/ref&gt;     

===Vilna Gaon===
The [[Vilna Gaon]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each day of Creation alludes to a thousand years of our existence, and every little detail that occurred on these days will have its corresponding event happen at the proportionate time during its millennium.&lt;ref name="Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The עִקְּבוֹת מְשִׁיחַ (''iqvot Meshiaḥ''), footsteps of Messiah, began the first hour of Friday morning in the Sixth Millennium, that is the year Five Hundred [ from nightfall of October 4, 1739 AD until nightfall of September 22, 1740 AD ], and from hour to hour the footsteps have continued to progress from many aspects [cf. M ''Avot'' 1:1; BT ''Sanhedrin'' 38a]. As is known, every hour consists of forty-one years and eight months [alt., 41.666], counting from the time that the bonds on the Messiah’s heels were loosened, as it says, ''You have loosened my bonds'' (Psalms 116:16), and as revealed in: ''A decree He declared it for Joseph… ‘I delivered his shoulder from the burden his palms were loosed from the hod’'' (Psalms 81:6-7). Beginning with the second hour [i.e., from 5541 (1781 AD)], the entire House of Israel took the stage, both as a whole, and with regard to each individual member of the nation, as an order from above, of Messiah of the beginning of redemption, namely, Messiah Son of Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Voice of the Turtle Dove 1:4|last = Rabbi Hillel Rivlin of Shklov in the name of the Gaon of Vilna|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ramchal===
The [[Ramchal]] explains that the Shabbat Millennium will be a time of rest, which will be merited by the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;Derech Hashem 1:3:9, Derech Hashem 4:7:2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lubavitcher Rebbe===
The Lubavitcher Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] explains that upon having reached the Hebrew year 5750 (1989 CE), the millennial 'time-clock' had reached the time of the 'eve' of [[Shabbat]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hadran on the Mishneh Torah, 5745, and Sichos Shabbos Parshas Vayeitzei, 5752&lt;/ref&gt;

This is based on the teaching of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref name="Sanhedrin 97a"/&gt; which states that one thousand human years is equivalent to one 'day' in the eyes of the Creator, which in turn is based upon the verse in Psalms, "For one thousand years in Your eyes are but a day that has passed (Psalms 90:4)". Therefore, given that one human-time millennium is equal to one cosmic 'day', the human-time seventh millennium is equivalent to the seventh cosmic 'day', the '[[Shabbat]]', the Messianic age.

Given that the Jewish day begins at nightfall, the year 5750 represented 12:00pm midday on the millennial 'Friday', as per the table below.

The Lubavitcher Rebbe, as others, maintains that the Messiah must arrive at, or before, the onset of the [[Shabbat]], the year 6000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The English year {{CURRENTYEAR}}, corresponding to the Hebrew year {{#time:xjY}}, thus marks {{#expr:floor({{#time:xjY}}*0.024-126)}}:{{#expr:floor(60*({{#time:xjY}}*0.024-floor({{#time:xjY}}*0.024)))}}pm on the Millennial Friday. In Jewish law, a half-hour past midday or ''mincha gedola'' marks the time on Friday afternoon when the influence of Shabbat begins, and some authorities forbid keeping a business open past that point.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.feedblitz.com/56067/~3861587&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shlomo Elyashiv===
Kabbalist and grandfather of Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]], Rabbi [[Shlomo Elyashiv]] writes in Drushei Olam HaTohu:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...This is why so much time must transpire from the time of creation until the time of the Tikkun (lit. 'correction', Moshiach's coming). All the forces of Gevurot (strict judgement) are rooted in the six [[Sefirot]]—[[Chesed]], [[Gevurah]], [[Tiferet]], [[Netzach]], [[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]], [[Yesod]]—which are the six days of creation... and also the 6,000 years of history that the world will exist.

And within [the six [[Sefirot]]] are the roots of all that will happen from the six days of creation until the Final Tikkun... We find that all that transpires is the result of the sparks from the time of Tohu, Chaos...&lt;ref&gt;Drushei Olam HaTohu 2:151b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Never before has mankind been faced with such a wide range of possibilities. Never before has it had such tremendous power at its disposal, to use for good or evil... We need not belabor the point, but the past hundred years or so have brought about an increase in knowledge unsurpassed in all human history... The ultimate goal of the historic process is the perfection of society... is what we call the Messianic Age...

Almost 2000 years ago, the Zohar predicted, "In the 600th year of the sixth thousand, the gates of wisdom on high and the wellsprings of lower wisdom will be opened. This will prepare the world to enter the seventh thousand, just as man prepares himself toward sunset on Friday for the Sabbath. It is the same here. And a mnemonic for this is (Gen 7:11), 'In the 600th year... all the foundations of the great deep were split'. Here we see a clear prediction that in the Jewish year 5600 (or 1840), the wellsprings of lower wisdom would be opened and there would be a sudden expansion of secular knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;The Real Messiah, NCSY, Mesorah Publications 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Esther Jungreis===
In an interview with Israel National Radio, Rebbetzin [[Esther Jungreis]] said the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Listen carefully, friends, to what I'm telling you. Hashem, Elokei Yisrael, created this world that we are living in today in six days.

Every day was a thousand years. This world, as we know it today, cannot last beyond 6,000 years. Right now, we are in the year 5769, which means it's Erev [[Shabbos]] of the world. By the year 6,000, [[Mashiach]] has to be here. He could come much earlier. But by the year 6,000, he has to be here. ... the [[Vilna Gaon]] said that the last war, Milchemet [[Gog and Magog|Gog uMagog]], is going to last only 12 minutes because they are going to have such weapons....

We know that the final redemption, the final [[Geula]], it's going to be like when you left Egypt – only one-fifth of our people left Egypt. Four-fifths perished... during the plague of darkness.

So I'm appealing to every Jew. Every negative prophecy can be changed. We can bring Mashiach today. Right now, we are living in a period called Erev [eve of] Shabbat.

It's Erev Shabbat, because when Mashiach will come, it will be the day that will be all Shabbat, the seventh day....

Let's bring Shabbos early, and let us to bring Shabbos with menucha [ease], with shalom [peace], with simchah [happiness] – Is it possible? Absolutely?! Every negative prophecy can be changed.&lt;ref name="israelnationalnews.com"&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Yerphal Caves''', also '''Yerphale Caves''', are a small group of Buddhist caves located near Umbraj, [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. The caves were only discovered recently, in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Qureshi |first1=Dulari |title=The Rock-cut Temples of Western India |date=2010 |publisher=Bharatiya Kala Prakashan |isbn=9788180902024 |page=346 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GVEAQAAIAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located not far from the [[Karad Caves]] (about 25&amp;nbsp;km).

The group contains a small [[chaitya]] hall with an [[apsidal]] plan with a [[stupa]] inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rujivacharakul |first1=Vimalin |last2=Hahn |first2=H.
