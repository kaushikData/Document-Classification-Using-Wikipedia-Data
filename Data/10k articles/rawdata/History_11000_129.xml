'''Adebowale Ibidapo Adefuye''' (January 1947 – August 27, 2015) was a Nigerian historian and diplomat.

==Academic career==

==Diplomatic career==
He was named the Ambassador to Jamaica in 1987, serving until 1991. During that period, Adefuye also concurrently served as the ambassador to Belize and Haiti. He was then the Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Adefuye left that post to serve as the deputy director of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] for fourteen years. After leaving the Commonwealth, he became an advisor to the [[Economic Community of West African States]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=tnn&gt;{{cite news|title=Adefuye died in US hospital, says Ministry of Foreign Affairs|url=http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2015/08/adefuye-died-in-us-hospital-says-ministry-of-foreign-affairs/|accessdate=30 August 2015|publisher=The News Nigeria|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] appointed Adefuye the ambassador to the United States in 2010.

The '''Amber Coast''' is the name given to a coastal strip of the [[Baltic Sea]] in the northwest of [[Kaliningrad]] ([[Russia]], [[Kaliningrad]] [[Oblast]], [[Sambia]] Peninsula, formerly northern [[East Prussia]] in [[Germany]]). In this area [[amber]] ([[Baltic amber]]) has been excavated since the mid-19th century and up to today in open-pit mining. Two deposits – Palmnikenskoe and Primorskoe, containing 80% of world amber reserves, were found near [[Yantarny, Kaliningrad Oblast|Yantarny]] on the Western coast of the [[Sambia Peninsula]] in 1948-1951’s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leta.st/blog/2016/07/history-of-russian-amber-1/ "The History of Russian Amber, Part 1: The Beginning"], Leta.st&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scientists believe that amber was deposited during the [[Upper Eocene]] and [[Lower Oligocene]] in a [[River delta|delta]] of a prehistoric river, in a shallow part of a marine basin.&lt;ref name="Rice2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patty C. Rice|title=Amber: Golden Gem of the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6NVVpqhixIC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=15 September 2006|publisher=Patty Rice|isbn=978-1-4259-3849-9|pages=22''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the coast near Kaliningrad, amber is also found elsewhere in the Baltic Sea region.&lt;ref name="Rice2006"/&gt; The deposits are found mostly in the "blue earth [[glauconite]]", a layer 1 to 17.5 meters thick found 25 to 40 meters from the surface.&lt;ref name="Rice2006"/&gt; In addition to the Sambia region, amber is gathered in noticeable amounts at German, Polish and Lithuanian Baltic beaches&lt;ref name="Rice2006"/&gt; (areas of the [[Bay of Gdańsk]] as well as the [[Vistula Lagoon]]), the western coast of [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name="Rice2006"/&gt; and the [[Frisian Islands]].&lt;ref name="Rice2006"/&gt; Small amounts of  Baltic amber can even be found outside the Baltic region, for example on the coastline of the south east of England.&lt;ref name="Rice2006"/&gt;

The Amber Coast is mentioned as early as by [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in his work ''Germania''.&lt;ref name=And37&gt;K.

==Other uses==
Another coastal strip referred to as “amber coast” is the Costa de Ambar (also known as “Costambar”) in the west of [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]] ([[Hispaniola]], [[Dominican Republic]]). In this area there are a number of small shaft mines, from which is excavated the so-called "[[Dominican amber]]".&lt;ref&gt;George O. Poinar, Jr.: ''Life in amber.'' Stanford 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominican amber production site is the world's second-largest, although compared to the Baltic region it is "a distant second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Tree_of_Life/FossilAmber.htm |title=Fossil Amber or Fossil Resin |publisher=Virtual Fossil Museum |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Not to be confused with [[America at the Crossroads]], an unrelated book by [[Francis Fukuyama]].''

'''''America at a Crossroads''''' is a documentary miniseries concerning the issues facing the [[United States|United States of America]] as related to the [[War on Terrorism]]. It aired originally on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television.

The miniseries initially consisted of 11 independently produced ''aired'' episodes, and premiered April 15–20, 2007 on PBS.&lt;ref&gt;PBS.org: [https://www.pbs.org/weta/crossroads/?campaign=pbshomefeatures_1_americaatacrossroads_2007-04-19 ''America at a Crossroads'' homepage.] Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its executive producers are [[Jeff Bieber]] and [[Dalton Delan]]; series producer is Leo Eaton and it is presented by [[Robert MacNeil]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS.org: [https://www.pbs.org/weta/crossroads/about/series_credits.html ''America at a Crossroads'' production credits.] Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Its music score is composed by Canadian musician [[Mark Korven]].

==Subject matter==
''America at a Crossroads'' explores the challenges confronting the post-9/11 world &amp;mdash; including the war on terrorism; the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan; the experience of American troops serving abroad; the struggle for balance within the Muslim world; and global perspectives on America's role overseas.

Aimed at creating a national dialogue surrounding the crucial issues explored in the series, an extensive media and outreach campaign in more than 25 communities accompanies the series. The campaign features screening events with the filmmakers and their subjects in discussions with United States military personnel, leading policy experts, leaders of the Islamic community, scholars from across the country as well as members of the public.

==Criticism==
One film, ''The Case for War: In Defense of Freedom'', in which [[Richard Perle]] presented his view of the challenges facing the U.S. generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/arts/television/01jens.html?_r=2&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin

| publisher = New York Times
| date = 2007-04-01
| first=Elizabeth
| last=Jensen
| accessdate=April 23, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critics complained that the film failed to adequately challenge Perle's views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/04/the_frog_of_war.html Wired Blogs: The World According to Richard Perle]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "a fascinating study in rationalization, a lighter, less repentant version of ''[[The Fog of War]]'', [[Errol Morris]]'s documentary about [[Robert S. McNamara]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = New York Times
| date = 2007-04-17
| first=Alessandra
| last=Stanley
| accessdate=April 23, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One critic complained that PBS's endorsement of the [[neoconservative]] viewpoint in this film was so misguided, that PBS viewers should express their disgust by "either cutting off donations or at least demanding back a percentage of what they've already given".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://baltimorechronicle.com/2007/041907Parry.shtml
| title = Time for PBS to Go?
| publisher = Baltimore Chronicle
| date = 2007-04-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Conversely, the producers of an unaired segment, ''[[Islam vs. Islamists]]'', claimed they had been victims of liberal bias and subsequently aired their documentary on the [[Fox News Channel]] under the provocative title ''[[Banned by PBS: Muslims Against Jihad]]''.

'''Ancient Roman architecture''' adopted the external language of classical [[Ancient Greek Architecture|Greek architecture]] for the purposes of the [[ancient Romans]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, but differed from Greek buildings, becoming a new [[architecture|architectural]] style. The two styles are often considered one body of [[classical architecture]].  Roman architecture flourished in the [[Roman Republic]] and even more so under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the [[arch]] and the [[dome]] to make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered.  Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still in use.

Roman Architecture covers the period from the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] in 509 BC to about the 4th century AD, after which it becomes reclassified as [[Late Antique]] or [[Byzantine architecture]].  Almost no substantial examples survive from before about 100 BC, and most of the major survivals are from the later empire, after about 100 AD.   Roman architectural style continued to influence building in the former empire for many centuries, and the style used in Western Europe beginning about 1000 is called [[Romanesque architecture]] to reflect this dependence on basic Roman forms.

The Romans only began to achieve significant originality in architecture around the beginning of the [[Roman empire|Imperial period]], after they had combined aspects of their original [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] architecture with others taken from Greece {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, including most elements of the style we now call classical architecture.  They moved from [[trabeated]] construction mostly based on columns and [[lintel]]s to one based on massive walls, punctuated by [[arch]]es, and later [[dome]]s, both of which greatly developed under the Romans. The classical orders now became largely decorative rather than structural, except in [[colonnade]]s.  Stylistic developments included the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order|Composite]] [[Classical orders|orders]]; the first being a shortened, simplified variant on the [[Doric order]] and the Composite being a tall order with the floral decoration of the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and the scrolls of the [[Ionic order|Ionic]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.  The period from roughly 40 BC to about 230 AD saw most of the greatest achievements, before the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] and later troubles reduced the wealth and organizing power of the central government.

The Romans produced massive public buildings and works of [[civil engineering]], and were responsible for significant developments in housing and public hygiene, for example their public and private baths and latrines, under-floor heating in the form of the [[hypocaust]], [[mica]] glazing (examples in [[Ostia Antica]]), and piped hot and cold water (examples in [[Pompeii]] and [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]).

== Overview ==
Despite the technical developments of the Romans, which took their buildings far away from the basic Greek conception where columns were needed to support heavy beams and roofs, they were very reluctant to abandon the [[classical order]]s in formal public buildings, even though these had become essentially decorative {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. 
However, they did not feel entirely restricted by Greek [[aesthetic]] concerns, and treated the orders with considerable freedom.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Innovation started in the 3rd or 2nd century BC with the development of [[Roman concrete]] as a readily available adjunct to, or substitute for, [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and brick. More daring buildings soon followed, with great pillars supporting broad arches and domes.  The freedom of concrete also inspired the [[colonnade]] screen, a row of purely decorative columns in front of a load-bearing wall. In smaller-scale architecture, concrete's strength freed the [[floor plan]] from [[Rectangle|rectangular]] cells to a more free-flowing environment.

Factors such as wealth and high population densities in cities forced the ancient Romans to discover new architectural solutions of their own. The use of [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[arch]]es, together with a sound knowledge of building materials, enabled them to achieve unprecedented successes in the construction of imposing infrastructure for public use.  Examples include the [[aqueducts of Rome]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]], the [[basilica]]s and [[Colosseum]]. These were reproduced at a smaller scale in most important towns and cities in the Empire. Some surviving structures are almost complete, such as the [[town wall]]s of [[Lugo]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], now northern Spain.  The administrative structure and wealth of the empire made possible very large projects even in locations remote from the main centres,&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 26&lt;/ref&gt; as did the use of slave labour, both skilled and unskilled.

Especially under the empire, architecture often served a political function, demonstrating the power of the Roman state in general, and of specific individuals responsible for building. Roman architecture perhaps reached its peak in the reign of [[Hadrian]], whose many achievements include rebuilding the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in its current form and leaving his mark on the landscape of northern Britain with [[Hadrian's Wall]].

=== Origins ===
While borrowing much from the preceding [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] architecture, such as the use of [[hydraulics]] and the construction of arches, Roman prestige architecture remained firmly under the spell of [[Ancient Greek architecture]] and the [[classical orders]].&lt;ref name="Henig, 27"&gt;Henig, 27&lt;/ref&gt; 
This came initially from [[Magna Graecia]], the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and indirectly from Greek influence on the Etruscans, but after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] directly from the best classical and Hellenistic examples in the Greek world. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
The influence is evident in many ways; for example, in the introduction and use of the [[Triclinium]] in Roman villas as a place and manner of dining. Roman builders employed Greeks in many capacities, especially in the great boom in construction in the early Empire.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Roman Architectural Revolution ===
[[File:Pantheon dome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] was the [[List of largest domes|largest dome in the world]] for more than a millennium.&lt;ref name=PBSO&gt;{{cite web|title=BUILDING BIG: Pantheon|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/pantheon.html|website=[[PBS]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest unreinforced solid concrete dome to this day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Roman Pantheon: The Triumph of Concrete|url=http://www.romanconcrete.com/|website=Roman Concrete|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Roman Architectural Revolution]], also known as the ''Concrete Revolution'',{{sfn|DeLaine|1990|p=407}}{{sfn|Rook|1992|pp=18f.}}{{sfn|Gardner|2005|p=170}} was the widespread use in Roman architecture of the previously little-used architectural forms of the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], and [[dome]]. For the first time in history, their potential was fully exploited in the construction of a wide range of civil engineering structures, public buildings, and military facilities. These included [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|baths]], [[List of Roman bridges|bridges]], [[Circus (building)#List of Roman circuses|circuses]], [[List of Roman dams and reservoirs|dams]], [[List of Roman domes|domes]], [[Roman harbour|harbours]], [[Roman temple|temples]], and [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]].

A crucial factor in this development, which saw [[List of ancient architectural records|a trend toward monumental architecture]], was the invention of [[Roman concrete]] (''opus caementicium''), which led to the liberation of shapes from the dictates of the traditional materials of stone and brick.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|1956}}

These enabled the building of the many [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] throughout the [[Roman Empire|empire]], such as the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], the [[Pont du Gard]], and the eleven [[aqueducts of Rome]]. The same concepts produced numerous bridges, some of which are still in daily use, for example the [[Puente Romano (Mérida)|Puente Romano]] at [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] in Spain, and the [[Pont Julien]] and the bridge at [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], both in Provence, France.

The [[dome]] permitted construction of [[vaulted ceiling]]s without crossbeams and made possible large covered public space such as [[public baths]] and [[basilicas]], such as Hadrian's [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]], all in Rome.

The Romans first adopted the arch from the Etruscans, and implemented it in their own building.  The use of arches that spring directly from the tops of columns was a Roman development, seen from the 1st century AD, that was very widely adopted in medieval Western, [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Islamic architecture]].

=== Domes ===
{{main|History of Roman and Byzantine domes}}
{{further|List of Roman domes}}
[[File:Pantheon oculus.jpg|thumb|right|Dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], inner view]]
The Romans were the first builders in the [[history of architecture]] to realize the potential of [[dome]]s for the creation of large and well-defined interior spaces.{{sfn|Rasch|1985|p=117}} Domes were introduced in a number of Roman building types such as [[Roman temple|temples]], [[thermae]], [[palace]]s, [[mausoleum|mausolea]] and later also [[Church (building)|churches]]. Half-domes also became a favoured architectural element and were adopted as [[apse]]s in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacred architecture]].

Monumental domes began to appear in the 1st century BC in [[Rome]] and the [[Roman province|provinces]] around the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Along with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], they gradually replaced the traditional [[post and lintel]] construction which makes use of the [[column]] and [[architrave]]. The construction of domes was greatly facilitated by the invention of [[Roman concrete|concrete]], a process which has been termed the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]].{{sfn|Lechtman|Hobbs|1986}} Their enormous dimensions remained unsurpassed until the introduction of structural [[steel]] frames in the late 19th century (see [[List of the world's largest domes]]).{{sfn|Rasch|1985|p=117}}{{sfn|Mark|Hutchinson|1986|p=24}}{{sfn|Heinle|Schlaich|1996|p=27}}

== Influence on later architecture ==
[[File:Stowe House 04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palladian]] [[Stowe House]], by [[William Kent]]]]
Roman architecture supplied the basic vocabulary of [[Pre-Romanesque]] and [[Romanesque architecture]], and spread across Christian Europe well beyond the old frontiers of the empire, to [[Ireland]] and [[Scandinavia]] for example.  In the East, [[Byzantine architecture]] developed new styles of churches, but most other buildings remained very close to Late Roman forms.  The same can be said in turn of [[Islamic architecture]], where Roman forms long continued, especially in private buildings such as houses and the [[Turkish bath]], and civil engineering such as fortifications and bridges.

In Europe the [[Italian Renaissance]] saw a conscious revival of correct classical styles, initially purely based on Roman examples. [[Vitruvius]] was respectfully reinterpreted by a series of architectural writers, and the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order]]s formalized for the first time, to give [[The Five Orders of Architecture|five rather than three]] orders.  After the flamboyance of [[Baroque architecture]], the [[Neoclassical architecture]] of the 18th century revived purer versions of classical style, and for the first time added [[Greek Revival architecture|direct influence]] from the Greek world.

Numerous local classical styles developed, such as [[Palladian architecture]], [[Georgian architecture]] and [[Regency architecture]] in the English-speaking world, [[Federal architecture]] in the United States, and later [[Stripped Classicism]] and [[PWA Moderne]].

Roman influences may be found around us today, in [[bank]]s, government buildings, great houses, and even small houses, perhaps in the form of a porch with Doric columns and a pediment or in a fireplace or a [[mosaic]] shower floor derived from a Roman original, often from [[Pompeii]] or [[Herculaneum]]. The mighty pillars, domes and arches of Rome echo in the [[New World]] too, where in [[Washington DC]] we see them in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], the [[White House]], the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and other government buildings. All across the US the seats of regional government were normally built in the grand traditions of Rome, with vast flights of stone steps sweeping up to towering pillared porticoes, with huge domes gilded or decorated inside with the same or similar themes that were popular in Rome.

In Britain, a similar enthusiasm has seen the construction of thousands of neo-Classical buildings over the last five centuries, both civic and domestic, and many of the grandest country houses and mansions are purely Classical in style, an obvious example being [[Buckingham Palace]].

===Stone===
[[Marble]] is not found especially close to Rome, and was only rarely used there before [[Augustus]], who famously boasted that he had found Rome made of brick and left it made of marble, though this was mainly as a facing for brick or concrete.  The [[Temple of Hercules Victor]] of the late 2nd century BC is the earliest surviving exception in Rome.  From Augustus' reign the quarries at [[Carrara]] were extensively developed for the capital, and other sources around the empire exploited,&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 28&lt;/ref&gt; especially the prestigious Greek marbles like [[Parian marble|Parian]]. [[Travertine]] [[limestone]] was found much closer, around [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], and was used from the end of the Republic; the [[Colosseum]] is mainly built of this stone, which has good load-bearing capacity, with a brick core.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Other more or less local stones were used around the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Favro, (ii) Materials and construction techniques&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans were extremely fond of luxury imported coloured marbles with fancy veining, and the interiors of the most important buildings were very often faced with slabs of these, which have usually now been removed even where the building survives.  Imports from Greece for this purpose began in the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 22; Favro, (ii) Materials and construction techniques, which lists major quarries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman brick ===
{{Main|Roman brick}}
[[File:Gariannonum Burgh Castle south wall well preserved close up.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up view of the wall of the Roman [[Saxon Shore|shore fort]] at [[Burgh Castle Roman Site|Burgh Castle]], Norfolk, showing alternating courses of [[flint]] and brickwork.]]
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] made [[Roman brick|fired clay bricks]] from about the beginning of the Empire, replacing earlier sun-dried mud-brick.  Roman brick was almost invariably of a lesser height than modern brick, but was made in a variety of different shapes and sizes.{{sfn|Juracek|1996|p=310}} Shapes included square, rectangular, triangular and round, and the largest bricks found have measured over three feet in length.{{sfn|Peet|1911|p=35–36}} Ancient Roman bricks had a general size of 1½ [[Foot (unit of length)#Historical origin|Roman feet]] by 1 Roman foot, but common variations up to 15 [[inch]]es existed. Other brick sizes in ancient Rome included 24" x 12" x 4", and 15" x 8" x 10". Ancient Roman bricks found in [[France]] measured 8" x 8" x 3".  The [[Aula Palatina|Constantine Basilica]] in [[Trier]] is constructed from Roman bricks 15" square by 1½" thick.{{sfn|Walters|Birch|1905|p=330–40}} There is often little obvious difference (particularly when only fragments survive) between Roman bricks used for walls on the one hand, and [[Imbrex and tegula|tiles]] used for roofing or flooring on the other, so archaeologists sometimes prefer to employ the generic term [[ceramic building material]] (or CBM).

The Romans perfected brick-making during the first century of their empire and used it ubiquitously, in public and private construction alike. The Romans took their brickmaking skills everywhere they went, introducing the craft to the local populations.{{sfn|Walters|Birch|1905|p=330–40}} The [[Roman legion]]s, which operated their own [[kiln]]s, introduced bricks to many parts of the empire; bricks are often stamped with the mark of the legion that supervised their production. The use of bricks in southern and western [[Germany]], for example, can be traced back to traditions already described by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]].  In the [[British Isles]], the introduction of Roman brick by the ancient Romans was followed by a 600–700 year gap in major brick production.

=== Roman concrete ===
[[File:OpusCaementiciumViaAppiaAntica.jpg|thumb|Example of ''opus caementicium'' on a tomb on the ancient [[Appian Way]] in [[Rome]]. The original covering has been removed.]]
{{Main|Roman concrete}}
Concrete quickly supplanted brick as the primary building material,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and more daring buildings soon followed, with great pillars supporting broad [[arch]]es and [[domes]] rather than dense lines of [[column]]s suspending flat [[architrave]]s. The freedom of concrete also inspired the [[colonnade]] screen, a row of purely decorative columns in front of a load-bearing wall. In smaller-scale architecture, concrete's strength freed the [[floor plan]] from [[Rectangle|rectangular]] cells to a more free-flowing environment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Most of these developments are described by [[Vitruvius]], writing in the first century AD in his work [[De Architectura]].

Although concrete had been used on a minor scale in Mesopotamia, Roman architects perfected [[Roman concrete]] and used it in buildings where it could stand on its own and support a great deal of weight. The first use of concrete by the Romans was in the town of [[Cosa]] sometime after 273 BC. Ancient Roman concrete was a mixture of [[lime mortar]], aggregate, [[pozzolana]], water, and [[Rock (geology)|stones]], and was stronger than previously-used concretes. The ancient builders placed these ingredients in wooden frames where they hardened and bonded to a facing of stones or (more frequently) bricks.  The aggregates used were often much larger than in modern concrete, amounting to rubble.

When the framework was removed, the new wall was very strong, with a rough surface of bricks or stones. This surface could be smoothed and faced with an attractive [[stucco]] or thin panels of marble or other coloured stones called revetment. Concrete construction proved to be more flexible and less costly than building solid stone buildings. The materials were readily available and not difficult to transport. The wooden frames could be used more than once, allowing builders to work quickly and efficiently.  [[Concrete]] is arguably the Roman contribution most relevant to modern architecture.

== City design ==
[[File:Détail de la maquette de Rome à lépoque de Constantin (5840455090).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[Temple of Claudius]] to the south (left) of the [[Colosseum]] (model of Imperial Rome at the [[Museum of Roman Civilization|Museo della civiltà romana in Rome)]]]]
{{further|Centuriation|Decumanus Maximus|Cardo}}

The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] employed regular orthogonal structures on which they molded their colonies.{{sfn|Morris|1972| pp= 39-41, 51-60}}{{sfn|Kolb|1984|pp=169-238}} {{sfn|Benevolo|1993|pp=256-267}} They probably were inspired by Greek and Hellenic examples, as well as by regularly planned cities that were built by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1989|pp=375–392}}: "The Etruscans were, in their turn, probably also influenced in this respect by Greek and Hellenic culture."&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Marzabotto]])

The Romans used a consolidated scheme for city planning, developed for military defense and civil convenience. The basic plan consisted of a central forum with city services, surrounded by a compact, rectilinear grid of streets, and wrapped in a wall for defense. To reduce travel times, two diagonal streets crossed the square grid, passing through the central square. A river usually flowed through the city, providing water, transport, and sewage disposal.{{sfn|Vitrivius|1914}} Hundreds of towns and cities were built by the Romans throughout their empire. Many European towns, such as [[Turin]], preserve the remains of these schemes, which show the very logical way the Romans designed their cities. They would lay out the streets at right angles, in the form of a square grid. All roads were equal in width and length, except for two, which were slightly wider than the others. One of these ran east–west, the other, north–south, and they intersected in the middle to form the center of the grid.  All roads were made of carefully fitted flag stones and filled in with smaller, hard-packed rocks and pebbles. Bridges were constructed where needed. Each square marked off by four roads was called an ''insula,'' the Roman equivalent of a modern [[city block]].

Each insula was {{convert|80|yd}} square, with the land within it divided. As the city developed, each insula would eventually be filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes and crisscrossed with back roads and alleys. Most insulae were given to the first settlers of a Roman city, but each person had to pay to construct his own house.

The city was surrounded by a wall to protect it from invaders and to mark the city limits. Areas outside city limits were left open as farmland. At the end of each main road was a large gateway with watchtowers. A [[portcullis]] covered the opening when the city was under siege, and additional watchtowers were constructed along the city walls. An aqueduct was built outside the city walls.

The development of Greek and Roman urbanization is relatively well-known, as there are relatively many written sources, and there has been much attention to the subject, since the Romans and Greeks are generally regarded as the main ancestors of modern Western culture. It should not be forgotten, though, that the [[Etruscans]] had many considerable towns and there were also other cultures with more or less urban settlements in Europe, primarily of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Demandt|1998}}: "In fact, many sites where the Romans created towns, such as Paris, Vienna and Bratislava, had previously been Celtic settlements of more or less urban character."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building types ==

=== Amphitheatre ===
{{Main|Roman amphitheatre}}
{{further|List of Roman amphitheatres}}
The [[amphitheatre]] was, with the triumphal arch and basilica, the only major new type of building developed by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 26. Blagg also mentions baths, granaries, insulae and large villas.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most impressive secular buildings are the amphitheatres, over 200 being known and many of which are well preserved, such as that at [[Arles]], as well as its progenitor, the [[Colosseum]] in Rome. They were used for [[gladiator]]ial contests, public displays, public meetings and [[bullfight]]s, the tradition of which still survives in Spain. Their typical shape, functions and name distinguish them from [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatres]], which are more or less semicircular in shape; from the [[Circus (building)|circuses]] (akin to [[hippodrome]]s) whose much longer circuits were designed mainly for horse or chariot racing events; and from the smaller [[Stadium|stadia]], which were primarily designed for [[sport|athletics]] and footraces.{{sfn|Bomgardner|2000|p=37}}

The earliest Roman amphitheatres date from the middle of the first century BC, but most were built under Imperial rule, from the [[Augustus|Augustan]] period (27 BC–14 AD) onwards.{{sfn|Bomgardner|2000|p=59}} Imperial amphitheatres were built throughout the Roman empire; the largest could accommodate 40,000–60,000 spectators, and the most elaborate featured multi-storeyed, arcaded façades and were elaborately decorated with [[marble]], [[stucco]] and statuary.{{sfn|Bomgardner|2000|p= 62}} After the end of gladiatorial games in the 5th century and of animal killings in the 6th, most amphitheatres fell into disrepair, and their materials were mined or recycled. Some were razed, and others  converted into fortifications. A few continued as convenient open meeting places; in some of these, churches were sited.{{sfn|Bomgardner|2000|p=201–223}}

Architecturally, they are typically an example of the Roman use of the classical orders to decorate large concrete walls pierced at intervals, where the columns have nothing to support.  Aesthetically, however, the formula is successful.

=== Basilica ===
[[File:Basilica of Constantine in the Roman Forum.JPG|thumb|right|Northern aisle of the [[Basilica of Maxentius]] in Rome]]
[[File:Trier - Aula Palatina.JPG|thumb|The [[Aula Palatina]] of [[Trier]], [[Germany]] (then part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]]), built during the reign of [[Constantine I]] (r. 306-337 AD)]]
The Roman [[basilica]] was a large public building where business or legal matters could be transacted. They were normally where the magistrates held court, and used for other official ceremonies, having many of the functions of the modern [[town hall]].  The first basilicas had no religious function at all. As early as the time of [[Augustus]], a public basilica for transacting business had been part of any settlement that considered itself a city, used in the same way as the late medieval covered market houses of northern Europe, where the meeting room, for lack of urban space, was set ''above'' the arcades, however. Although their form was variable, basilicas often contained interior [[colonnade]]s that divided the space, giving aisles or arcaded spaces on one or both sides, with an [[apse]] at one end (or less often at each end), where the magistrates sat, often on a slightly raised [[dais]]. The central aisle tended to be wide and was higher than the flanking aisles, so that light could penetrate through the [[clerestory]] windows.

The oldest known basilica, the [[Comitium#Basilica Porcia|Basilica Porcia]], was built in Rome in 184&amp;nbsp;BC by [[Cato the Elder]] during the time he was [[Roman censor|Censor]]. Other early examples include the basilica at Pompeii (late 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC).  After Christianity became the official religion, the basilica shape was found appropriate for the first large public churches, with the attraction of avoiding reminiscences of the Greco-Roman temple form.

=== Circus ===
The [[Circus (building)|Roman circus]] was a large open-air venue used for public events in the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. The circuses were similar to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[hippodrome]]s, although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction. Along with [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]] and [[amphitheatre]]s, Circuses were one of the main [[entertainment]] sites of the time. Circuses were venues for [[chariot racing|chariot races]], [[horse race]]s, and performances that commemorated important events of the empire were performed there. For events that involved re-enactments of [[naval battle]]s, the circus was flooded with water.

The performance space of the Roman circus was normally, despite its name, an oblong rectangle of two linear sections of [[race track]], separated by a median strip running along the length of about two thirds the track, joined at one end with a semicircular section and at the other end with an undivided section of track closed (in most cases) by a distinctive starting gate known as the [[carceres]], thereby creating a circuit for the races.

=== Forum ===
{{further|Roman Forum|List of monuments of the Roman Forum}}
[[File:Tavares.Forum.Romanum.redux.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Roman Forum]]]]

A [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] was a central public open space in a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[municipium]], or any [[civitas]], primarily used as a marketplace, along with the buildings used for shops and the [[stoa]]s used for open stalls. Other large public buildings were often sited at the edges or close by. Many forums were constructed at remote locations along a road by the [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] responsible for the road, in which case the forum was the only settlement at the site and had its own name, such as [[Forlimpopoli|Forum Popili]] or [[Forlì|Forum Livi]].{{sfn|Abbott|Johnson|1926|p=12}}

During the years of the Republic, Augustus claimed he "found the city in brick and left it in marble".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 43943460|title = A Page from Latin Notes Supplement XV, Entitled SOME STORIES ABOUT THE ROMAN FORUM|journal = Latin Notes|volume = 3|issue = 6|year = 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; While chances are high that this was an exaggeration, there is something to be said for the influx of marble use in Roman Forum from 63 BC onwards. During Augustus reign, the Forum was described to have been "a larger, freer space than was the Forum of imperial times."&lt;ref name="Dennison"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennison|first=Walter|date=June 1908|title=The Roman Forum as Cicero Saw It|jstor=3287491|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=3|issue=8|pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum began to take on even more changes upon the arrival of Julius Casear who drew out extensive plans for the market hub. While Casear's death came prematurely, the ideas himself, as well as Augustus had in regards to the Forum proved to be the most influential for years to come. According to Walter Dennison's The Roman Forum As Cicero Saw It, the author writes that "the diverting of public business to the larger and splendid imperial fora erected in the vicinity resulted in leaving the general design of the Forum Romanum".&lt;ref name="Dennison"/&gt;

Every city had at least one forum of varying size. In addition to its standard function as a marketplace, a forum was a gathering place of great social significance, and often the scene of diverse activities, including political discussions and debates, rendezvous, meetings, etc. Much the best known example is the [[Roman Forum]],  the earliest of several in Rome.

In new Roman towns the forum was usually located at, or just off, the intersection of the main north-south and east-west streets (the [[cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]). All forums would have a Temple of Jupiter at the north end, and would also contain other temples, as well as the [[basilica]]; a public weights and measures table, so customers at the market could ensure they were not being sold short measures; and would often have the baths nearby.

=== Horreum ===
[[File:Ostia, horrea epagathiana 01.JPG|left|thumb|The Horrea Epagathiana et Epaphroditiana, a ''horreum'' in Ostia built c. 145-150 AD]]
A [[horreum]] was a type of public warehouse used during the ancient Roman period. Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] term is often used to refer to [[granary|granaries]], Roman horrea were used to store many other types of consumables; the giant [[Horrea Galbae]] in [[Rome]] were used not only to store [[grain]] but also [[olive oil]], [[wine]], foodstuffs, clothing and even [[marble]].{{sfn|Richardson|1992|p=193}} By the end of the imperial period, the city of Rome had nearly 300 horrea to supply its demands.{{sfn|Lampe|2006|p=61}} The biggest were enormous, even by modern standards; the Horrea Galbae contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000&amp;nbsp;m²).{{sfn|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=180}}

The first horrea were built in Rome towards the end of the 2nd century BC,{{sfn|Patrich|1996|p=149}} with the first known public horreum being constructed by the ill-fated [[tribune]], [[Gaius Gracchus]] in 123 BC.{{sfn|Métreaux|1998|p=14-15}} The word came to be applied to any place designated for the preservation of goods; thus it was often used refer to cellars (''horrea subterranea''), but it could also be applied to a place where artworks were stored,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], Epist. VIII.18&lt;/ref&gt; or even to a library.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Epist. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Some public horrea functioned somewhat like banks, where valuables could be stored, but the most important class of horrea were those where foodstuffs such as grain and olive oil were stored and distributed by the state.{{sfn|Schmitz|1875|p=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Horreum.html 618]}}

The word itself is thought to have linguist roots tied to the word hordeum which in Latin means 'barley'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=David|date=Dec 2, 1929|title=Horrea Romana: Roman Storehouses|jstor=4389377|journal=The John's Hopkin's University Press|volume=7|issue=7|pages=49–54|doi=10.2307/4389377}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the John's Hopkin's University Press, The Classical Weekly states that "Pliny the Elder does indeed make a distinction between the two words. He describes the horreum as a structure made of brick, the walls of which were not less than three feet thick; it had no windows or openings for ventilation".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=David|date=Dec 2, 1929|title=Horrea Romana: Roman Storehouses|jstor=4389377|journal=The John's Hopkin's University Press|volume=no. 7|issue=7|pages=49|doi=10.2307/4389377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the storehouses would also host oil and wine and also utilize large jars that could serve as cache's for large amounts of products.These storehouses were also used to house keep large sums of money and were used much like personal storage units today are. Romans were "These horrea were divided and subdivided, so that one could hire only so much space as one wanted, a whole room (cella), a closet (armarium), or only a chest or strong box (arca, arcula, locus, loculus)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Insula ===
{{Main|Insula (building)}}
[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|left|Insula in [[Ostia Antica]]]]

Multi-story apartment blocks called [[insulae]] catered to a range of residential needs. The cheapest rooms were at the top owing to the inability to escape in the event of a fire and the lack of piped water. Windows were mostly small, facing the street, with iron security bars. Insulae were often dangerous, unhealthy, and prone to fires because of overcrowding and haphazard cooking arrangements.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} There are examples in the Roman port town of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], that date back to the reign of [[Trajan]], but they seem to have been found only in Rome and a few other places.  Elsewhere writers report them as something remarkable, but [[Livy]] and Vituvius refer to them in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;EERA, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  External walls were in "Opus Reticulatum" and interiors in "Opus Incertum", which would then be plastered and sometimes painted.

To lighten up the small dark rooms, tenants able to afford a degree of painted colourful murals on the walls. Examples have been found of jungle scenes with wild animals and exotic plants. Imitation windows ([[trompe l'oeil]]) were sometimes painted to make the rooms seem less confined.

Ancient Rome had elaborate and luxurious houses owned by the elite. The average house, or in cities apartment, of a commoner or [[plebe]] did not contain many luxuries.  The [[domus]], or single-family residence, was only for the well-off in Rome, with most having a layout of the closed unit, consisting of one or two rooms. Between 312 and 315 A.D. Rome had 1781 domus and 44,850 of insulae.{{sfn|Hermansen|1970}}

Insulae have been the subject of great debate for historians of Roman culture, defining the various meanings of the word.{{sfn|Storey|2002}} Insula was a word used to describe apartment buildings, or the apartments themselves,{{sfn|Storey|2004}} meaning apartment, or inhabitable room, demonstrating just how small apartments for Plebes were. Urban divisions were originally street blocks, and later began to divide into smaller divisions, the word insula referring to both blocks and smaller divisions. The insula contained cenacula, [[tabernae]], storage rooms under the stairs, and lower floor shops. Another type of housing unit for Plebes was a cenaculum, an apartment, divided into three individual rooms: cubiculum, exedra, and medianum. Common Roman apartments were mainly masses of smaller and larger structures, many with narrow balconies that present mysteries as to their use, having no doors to access them, and they lacked the excessive decoration and display of wealth that aristocrats’ houses contained. Luxury in houses was not common, as the life of the average person did not consist of being in their houses, as they instead would go to public baths, and engage in other communal activities.

=== Lighthouses ===
{{Main|Roman lighthouse}}
[[File:A coruna torre de hercules sunset edit.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The [[Tower of Hercules]], a Roman [[lighthouse]] in Spain]]
Many [[lighthouses]] were built around the Mediterranean and the coasts of the empire, including the [[Tower of Hercules]] at [[A Coruña]] in northern Spain, a structure which survives to this day. A smaller lighthouse at [[Dover]], England also exists as a ruin about half the height of the original. The light would have been provided by a fire at the top of the [[structure]].

=== Thermae ===
{{Main|Thermae}}
{{further|List of Roman public baths}}
All Roman cities had at least one [[thermae]], a popular facility for public bathing, exercising and socializing. Exercise might include wrestling and weight-lifting, as well as swimming. Bathing was an important part of the Roman day, where some hours might be spent, at a very low cost subsidized by the government. Wealthier Romans were often accompanied by one or more slaves, who performed any required tasks such as fetching refreshment, guarding valuables, providing towels, and at the end of the session, applying olive oil to their masters' bodies which was then scraped off with a [[strigil]], a scraper made of wood or bone. Romans did not wash with soap and water as we do now.

Roman bath-houses were also provided for private [[Roman villa|villas]], [[domus|town houses]] and [[castra|forts]]. They were normally supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream, or by [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]. The design of thermae is discussed by [[Vitruvius]] in [[De Architectura]].

=== Temples ===
{{Main|Roman temple}}
[[File:Baalbek-Bacchus.jpg|thumb|left|"Roman Baroque" [[Temple of Bacchus]] at [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]]]]

Roman temples were among the most important and richest buildings in Roman culture, though only a few survive in any sort of complete state. Their construction and maintenance was a major part of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and all towns of any importance had at least one main temple, as well as smaller shrines.  The main room ''(cella)'' housed the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] image of the [[List of Roman deities|deity]] to whom the temple was [[votum|dedicated]], and often a small altar for incense or [[libation]]s. Behind the cella was a room or rooms used by temple attendants for storage of equipment and offerings.

Some remains of many Roman temples survive, above all in Rome itself, but the relatively few near-complete examples were nearly all converted to Christian churches (and sometimes subsequently to [[mosque]]s), usually a considerable time after the initial [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|triumph of Christianity under Constantine]].  The [[Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|decline of Roman religion]] was relatively slow, and the temples themselves were not appropriated by the government until a decree of the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in 415. Some of the oldest surviving temples include the [[Temple of Hercules Victor]] (mid 2nd century BC) and [[Temple of Portunus]] (120-80 BC), both standing within the [[Forum Boarium]].

The form of the Roman temple was mainly derived from the [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] model, but using Greek styles {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Roman temples emphasised the front of the building, which followed [[Greek temple]] models and typically consisted of wide steps leading to a [[portico]] with columns, a [[pronaos]], and usually a triangular [[pediment]] above, which was filled with statuary in the most grand examples; this was as often in [[terracotta]] as stone, and no examples have survived except as fragments.  However, unlike the Greek models, which generally gave equal treatment to all sides of the temple, which could be viewed and approached from all directions, the sides and rear of Roman temples might be largely undecorated (as in the [[Pantheon, Rome]] and [[Roman temple of Vic|Vic]]), inaccessible by steps (as in the [[Maison Carrée]] and Vic), and even back on to other buildings. As in the Maison Carrée, columns at the side might be half-columns, emerging from ("engaged with" in architectural terminology) the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform on which the temple sat was typically raised higher in Roman examples than Greek, with up ten or twelve or more steps rather than the three typical in Greek temples; the [[Temple of Claudius]] was raised twenty steps. These steps were normally only at the front, and typically not the whole width of that.

The Greek [[classical order]]s in all their details were closely followed in the façades of temples, as in other prestigious buildings.  However the idealized proportions between the different elements set out by the only significant Roman writer on architecture to survive, [[Vitruvius]], and subsequent [[Italian Renaissance]] writers, do not reflect actual Roman practice, which could be very variable, though always aiming at balance and harmony.  Following a [[Hellenistic]] trend, the [[Corinthian order]] and its variant the [[Composite order]] were most common in surviving Roman temples, but for small temples like [[Roman temple of Alcántara|that at Alcántara]], a simple [[Tuscan order]] could be used.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 8-13&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable local variation in style, as Roman architects often tried to incorporate elements the population expected in its [[sacred architecture]]. This was especially the case in [[Egypt]] and the [[Near East]], where different traditions of large stone temples were already millennia old.  The [[Romano-Celtic temple]] was a simple style for small temples found in the [[Western Empire]], and by far the most common type in [[Roman Britain]].  It often lacked any of the distinctive classical features, and may have had considerable continuity with pre-Roman temples of the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]].

=== Theatres ===
[[File:Teatro de Mérida, España, 2017 18.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Theatre (Mérida)]], Spain]]
[[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatres]] were built in all areas of the [[Roman Empire|empire]] from Spain, to the Middle East. Because of the Romans' ability to influence local architecture, we see numerous theatres around the world with uniquely Roman attributes.{{sfn|Wilson Jones|2000}}

These buildings were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences depending on the region in which they were constructed. The ''[[scaenae frons]]'' was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The ''[[Proscenium|proscaenium]]'' was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the ''[[proscenium|proscaenium]]''. The Roman theatre also had a ''[[podium]]'', which sometimes supported the columns of the ''scaenae frons''. The ''scaenae'' was originally not part of the building itself, constructed only to provide sufficient background for the actors. Eventually, it became a part of the edifice itself, made out of concrete. The theatre itself was divided into the stage ([[orchestra]]) and the seating section ([[auditorium]]). ''[[Vomitorium|Vomitoria]]'' or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.{{sfn|Ros|1996}}

=== Villa ===
[[File:Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Villa of the Mysteries]] just outside [[Pompeii]], seen from above]]
{{main|Roman villa}}
{{See also||Villa rustica|List of Roman villas in England|List of Roman villas in Belgium}}
A Roman villa was a [[country house]] built for the upper class, while a [[domus]] was a wealthy family's house in a town. The Empire contained many kinds of villas, not all of them lavishly appointed with [[mosaic]] floors and [[fresco]]es. In the provinces, any country house with some decorative features in the Roman style may be called a "villa" by modern scholars.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2000|p= 333}} Some were pleasure palaces such as those— like [[Hadrian's Villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]— that were situated in the cool hills within easy reach of [[Rome]] or— like the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]]— on picturesque sites overlooking the [[Bay of Naples]]. Some villas were more like the [[country house]]s of England or [[Poland]], the visible seat of power of a local magnate, such as the famous palace rediscovered at [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Fishbourne]] in [[Sussex]].

Suburban villas on the edge of cities were also known, such as the Middle and Late Republican villas that encroached on the [[Campus Martius]], at that time on the edge of Rome, and which can be also seen outside the city walls of [[Pompeii]], including the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], famous for its frescos. These early suburban villas, such as the one at Rome's Auditorium site&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130906/http://www2.comune.roma.it/auditorium/auditorium.html La Villa Romana dell'Auditorium]&lt;/ref&gt; or at Grottarossa in Rome, demonstrate the antiquity and heritage of the ''villa suburbana'' in Central Italy.  It is possible that these early, suburban villas were also in fact the seats of power (maybe even palaces) of regional strongmen or heads of important families (''gentes'').

A third type of villa provided the organizational center of the large farming estates called [[latifundia]]; such villas might be lacking in luxuries. By the 4th century, ''villa'' could simply mean an agricultural estate or holding: [[Jerome]] translated the [[Gospel of Mark]] (xiv, 32) ''chorion'', describing the olive grove of [[Gethsemane]], with ''villa'', without an inference that there were any dwellings there at all (''Catholic Encyclopedia'' "Gethsemane").

With the colossal [[Diocletian's Palace]], built in the countryside but later turned into a fortified city, a form of residential [[castle]] emerges, that anticipates the Middle Ages.

=== Watermills ===
{{further|List of ancient watermills}}
The initial invention of the [[watermill]] appears to have occurred in the [[Hellenistic civilization|hellenized eastern Mediterranean]] in the wake of the [[conquests of Alexander the Great]] and the rise of [[History of science in Classical Antiquity#Hellenistic period|Hellenistic science and technology]].{{sfn|Wikander|2000a|pp=396f.}}{{sfn|Donners|Waelkens|Deckers|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Wilson|2002|pp=7f.}} In the subsequent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, the use of water-power was diversified and different types of watermills were introduced. These include all three variants of the vertical [[water wheel]] as well as the horizontal water wheel.{{sfn|Wikander|2000a|pp=373–378}}{{sfn|Donners|Waelkens|Deckers|2002|pp=12–15}} Apart from its main use in grinding flour, water-power was also applied to pounding grain,{{sfn|Wikander|1985|p=158}}{{sfn|Wikander|2000b|p=403}}{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=16}} crushing ore,{{sfn|Wikander|2000b|p=407}} sawing stones{{sfn|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007}} and possibly fulling and bellows for iron furnaces.{{sfn|Wikander|2000b|pp=406f.}}

=== Monoliths ===
{{further|List of ancient Greek and Roman monoliths}}
In architecture, a [[Monolithic architecture|monolith]] is a structure which has been excavated as a unit from a surrounding matrix or outcropping of rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/glossary1.html#monolith |title=Glossary and Index of (mostly) Asian Art |author=Michael D.

They were either: quarried without being moved; or quarried and moved; or quarried, moved and lifted clear off the ground into their position (e.g. [[architrave]]s); or quarried, moved and erected in an upright position (e.g. [[column]]s).

Transporting was done by land or water (or a combination of both), in the later case often by special-built ships such as [[obelisk carrier]]s.{{sfn|Wirsching|2000}} For lifting operations, [[Crane (machine)#History|ancient cranes]] were employed since ca. 515 BC,{{sfn|Coulton|1974|pp=7, 16}} such as in the [[Trajan's Column#Construction|construction of Trajan's Column]].{{sfn|Lancaster|1999|pp=419–439}}

{{further|List of obelisks in Rome}}
[[File:RomaObeliscoSallustiano.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.5|''Obelisco Sallustiano'' in front of the church of [[Trinità dei Monti]] in Rome]]
An [[obelisk]] is a tall, four-sided, narrow tapering monument which ends in a pyramid-like shape at the top. These were originally called "tekhenu" by the builders, the ancient Egyptians. The Greeks who saw them used the Greek 'obeliskos' to describe them, and this word passed into Latin and then English.{{sfn|Baker|Baker|2001|page=69}} The Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style. Examples include:

=== Roman gardens ===
[[File:P1080474 Mosaico Conimbriga (Condeixa-a-Nova).jpg|thumb|right|Gardens in [[Conimbriga]], [[Portugal]]]]
[[Roman gardens]] were influenced by Egyptian, [[Persian gardens|Persian]], and [[Greek gardens|Greek]] gardening techniques {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. In Ancient [[Latium]], a garden was part of every farm. According to [[Cato the Elder]], every garden should be close to the house and should have flower beds and ornamental trees.{{sfn|Semple|1929|pp=435}} [[Horace]] wrote that during his time [[flower garden]]s became a national indulgence.{{sfn|Semple|1929|pp=436}}

Gardens were not reserved for the extremely wealthy. Excavations in [[Pompeii]] show that gardens attaching to residences were scaled down to meet the space constraints of the home of the average Roman. Modified versions of Roman garden designs were adopted in Roman settlements in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. As town houses were replaced by tall ''[[Insula (building)|insula]]'' (apartment buildings), these urban gardens were replaced by [[Flower box|window boxes]] or [[roof garden]]s. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

}}
A [[triumphal arch]] is a monumental structure in the shape of an [[arch]]way with one or more arched passageways, often designed to span a road. The origins of the Roman triumphal arch are unclear. There were precursors to the triumphal arch within the Roman world; in Italy, the [[Etruscans]] used elaborately decorated single bay arches as gates or portals to their cities. Surviving examples of Etruscan arches can still be seen at [[Perugia]] and [[Volterra]].{{sfn|Zaho|2004|p=18–25}} The two key elements of the triumphal arch – a round-topped arch and a square entablature – had long been in use as separate architectural elements in [[ancient Greece]].

The innovation of the Romans was to use these elements in a single free-standing structure. The columns became purely decorative elements on the outer face of arch, while the entablature, liberated from its role as a building support, became the frame for the civic and religious messages that the arch builders wished to convey.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=133–134}} Little is known about how the Romans viewed triumphal arches. [[Pliny the Elder]], writing in the first century AD, was the only ancient author to discuss them.{{sfn|Fürst|Grundmann|1998|p=43}} He wrote that they were intended to "elevate above the ordinary world" an image of an honoured person usually depicted in the form of a statue with a [[quadriga]].{{sfn|Fürst|Grundmann|1998|p=43}}

The first recorded Roman triumphal arches were set up in the time of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Britannica|606106|Triumphal Arch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generals who were granted a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] were termed ''triumphators'' and would erect ''[[Arch|fornices]]'' or honorific arches bearing statues to commemorate their victories.&lt;ref name="Grove Art"&gt;F. B. Sear and Richard John. "Triumphal arch." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 30 Jul. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Roman triumphal practices changed significantly at the start of the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]] when the first [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]] decreed that only emperors would be granted [[Roman triumph|triumphs]]. The triumphal arch changed from being a personal monument to being an essentially propagandistic one, serving to announce and promote the presence of the ruler and the laws of the state.{{sfn|Zaho|2004|p=18–25}} Arches were not necessarily built as entrances, but – unlike many modern triumphal arches – they were often erected across roads and were intended to be passed through, not round.{{sfn|Honour|Fleming|2005}}

Most Roman triumphal arches were built during the imperial period. By the fourth century AD there were 36 such arches in Rome, of which three have survived – the [[Arch of Titus]] (AD 81), the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] (203-205) and the [[Arch of Constantine]] (312). Numerous arches were built elsewhere in the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The single arch was the most common, but many triple arches were also built, of which the [[Triumphal Arch of Orange]] (''circa'' AD 21) is the earliest surviving example. From the 2nd century AD, many examples of the ''arcus quadrifrons'' – a square triumphal arch erected over a crossroads, with arched openings on all four sides – were built, especially in North Africa. Arch-building in Rome and Italy diminished after the time of Trajan (AD 98-117) but remained widespread in the provinces during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD; they were often erected to commemorate imperial visits.&lt;ref name="Grove Art"/&gt;
[[File:Arch of Augustus at Ariminum, dedicated to the Emperor Augustus by the Roman Senate in 27 BC, the oldest Roman arch which survives, Rimini, Italy (19948839545).jpg|thumb|The [[Arch of Augustus (Rimini)|Arch of Augustus]] in [[Rimini]] (Ariminum), dedicated to [[Augustus]] by the [[Roman Senate]] in 27 BC, the oldest surviving [[List of Roman triumphal arches|Roman triumphal arch]]]]

The ornamentation of an arch was intended to serve as a constant visual reminder of the triumph and ''triumphator''. The façade was ornamented with marble columns, and the piers and attics with decorative cornices. Sculpted panels depicted victories and achievements, the deeds of the ''triumphator'', the captured weapons of the enemy or the triumphal procession itself. The [[spandrel]]s usually depicted flying [[Victoria (mythology)|Victories]], while the attic was often inscribed with a dedicatory inscription naming and praising the ''triumphator''. The piers and internal passageways were also decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculptures. The vault was ornamented with [[coffer]]s. Some triumphal arches were surmounted by a statue or a ''currus triumphalis'', a group of statues depicting the emperor or general in a [[quadriga]].{{sfn|Zaho|2004|p=18–25}}&lt;ref name="Grove Art"/&gt;

Inscriptions on Roman triumphal arches were works of art in themselves, with very finely cut, sometimes gilded letters. The form of each letter and the spacing between them was carefully designed for maximum clarity and simplicity, without any decorative flourishes, emphasizing the Roman taste for restraint and order. This conception of what later became the art of [[typography]] remains of fundamental importance down to the present day.{{sfn|Honour|Fleming|2005}}

[[File:PompeiiStreet.jpg|thumb|left|A Roman street in [[Pompeii]]]]

=== Roads ===
[[Roman road]]s were vital to the maintenance and development of the Roman state, and were built from about 500 BC through the expansion and consolidation of the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Forbes|1993|page=146}} They provided efficient means for the overland movement of [[Military history of ancient Rome|armies]], officials and civilians, and the inland carriage of official communications and  [[Roman commerce|trade]] goods.{{sfn|Kaszynski|2000|p=9}} At the peak of Rome's development, no fewer than 29 great military highways radiated from the capital, and the Late Empire's 113 provinces were interconnected by 372 great road links.{{sfn|Bunson|2009|p=195}}{{sfn|O'Flaherty|2002|p=2}}
Roman road builders aimed at a regulation width (see [[#Laws and standards|Laws and standards]] above), but actual widths have been measured at between 3.6&amp;nbsp;ft (1.1&amp;nbsp;m) and more than {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Today, the concrete has worn from the spaces around the stones, giving the impression of a very bumpy road, but the original practice was to produce a surface that was no doubt much closer to being flat.

=== Aqueduct ===
{{Main|Roman aqueduct}}
{{further|List of aqueducts in the Roman Empire}}
[[File:AcueductoSegovia edit1.jpg|thumb|The [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], Spain]]
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont du Gard]], near [[Vers-Pont-du-Gard]], France]]
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] constructed numerous [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] in order to bring water from distant sources into their cities and towns, supplying [[Thermae|public baths]], [[latrine]]s, fountains and private households. Waste water was removed by complex [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|sewage systems]] and released into nearby bodies of water, keeping the towns clean and free from effluent. Aqueducts also provided water for mining operations, milling, farms and gardens.

Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone, being constructed along a slight downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick or concrete. Most were buried beneath the ground, and followed its contours; obstructing peaks were circumvented or, less often, tunnelled through. Where valleys or lowlands intervened, the conduit was carried on bridgework, or its contents fed into high-pressure lead, ceramic or stone pipes and siphoned across. Most aqueduct systems included sedimentation tanks, [[sluice]]s and distribution tanks to regulate the supply at need.

[[Rome]]'s first aqueduct supplied a water-fountain sited at the city's cattle market. By the third century AD, the city had eleven aqueducts, sustaining a population of over a million in a water-extravagant economy; most of the water supplied the city's many public baths. Cities and municipalities throughout the [[Roman Empire]] emulated this model, and funded aqueducts as objects of public interest and civic pride, "an expensive yet necessary luxury to which all could, and did, aspire."{{sfn|Gagarin|Fantham|2010|p= 145}}

Most Roman aqueducts proved reliable, and durable; some were maintained into the [[early modern]] era, and a few are still partly in use. Methods of aqueduct surveying and construction are noted by [[Vitruvius]] in his work ''[[De Architectura]]'' (1st century BC). The general [[Frontinus]] gives more detail in his [[De aquaeductu|official report]] on the problems, uses and abuses of Imperial Rome's public water supply. Notable examples of aqueduct architecture include the supporting piers of the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], and the aqueduct-fed cisterns of [[Constantinople]].

=== Bridges ===
[[File:Bridge Alcantara.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Alcántara Bridge]], Spain, a masterpiece of ancient bridge building]]
{{Main|Roman bridge}}
{{further|List of Roman bridges}}
Roman bridges, built by [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], were the first large and lasting bridges built.{{sfn|O'Connor|1993|p=1}} Roman bridges were built with stone and had the [[arch]] as the basic structure (see [[arch bridge]]). Most utilized [[Roman concrete|concrete]] as well, which the Romans were the first to use for bridges.

Roman arch bridges were usually [[semicircle|semicircular]], although a few were [[circular segment|segmental]] (such as [[Alconétar Bridge]]). A segmental arch is an arch that is less than a semicircle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://imgs.ebuild.com/woc/M880252.pdf |title=Designing the segmental arch |last=Beall |first=Christine |year=1988 |publisher=ebuild.com |accessdate=8 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of the [[circular segment|segmental]] arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones ([[voussoir]]s) of the same in size and shape. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch [[Roman aqueducts|aqueducts]], such as the [[Pont du Gard]] and [[Aqueduct of Segovia|Segovia Aqueduct]]. Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the [[Pons Fabricius]] in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing.
Roman engineers were the first and until the [[industrial revolution]] the only ones to construct bridges with [[Roman concrete|concrete]], which they called [[Opus caementicium]]. The outside was usually covered with brick or ashlar, as in the Alcántara bridge.

The Romans also introduced segmental arch bridges into bridge construction. The 330&amp;nbsp;m long [[Limyra Bridge]] in southwestern [[Turkey]] features 26 segmental arches with an average span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1,{{sfn|O'Connor|1993|p=126}} giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed for more than a millennium. [[Trajan's bridge]] over the [[Danube]] featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on 40&amp;nbsp;m high concrete piers). This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790&amp;nbsp;m long [[Puente Romano (Mérida)|Puente Romano]] at [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].

=== Canals ===
{{further|List of Roman canals}}
Roman canals were typically multi-purpose structures, intended for [[irrigation]], [[drainage]], [[land reclamation]], [[flood control]] and [[navigation]] where feasible. Some navigational canals were recorded by [[List of Graeco-Roman geographers|ancient geographers]] and are still traceable by [[modern archaeology]]. Channels which served the needs of urban [[water supply]] are covered at the [[List of aqueducts in the Roman Empire]].

=== Cisterns ===
{{further|List of Roman cisterns}}
[[File:Yerebatan2.JPG|thumb|The [[Basilica Cistern]] in [[Constantinople]] provided water for the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Imperial Palace]].]]
Freshwater reservoirs were commonly set up at the termini of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] and their branch lines, supplying urban households, [[Villa rustica|agricultural estates]], imperial palaces, [[thermae]] or naval bases of the [[Roman navy]].{{sfn|Döring|2002|pp=310–319}}

=== Dams ===
{{further|List of Roman dams and reservoirs}}
Roman dam construction began in earnest in the [[History of the Roman Empire|early imperial period]].{{sfn|Hodge|1992|p=87}} For the most part, it concentrated on the semi-arid fringe of the empire, namely the provinces of [[Roman North Africa|North Africa]], the [[Near East]], and [[Hispania]].{{sfn|Schnitter|1978|p=28, fig. 7}} {{sfn|Hodge|1992|p=80}}{{sfn|Hodge|2000|p=332}} The relative abundance of Spanish dams below is due partly to more intensive field work there; for [[Roman Italy|Italy]] only the [[Subiaco Dams]], created by emperor [[Nero]] (54–68 AD) for recreational purposes, are attested.{{sfn|Smith|1970|pp=60f.}}{{sfn|Hodge|1992|p=87}} These dams are noteworthy, though, for their extraordinary height, which remained unsurpassed anywhere in the world until the [[Late Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Hodge|1992|p= 87}}

The most frequent dam types were earth- or rock-filled [[embankment dam]]s and masonry [[gravity dam]]s.{{sfn|Hodge|2000|pp=331f.}} These served a wide array of purposes, such as [[irrigation]], [[flood control]], river diversion, soil-retention, or a combination of these functions.{{sfn|Hodge|1992|pp=86f.}} The impermeability of Roman dams was increased by the introduction of waterproof hydraulic [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and especially ''[[opus caementicium]]'' in the [[Concrete Revolution]]. These materials also allowed for bigger structures to be built,{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=49}} like the [[Lake Homs Dam]], possibly the largest water barrier today,{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=42}} and the sturdy [[Harbaqa Dam]], both of which consist of a concrete core.

Roman builders were the first to realize the stabilizing effect of [[arch]]es and [[buttress]]es, which they integrated into their dam designs. Previously unknown dam types introduced by the Romans include [[arch-gravity dam]]s,{{sfn|Hodge|2000|p=332}}{{sfn|James|Chanson|2002}} [[arch dam]]s,;{{sfn|Smith|1971|pp=33–35}}{{sfn|Schnitter|1978|pp=31f.}}{{sfn|Schnitter|1987a|p=12}} {{sfn|Schnitter|1987c|p=80}}{{sfn|Hodge|2000|p=332, fn. 2}} [[buttress dam]]s,{{sfn|Schnitter|1987b|pp=59–62}} and [[Arch dam#Variations|multiple-arch buttress dams]].{{sfn|Schnitter|1978|p=29}}{{sfn|Schnitter|1987b|pp=60, table 1, 62}}{{sfn|James|Chanson|2002}}{{sfn|Arenillas|Castillo|2003}}

===Defensive walls===
[[File:Muralla de Lugo - 03.jpg|thumb|[[Roman walls of Lugo]], Spain]]
[[File:Trier Porta Nigra BW 2.JPG|thumb|The [[Porta Nigra]] of [[Trier]], [[Germany]], capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]], constructed between 186 and 200 AD]]
{{Main|Ancient Roman defensive walls}}
The Romans generally fortified cities, rather than fortresses, but there are some fortified camps, such as the [[Saxon Shore#The forts|Saxon Shore forts]] like [[Portus Adurni|Porchester Castle]] in England.  City walls were already significant in [[Etruscan architecture]], and in the struggle for control of Italy under the early Republic many more were built, using different techniques.  These included tightly-fitting massive irregular polygonal blocks, shaped to fit exactly in a way reminiscent of later [[Inca]] work. The Romans called a simple rampart wall an [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]; at this date great height was not necessary. The [[Servian Wall]] around Rome was an ambitious project of the early 4th century BC. The wall was up to 10&amp;nbsp;metres (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft) in height in places, 3.6&amp;nbsp;metres (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at its base, 11&amp;nbsp;km (7&amp;nbsp;mi) long,&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Nic; Peter Dennis ''The Walls of Rome'' Osprey Publishing; 10 Mar 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84603-198-4}} p.10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SDxrLQymWWwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=height+servian+wall&amp;as_brr=3#PPA10,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to have had 16 main gates, though many of these are mentioned only from writings, with no other known remains.  Some of it had a ''fossa'' or ditch in front, and an agger behind, and it was enough to deter [[Hannibal]]. Later the [[Aurelian Wall]] replaced it, enclosing an expanded city, and using more sophisticated designs, with small forts at intervals.

The Romans walled major cities and towns in areas they saw as vulnerable, and parts of many walls remain incorporated in later defensive fortifications, as at [[Roman walls of Córdoba|Córdoba]] (2nd century BC), [[Chester city walls|Chester]] (earth and wood in the 70s AD, stone from c. 100), and [[York city walls|York]] (from 70s AD).  Strategic walls across open country were far rarer, and [[Hadrian's Wall]] (from 122) and the [[Antonine Wall]] (from 142, abandoned only 8 years after completion) are the most significant examples, both on the [[Picts|Pictish]] frontier of [[Roman Britain]]...

== Architectural features ==

=== Mosaics ===
{{main|Roman mosaic}}
On his return from campaigns in Greece, the general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] brought back what is probably the most well-known element of the early [[Roman Empire|imperial period]], the [[mosaic]], a decoration made of colourful chips of stone inserted into cement. This tiling method took the empire by storm in the late first century and the second century and in the Roman home joined the well known [[mural]] in decorating floors, walls, and [[grotto]]es with [[geometry|geometric]] and [[image|pictorial]] designs.

There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' used tiny ''[[tesserae]]'', typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny ''tesserae'' allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting.  Often small panels called ''emblemata'' were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work.  The normal technique, however, was ''[[opus tessellatum]]'', using larger tesserae, which were laid on site.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=116–119}}  There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=121–123}}

A specific genre of Roman mosaic obtained the name ''asaroton'' (Greek "unswept floor"). It represented an optical illusion of the leftovers from a feast on the floor of reach houses.{{sfn|Miller|1972}}

=== Hypocaust ===
[[File:Vieux la Romaine Villa hypocauste.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Part-excavated [[hypocaust]] under the floor in a [[Roman villa]] in Vieux-la-Romaine, near [[Caen]], France]]
A [[hypocaust]] was an ancient Roman system of [[underfloor heating]], used to heat houses with hot air. The Roman architect Vitruvius, writing about the end of the 1st century B.C., attributes their invention to [[Sergius Orata]]. Many remains of Roman hypocausts have survived throughout Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.  The hypocaust was an invention which improved the hygiene and living conditions of citizens, and was a forerunner of modern [[central heating]].

Hypocausts were used for heating hot baths ([[thermae]]), houses and other buildings, whether public or private. The floor was raised above the ground by pillars, called [[pilae stacks]], with a layer of tiles, then a layer of concrete, then another of tiles on top; and spaces were left inside the walls so that hot air and smoke from the [[furnace]] would pass through these enclosed areas and out of flues in the roof, thereby heating but not polluting the interior of the room.

=== Roman roofs ===
{{further|List of ancient Greek and Roman roofs}}
In [[Magna Graecia|Sicily]] truss roofs presumably appeared as early as 550 BC.{{sfn|Hodge|1960|p=38–44}}Their potential was fully realized in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period, which saw trussed roofs over 30 wide spanning the rectangular spaces of monumental public buildings such as [[Roman temple|temples]], [[basilica]]s, and later [[Church (building)|churches]]. Such spans were three times as wide as the widest prop-and-lintel roofs and only surpassed by the largest [[List of Roman domes|Roman domes]].{{sfn|Ulrich|2007|pp=148f}}

The largest [[truss]] roof by span of ancient Rome covered the [[Flavian Palace|Aula Regia]] (throne room) built for emperor [[Domitian]] (81–96&amp;nbsp;AD) on the [[Palatine Hill]], Rome. The timber truss roof had a width of 31.67&amp;nbsp;m, slightly surpassing the postulated limit of 30&amp;nbsp;m for Roman roof constructions. Tie-beam trusses allowed for much larger spans than the older prop-and-lintel system and even concrete vaulting. Nine out of the ten largest rectangular spaces in Roman architecture were bridged this way, the only exception being the groin vaulted [[Basilica of Maxentius]].{{sfn|Ulrich|2007|pp=148f}}

=== Spiral stairs ===
{{further|List of ancient spiral stairs}}
The [[Stairway#Spiral and helical stairs|spiral stair]] is a type of [[stairway]] which, due to its complex [[helix|helical]] structure, was introduced relatively late into architecture. Although the oldest example dates back to the 5th century BC,{{sfn|Beckmann|2002}} it was only in the wake of the influential design of [[Trajan's Column]] that this space-saving new type permanently caught hold in Roman architecture.{{sfn|Beckmann|2002|p=353–356}}

Apart from the [[triumphal column]]s in the imperial cities of [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]], other types of buildings such as [[Roman temple|temples]], [[thermae]], [[basilica]]s and tombs were also fitted with spiral stairways.{{sfn|Beckmann|2002|p=353–356}} Their notable absence in the towers of the [[Aurelian Wall]] indicates that although used in [[medieval castle]]s, they did not yet figure prominently in [[Roman military engineering]].{{sfn|Beckmann|2002|p=353–356}} By [[late antiquity]], separate stair towers were constructed adjacent to the main buildings, as in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]].

The construction of spiral stairs passed on both to [[Church architecture|Christian]] and [[Islamic architecture]].

'''Charles Dawson''' (11 July 1864 – 10 August 1916) was a British amateur [[archaeologist]] who was initially credited with, and is now blamed for, discoveries that turned out to be imaginative [[fraud]]s, climaxing with that of the [[Piltdown Man]] (''Eoanthropus dawsoni''), which he presented in 1912.  Dawson was often present at finds in the archaeological digs, or was the finder himself.

Born the eldest of three sons, Dawson moved with his family from [[Preston, Lancashire]] to [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]] when he was still very young. Charles initially studied as a lawyer following his father and pursued a hobby of collecting and studying fossils.&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;Spencer (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

He made a number of seemingly important fossil finds. Amongst these were teeth from a previously unknown species of mammal, later named ''[[Plagiaulax]] dawsoni'' in his honour; three new species of dinosaur, one later named ''[[Barilium|Iguanodon dawsoni]]''; and a new form of fossil plant, ''Salaginella dawsoni''. The [[British Museum]] conferred upon him the title of Honorary Collector. For these important finds he was elected a [[fellow]] of the [[Geological Society]] and a few years later after another find, to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1895. Dawson died prematurely from [[sepsis|septicaemia]] in 1916 at [[Lewes]], Sussex.&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;

==Alleged discoveries==
[[File:Sterkfontein Caves 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A replica of the Piltdown Man skull.]]

In 1889 Dawson was a co-founder of the Hastings and St Leonards Museum Association, one of the first voluntary museum friends groups established in Britain. Dawson worked on a voluntary basis as a member of the Museum Committee, in charge of the acquisition of artefacts and documents. His interest in archaeology developed and he had an uncanny knack of making spectacular discoveries, ''The Sussex Daily News'' named him the "Wizard of Sussex" for his success.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;

In 1893 Dawson investigated a curious flint mine full of prehistoric, Roman and mediaeval artefacts at Lavant, near [[Chichester]] and probed in inner depths of two tunnels beneath [[Hastings Castle]]. In the same year, he presented the British Museum with a Roman statuette from Beauport Park, which was made, uniquely for the period, of cast iron. Other discoveries followed, including a strange form of hafted Neolithic stone axe and a well-preserved ancient timber boat.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;

[[File:Toad in a hole - Booth Museum Brighton.jpg|thumb|[[Entombed animal|Toad in the hole]], claimed by Dawson to have been found by workmen in a Lewes quarry]]
He studied ancient quarries, re-analysed the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] and, in 1909, produced what was then the definitive study of Hastings Castle. He later found faked evidence for the final phases of Roman occupation in Britain at [[Pevensey Castle]] in Sussex.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;Walsh (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating unusual elements of the natural world, Dawson presented a [[Entombed animal|petrified toad]] inside a flint nodule, discovered a large supply of natural gas at Heathfield in East Sussex, reported on a sea-serpent in the English Channel, observed a new species of human and found a strange goldfish/carp hybrid. It was even reported that he was experimenting with phosphorescent bullets as a deterrent to [[Zeppelin]] attacks on London.

In recognition of his many discoveries, Dawson was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1895. At the age of 31, and without a university degree to his name, he was now Charles Dawson F.G.S., F.S.A. His most famous discovery was in 1912 with the discovery of the [[Piltdown Man]] which was billed as the "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]" between humans and other [[Hominidae|great apes]].&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Questions about the Piltdown find were raised from the beginning, first by [[Arthur Keith]], but also by paleontologists and anatomists from the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and from Europe. Those disputing the find were attacked in very personal terms. Challenges to Piltdown Man arose again in the 1920s, but were again dismissed. In 1949, further questions were raised about the Piltdown Man and its authenticity, which led to the conclusive demonstration that Piltdown was a hoax, in 1953. Since then, a number of Dawson's other finds have also been shown to be forged or planted.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shreeve (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Miles Russell]] of [[Bournemouth University]] published the results of his investigation into Dawson's antiquarian collection and concluded that at least 38 specimens were clear fakes. Russell has noted that Dawson’s whole academic career appears to have been "one built upon deceit, sleight of hand, fraud and deception, the ultimate gain being international recognition".&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a team of British researchers used DNA studies to provide added evidence for the provenance of Piltdown Man. They concluded that Dawson likely acted alone, and was the only person in the group of suspected perpetrators with sufficient scientific knowledge to have carried off the bluff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Groote|first1=Isabelle|display-authors=etal|title=New genetic and morphological evidence suggests a single hoaxer created ‘Piltdown man’|journal=Royal Society Open Science|date=2016|volume=3|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/8/160328|doi=10.1098/rsos.160328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Dawson never received a knighthood, though many others associated with the Piltdown "find" did, and was never elected to the Royal Society. Following his death in 1916, no further finds were made at Piltdown.&lt;ref name="walsh"/&gt;

The "'''Class of 9/11'''" is a term coined by [[National Public Radio]] for American [[high school]] graduating classes of 2005. These students were [[freshman|freshmen]] when the  [[September 11 attacks]] occurred in 2001, and have had to cope with the many aspects of the aftermath during teenage life and high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Sept. 11 Shaped the Class of 2005  |first= Susan |last=Stamberg |authorlink= Susan Stamberg |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4656203 |newspaper= |publisher =[[National Public Radio]] |date=May 18, 2005 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Class of 2002''' can also be considered the Class of 9/11.

This term is now used mainly for the 2005 graduating class of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], which contained 911 students.  According to the [[Associated Press]] report the graduating cadets were told they were "a special group forged by historic events".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Joining during peace, cadets graduate in terror's shadow |first=Michael |last=Hill |newspaper= |date=May 29, 2005 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Comoedia Lydiae''''' (or '''''Lidia''''') is a [[medieval Latin]] [[elegiac comedy]] from the late twelfth century. The "argument" at the beginning of the play refers to it as the ''Lidiades'' (line 3, a play on ''[[Heroides]]''), which the manuscripts [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]] as ''comedia de Lidia facta'' (a comedy made about Lidia) and which its English translator gives as ''Adventures of Lidia''.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, 126 and 133n3.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lidia'' was long ascribed to [[Matthew of Vendôme|Matthieu de Vendôme]], but in 1924 [[Edmond Faral]], in his study of Latin "''[[fabliau]]x''", discounted this hypothesis. More recently, scholars have argued in favour of the authorship of the cleric [[Arnulf of Orléans (commentator)|Arnulf of Orléans]], which now seems secure.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, xlv.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was probably composed sometime shortly after 1175.

Compared with the other elegiac comedies, ''Lidia'' is not as dependent on [[Ovid]]. It is dark and cynical in its view of [[human nature]], even [[misogynistic]]. Lidia, the title character, is portrayed as a complete brute, sexually mischievous, faithless, cruel, and completely self-centred. Arnulf is explicit when he claims that Lidia is just a typical woman (line 37).

In style, ''Lidia'' is highly [[rhetoric]]al. Bruno Roy called it "the [[apotheosis]] of the [[pun]]".&lt;ref&gt;Roy, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Lidia's name is often punned with ''ludus'' (game) and ''ludere'' (play), often with connotations of deception or sexual activity. Women are the ''[[virus]]'' that destroys ''virum'' (man, [[virility]]). Lidia would be unsatisfied even with ten (''decem'') men, a pun on her husband's name, Decius. The puns, though fashionable in the late twelfth century, make elegance in translation very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, xlvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lidia'' is preserved in two fourteenth-century manuscripts. One of them may have been copied by the hand of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. Regardless, he certainly borrowed the tale for his  ''[[Decameron]]'', [[Summary of Decameron tales#Ninth tale .28VII.2C 9.29|7.9]]. His major alteration was the name of Lidia's husband, changed from Decius to Nicostrato. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] also borrowed aspects of ''Lidia'' for  "[[The Merchant's Prologue and Tale|The Merchant's Tale]]", one of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.

==Story==
The comedy is divided into three parts: a short "argument" explaining the nature and purpose of the work, a brief [[prologue]] laying out the characters and the situation, and the story itself. In the argument Arnulf claims that he is writing to improve upon his previous comedy about "the sportive knight", ''[[Miles gloriosus (Arnulf of Orléans)|Miles gloriosus]]''. He has depicted "all female wiles worthy of note" so that you "may flee forewarned: after all,  you too may have a Lidia in your life" (lines 5&amp;ndash;6). A moralistic or didactic purpose was often given in the Middle Ages to justify the production of eroticised or sexualised literature.

The prologue begins with a pun on one of the main characters, Pyrrhus, the loyal [[knight]] of Lidia's husband, the [[duke]] Decius, and the Latin word for [[pear tree]], ''pirus''. The pun is accommodated in English by use of "Pearus" for "Pyrrhus". A pear was a common phallic symbol from antiquity to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;According to Elliot, 146n34, citing [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]], "pear" can mean "[[testicle]]", as when Lusca asks Pearus to "strike that pear [the fruit] with a better one". Another elegiac comedy, ''[[Alda (comedy)|Alda]]'', also about a character named Pyrrhus, involves the same pun on ''pirus'' for both "pear tree" and "testis/penis". According to Vasvári, 9 and n9, this "protracted botanical symbolism" dates back at least to [[Classical Latin]] and forward as far as Chaucer and Boccacio. For its use in antiquity, see James N. Adams (1982), ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press). For its use in ''[[Cligès]]'', see L. Polak (1972), "Cligès, Fénice, et l'arbre d'amour", ''Romania'', 93:303&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatist is poking fun at Pyrrhus when he refers to "the pears fallen from the pear tree" (line 8). The references to the "jealous one" in the prologue are probably a reference to Matthieu de Vendôme and his rivalry with Arnulf.

The tale begins by describing Lidia's dissatisfaction with her marriage. She is enamored of Pearus and whenever he passes she pretends to faint, his name gets stuck in her throat (which, given its phallic symbolism, is an [[innuendo]] for [[oral sex]]), and when she lies in her bed alone she is pleased that Decius is away. She then concocts a plan to test Pearus. She sends her elderly messenger Lusca (the one-eyed) to tell Pearus how she dies for him, would willingly give herself to him, and is unfaithful to her husband. Shocked, Pearus rationalises that it is a test of his loyalty planned by his master, Decius, and proclaims that just as Lidia is loyal to the duke, so is Pearus.

What follows is a diatribe from Lusca on the evil of women, the promiscuity of Lidia, and the decline of the state of marriage. She decides, however, that her interests are best served by Lidia's continued infidelity, since a disloyal wife is freer with her husband's wealth. When Lusca approaches Pearus a second time, the knight is moved by the story of [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] to test Lusca's allegation that Decius is a fool whom Lidia controls and deceives at will. He devises three tests for Lidia: she must kill the duke's prized [[falcon]] to prove she can deceive him, she must pluck five hairs from his beard, and she must extract one of his teeth. Each of these tests is a test of virility, since the falcon, the beard, and the tooth could all be symbols for male sexuality in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, 145n23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following scene, Lusca relays Pearus' challenge to Lidia. Lidia, dressed "sumptuously", then brazenly enters the noisy hall where Decius is holding court, makes an impassioned speech accusing Decius of preferring the hunting grounds to her bedchamber, and grabbing the falcon from its perch, wrings its neck in front of all. Then, laughing, she nuzzles up to Decius and plucks five hairs from his beard, claiming that they were white, making him appear older than he was.

The ruse to take Decius' tooth takes days of planning. Lidia eventually has the youthful cupbearers turn their heads to the side as they serve the wine, in the belief that they have bad breath. Then, at the banquet, she loudly proclaims that they turn aside because Decius has bad breath. Pearus is then summoned to help remove the duke's offending bad tooth. Amazed, Pearus then concedes to Lidia's newest wish: to be caught "''[[wikt:in flagrante delicto|in flagrante delicto]]''" by the duke.

The plan is simple. Lidia feigns illness and the four named characters make a trip to a garden to help relieve her. When they arrive at a pear tree, Decius sends Pearus up it to fetch some fruit. While in the tree the knight, feigning modesty, pretends that he can see the duke and Lidia in the act of intercourse. Lidia explains that it is an illusion caused by the height. Decius and Pearus promptly switch places to test the illusion. While Pearus and Lidia have sex, the duke believes he is being tricked by the pear tree. When he climbs down, he orders the tree cut down, at Lidia's request, so that it will not deceive others.

'''Curt Weibull''' (19 August 1886 &amp;ndash; 10 November 1991) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] historian, educator and author.

==Biography==
Curt Hugo Johannes Weibull was born in [[Lund]], Sweden. He was a member of the noted Swedish [[:sv:Weibull|Weibull family]]. He was the son of history professor [[:sv:Martin Weibull (historiker)|Martin Weibull]] (1835–1902) and the  brother of [[Lauritz Weibull]], Alexander Weibull, Julius Oscar Elof Weibull and Carl Gustaf Weibull. He and his brothers attended the [[University of Lund]].

Curt Weibull was a professor of history at [[Gothenburg University]] from 1927–1953 and its president from 1936 to 1946. In 1928 he and his brother, Lauritz Weibull, founded the [[periodical]] ''Scandia''. Together they are known for having introduced a critical theory of history in Swedish historical research, inspired by German historian, [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Weibull was an important mentor to historian [[Erik Lönnroth]], who further developed the methods to evaluate sources.

His most important and acclaimed work is a criticism regarding the interpretation and the [[ahistoricism]] of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by the 12th century Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]]. This piece was called: ''Saxo. Kritiska undersökningar i Danmarks historia från Sven Estridsens död till Canute VI'' (Saxo. Critical studies in Denmark's history from Sven Estriden's death to [[Canute VI]]), and was rather controversial at the time, as it revealed the vague foundations of [[Denmark]]'s older history of the time.

In 1991, when he was 105, his last work was published: an article in a book celebrating the 100th anniversary of [[Gothenburg University]]. That probably makes him the oldest historian in the world to have a new study published while still alive. An anecdote tells that when a Danish historian was counter-criticizing parts of Weibull's Ph.D. thesis (from 1916) on Saxo Grammaticus in his own thesis (believing Weibull to be dead since this was after his 100th birthday) Weibull appeared on the public disputation angrily defending his work. In the late 1970s, while holding a lecture about his life and his research to younger students, he had cheekily remarked about a Danish professor who had criticized his own thesis when it appeared: "I haven't replied in depth to the criticism of the professor. But it's not too late, now is it?"

He was the father of the Swedish historian and Liberal politician, [[:sv:Jörgen Weibull|Jorgen Weibull]] (1924–1998) and was buried in [[:sv:Norra kyrkogården, Lund|Norra kyrkogården]] in Lund.

'''Ethiopian historiography''' embodies the [[Ancient literature|ancient]], [[Medieval literature|medieval]], [[Early modern literature|early modern]] and [[History of modern literature|modern]] disciplines of recording the [[history of Ethiopia]], including both native and foreign sources. The roots of Ethiopian historical writing can be traced back to the ancient [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (c. 100 – c. 940 AD). These early texts were written in either the Ethiopian [[Ge'ez script]] or the [[Greek alphabet]], and included a variety of mediums such as [[manuscript]]s and [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] inscriptions on monumental [[stelae]] and [[obelisk]]s documenting contemporary events. The writing of [[history]] became an established genre in [[Ethiopian literature]] during the early [[Solomonic dynasty]] (1270–1974). In this period, written histories were usually in the form of royal [[biographies]] and dynastic [[chronicle]]s, supplemented by [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] literature and [[Universal history|universal histories]] in the form of [[annal]]s. [[Christian mythology]] became a linchpin of medieval Ethiopian [[historiography]] due to works such as the [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Orthodox]] ''[[Kebra Nagast]]''. This reinforced the genealogical traditions of Ethiopia's Solomonic dynasty [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|rulers]], which asserted that they were descendants of [[Solomon]], the legendary [[Kings of Israel and Judah|King of Israel]].

Ethiopian historiographic literature has been traditionally dominated by [[Christian theology]] and the [[chronology of the Bible]]. There was also considerable influence from [[Islam|Muslim]], [[pagan]] and foreign elements from within the [[Horn of Africa]] and beyond. Diplomatic ties with [[Christendom]] were established in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] under Ethiopia's first Christian king, [[Ezana of Axum]], in the 4th century AD, and were renewed in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with embassies traveling to and from [[medieval Europe]]. Building on the legacy of ancient [[Greek historiography|Greek]] and [[Roman historiography|Roman]] historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical [[Prester John]], who was viewed as a potential ally against [[History of Islam|Islamic powers]]. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval [[Historiography of early Islam|Islamic historiography]] and even [[Chinese historiography|Chinese]] [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedias]], [[travel literature]], and [[Official history|official]] [[Twenty-Four Histories|histories]].

During the 16th century and onset of the [[early modern period]], [[military alliance]]s with the [[Portuguese Empire]] were made, the [[Jesuit]] [[Christian mission|Catholic missionaries]] arrived, and prolonged warfare with [[Islam in Africa|Islamic foes]] including the [[Adal Sultanate]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], as well as with the [[polytheistic]] [[Oromo people]], threatened the security of the [[Ethiopian Empire]]. These contacts and conflicts inspired works of [[ethnography]], by authors such as the monk and historian [[Bahrey]], which were embedded into the existing historiographic tradition and encouraged a broader view in historical chronicles for [[Foreign relations of Ethiopia|Ethiopia's place in the world]]. The [[Jesuit missions|Jesuit missionaries]] [[Pedro Páez]] (1564–1622) and [[Manuel de Almeida]] (1580–1646) also composed a history of Ethiopia, but it remained in manuscript form among Jesuit priests of [[Portuguese India]] and was not published in [[Western world|the West]] until modern times.

[[Outline of Ethiopia|Modern Ethiopian]] historiography was developed locally by native Ethiopians as well as by foreign historians, most notably [[Hiob Ludolf]] (1624–1704), the German [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] who British historian [[Edward Ullendorff]] (1920–2011) considered the founder of [[Ethiopian Studies]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a period where Western historiographic methods were introduced and synthesized with traditionalist practices, embodied by works such as those by [[Heruy Wolde Selassie]] (1878–1938). The discipline has since developed new approaches in studying the nation's past and offered criticism of some traditional [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-dominated views that have been prevalent, sometimes at the expense of Ethiopia's traditional ties with the [[Middle East]]. [[Marxist historiography]] and [[African studies]] have also played significant roles in developing the discipline. Since the 20th century, historians have given greater consideration to issues of class, gender, and ethnicity. Traditions pertaining mainly to other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic-speaking]] populations have also been accorded more importance, with literary, linguistic, and archaeological analyses reshaping the perception of their roles in historical Ethiopian society. Historiography of the 20th century focused largely on the [[Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1935 and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], whereas the Ethiopian victory over the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]] played a major role in the historiographic literature of these two countries immediately following the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].

==Ancient origins==

[[File:Ethio w11.jpg|thumb|alt=Epigraphy in ancient boustrophedon, pre-axoumitic period, found near Aksum - Aksum museum.|An [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] text in the old [[Ge'ez]] [[Ge'ez script|script]] and ancient [[boustrophedon]], from the period preceding the foundation of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (c. 100 AD), found near [[Axum]], Ethiopia]]

Writing was introduced to Ethiopia [[Dʿmt|as far back as the 5th century BC]] with the [[ancient South Arabian script]].{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=375}} This [[South Semitic]] script served as the basis for the creation of Ethiopia's [[Ge'ez]] script, the oldest evidence for it found in [[Matara, Eritrea]], and dated to the 2nd century AD.{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=375}} However, the 1st-century AD [[Latin literature|Roman]] ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' asserts that the local ruler of Adulis could speak and write [[Ancient Greek|in Greek]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=273}} This embrace of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] could also be found in the [[coin]]age of [[Aksumite currency]], in which legends were usually [[History of the Greek alphabet|written in Greek]], much like [[ancient Greek coinage]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=273}}

===Epigraphy===
The roots of the [[Historiography|historiographic]] tradition in Ethiopia date back to the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite period]] (c. 100 – c. 940 AD) and are found in [[epigraphic]] texts commissioned by monarchs to recount the deeds of their reign and royal house.  Written in a false [[autobiographical]] style, in either the native [[Ge'ez script]], the [[Greek alphabet]], or both, they are preserved on [[stelae]], [[throne]]s, and [[obelisk]]s found in a wide geographical span that includes [[Sudan]], [[Eritrea]], and [[Ethiopia]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=14–15}} In commemorating the contemporary ruler or aristocrats and elite members of society, these documents record various historical events such as military campaigns, diplomatic missions, and acts of [[philanthropy]]. For instance, 4th-century stelae erected by [[Ezana of Axum]] memorialize his achievements in battle and expansion of the realm in the [[Horn of Africa]], while the ''[[Monumentum Adulitanum]]'' inscribed on a throne in [[Adulis]], Eritrea, contains descriptions of [[Kaleb of Axum]]'s conquests in the [[Red Sea]] region during the 6th century, including parts of the [[Arabian peninsula]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=15}} It is clear that such texts influenced the [[epigraphy]] of later Aksumite rulers who still considered their lost Arabian territories as part of their realm.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=16}}

[[File:Ezana.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin of the Axumite king Ezana.|left|A silver coin of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite]] [[List of kings of Axum|king]] [[Ezana]], mid-4th century AD]]

In [[Roman historiography]], the [[ecclesiastical]] history of [[Tyrannius Rufinus]], a [[History of Latin|Latin translation]] and extension of the work of [[Eusebius]] dated circa 402, offers an account of the Christian conversion of Ethiopia (labeled as "India ulterior") by the missionary [[Frumentius]] of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=273–274}} The text explains that Frumentius, in order to complete this task, was ordained a bishop by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] (298–373), most likely after 346 during the latter's third tenure as [[Bishop of Alexandria]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=274–275}} The mission certainly took place before 357, when Athanasius was deposed, replaced by [[George of Cappadocia]], and forced into flight, during which he wrote an apologetic letter to [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantius II]] (r. 337–361) that coincidentally preserved an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] letter to the royal court of Aksum.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=275}} In this letter, Constantius II addresses two "tyrants" of Ethiopia, Aizanas and Sazanas, who are undoubtedly Ezana and his brother Saiazana, or Sazanan, a military commander.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=275–276}} The letter also hints that the ruler of Aksum was already a [[Christian monarchy|Christian monarch]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=275}} From the early inscriptions of Ezana's reign it is clear that he was once a [[Polytheism|polytheist]],{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=276}} who erected bronze, silver, and gold statues to [[Ares]], [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god of war]].{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=375}} But the dual Greek and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean-style]] Ge'ez inscriptions on the [[Ezana Stone]], commemorating Ezana's conquests of the [[Kingdom of Kush]] (located in [[Nubia]], i.e. modern Sudan), mention his [[conversion to Christianity]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=276}} This claim is supported by the [[Christian symbolism|Christian symbol]] of [[Christian cross|the cross]] decorating virtually all [[Numismatics|Aksumite coins]] minted after Ezana's reign, along with the sudden discontinuation of polytheistic writings.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=275–276}}

[[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], a 6th-century [[Eastern Roman]] monk and former merchant who wrote the ''[[Christian Topography]]'' (describing the [[Indo-Roman trade relations|Indian Ocean trade]] leading all the way [[Sino-Roman relations|to China]]),{{sfnp|Yule|1915|pp=25, 28}} visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book.{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=372}} He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the [[Sabaeans]] in what is now [[Yemen]], along with other parts of western Arabia.{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=372}}{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=277}} Ancient Sabaean texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler [[GDRT|Gadara]], who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the [[Himyar]]ite ruler [[Shammar Yahri'sh]] (r. c. 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia.{{sfnp|Robin|2012|pp=277–278}} It is only from Sabaean and [[Himyaritic language|Himyarite inscriptions]] that we know the names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs [[`DBH]] and [[DTWNS]].{{sfnp|Robin|2012|p=278}} Inscriptions of king Ezana mention [[Architecture of Ethiopia|stone-carved thrones]] near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in [[Axum]] (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=372}}

===Manuscripts===
Aside from epigraphy, Aksumite historiography also includes the [[manuscript]] textual tradition. Some of the earliest Ethiopian [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] manuscripts include translations of the [[Bible]] into Ge'ez, such as the [[Garima Gospels]] that were written between the 4th and 7th centuries and imitated the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript art]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=15–16}}{{sfnp|Anfray|2000|p=376}}  The Aksum Collection containing a Ge'ez [[codex]] that provides chronologies for the [[diocese]] and [[episcopal see]]s of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in [[Roman Egypt]] was compiled between the 5th and 7th centuries.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=15–16}} These texts reveal how the Aksumites viewed history through the narrow lens of [[Biblical studies|Christian chronology]], but their early historiography was perhaps also influenced by non-Christian works, such as those from the Kingdom of Kush, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of [[Hellenistic Egypt]], and the [[Yemenite Jews]] of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=16}}

===Zagwe dynasty===
The power of the Aksumite Kingdom declined after the 6th century due to the rise of other regional states in the [[History of the Horn of Africa|Horn of Africa]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=17}} Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure [[Gudit]] (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum.{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|pp=16–17}} The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk [[Tekle Haymanot]], who compiled historical writings gathered from various [[Christianity in Ethiopia|Ethiopian churches and monasteries]].{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|p=16}} The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to [[Judaism]]. The Scottish travel writer [[James Bruce]] (1730–1794) was incredulous about the tale and believed she was simply a Jewish queen.{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|p=16}} [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] (1872–1949) hypothesized that she was an ethnic [[Sidama people|Sidamo]] from [[Damot]], whereas [[Steven Kaplan (historian)|Steven Kaplan]] argues she was a non-Christian invader and historian [[Knud Tage Andersen]] contends she was a regular member of the Aksumite royal house who shrewdly seized the throne.{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|pp=16–17}} The latter is more in line with another legend that claims [[Dil Na'od]], the last king of Aksum, kept his daughter Mesobe Werq in isolation out of fear of a prophecy that her son would overthrow him, yet she eloped with the nobleman [[Mara Takla Haymanot]] from [[Lasta]] who eventually killed the Aksumite king in a duel, took the throne and founded the [[Zagwe dynasty]].{{sfnp|Augustyniak|2012|p=17}} The latter remains one of the most poorly understood periods of Ethiopia's recorded history.{{sfnp|Riches|2015|p=44}} What is known is that the early Zagwe kings were polytheistic, eventually converted to Christianity, and ruled over the northern [[Highlands of Ethiopia]], while Islamic sultanates inhabited the [[Geography of Ethiopia|coastal Ethiopian Lowlands]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=17}}

===Solomonic dynasty===
[[File:Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.png|thumb|upright|alt=Detail from Ethiopian icon, IESMus3450, showing Negus Lalibela.|A 15th-century [[Ethiopian art|Ethiopian painting]] of the [[Solomonic dynasty]] depicting the [[Zagwe dynasty]] ruler [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]] (r. 1181-1221), the subject of a [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] pseudo-[[chronicle]] depicting him as a [[saint]] who performed [[miracle]]s{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=18–19}}]]
When the forces of [[Yekuno Amlak]] (r. 1270–1285) toppled the Zagwe dynasty in 1270 he became the first [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], establishing a line of rulers in the [[Solomonic dynasty]] that would last into the 20th century.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=17}} By this time the [[Greek language]], once pivotal for translation in [[Ethiopian literature]], had become marginalized and mixed with [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Arabic]] translations.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=16–17}} This contributed to a process by which medieval Ethiopian historians created a new historiographic tradition largely divorced from the ancient Aksumite textual corpus.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=16–17}} The Solomonic kings professed a direct link to the kings of Aksum and [[Menelik I|a lineage traced back]] to [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=17–18}}{{sfnp|Phillipson|2014|pp=66–67}} These genealogical traditions formed the basis of the ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'', a seminal work of Ethiopian literature and Ge'ez-language text originally compiled in Copto-Arabic sometime between the 10th and 13th centuries.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=17–18}}{{sfnp|Phillipson|2014|pp=66–67}} Its current form dates to the 14th century, by which point it included detailed mythological and historical narratives relating to Ethiopia along with [[Christian theology|theological discourses]] on themes in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]].{{sfnp|Phillipson|2014|p=66}} De Lorenzi compares the tome's mixture of [[Christian mythology]] with historical events to the legend of [[King Arthur]] that was greatly embellished by the Welsh cleric [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' of 1136.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=18}} Although the ''Kebra Nagast'' indicates that [[List of Byzantine emperors|the emperors]] of [[Rome]] or [[Constantinople]] and Ethiopia were descended from the [[Israelite]] king Solomon, there is an emphatically [[anti-Jewish]] sentiment expressed in several passages of the book.{{sfnp|Phillipson|2014|p=66}}

The most common form of written history sponsored by the Solomonic royal court was the [[biography]] of contemporary rulers, who were often lauded by their biographers along with the Solomonic dynasty. The royal biographical genre was established during the reign of [[Amda Seyon I]] (r. 1314–1344), whose biography not only recounted the diplomatic exchanges and military conflicts with the rival Islamic powers of the [[Ifat Sultanate]] and [[Adal Sultanate]], but also depicted the Ethiopian ruler as the [[Messiah|Christian savior]] of his nation.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=18}} The origins of the dynastic history (''tarika nagast'') are perhaps found in the biographical [[chronicle]] of [[Baeda Maryam I]] (r. 1468–1478), which provides a narrative of his life and that of his children and was most likely written by the [[preceptor]] of the royal court.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=18}} Teshale Tibebu asserts that Ethiopian court historians were "professional flatterers" of their ruling monarchs, akin to their [[Byzantine literature#Historians and annalists|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Imperial China|Imperial]] [[Chinese historiography|Chinese counterparts]].{{sfnp|Tibebu|1995|p=13}} For instance, the anonymously written biography of the emperor [[Gelawdewos]] (r. 1540–1549) speaks glowingly of the ruler, albeit in an [[elegiac]] tone, while attempting to place him and his deeds within a greater moral and historical context.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=13}}

There are also [[hagiographies]] of previous Zagwe dynastic rulers composed during the Solomonic period. For instance, during the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]] (1434–1468) a chronicle focusing on [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]] (r. 1185–1225) portrayed him as a [[Christian saint]] who performed miracles. Conveniently for the legitimacy of the Solomonic dynasty, the chronicle stated that Lalibela did not desire for his heirs to inherit his throne.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=18–19}}

===Medieval Europe and the search for Prester John===

In [[Greek historiography]], [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BC) had written brief descriptions of [[Aethiopia|ancient Ethiopians]], who were also mentioned in the New Testament.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|p=19}} Although the [[History of the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]] maintained [[Byzantine diplomacy|regular relations]] with Ethiopia during the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Early Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century severed the connection between Ethiopia and the rest of [[Christendom]].{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|pp=19–21}} Records of these contacts encouraged medieval Europeans to discover if Ethiopia was still Christian or had [[Islamization|converted to Islam]], an idea bolstered by the presence of Ethiopian [[pilgrim]]s in the [[Holy Land]] and [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Crusades]].{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|p=20}} During the [[High Middle Ages]], the [[Mongol conquests]] of [[Genghis Khan]] (r. 1206–1227) led Europeans to speculate about the existence of a priestly, legendary warrior king named [[Prester John]], who was thought to inhabit distant lands in Asia associated with [[Nestorian Christians]] and might help to defeat rival Islamic powers. The [[travel literature]] of [[Marco Polo]] and [[Odoric of Pordenone]] regarding [[Europeans in Medieval China|their separate journeys]] to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|China]] during the 13th and 14th centuries, respectively, and fruitless searches in [[southern India]], helped to dispel the notion that Prester John's kingdom existed in Asia.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|pp=16–19}} An Ethiopian diplomatic mission sent to Christian Europe by Ethiopian emperor [[Wedem Arad]] (r. 1299–1314) in 1306 allowed the chance for the priest and [[cartographer]] [[Giovanni da Carignano]] (1250–1329) to question the embassy as they stayed in [[Genoa]], after which he published a work describing the geographic location of their kingdom and the nature of their Christian faith.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|p=22}}

In his 1324 ''Book of Marvels'' the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] missionary [[Jordanus]], bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon]] along the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, was the first known author to suggest that Ethiopia was the location of Prester John's kingdom.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|pp=20–21}} The [[Florence|Florentine]] merchant Antonio Bartoli visited Ethiopia from the 1390s until about 1404 when he returned to Europe with Ethiopian diplomats.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|p=22}} This was followed by the lengthy stay of Pietro Rombuldo in Ethiopia from 1404 to 1444 and Ethiopian diplomats attending the [[Ecumenical council|ecumenical]] [[Council of Florence]] in 1441, where they expressed some vexation with the European attendees who insisted on addressing their emperor as Prester John.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|pp=22–23}} Thanks to the legacy of European medieval historiography, this belief persisted beyond the [[Late Middle Ages]]. For instance, the [[History of Portugal|Portuguese]] missionary [[Francisco Álvares]] set out for Ethiopia in 1520 believing that he was to visit the homeland of Prester John.{{sfnp|Baldridge|2012|p=23}}

Islamic sources state that in 615 the Aksumite king [[Armah]] (r. 614–631) provided refuge for the exiled followers of [[Muhammad]] in Axum, an event known as the [[First Hejira]] (i.e. [[Migration to Abyssinia]]).{{sfnp|Milkias|2015|p=456}} In his ''History'', the scholar [[Ya'qubi|ibn Wadîh al-Ya'qûbî]] (d. 897) of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] identified Abyssinia (''al-Habasha'') as being located to the north of the territory of the [[Barbara (region)|Berber]] (Somali) as well as the land of the [[Zanj]] (the "Blacks").{{sfnp|Smidt|2001|p=6}} The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk-Egyptian]] historian [[Shihab al-Umari]] (1300–1349) wrote that the historical [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|state of Bale]], neighboring the [[Hadiya Sultanate]] of southern Ethiopia, was part of an Islamic [[Zeila]] confederacy, although it fell under the control of the Ethiopian Empire in the 1330s, during the reign of Amda Seyon I.{{sfnp|Braukämper|2004|pp=76–77}} [[Al-Maqrizi]] (1364–1422), another Mamluk-Egyptian historian, wrote that the Ifat sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]] (r. 1387–1415) won a crushing victory against the Christian [[Amhara Province|Amhara]] in Bale, despite the latter's numerical superiority.{{sfnp|Braukämper|2004|p=77}} He described other allegedly significant victories won by the Adal sultan [[Jamal ad-Din II]] (d. 1433) in Bale [[Sultanate of Dawaro|and Dawaro]], where the Muslim leader was said to have taken enough war booty to provide his poorer subjects with multiple slaves.{{sfnp|Braukämper|2004|p=77}} Historian [[Ulrich Braukämper]] states that these works of Islamic historiography, while demonstrating the influence and military presence of the Adal sultanate in southern Ethiopia, tend to overemphasize the importance of military victories that at best led to temporary territorial control in regions such as Bale.{{sfnp|Braukämper|2004|pp=77–78}} In his ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Description of Africa]]'' (1555), the historian [[Leo Africanus]] (c. 1494–1554) of [[Al-Andalus]] described Abassia (Abyssinia) as the realm of the ''Prete Ianni'' (i.e. Prester John), unto whom the Abassins (Abyssinians) were subject. He also identified Abassins as one of five main population groups on the continent alongside [[Africa (Roman province)|Africans]] ([[Moors]]), [[Egyptians]], [[Arabs|Arabians]] and [[Kaffir (racial term)|Cafri]] (Cafates).{{sfnp|Africanus|1896|pp=20, 30}}

===Chinese historiography===
{{further|Chinese historiography|Twenty-Four Histories}}
Contacts between the Ethiopian Empire and [[Imperial China]] seem to have been very limited, if not mostly indirect. There were some attempts in Chinese historiographic and [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedic literature]] to describe parts of Ethiopia or outside areas that it once controlled. Zhang Xiang, a scholar of [[Africa–China relations]], asserts that the country of ''Dou le'' described in the ''Xiyu juan'' (i.e. [[Western Regions]]) chapter of the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' was that of the Aksumite port city of Adulis.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2015 New African"/&gt; It was from this city that an envoy was sent to [[Luoyang]], the capital of China's [[Han dynasty]], in roughly 100 AD.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2015 New African"&gt;Abraham, Curtis. (11 March 2015). "[http://newafricanmagazine.com/chinas-long-history-africa/ China’s long history in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802172711/http://newafricanmagazine.com/chinas-long-history-africa/ |date=2017-08-02 }}". ''[[New African]]''. Retrieved 2 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th-century ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' and 14th-century ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'' describe the country of Nubia (previously controlled by the Aksumite Kingdom) as a land of deserts [[Diocese of Egypt|south of the Byzantine Empire]] that was infested with [[malaria]], where the natives of the local ''Mo-lin'' territory had [[dark skin|black skin]] and consumed foods such as [[Palm date|Persian dates]].&lt;ref name="hirth 2000"/&gt; In his English translation of this document, [[Friedrich Hirth]] identified ''Mo-lin'' (''Molin'') with the kingdom of [[Alodia|'Alwa]] and neighboring ''Lao-p'o-sa'' with the kingdom of [[Makuria|Maqurra]], both in Nubia.&lt;ref name="hirth 2000"&gt;{{cite web|orig-year=1885|year=2000|author=Friedrich Hirth|editor=Jerome S.

The ''Wenxian Tongkao'' describes the [[Islamization of the Sudan region|main religions of Nubia]], including the ''[[Da Qin]]'' religion (i.e. Christianity, particularly [[Church of the East in China|Nestorian Christianity]] associated with [[History of Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|the Eastern Roman Empire]]) and the [[Sabbath|day of rest]] occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the ''Da shi'' (i.e. the [[Islam in Sudan|Muslim Arabs]]).&lt;ref name="hirth 2000"/&gt; These passages are ultimately derived from the ''[[Jingxingji]]'' of [[Du Huan]] (fl. 8th century),{{sfnp|Bai|2003|pp=242–247}} a travel writer during the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) who was captured by [[Sino-Arab relations|Abbasid forces]] in the 751 [[Battle of Talas]], after which he visited parts of [[West Asia]] and [[northeast Africa]].&lt;ref name="Abraham 2015 New African"/&gt; Historian [[Wolbert Smidt]] identified the territory of ''Molin'' in Du's ''Jingxingji'' (preserved in part by the ''[[Tongdian]]'' of [[Du You]]) as the Christian kingdom of Muqurra in Nubia. He also associated the territory of ''Laobosa'' (''Lao-p'o-sa'') depicted therein with Abyssinia, thereby making this the first Chinese text to describe Ethiopia.{{sfnp|Smidt|2001|pp=5–6}}&lt;ref name="Abraham 2015 New African"/&gt; When Du Huan left the region to return home, he did so through the Aksumite port of Adulis.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2015 New African"/&gt; Trade activity between Ethiopia and China during the latter's [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) seems to be confirmed by [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Song-Chinese coinage]] found in the medieval village of Harla, near [[Dire Dawa]], Ethiopia. The Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) sent diplomats to Ethiopia, which was also frequented by [[Indian Ocean trade|Chinese merchants]]. Although only private and indirect trade was conducted with African countries during the early [[Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), the Chinese were able to refer to Chinese-written travel literature and histories about East Africa before diplomatic relations were restored with African countries in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2015 New African"/&gt;

===Conflict and interaction with foreign powers===
During the 16th century the Ethiopian biographical tradition became far more complex, [[Intertextuality|intertextual]], and broader in its view of the world given Ethiopia's direct involvement in [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts|the conflicts]] between the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires in the Red Sea region.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=19–20}} The annals of [[Dawit II]] (r. 1508–1540) describe [[Abyssinian–Adal war|the defensive war]] he waged against the Adal sultan [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (r. 1527–1543), in an [[Serial (literature)|episodic format]] quite different from the earlier chronicling tradition.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=19}} The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] abbot [[Enbaqom]] (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous Ethiopian work of history.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=19}} It explains the Ethiopian emperor's [[military alliance]] with [[Cristóvão da Gama]] (1516–1542), son of the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Vasco da Gama]], against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the [[Pasha|Ottoman governor]] of [[History of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Özdemir Pasha]] (d. 1560).{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=19–20}}

The biography of Galawdewos' brother and successor [[Menas of Ethiopia]] (r. 1559–1563) is divided into two parts, one dedicated to his life before taking the throne and the other to his troubled reign fighting against rebels.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=20}} His chronicle was completed by the biographers of his successor [[Sarsa Dengel]] (r. 1563–1597). The latter's chronicle can be considered an [[epic cycle]] for its [[preface]] describing events in previous eras mixed with biblical allusions.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=20}} It also describes conflicts against rebel nobility allied with the Ottomans as well as a military campaign against [[Ethiopian Jews]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=20}}

By the 16th century Ethiopian works began to discuss the profound impact of foreign peoples in their own regional history. The chronicle of Gelawdewos explained the friction between the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionaries]] from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], after the arrival of the [[Jesuits]] in 1555.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=20}} With the persuasion of Jesuits in his realm, emperor [[Susenyos I]] (r. 1607–1632) became the only Ethiopian ruler to [[List of converts to the Catholic Church|convert from Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism]], perhaps earlier than the accepted date of 1625, after which his attempts to convert his subjects and undermine the Orthodox church led to internal revolts.{{sfnp|Abir|1980|pp=211–217}} In 1593 the Ethiopian [[monk]], [[historian]], and [[ethnographer]] [[Bahrey]] published a work of [[ethnography]] that provided reasoning for the military success of the [[Traditional African religions|polytheistic]] [[Oromo people]] who fought against the Ethiopian Empire.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=20}} Ethiopian histories of this period also included details of foreign [[Muslim]]s, [[History of Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]] (including those from [[Western Europe]]), [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], and even figures of the fallen [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=20}}
[[File:Ethiopian scribes.jpg|thumb|left|Early 18th century manuscript illumination from Aksum showing two scribes.]]

[[Pedro Paez]] (1564–1622), a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] Jesuit at the court of Susenyos I, translated portions of the chronicles of Ethiopian emperors stretching back to the reign of Amda Seyon I in the 14th century AD, as well as the reign of king [[Kaleb of Axum]] in the 6th century AD.{{sfnp|Cohen|2009|pp=106–107}} Some of these fragments were preserved in the ''Historia de Ethiopia'' by the Portuguese Jesuit [[Manuel de Almeida]] (1580–1646),{{sfnp|Cohen|2009|p=106}} but Paez's original manuscript was largely rewritten to remove polemical passages against the rival [[Dominican Order]].{{sfnp|Pennec|2012|pp=83–86, 91–92}} Paez also translated a chapter from an Ethiopian hagiography that covered the life and works of the 13th-century ruler Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.{{sfnp|Cohen|2009|pp=107–108}} The ''Historia de Ethiopia'', which arrived in [[Goa]], India, by the end of 1624, was not published in Europe until the modern era and only remained in circulation among members of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Portuguese India]], although Almeida's map of Ethiopia was published by [[Baltasar Teles]] in 1660.{{sfnp|Pennec|2012|pp=87–90, 92–93}} In his treatise ''A Voyage to Abyssinia'', the Portuguese Jesuit missionary [[Jerónimo Lobo]] (1595–1678) described Abyssinia and its denizens, indicating that the native inhabitants were of two distinct physical types: the Abyssinians proper, who were narrow-featured, near olive-skinned, and had long hair which they wore in various styles, and the Soudans, who were [[platyrrhine]] (i.e. flat-nosed), black-skinned, and had woolly hair.{{sfnp|Le Grand|1789|p=198}} Following the [[abdication]] of Susenyos I, his son and successor [[Fasilides]] (r. 1632–1667) had the Jesuits expelled from Ethiopia.{{sfnp|Milkias|2015|p=456}}

===Biographical chronicles and dynastic histories===
At least as far back as the reign of Susenyos I the Ethiopian royal court employed an official court historian known as a ''[[sahafe te'ezaz]]'', who was usually also a senior scholar within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=20–21}} Susenyos I had his [[confessor]] Meherka Dengel and counselor Takla Sellase (d. 1638), nicknamed "Tino", compose his biography.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=22}} Biographies were written for the emperors [[Yohannes I]] (r. 1667–1682), [[Iyasu I]] (1682–1706), and [[Bakaffa]] (r. 1721–1730), the latter employing four separate court historians: Sinoda, Demetros, Arse, and Hawaryat Krestos.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=22}} The reigns of the emperors [[Iyasu II]] (r. 1730–1755) and [[Iyoas I]] (r. 1755–1769) were included in general dynastic histories, while the last known royal biography in chronicle format prior to the 19th century was written by the church scholar Gabru and covered the first reign of [[Tekle Giyorgis I]] (r. 1779–1784), the text ending abruptly just before his [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=22}}

The chaotic period known as the [[Age of the Princes|Era of the Princes]] (Ethiopian: ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'') from the mid-18th to mid-19th centuries witnessed political fragmentation, civil war, loss of central authority, and, as a result of these, a complete shift away from the royal biography in favor of dynastic histories.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=22}} A new genre of dynastic history, known as the "Short Chronicle" according to Lorenzi, was established by a church scholar named [[Takla Haymanot (historian)|Takla Haymanot]], whose work combined [[universal history]] with Solomonic dynastic history.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=22}} The "Short Chronicle" genre of historiography continued well into the 20th century.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=22}} Ge'ez became an [[extinct language]] by the 17th century, but it wasn't until the reign of [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855–1868) that royal chronicles were [[Vernacular literature|written in the vernacular]] [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Semitic language of Amharic]].{{sfnp|Milkias|2015|p=474}}

Another genre of history writing produced during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian [[annal]] known as ''ya'alam tarik''.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=23}} These works attempted to list major world events from the time of [[Book of Genesis|the biblical Genesis]] until their present time in a universal history.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=23}} For instance, the translated work of [[John of Nikiû]] explaining human history until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=23}} There are also chronological and [[genealogical]] [[List of Emperors of Ethiopia|lists of rulers]] and [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Orthodox Church patriarchs]] that include some elements of historical narrative.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=23}}

===Biographical literature===
Various biographies of Ethiopian emperors have been compiled in the modern era. In 1975 the [[Oxford University|Oxford-educated]] historian [[Zewde Gebre-Sellassie]] (1926–2008) published a biography on the Emperor [[Yohannes II]] (r. 1699–1769), with whom he was distantly related.{{sfnp|Bekerie|2013|p=180}} In 1973 and 1974, the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] (r. 1930–1974) published his autobiography ''[[My Life and Ethiopia's Progress]]''; in 1976 it was translated from [[Amharic]] into English and [[Annotation|annotated]] by [[Edward Ullendorff]] in an [[Oxford University Press]] publication.{{sfnp|Strang|2013|p=349}} Hanna Rubinkowska maintains that Emperor Selassie was an active proponent of "historiographic manipulation", especially when it came to concealing historical materials that seemingly contested or contradicted dynastic propaganda and [[official history]].{{sfnp|Rubinkowska|2004|pp=223–224}} For instance, he removed certain chronicles and historical works from the public eye and placed them in his private library, such as ''[[aleqa]]'' [[Gabra Igziabiher Elyas]]' (1892–1969) biographical chronicle covering the reigns of Selassie's predecessors [[Iyasu V]] (r. 1913–1916), a late [[Conversion to Islam|convert to Islam]], and the Empress [[Zewditu]] (r. 1916–1930).{{sfnp|Rubinkowska|2004|p=223}}{{sfnp|Omer|1994|p=97}} The latter work was edited, translated into English and republished by [[Rudolf K.

Edward Ullendorff considered the German [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Hiob Ludolf]] (1624–1704) to be the founder of [[Ethiopian studies]] in Europe, thanks to his efforts in documenting the [[history of Ethiopia]] and the Ge'ez language, as well as Amharic.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|p=1}}{{sfnp|Budge|2014|pp=183–184}} The Ethiopian monk [[Abba Gorgoryos]] (1595–1658), while lobbying the ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' in Rome to become bishop of Ethiopia following his Catholic conversion and expulsion of the Jesuits by Ethiopian emperor [[Fasilides]], collaborated with Ludolf – who never actually visited Ethiopia – and provided him with critical information for composing his ''Historia Aethiopica'' and its ''Commentaries''.{{sfnp|Salvadore|2012|pp=493–494}}{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|pp=1–2}} The ethnically-Ethiopian Portuguese cleric [[António d'Andrade]] (1610–1670) aided them as a translator,{{sfnp|Salvadore|2012|p=493}} since Abba Gorgoryos was not a fluent speaker of either Latin or Italian.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|p=2}} After Ludolf, the 18th-century Scottish travel writer James Bruce, who visited Ethiopia, and German orientalist [[August Dillmann]] (1823–1894) are also considered pioneers in the field of early Ethiopian studies.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|pp=1–2}}{{sfnp|Budge|2014|pp=184–186}} After spending time at the Ethiopian royal court, Bruce was the first to systematically collect and deposit Ethiopian historical documents into libraries of Europe, in addition to composing a history of Ethiopia based on [[Primary source|native Ethiopian sources]].{{sfnp|Budge|2014|pp=184–185}} Dillmann cataloged a variety of Ethiopian manuscripts, including historical chronicles, and in 1865 published the ''Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae'', the first such [[lexicon]] to be published on [[languages of Ethiopia]] since Ludolf's work.{{sfnp|Budge|2014|p=186}}

Ethiopian historians such as [[Taddesse Tamrat]] (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie have argued that modern Ethiopian studies were an invention of the 17th century and originated in Europe.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|p=2}} Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 ''Storia d'Etiopia'' a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|p=2}} The philosopher [[Messay Kebede]] likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars to the understanding of Ethiopia's past.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|pp=2–4}}&lt;ref&gt;College of Arts and Sciences.

A. Wallis Budge]]'s translation of the ''Kebra Nagast'', arguing that Budge had assigned a [[South Arabia]]n origin to the Queen of Sheba although the ''Kebra Nagast'' itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|p=4}} Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin.{{sfnp|Kebede|2003|pp=5–7}}

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ethiopian [[vernacular]] historiography became more heavily influenced by [[Western literature|Western]] methods of historiography, but De Lorenzi contends that these were "[[Indigenization|indigenized]]" to suit the cultural sensibilities of traditionalist historians.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=57–59}} [[Gabra Heywat Baykadan]], a foreign-educated historian and reformist intellectual during the reign of [[Menelik II]] (r. 1889–1913),{{sfnp|Adejumobi|2007|p=59}} was unique among his peers for breaking almost entirely from the traditionalist approach to writing vernacular history and systematically adopting [[Comparative historical research|Western theoretical methods]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=58–59}} [[Heruy Wolde Selassie]] (1878-1938), ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Mekwanint|blattengeta]]'' and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ethiopia)|foreign minister of Ethiopia]], used [[English literature|English scholarship]] and nominally adopted modern Western methods in writing vernacular history, but he was a firmly traditionalist historian.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=57–59}} His innovative works include a 1922 historical [[dictionary]] that offered a [[prosopography|prosopographic]] study of Ethiopia's historical figures and contemporary notables, a history of Ethiopian foreign relations, historiographic travel literature, and a traditionalist historical treatise combining narrative histories for the Zagwe and Solomonic dynasties with other parts on church history and biographies of church leaders.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=58}}

[[Takla Sadeq Makuriya]] (1913–2000), historian and former head of the [[National Archives and Library of Ethiopia]], wrote various works in Amharic as well as foreign languages, including a four-volume Amharic-language series on the history of Ethiopia from ancient times until the reign of Selassie, published in the 1950s.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=120}} During the 1980s he published a three-volume tome exploring the reigns of 19th-century Ethiopian rulers and the theme of [[Ethiopian nationalism|national unity]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=120}} He also produced two English chapters on the history of the Horn of Africa for [[UNESCO]]'s ''[[General History of Africa]]'' and several French-language works on Ethiopia's church history and royal genealogies.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=120–121}} Some volumes from his [[Vernacular culture|vernacular]] survey on general Ethiopian history have been edited and circulated as school [[textbook]]s in Ethiopian classrooms by the [[Education in Ethiopia|Ministry of Education]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=121}} [[Kebede Michael]] (1916–1998), a playwright, historian, editor, and [[Archaeology of Ethiopia|director of archaeology]] at the National Library, wrote works of [[world history]], histories of [[Western civilization]], and histories of Ethiopia, which, unlike his previous works, formed the central focus of his 1955 world history written in Amharic.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=114–116}}

The decisive victory of the Ethiopian Empire over the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]], during the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]], made a profound impact on the historiography of Italy and Ethiopia.{{sfnp|Forclaz|2015|p=156, note #94}} It was not lost to the [[collective memory]] of Italians, since the Italian capture of [[Adwa]], [[Tigray Region]], Ethiopia in 1935, during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], was hailed as an act that avenged their previous humiliation and defeat.{{sfnp|Forclaz|2015|p=156}} Historiography about Ethiopia throughout much of the 20th century focused primarily on this second invasion and the [[Abyssinian Crisis]] that preceded it, in which Ethiopia was depicted as being relegated to the role of a pawn in European diplomacy.{{sfnp|Crummey|2000|p=319, note #35}} The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|courtier (i.e. ''blatta'')]] and historian [[Marse Hazan Walda Qirqo]]s (1899–1978) was commissioned by the Selassie regime to compile a documentary history of the [[Italian Ethiopia|Italian occupation]] entitled ''A Short History of the Five Years of Hardship'', composed concurrently with the submission of historical evidence to the [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]] for [[Yekatit 12|Fascist Italy's war crimes]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=46, 119–120}} Coauthored by [[Berhanu Denque]], this work was one of the first vernacular Amharic histories to cover the Italian colonial period, documenting contemporary newspaper articles and propaganda pieces, events such as the 1936 [[March of the Iron Will|fall of Addis Ababa]] and the 1941 [[East African Campaign (World War II)|British-Ethiopian reconquest of the country]], and speeches by key figures such as Emperor Selassie and [[Rodolfo Graziani]] (1882–1955), [[Viceroy of Italian East Africa|Viceroy]] of [[Italian East Africa]].{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|p=119}}

Modern historians have taken new approaches to analyzing both traditional and modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, [[Donald Crummey]] (1941–2013)&lt;ref&gt;Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Illinois. &lt;br&gt;[[African Studies Association]]. (17 November 2014). "[https://africanstudies.org/individual-membership/in-memory/donald-crummey-1941-2013/ Donald Crummey (1941–2013)]." Retrieved 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender.{{sfnp|Jalata|1996|p=101}} He also criticized earlier approaches made by [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] (1882–1960) and [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works.{{sfnp|Jalata|1996|p=101}} Following the 1974 [[Ethiopian Revolution]] and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the [[historical materialism]] of [[Marxist historiography]] came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of [[Northeast Africa]]n history.{{sfnp|De Lorenzi|2015|pp=11–12, 121–122}} In her 2001 article ''Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review'', [[Belete Bizuneh]] remarks that the impact of [[social history]] on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of [[Women's studies|women]] and [[Gender studies|gender]] in historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.{{sfnp|Bizuneh|2001|pp=7–8}}

By relying on the written works of both Christian and Muslim authors, oral traditions, and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, [[Mohammed Hassen]], Associate Professor of History at Georgia State University,&lt;ref&gt;College of Arts and Sciences (faculty page). "[http://history.gsu.edu/profile/mohammed-hassen-ali/ Mohammed Hassen Ali: Associate Professor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804012737/http://history.gsu.edu/profile/mohammed-hassen-ali/ |date=2017-08-04 }}". [[Georgia State University]]. Retrieved 25 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the largely non-Christian [[Oromo language|Oromo people]] have interacted and lived among the [[Semitic languages|Semitic-speaking]] Christian [[Amhara people]] since at least the 14th century, not the 16th century as is commonly accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography.{{sfnp|Hassen|2015|pp=ix–xii}} His work also stresses Ethiopia's need to properly integrate its [[List of ethnic groups in Ethiopia|Oromo population]] and the fact that the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic-speaking]] Oromo, despite their traditional reputation as invaders, were significantly involved in maintaining the cultural, political, and military institutions of the Christian state.{{sfnp|Hassen|2015|pp=x–xi}}

===Middle Eastern versus African studies===

[[File:Salama III.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Image of the Abuna Salama, died 25 October 1867.|Engraving of [[Abuna Salama III|Salama III]], head of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (1841-1867). This ''[[abuna]]'' (''abun'') ecclesiastical office was established to strengthen Ethiopia's historical ties with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] in Egypt.]]
In his 1992 review of [[Naguib Mahfouz]]'s ''The Search'' (1964), the Ethiopian scholar Mulugeta Gudeta observed that Ethiopian and [[History of Egypt|Egyptian societies]] bore striking historical resemblances.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|pp=215–216, 225 note #18}} According to [[Haggai Erlich]], these parallels culminated in the establishment of the Egyptian ''[[Abuna|abun]]'' ecclesiastical office, which exemplified Ethiopia's traditional connection to [[Christianity in Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Christianity in the Middle East|the Middle East]].{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=11}} In the earlier part of the 20th century, Egyptian nationalists also propounded the idea of forming a ''Unity of the Nile Valley'', a territorial union that would include Ethiopia. This objective gradually ebbed due to political tension over control of the [[Nile]] waters.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|pp=5 &amp; 85}} Consequently, after the 1950s, Egyptian scholars adopted a more distant if not apathetic approach to Ethiopian affairs and academic studies.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}} For instance, the Fifth Nile 2002 Conference held in [[Addis Ababa]] in 1997 was attended by hundreds of scholars and officials, among whom were 163 Ethiopians and 16 Egyptians.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=11}} By contrast, there were no Egyptian attendees at the Fourteenth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies later held in Addis Ababa in 2000, similar to all previous ICES conferences since the 1960s.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}}

Erlich argues that, in deference to their training as [[African studies|Africanists]], native and foreign Ethiopianists of the post-1950 generation focused more on historiographic matters pertaining to Ethiopia's place within the African continent.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}} This trend had the effect of marginalizing Ethiopia's traditional bonds with the Middle East in historiographic works.{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=216}} In [[Bahru Zewde]]'s retrospective on Ethiopian historiography published in 2000, he highlighted Ethiopia's ancient tradition of historiography, observing that it dates from at least the fourteenth century and distinguishes the territory from most other areas in Africa.{{sfnp|Zewde|2000|p=5}} He also noted a shift in emphasis in Ethiopian studies away from the field's traditional fixation on Ethiopia's northern Semitic-speaking groups, with an increasing focus on the territory's other [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking communities. Zewde suggested that this development was made possible by a greater critical usage of oral traditions.{{sfnp|Zewde|2000|p=10}} He offered no survey of Ethiopia's role in [[Middle Eastern studies]] and made no mention of [[Egypt–Ethiopia relations|Egyptian-Ethiopian historical relations]].{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=225, note #19}} Zewde also observed that historiographic studies in Africa were centered on methods and schools that were primarily developed in [[Nigeria]] and [[Tanzania]], and concluded that "the integration of Ethiopian historiography into the African mainstream, a perennial concern, is still far from being achieved to a satisfactory degree."{{sfnp|Erlich|2002|p=225, note #19}}

'''Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann''' (13 May 1785, [[Wismar]]{{snd}}5 December 1860, [[Bonn]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]] and [[politician]].

== Biography ==
He came of an old [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] family of Wismar, then controlled by [[Sweden]].  His father, who was [[burgomaster]] of the town, intended him to study theology, but Friedrich preferred classical [[philology]], which he studied from 1802 to 1806 at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[University of Halle]], and then again at Copenhagen. After finishing his studies, he translated some of the Greek tragic poets, and [[The Clouds]] of Aristophanes. But he was also interested in modern literature and philosophy; and the troubles of the times, of which he had personal experience, aroused in him a strong feeling of German patriotism, though throughout his life he was always proud of his connection with Scandinavia, and [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] was his particular hero.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1809, on the outbreak of war in Austria, Dahlmann, together with the poet [[Heinrich von Kleist]], whom he had met in [[Dresden]], went to [[Bohemia]], and was afterwards with the Imperial army, up till the [[Battle of Aspern]], with the somewhat vague object of trying to convert the [[Austria]]n war into a German one. This hope was shattered by the [[battle of Wagram|defeat of Wagram]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He now decided to try his fortunes in [[Denmark]], where he had influential relations. After taking his doctor's degree at [[university of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] (1810) he qualified at Copenhagen in 1811, with an essay on the origins of the ancient theatre, as a lecturer on ancient literature and history, on which he delivered lectures in [[Latin]]. His influential friends soon brought him further advancement. As early as 1812 he was summoned to [[university of Kiel|Kiel]], as successor to the historian [[Dietrich Hermann Hegewisch]] (1746–1812). This appointment proved in two respects a decisive moment in his career; on the one hand it made him give his whole attention to a subject for which he was admirably suited, but to which he had so far given only a secondary interest; and on the other hand, it threw him into politics.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1815 he obtained, in addition to his professorate, the position of secretary to the perpetual deputation of the estates of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. In this capacity he began, by means of memoirs or of articles in the Kieler Bldlter, which he founded himself, to appear as an able and zealous champion of the half-forgotten rights of the [[Elbe]] duchies, as against Denmark, and of their close connexion with Germany. It was he upon whom the Danes afterwards threw the blame of having invented the Schleswig-Holstein question; certainly his activities form an important link in the chain of events which eventually led to the solution of 1864. So far as this interest affected himself, the chief profit lay in the fact that it deepened his conception of the state, and directed it to more practical ends. Whereas at that time mere speculation dominated both. the French [[Liberalism]] of the school of Rotteck, and [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s [[romanticism|Romanticist]] doctrine of the Christian state, Dahlmann took as his premises the circumstances as he found them, and evolved the new out of the old by a quiet process of development. Moreover, in the inevitable conflict with the Danish crown his upright point of view and his German patriotism were further confirmed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After transferring to [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]] around 1829 he had the opportunity of working in the same spirit. As confidant of the duke of Cambridge, he was allowed to take a share in framing the Hanoverian constitution of 1833, which remodelled the old aristocratic government in a direction which had become inevitable since the July revolution in [[Paris]]; and when in 1837 the new king [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernst August]] declared the constitution invalid, Dahlmann inspired the famous protest of the [[Göttingen Seven|seven professors of Göttingen]]. Though deprived of his position and banished, he had the satisfaction of knowing that German national feeling received a boost from his courageous action, while public subscriptions saved him from poverty.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After several years in [[Leipzig]] and [[Jena]], [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|King Frederick William IV of Prussia]] appointed him in October 1842 to a professorship at the [[University of Bonn]]. The years that followed were those of his greatest fame. His ''Politik'' (1835) had already made him a name as a writer; he now published his ''Dänische Geschichte'' (1840–1843), a historical work of the first rank; and this was soon followed by histories of the [[English Revolution|English]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions, which, though of less scientific value, exercised a decisive influence upon public opinion by their open advocacy of the system of constitutional monarchy. As a teacher too he was much beloved. Though no orator, and in spite of a personality not particularly amiable or winning, he produced a profound impression upon young men by the pregnancy of his expression, a consistent logical method of thought based on [[Immanuel Kant]] and by the manliness of his character.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

When the revolution of 1848 broke out, the "father of German nationality," as the provisional government at [[Milan]] called him, found himself the centre of universal interest. Both [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Prussia]] offered him in vain the post of envoy to the diet of the confederation. Naturally, too, he was elected to the national assembly at [[Frankfurt]], and took a leading part in the constitutional committees appointed first by the diet, then by the parliament. His objective was to make Germany as far as possible a united constitutional monarchy, with the exclusion of the whole of [[Austria]], or at least, of its non-German parts. Prussia was to provide the emperor, but at the same time—and in this lay the doctrinaire weakness of the system—was to give up its separate existence, consecrated by history, in the same way as the other states. When, therefore, Frederick William IV, without showing any anxiety to bind himself by the conditions laid down at Frankfurt, concluded with Denmark the seven months truce of Malmö (26 August 1848), Dahlmann proposed that the national parliament should refuse to recognize the truce, with the express intention of clearing up once for all the relations of the parliament with the court of Berlin. The motion was passed by a small majority (September 5); but the members of Dahlmann's party were just those who voted against it, and it was they who on September 18 reversed the previous vote and passed a resolution accepting the truce, after Dahlmann had failed to form a ministry on the basis of the resolution of the 5th, owing to his objection to the Radicals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Dahlmann afterwards described this as the decisive turning-point in the fate of the parliament. He did not immediately give up hope. Though he took little active part in parliamentary debates, he was very active on commissions and in party conferences, and it was largely owing to him that a German constitution was at last evolved, and that Frederick William IV was elected hereditary emperor (28 March 1849). He was accordingly one of the deputation which offered the crown to the king in [[Berlin]]. The king's refusal came as less of a surprise to him than to most of his colleagues. He counted on being able to compel recognition of the constitution by the moral pressure of the consent of the people. It was only when the attitude of the Radicals made it clear to him that this course would lead to a revolution, that he decided, after a long struggle, to retire from the national parliament (21 May).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He remained one of the chief promoters of the well-known conference of the imperial party at [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], the proceedings of which were not, however, satisfactory to him; and he took part in the sessions of the first Prussian chamber (1849–1850) and of the parliament of [[Erfurt]] (1850). But finally, convinced that for the moment all efforts towards the unity of Germany were unavailing, he retired from political life, though often pressed to stand for election, and again took up his work of teaching at Bonn. His last years were, however, saddened by illness, bereavement and continual friction with his colleagues. His death followed an apoplectic fit.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The golden age is noted for its innovation – a time "when it seemed that every new single reinvented the genre,"&lt;ref name="rollingstone1995" /&gt; according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

and [[MTV]]'s [[Sway Calloway]] added: "The thing that made that era so great is that nothing was contrived.

Hip hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the [[drum machine]] was augmented with the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beaumont-Thomas|first1=Ben|title=The Roland TR-808: the drum machine that revolutionised music|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/06/roland-tr-808-drum-machine-revolutionised-music|website=The Guardian|accessdate=June 20, 2017|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rakim]] took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and [[Chuck D]] pushed "message rap" towards black activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forman|first1=Murray|title=The 'Hood Comes First: Race, Space, and Place in Rap and Hip-Hop|date=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-6397-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zDluqhv-QcC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=chuck+d+%22message+rap%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wLeBj8RLqG&amp;sig=RMVuDtCds9QjKVEYzCoFvQtVQs8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJt-PS8cvUAhUBGz4KHeddBDMQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=chuck%20d%20%22message%20rap%22&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Native Tongues]] artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, [[Afrocentricity]] and playful energy. With the eventual commercial dominance of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[gangsta rap]], particularly the emergence of the relaxed sounds of [[G-funk]] by the early nineties, the [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] new school/golden age can be said to have ended, with hardcore rappers such as the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and gangsta rappers such as [[Nas]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] coming to dominate the East Coast scene.

During the golden age of hip hop, samples were heavily used.&lt;ref name="today"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=By Tony|title=Remembering the golden age of hip-hop|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/remembering-golden-age-hip-hop-wbna5430999|website=TODAY.com|accessdate=June 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to sample different beats, riffs and patterns from a wide variety of sources gave birth to a new breed of producers and DJs who did not necessarily need formal musical training or instruments, just a good ear for sound collages.&lt;ref name="soundcollage"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=Coreen|last2=Paris|first2=Anika|last3=Borg|first3=Bobby|last4=Corne|first4=Eric|last5=Eames|first5=Michael|title=Five Star Music Makeover: The Independent Artist's Guide for Singers, Songwriters, Bands, Producers, and Self-Publishers|date=2016|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781495063596|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VT-GDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT198&amp;lpg=PT198&amp;dq=hip+hop+sampling+sound+collages+formal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7t0caA9Uj7&amp;sig=vlpfAmYSSSaYNBAYM4g-RmfaXYc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl-MP48svUAhVLND4KHcFpCREQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=hip%20hop%20sampling%20sound%20collages%20formal&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These samples were derived from a number of genres, ranging from [[jazz]], [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] to [[rock and roll]]. For example, ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'', the [[Beastie Boys]]' second studio album, drew from over 200 individual samples, 24 of which were featured on the last track of the album.&lt;ref name="today"/&gt; Samples and sound bites were not limited to just music. [[RZA]] of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip hop collective formed in the 1990s, sampled sound clips from his own collection of 1970s kung-fu films to bolster and frame the group's [[hardcore hip hop|gritty lyrical content]]. Many of the sample-laden albums released during this time would not be able to receive legal clearance today.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Kembrew &amp; Kuenzli, Rudolf E. "Crashing the Spectacle: A Forgotten History of Digital Sampling, Infringement, Copyright Liberation and the End of Recorded Music.” Culture Machine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="creative" /&gt;

The era also provided some of the greatest advances in [[rapping]] technique. [[Kool G Rap]], referring to the golden age in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'' said, "that era bred rappers like a [[Big Daddy Kane]], a [[KRS-One]], a [[Rakim]], a [[Chuck D]]... their rapping capability and ability&amp;nbsp;– these dudes were phenomenal".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Dave Shewring, Chicago Review Press, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapradar.com/2009/12/03/how-to-rap-kool-g-rap-foreword/|title=How To Rap: Kool G Rap (Foreword) – Rap Radar|work=Rap Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of hip hop's biggest artists were also at their creative peak. [[Allmusic]] said the golden age "witnessed the best recordings from some of the biggest rappers in the genre's history... overwhelmingly based in [[East coast hip hop|New York City]], golden age rap is characterized by [[dub music|skeletal beats]], samples cribbed from [[hard rock]] or soul tracks, and tough dis raps... rhymers like [[Public Enemy (group)|PE]]'s [[Chuck D]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[KRS-One]], [[Rakim]], and [[LL Cool J]] basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop".&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/golden-age-ma0000012011|title=Golden Age &amp;#124; Significant Albums, Artists and Songs &amp;#124; AllMusic|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lyrical self-glorification, hip hop was also used as a form of social protest.&lt;ref name="aa_pedia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Emmett George|last2=Kernodle|first2=Tammy L.|last3=Jr|first3=Horace J.

[[Conscious hip hop|Conscious]] and [[political hip hop]] tracks of the time were a response to the effects of American capitalism and former President Reagan's conservative political economy. According to Rose Tricia, "In rap, relationships between black cultural practice, social and economic conditions, technology, sexual and racial politics, and the institution policing of the popular terrain are complex and in constant motion. Even though hip hop was used as a mechanism for different social issues it was still very complex with issues within the movement itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Tricia. Black Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary American. Hanover: Wesleyan U, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also often an emphasis on [[black nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of Afrocentric Rap as the Predominant Movement Within Hip-Hop|url=https://www.amoeba.com/blog/2011/02/jamoeblog/the-rise-and-fall-of-afrocentric-rap-as-the-predominant-movement-within-hip-hop.html|website=Amoeblog|accessdate=June 20, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop scholar [[Michael Eric Dyson]] stated, "during the golden age of hip hop, from 1987 to 1993, Afrocentric and black nationalist rap were prominent",&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, Michael Eric, 2007, ''Know What I Mean?'', Westview Press, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and critic Scott Thill described the time as "the golden age of hip hop, the late '80s and early '90s when the form most capably fused the militancy of its [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] and [[The Watts Prophets|Watts Prophets]] forebears with the wide-open cultural experimentalism of [[De La Soul]] and others".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Thill, [http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21943?page=1 "Whiteness Visible"] AlterNet, May 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistic variety was also prominent. [[MSNBC]] said that in the golden age, "rappers had an individual sound that was dictated by their region and their communities, not by a marketing strategist"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and the ''[[Village Voice]]'' referred to the golden age's "eclecticism".&lt;ref name="villagevoice2002"&gt;Mosi Reeves, [http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0205,reeves,31875,22.html "Easy-Chair Rap"], ''Village Voice'', January 29th 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time period ==
[[File:Tribe 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[A Tribe Called Quest]] at a 2009 show.]]
[[AllMusic]] writes, "Hip-hop's golden age is bookended by the commercial breakthrough of [[Run–D.M.C.]] in 1986 and the explosion of gangsta rap with NWA in the late 80s and Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg in 1993."&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt; However, the specific time period that the golden age covers varies among different sources. The ''[[New York Times]]'' also defines hip-hop's golden age as the "late 1980's and early 90's".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Caramanica, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/arts/music/26jon.html "Hip-Hop's Raiders of the Lost Archives"], ''New York Times'', June 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Simmons of [[The Chemical Brothers]] said, "there was that golden age of hip-hop in the early 90s when the [[Jungle Brothers]] made ''[[Straight Out the Jungle]]'' and [[De La Soul]] made ''[[Three Feet High and Rising]]''"&lt;ref&gt;Will Hodgkinson, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/homeentertainment/story/0,12830,1044954,00.html "Adventures on the wheels of steel"], ''The Guardian'', September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (though these records were in fact made in 1988 and 1989 respectively). [[MSNBC]] called the 1980s the "Golden Age" of hip-hop music.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[The Guardian]] states, "The golden age of hip-hop, from 1986 to 1993, gave the world an amazing number of great records," and also describes the period in November 1993, when [[A Tribe Called Quest]] and [[Wu-Tang Clan]] released albums, as "The Next Golden age"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jan/03/thegoldenageofhiphop|work=The Guardian|title=The missing link of hip-hop's golden age|date=January 3, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2011|first1=Allan|last1=McGee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/wu-tang-clan-golden-age|work=The Guardian|title=The next golden age|date=June 12, 2011|accessdate=September 17, 2011|first1=Paul|last1=MacInnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden age is described by scholar Mickey Hess as "circa 1986-1994."&lt;ref name="autogenerated361b"&gt;Hess, Mickey., 2007, ''Icons of Hip Hop [Two Volumes] [2 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture (Greenwood Icons)'', Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic Tony Green, in the book ''Classic Material'', refers to the two-year period 1993–1994 as "a second Golden Age" that saw influential, high-quality albums using elements of past classicism&amp;nbsp;– [[drum machine]]s ([[Roland TR-808]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mva_xJa_2Q0C&amp;pg=PA52|title=The Soul of Hip Hop: Rims, Timbs and a Cultural Theology|first=Daniel White|last=Hodge|date=August 21, 2010|publisher=InterVarsity Press|accessdate=June 20, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;), drum [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] ([[Akai MPC60]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/22/akai-mpc-live-mpc-x/|title=Hip-hop's most influential sampler gets a 2017 reboot|website=Engadget|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E-mu SP-1200]]), [[Turntablism|turntable]] scratches, references to [[old school hip hop]] hits, and "tongue-twisting triplet verbalisms"&amp;nbsp;– while making clear that [[Alternative hip hop|new directions]] were being taken. Green lists as examples the Wu-Tang Clan's ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', Nas' ''[[Illmatic]]'', De La Soul's 1993 release ''[[Buhloone Mindstate]]'', Snoop Doggy Dogg's ''[[Doggystyle]]'', A Tribe Called Quest's third album ''[[Midnight Marauders]]'' and the Outkast debut ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated132"/&gt;

According to copyright, music, and pop culture scholars Kembrew Mcleod and Peter DiCola, the golden age of hip-hop [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] spans from 1987-1992. Artists and record labels were not yet aware of the permanence of hip-hop culture in mainstream media, and did not yet accept it as a legitimate institution. They believe the ruling made in ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.]]'' marked the end of the golden age of hip hop and its sampling practices.&lt;ref name="creative"&gt;DiCola, Peter &amp; Mcleod, Kembrew.

===Juice Crew===
[[File:Marlon Williams aka Dj Marley Marl.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Marley Marl]] in Nottingham, England in 1999.]]       
Notable hip hop producer and innovator, [[Marley Marl]], formed the [[Juice Crew]] hip hop collective. Marl also founded [[Cold Chillin' Records]] and assembled various hip hop acts, including [[MC Shan]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Roxanne Shanté]], [[Kool G Rap|Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo]], and [[Masta Ace]].&lt;ref name="allmusicMarley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p101803/biography|title=Marley Marl|publisher=[[AllMusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Juice Crew]] collective was an important force in ushering the "golden age" era of hip hop, with advances in lyrical technique, distinctive personalities of emerging artists like Biz Markie and Big Daddy Kane, and attaining [[crossover (music)|crossover]] commercial success for hip hop music.&lt;ref name="allmusicMarley"/&gt; Marley Marl's first production was an "answer record" to "Sucker MCs" in 1983 entitled "Sucker DJs" by Dimples D. Soon after came 14-year-old Roxanne Shanté's answer to [[UTFO]]'s "Roxanne Roxanne", "Roxanne's Revenge" (1985), sparking off the huge wave of answer records known as the [[Roxanne Wars]].&lt;ref name="allmusicMarley"/&gt; More disses (insults intended to show disrespect) from Shanté followed: "Bite This" (1985), "Queen of Rox" (1985), introducing Biz Markie on "Def Fresh Crew" (1986), "Payback" (1987), and "Have a Nice Day" (1987).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boogie Down Productions===
Shante's "Have a Nice Day" had aimed some barbs at the principal two members of a new group from the Bronx called Boogie Down Productions (BDP): "Now KRS-ONE you should go on vacation with that name soundin' like a wack radio station, and as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed, when [[T La Rock]] said "It's Yours", he didn't mean his name". Boogie Down Productions had manufactured a disagreement with the Juice Crew's [[MC Shan]], releasing "South Bronx" and "The Bridge is Over" in reply to his "The Bridge" and "Kill That Noise" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; KRS-One considered Run-D.M.C. the epitome of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that BDP's approach reflected a feeling that the early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and out of touch with the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman , p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boogie Down's first album ''[[Criminal Minded]]'' (1987) admitted a [[reggae]] influence and had KRS-One imitating the Beatles' "Hey Jude" on the title track. It also contained two tales of grim street life, yet played for callous laughs: "The P Is Free", in which KRS speaks of throwing out his girl who wants [[crack cocaine]] in exchange for sex, and "9mm Goes Bang", in which he shoots a drug dealer then cheerfully sings "la la la la la la". Songs like these presaged the rise of an underground that matched violent lyrics to the hardcore [[drum machine]] tracks of the new school. The cover of ''Criminal Minded'' was a further reflection of a move towards this sort of radical image, depicting the group in a half-light, holding firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The next album ''[[By All Means Necessary (album)|By All Means Necessary]]'' (1988) left that element behind for political radicalism following the murder of [[Scott La Rock]], with its title and cover alluding to [[Malcolm X]]. KRS-One became involved with the [[Stop the Violence Movement]] at this time. Boogie Down Productions, along with Run-D.M.C. and Public Enemy, associated the new school as rap music with a strong message.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;Jackson, Derrick Z. "Welcome to the School of Rap Music It's in Session Now, And There Are Some Positive Lessons", ''Boston Globe'', August 13, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric B. and Rakim===
Eric B. &amp; Rakim appeared with the Marley Marl produced "Eric B. Is President" and "My Melody" on Zakia Records in 1986. Both tracks appeared on ''Paid in Full'' (1987). Just as Boogie Down Productions had, the pair reflected changes in street life on their debut's cover, which depicted the two wearing large gold chains and surrounded by money. Like ''Criminal Minded'', the sampling prevalent in the album cemented James Brown's status as a hip hop source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering James Brown And His Influence On Hip Hop Culture|url=http://thesource.com/2013/12/26/remembering-james-brown-and-his-influence-on-hip-hop-culture/|website=The Source|accessdate=June 20, 2017|date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Rakim's allusions showed the growing influence of mystic Islam-offshoot [[The Nation of Gods and Earths]] in hip-hop. The music was minimalist, austerely so, with many writers noting that coupled with Rakim's precise, logical style, the effect was almost one of scientific rigour. The group followed ''Paid in Full'' with ''Follow The Leader'' (1988) (on which they were open-minded enough to sample [[The Eagles]]), ''Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em'' (1990) and ''Don't Sweat The Technique'' (1992).

Rakim is generally regarded as the most cutting-edge of the MCs of the new school era.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Mark Anthony.

Jess Harvell in ''Pitchfork'' in 2005 wrote that "Rakim's innovation was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap's most sacred cause: talking shit about how you're a better rapper than everyone else."&lt;ref name="Harvell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvell|first1=Jess|title=Eric B &amp; Rakim: Paid in Full / Follow the Leader|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/17495|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=June 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081225143228/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/17495|archivedate=December 25, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christgau in the ''Village Voice'' in 1990 wrote of Rakim's style as "calm, confident, clear.

===Public Enemy===

Public Enemy, having been reluctantly convinced to sign to a record label, released ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'' on Def Jam in 1987.&lt;ref name="Coleman351"&gt;Coleman, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted the Public Enemy logo, a circle of hatted b-boy in a sniper's cross-hairs, was replete with battle rhymes ("Miuzi Weighs a Ton", "Public Enemy #1"), social-political fare ("Rightstarter (Message to a Black Man)" and anti-[[crack cocaine|crack]] messages ("Megablast").&lt;ref name="Coleman351" /&gt; The album was a critical and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time.&lt;ref name="Coleman354"&gt;Coleman, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bumrush the Show'' had been recorded on the heels of Run-D.M.C.'s ''Raising Hell'', but was held back by Def Jam in order for them to concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys' ''License to Ill''.&lt;ref name="Coleman351" /&gt; Chuck D of Public Enemy felt that by the time their first record was released, Boogie Down Productions and Rakim had already changed the landscape for how an MC could rap.&lt;ref name="Coleman351" /&gt; Public Enemy were already recording their second album ''It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back'' (Def Jam, 1988) when ''Bumrush'' hit stores.&lt;ref name="Coleman351" /&gt;

===Gangsta rap===
{{main|Gangsta rap}}

The underground sound, centered on urban violence, that was to become [[gangsta rap]], existed on the East Coast soon after Run–D.M.C. had inaugurated the new school of hip hop. Philadelphia's [[Schoolly D]] self-released "Gangsta Boogie" in 1984, and "P.S.K. What Does It Mean?"/"Gucci Time" in 1985, leading to ''[[Saturday Night! – The Album|Saturday Night]]'' (Schoolly D, 1986, [[Jive Records|Jive]], 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 406–407&lt;/ref&gt; The West Coast, which became the home of gangsta rap, had Toddy Tee's influential ''Batteram'' mixtape in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, p. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ice-T]]'s "Six in the Morning" in 1986&lt;ref&gt;Cross, p. 24–5&lt;/ref&gt; before [[N.W.A]]'s first records, leading to the hugely successful ''Straight Outta Compton'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, p. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Tongues===
Developments in the New York new school continuum in this climate were represented by the [[Native Tongues]] groups—[[The Jungle Brothers]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Monie Love]]—along with fellow travellers like [[Leaders of the New School]], [[KMD]] and [[Brand Nubian (hip hop group)|Brand Nubian]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Oliver.

'''Heinrich Brunner''' ({{lang-en|Henry Brunner}}; 21 June 1840 &amp;ndash; 11 August 1915) was a [[Germany|German]] historian born at [[Wels]] in [[Upper Austria]]. After studying at the universities of [[University of Vienna|Vienna]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], he became professor at the [[University of Lemberg]] in 1866, and in quick succession held similar positions at [[Prague]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Berlin]]. 

From 1872 Brunner devoted himself especially to studying the early laws and institutions of the [[Franks]] and kindred peoples of [[Western Europe]], and on these subjects his researches have been of supreme value. He also became a leading authority on modern [[Germany|German]] law. He became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, and in 1886, after the death of [[Georg Waitz]], undertook the supervision of the ''Leges'' section of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.

After the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was invaded by the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]], all of Bosnia was ceded to the newly created [[Independent State of Croatia]]. Axis rule in Bosnia led to widespread persecution and mass-killings of native undesirables and anti-fascists. Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the [[Chetniks]], a Serb nationalist and royalist resistance movement that conducted ineffective [[guerrilla warfare]] against the occupying Nazi forces, only to collaborate with them later in the war against the communist partisans. The Chetniks were also known to persecute and murder non-Serbs and communist sympathizers. On 12 October 1941 a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of [[Sarajevo]] signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|persecution of Serbs]] organized by [[Ustaše]], made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and whole Muslim population, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hadžijahić |first=Muhamed |title= Istorija Naroda Bosne i Hercegovine |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |origyear= |year= 1973 |month= |publisher=Institut za istoriju radničkog pokreta |location= Sarajevo|language=Serbo-Croatian|isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page= 277 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= Muslimanske rezolucije iz 1941 godine [Muslim resolutions of 1941] |chapterurl= https://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941 |quote= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]] organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Ottoman borders. Military success eventually prompted the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to support the Partisans, and the end of the war resulted in the establishment of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution|constitution of 1946]] officially making [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] one of six constituent republics in the new state.

During the war, and following the massive deterioration of internal security under the incompetent [[Ustaše]] regime, the [[Nazis]] tried to create a [[quisling]] [[Waffen-SS]] unit in [[Bosnia]] called the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)]] in February 1943. Imam [[Halim Malkoć]] was the only [[Muslim]] to earn the [[Germany|German]] [[Iron Cross]] during [[World War II]].

The '''indigenous peoples of the Americas''' are the [[pre-Columbian]] peoples of [[the Americas]] and their descendants.

Although some [[indigenous peoples]] of the Americas were traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s—and many, especially in the [[Amazon basin]], still are—many groups practiced [[aquaculture]] and [[agriculture]]. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C. Mann |year=2005 |title=[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]] |location=New York |publisher=Knopf Publishing Group |isbn=1-4000-4006-X|oclc=56632601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting and gathering. In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, city-states, [[chiefdom]]s, [[State (polity)|states]], [[Realm|kingdoms]] and [[empire]]s. Among which are the [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]], [[Inca civilization|Inca]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] states that until the 16th century were among the most politically and socially advanced nations in the world. They had a vast knowledge of [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[writing]], [[physics]], [[medicine]], [[planting]] and [[irrigation]], [[geology]], [[mining]], [[sculpture]] and [[goldsmithing]].

Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially [[Belize]], [[Bolivia]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Greenland]], [[Guatemala]], [[Guyana]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], and the [[United States]]. At least a thousand different [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the [[Quechuan languages]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], [[Mayan languages]] and [[Nahuatl]], count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, [[social organization]] and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from [[Western culture]], and a few are still counted as [[uncontacted peoples]].

==Terminology==
{{lang|es|Indígenas}} or {{lang|es|pueblos indígenas}} ("indigenous peoples") is a common term in [[Spanish-speaking countries]], and {{lang|es|pueblos nativos}} or {{lang|es|nativos}} (lit. "native peoples") may also be heard, while {{lang|es|aborigen}} (aborigine) is used in [[Argentina]], and {{lang|es|pueblos aborígenes}} (aboriginal peoples) is common in [[Chile]]. The term "Amerindian" (short for "'Indians of the Americas") is used in [[Quebec]], [[the Guianas]], and [[Commonwealth Caribbean|the English-speaking Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/info/terminology "Terminology."] ''Survival International.''

This led to the blanket term "Indies" and "Indians" (Spanish {{lang|es|indios}}, Portuguese {{lang|es|índios}}) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced, or tolerated, by many over the last two centuries.{{Citation needed||date=January 2016}} Even though the term "Indian" generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas—such as the [[Aleut]]s, [[Inuit]], or [[Yupik peoples]], who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years before, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic [[Russian Far East]]—these groups are nonetheless considered "indigenous peoples of the Americas". The Portuguese and Spanish equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, {{lang|es|[[Filipinos#Hispanized caste system|indios filipinos]]}}.

The data indicate that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America.  Ruled out were hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen2014"/&gt; After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.

Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named '[[Naia (skeleton)|Naia]]' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called ''[[sistema Sac Actun]]'' in [[Mexico]]'s eastern [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-16/13000-year-old-skeleton-found-in-mexican-cave/5456472 "13,000-year-old skeleton found in Mexican cave oldest ever uncovered in the Americas: study"], [[ABC Online]], 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of two infants found at the [[Upward Sun River site]] have been dated to 11,500 years ago. They show that all Native Americans descended from a single founding population that initially split from East Asians around 36,000 years ago. They also show that the basal northern and southern Native American branches, to which all other indigenous Americans belong, diverged around 16,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period, and were documented in historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, and [[Nahua peoples]], had their own written languages and records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs, and burned many pre-Columbian written records.

The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the native peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-colonization population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80% and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The majority of these losses are attributed to the introduction of Afro-Eurasian diseases into the Americas. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which the early colonists and African slaves brought from Europe. The disease spread was slow initially, as Europeans were poor vectors for transferring the disease due to their natural exposure. This changed with the mass importation of Western and Central Africans slaves, who like the Native Americans lacked any resistances to the diseases of Europe and Northern Africa. These two groups were able to maintain a population large enough for diseases such as smallpox to spread rapidly amongst themselves. In 1520, contact with an African who had been infected with smallpox had arrived in Yucatán. By 1558, the disease had spread throughout South America and had arrived at the Plata basin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|date=1993|title=Disease Exchange Across the Tropical Atlantic|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|volume=15|issue=3|pages=329–356|doi=10.2307/23331729|jstor=23331729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonist violence towards indigenous peoples exacerbated the loss of lives.

There are many factors as to why Native Americans suffered such immense losses from Afro-Eurasian diseases. After the land bridge separated the human populations of the Old World and the New World, the Native Americans lost many of the immunities their ancestors possessed. In addition, Europeans acquired many diseases, like cow pox, from domestication of animals that the Native Americans did not have access to. While Europeans adapted to these diseases, there was no way for Native Americans to acquire those diseases and build up resistances to them. Finally, many of the European diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [[yellow fever]], that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult. Children could survive the disease and that individual would have immunity to the disease for the rest of their life. Upon contact with the adult populations of Native Americans, these childhood diseases were very fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/goodling.html |title= Stacy Goodling, "Effects of European Diseases on the Inhabitants of the New World" |publisher= Millersville.edu |accessdate= 23 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510163413/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/goodling.html |archivedate= 10 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Colonization of the Caribbean led to the destruction of the [[Arawak]]s of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Their culture was destroyed by 1650. Only 500 had survived by the year 1550, though the bloodlines continued through to the modern populace.

The [[Spanish Empire]] and other Europeans re-introduced [[horse]]s to the Americas. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;
''Ancient Horse (Equus cf. E. complicatus)'', The Academy of Natural Sciences, Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection, Philadelphia, [http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/otherFossils/equus.php (See: species ''[[Equus scotti]]'') Other horse species had died out at the end of the last [[ice age]] with other megafauna.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829184554/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/otherFossils/equus.php |date=29 August 2008 }}

The re-introduction of the [[horse]], extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on [[horse culture|Native American culture]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America and in [[Patagonia]] in South America. By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture [[game (hunting)|game]], especially [[bison]].

Natives of North America began practicing [[farming]] approximately 4,000 years ago, late in the [[Archaic period in the Americas| Archaic]] period of North American cultures. Technology had advanced to the point where pottery had started to become common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic [[Native American use of fire| Indians began using fire]] in a controlled manner. They carried out intentional burning of vegetation to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important both for food and for medicines.&lt;ref name="Owen2002"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm|title= Chapter 2 (TERRA–2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South|last= Owen|first= Wayne|year=2002|work= Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report|publisher= U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station|accessdate= 29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mississippi River]] valley, Europeans noted that Native Americans managed groves of [[Nut (fruit) | nut]]- and [[fruit tree | fruit-tree]]s not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields. They would have used [[Controlled burn| prescribed burning]] further away, in forest and prairie areas.&lt;ref name="Lentz2000"&gt;{{cite book|title= Imperfect balance: landscape transformations in the Precolumbian Americas|editor= David L. Lentz|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= New York|year= 2000|pages= 241–242|isbn= 0-231-11157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many crops first domesticated by indigenous Americans are now produced and used globally, most notably [[maize]] or "corn", arguably the most important crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Pollan]], ''The Omnivore's Dilemma''&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant crops include [[cassava]]; [[Salvia hispanica |chia]]; [[squash (plant) |squash]] (pumpkins, zucchini, [[marrow (vegetable) |marrow]], [[acorn squash]], [[butternut squash]]); the [[pinto bean]], ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans including most [[common bean]]s, [[tepary bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s; [[tomato]]es; [[potato]]es; [[avocado]]s; [[peanut]]s; [[cocoa bean]]s (used to make [[chocolate]]); [[vanilla]]; [[strawberries]]; [[pineapple]]s; [[Capsicum| peppers]] (species and varieties of ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[bell pepper]]s, [[jalapeño]]s, [[paprika]] and [[chili pepper]]s); [[sunflower|sunflower seeds]]; [[rubber]]; [[brazilwood]]; [[chicle]]; [[tobacco]]; [[coca]]; [[manioc]] and some species of [[cotton]].

Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management — including of agro-forestry practices among [[Itza]] [[Maya peoples |Maya]] in Guatemala and of hunting and fishing among the [[Menominee]] of Wisconsin — suggest that longstanding "sacred values" may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
Indigenous Americans also domesticated some animals, such as [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, and [[guinea-pig]]s.

==Culture==

[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], [[Andes]], [[Peru]]]]
Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where distinct ethnic groups adopting shared cultural traits, similar technologies, and social organizations. An example of such a [[cultural area]] is [[Mesoamerica]], where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [[nomad]]ic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.

=== Languages ===
The languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area.
Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the [[Ojibwe language|Chippewas]] and [[Lenape|Delawares]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammerton, J.A., Peoples Of All Nations, Volume 7, London: Educational Book Co., Limited, 17, New Bridge Street, E.C&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing systems===
{{see also|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cherokee syllabary|Quipu}}
[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]]]]
The development of [[writing]] is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] began to wane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1–4|publisher= Mesoweb Reports &amp; News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maya script|Maya writing system]] was a combination of [[phonetic]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s—that is, it was a [[logosyllabic]] writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the [[spoken language]] of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D.  |authorlink=Michael D.

The [[Zapotec script|Zapotec writing system]] is one of the earliest writing systems in the Americas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Urcid Javier, 2005; La Escritura zapoteca&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest example of the Zapotec script is a monument discovered in [[San José Mogote]], dating from around from 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery and Marcus, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Zapotec writing was [[logogram|logographic]] and presumably [[syllabary|syllabic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The remains of the Zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture. There are only a few extant inscriptions, making study of this writing system difficult.

[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hill Boone, "Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico". p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial era codices contain not only [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), Spanish, and occasionally [[Latin]].

Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there are a large number of local-level documents in [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Karttunen, "Nahuatl Literacy", in George A. Collier et al, eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York: Academic Press 1982, pp. 395–417.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [[New Philology]] to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].

Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.

[[Native American music]] in North America is almost entirely [[Texture (music)|monophonic]], but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around [[drum]]ming. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, [[clapper stick]]s, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. [[Flute]]s were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in [[Northern California]], a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The [[Apache fiddle]] is a single [[stringed instrument]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often [[pentatonic]]. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and "rain" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420123834/http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|date=2004-04-17|archivedate=2015-04-20|accessdate=2016-06-22|title=Music from the Land of the Jaguar|publisher=The Princeton Art Museum}} (Includes sound sample.) {{Dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous peoples in what is now the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]], including their descendants, were commonly called "American Indians", or simply "Indians" domestically. Since the late 20th century, when some{{who|date=February 2018}} insisted on using "Native American", as their preferred term, the [[United States Census Bureau]] and other parts of government have also adopted it. In Alaska, indigenous peoples belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the [[St. Lawrence Island Yupik]], [[Iñupiat]], [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]], [[Yup'ik]], [[Cup'ik]], [[Unangax]], [[Alutiiq]], [[Eyak]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tsimshian]], and [[Tlingit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education and Programs: Traditional Territories of Alaska Native Cultures|url=http://www.alaskanative.net/en/main-nav/education-and-programs/cultures-of-alaska/|website=Alaskan Native Heritage Center Museum|accessdate=8 November 2015|location=Anchorage, AK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are collectively called [[Alaska Natives]]. They include Native American peoples as well as Inuit, who are distinct but occupy areas of the region. The United States has authority with Indigenous [[Polynesia|Polynesian peoples]], which include [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]], [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]], [[Samoan people|Samoan]], [[Tahitian people|Tahitian]], and [[Demographics of Tonga|Tongan]]; politically they are classified as [[Pacific Islands American]]. They are geographically, genetically, and culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the mainland continents of the Americas.

In the 2010 census, 2.9 million people identified as Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native alone. A total of 5.2 million people identified as Native Americans, either alone or in combination with one or more ethnicity or other races.&lt;ref name="uscensus"/&gt; 1.8 million are enrolled tribal members.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Tribes have established their own criteria for membership, which are often based on [[blood quantum]], [[lineal descent]], or residency. A minority of Native Americans live in land units called [[Indian reservation]]s. Some California and Southwestern tribes, such as the [[Kumeyaay]], [[Cocopa]], [[Pascua Yaqui]] and [[Apache]], span both sides of the US–Mexican border. By treaty, [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee people]] have the legal right to freely cross the US–Canada border.

==== Mexico ====
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Mexico}}
[[File:Huichol indian.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huichol people|Wixarika (Huichol)]] woman from Zacatecas]]
The territory of modern-day [[Mexico]] was home to numerous indigenous civilizations prior to the arrival of the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'': The [[Olmec]]s, who flourished from between 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE in the coastal regions of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and the [[Mixtec]]s, who held sway in the mountains of [[Oaxaca]] and the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in the [[Yucatán]] (and into neighbouring areas of contemporary [[Central America]]); the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] in present-day [[Michoacán]] and surrounding areas, and the [[Aztec]]s/[[Mexica]], who, from their central capital at [[Tenochtitlan]], dominated much of the centre and south of the country (and the non-Aztec inhabitants of those areas) when [[Hernán Cortés]] first landed at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]].

In contrast to what was the general rule in the rest of North America, the history of the colony of [[New Spain]] was one of racial intermingling (''mestizaje''). ''[[Mestizo]]s'', which in Mexico designate people who do not identify culturally with any indigenous grouping, quickly came to account for a majority of the colony's population; but 6% of the Mexican population identify as speakers of one of the indigenous languages. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]] identifies 62 indigenous groups in Mexico, each with a unique language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611011220/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/257.pdf |date=11 June 2008 }} (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the states of [[Chiapas]] and [[Oaxaca]] and in the interior of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] the majority of the population is indigenous. Large indigenous minorities, including [[Aztecs]] or [[Nahua people|Nahua]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s, [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], and [[Mixtec]]s are also present in the central regions of Mexico. In Northern Mexico indigenous people are a small minority.
[[File:Highland_Maya_Women_(crop).jpg|thumb|upright|Two Maya women in the highlands of [[Chiapas]]]]

The [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] grants all indigenous languages spoken in Mexico, regardless of the number of speakers, the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken, and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some [[public services]] and documents in their native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas (General Law of the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples) |work=CDI México |url=http://cdi.gob.mx/derechos/vigencia/2006_ley_general_derechos_linguisticos_pueblos_indigenas.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925193420/http://cdi.gob.mx/derechos/vigencia/2006_ley_general_derechos_linguisticos_pueblos_indigenas.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2007 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Spanish, the law has granted them—more than 60 languages—the status of "national languages". The law includes all indigenous languages of the Americas regardless of origin; that is, it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] recognizes the language of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], who immigrated from the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kikapúes&amp;nbsp;— Kikaapoa |work=CDI México |url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=291 |accessdate=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recognizes the languages of the [[Guatemala]]n indigenous refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aguacatecos, cakchiqueles, ixiles, kekchíes, tecos y quichés |work=CDI México |url=http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1378 |accessdate=2 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232909/http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=1378 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and [[secondary education]] in some indigenous rural communities. Nonetheless, of the indigenous peoples in Mexico, only about 67% of them (or 5.4% of the country's population) speak an indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak Spanish (1.2% of the country's population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poblicación de 5 años y más por Entidad Federativa, sexo y grupos lengüa indígena quinquenales de edad, y su distribución según condición de habla indígena y habla española |work=INEGI, México |url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102103605/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Costa Rica =====
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica}}
There are over 114,000 inhabitants of Native American origins, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (In the Central Valley), Matambú or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (Northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (Southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar people|Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (Southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (Southern Costa Rica) and [[Ngäbe people|Ngäbe]] (Southern Costa Rica).

These native groups are characterized for their work in wood, like masks, drums and other artistic figures, as well as fabrics made of cotton.

Their subsistence is based on agriculture, having corn, beans and plantains as the main crops.

===== El Salvador =====

[[File:Nuestros Angeles de El Salvador.jpg|thumb|Indigenous Salvadoran [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women dancing in the traditional Procession of Palms, [[Panchimalco]] in [[El Salvador]]]]
Much of [[El Salvador]] was home to the [[Pipil people|Pipil]], the [[Lenca people|Lenca]], Xinca, and Kakawira. The Pipil lived in western [[El Salvador]], spoke [[Nahuat|Nawat]], and had many settlements there, most noticeably [[Cuzcatlan]]. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [[fertile soil|fertile land]] that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like [[Izalco]], [[Panchimalco]], [[Sacacoyo]], and [[Nahuizalco]].

===== Guatemala =====
{{main|Demographics of Guatemala}}
[[File:Guatémala 78.jpg|thumb|left|Maya women from Guatemala]]
Guatemala has one of the largest Indigenous populations in Central America, with approximately 39.3% of the population considering themselves Indigenous.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] demographic portion of Guatemala’s population consists of majority Mayan groups and one Non-Mayan group. The Mayan portion, can be broken down into 23 groups namely [[K'iche' people|K’iche]] 11.3%, [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] 7.4%, [[Mam people|Mam]] 5.5%, [[Q'eqchi' people|Q’eqchi’]] 7.6% and Other 7.5%.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; The Non-Mayan group consists of the [[Xinca people|Xinca]] who are another set of Indigenous people making up 0.5% of the population.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

&amp;nbsp;The Law of National Languages has been an effort to grant and protect Indigenous people rights not afforded to them previously. Along with the Law of National Languages passed in 2003, in 1996 the Guatemalan Constitutional Court had ratified the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5613|title=Guatemala adopts indigenous rights into Constitution|last=International|first=Survival|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107003354/https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5613|archive-date=7 November 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization|ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples]], is also known as Convention 169 .

===== Nicaragua =====
About 5% of the [[Nicaraguan]] population are indigenous. The largest indigenous group in Nicaragua is the [[Miskito people]]. Their territory extended from [[Cape Camarón]], [[Honduras]], to [[La Cruz de Río Grande|Rio Grande]], Nicaragua along the [[Mosquito Coast]]. There is a native [[Miskito language]], but large numbers speak [[Miskito Coast Creole]], Spanish, [[Rama language|Rama]] and other languages. Their use of [[English-based creole languages|Creole English]] came about through frequent contact with the British, who colonized the area. Many Miskitos are Christians. Traditional Miskito society was highly structured, politically and otherwise. It had a king, but he did not have total power. Instead, the power was split between himself, a [[Miskito Governor]], a [[Miskito General]], and by the 1750s, a [[Miskito Admiral]]. Historical information on Miskito kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-[[mythology|mythical]].

Another major indigenous culture in eastern Nicaragua are the [[Sumo people|Mayangna (or Sumu) people]], counting some 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, J. L. (1998). To die in this way: Nicaraguan Indians and the myth of mestizaje, 1880–1965. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller indigenous culture in southeastern Nicaragua are the [[Rama people|Rama]].

Other indigenous groups in Nicaragua are located in the central, northern, and Pacific areas and they are self-identified as follows: [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera (or Matagalpa)]], [[Subtiaba language|Xiu-Subtiaba]], and [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saballos|first1=Francisco|title=Características Socioculturales de los Pueblos Indígenas del Pacífico, Centro y Norte|url=http://www.pueblosindigenaspcn.net/component/content/article/84.html|accessdate=January 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114052706/http://www.pueblosindigenaspcn.net/component/content/article/84.html|archivedate=November 14, 2012|language=Spanish|trans-title=Sociocultural Characteristics of the Indigenous Peoples of the Pacific, Central and North|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Argentina's indigenous population (known as ''pueblos originarios'') numbered about 600,329 (1.6% of total population); this figure includes 457,363 people who self-identified as belonging to an indigenous ethnic group and 142,966 who identified themselves as first-generation descendants of an indigenous people.&lt;ref name=repetida_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp |title=Encuesta Complementaria de Pueblos Indígenas (ECPI) 2004 - 2005 |publisher=INDEC |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ten most populous indigenous peoples are the [[Mapuche]] (113,680 people), the [[Kolla people|Kolla]] (70,505), the [[Toba people|Toba]] (69,452), the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] (68,454), the [[Wichí people|Wichi]] (40,036), the [[Diaguita]]&amp;ndash;[[Calchaquí]] (31,753), the [[Mocoví people|Mocoví]] (15,837), the [[Huarpe]] (14,633), the [[Comechingón]] (10,863) and the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] (10,590).

{{main|Demographics of Bolivia|Indigenous peoples in Bolivia}}
[[File:Countries with dominant Mestizo and Native American population.png|thumb|Bolivia and Peru have majority-Native American populations, including [[mestizos]].]]

In [[Bolivia]], the 2001 census reported that 62% of residents over the age of 15 identify as belonging to an indigenous people. Some 3.7% report growing up with an indigenous mother tongue but do not identify as indigenous.&lt;ref name=CEPALBol32&gt;Indigenous identification was treated in a complex way in the 2001 Census, which collected data based on three criteria: self-identification, capacity to speak an indigenous language, and learning an indigenous language as a child. CEPAL, "[http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/publicaciones/xml/3/23263/P23263.xml&amp;xsl=/celade/tpl/p9f.xsl&amp;base=/celade/tpl/top-bottom.xsl Los pueblos indígenas de Bolivia: diagnóstico sociodemográfico a partir del censo del 2001]", 2005, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; When both of these categories are totaled, and children under 15, some 66.4% of Bolivia's population was recorded as indigenous in the 2001 Census.&lt;ref name=CEPALBol42&gt;CEPAL, "[http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/publicaciones/xml/3/23263/P23263.xml&amp;xsl=/celade/tpl/p9f.xsl&amp;base=/celade/tpl/top-bottom.xsl Los pueblos indígenas de Bolivia: diagnóstico sociodemográfico a partir del censo del 2001]", 2005, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest indigenous ethnic groups are: [[Quechuas|Quechua]], about 2.5 million people; [[Aymara people|Aymara]], 2.0 million; [[Chiquitano people|Chiquitano]], 181,000; [[Guarani people|Guaraní]], 126,000; and [[Mojeño]], 69,000.

Some groups, including [[CONAMAQ]] (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu), draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of 50 indigenous peoples native to Bolivia.

Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of "empowered caciques" to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the [[CIDOB Confederation|CIDOB]] confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the [[ILO Convention 169]] and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories. The 1994 [[Law of Popular Participation]] granted "grassroots territorial organizations;" these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas.

Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages. The constitutional reform in 1997 recognized Bolivia as a multi-lingual, pluri-ethnic society and introduced [[education reform]]. In 2005, for the first time in the country's history, an indigenous Aymara, [[Evo Morales]], was elected as President.

Morales began work on his "indigenous autonomy" policy, which he launched in the eastern lowlands [[Departments of Bolivia|department]] on August 3, 2009. Bolivia was the first nation in the history of South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to self-government.&lt;ref name="en.mercopress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2009/08/03/bolivian-president-morales-launches-the-indigenous-autonomy|title=Bolivian president Morales launches the "indigenous autonomy"|date=2009-08-03|accessdate=5 August 2009|publisher=[[MercoPress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], the President called it "a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement", saying that, though he might make errors, he would "never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people."&lt;ref name="en.mercopress.com"/&gt; A vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in December 2009, at the same time as general elections to office.

The Mapuche successfully fought off defeat in the first 300–350 years of Spanish rule during the [[Arauco War]]. Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean state decided to occupy their lands. During the [[Occupation of Araucanía]] the Mapuche surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s. Their land was opened to settlement by Chileans and Europeans. [[Mapuche conflict|Conflict over Mapuche land rights]] continues to the present.

Other groups include the [[Aymara people|Aymara]], the majority of whom live in Bolivia and Peru, with smaller numbers in the [[Arica-Parinacota Region|Arica-Parinacota]] and [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]] regions, and the [[Atacama people]] (''Atacameños''), who reside mainly in [[El Loa]].

[[Ecuador]] was the site of many indigenous cultures, and civilizations of different proportions. An early sedentary culture, known as the [[Valdivia culture]], developed in the coastal region, while the [[Caras (tribe)|Caras]] and the [[Quitu]]s unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The [[Cañari]]s near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] were the most advanced, and most feared by the [[Inca]], due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.

[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]
Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendants of peoples conquered by the Incas, they are [[Kichwa]] speakers and include the [[Inca-Caranqui|Caranqui]], the [[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]s, the Cayambe, the Quitu-Caras, the [[Panzaleo]], the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the [[Cañari]], and the [[Saraguro people|Saraguro]]. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as ''mitimaes''.

Coastal groups, including the [[Awá (kwaiker)|Awá]], [[Ecuador|Chachi]], and the [[Tsáchila]], make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], the [[Huaorani]], the Siona-Secoya, the [[Cofán]], and the [[Achuar people|Achuar]].

In 1986, indigenous people formed the first "truly" national [[Political organisation|political organization]]. [[CONAIE|The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[CONAIE]]) has been the primary political institution of the Indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation. It has been influential in national politics, contributing to the ouster of presidents [[Abdalá Bucaram]] in 1997 and [[Jamil Mahuad]] in 2000.

Cultural citizenship—or what Renato Rosaldo has called, "the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense" (1996:243)—is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}}, [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 UPF.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Venezuela]]ns have some indigenous heritage and are [[pardo]], even if they identify as white. But those who identify as indigenous, from being raised in those cultures, make up only around 2% of the total population. The indigenous peoples speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects. As some of the ethnic groups are very small, their native languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important indigenous groups are the [[Ye'kuana]], the [[Wayuu]], the [[Pemon]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]]. The most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who lived mainly in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.

The 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives the indigenous [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [[primary education]] in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.

=== Other parts of the Americas ===

Indigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charrúa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.&lt;ref name="enha_asc"/&gt; Some governments recognize some of the major Native American languages as official languages: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]].

==== Cuba ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In [[Cuba]], the population of Amerindians includes 0.1 of the population and 0.2 part Native which is also part of the population. Many are from the [[Taíno people]] or [[Arawak people]]. When the [[Spanish Empire]] was in control of the island they used the Natives as slaves and many died from diseases, hence decreasing the population. Presently 0.3 of the population of [[Cuba]] consists of part Native and full-blooded Amerindians.

==== Dominica ====
Dominica is home to the [[Carib Territory]], one of the last indigenous communities in the Caribbean. The Carib Territory is home to an estimated 3,000 Kalinago or Carib people.

==Native American name controversy==
{{Main|Native American name controversy}}

The Native American name controversy relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship. Many English [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [[endonyms]] from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples.

Since the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term "[[Native American name controversy|Native American]]," to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans or American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples. They prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations.

==Rise of indigenous movements==
{{Indigenous rights}}
Since the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and preservation of their culturess. Organizations such as the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations, for instance those across the [[Amazon Basin]]. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].

There has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [[United Nations]] voted to adopt the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.

In Colombia, various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221046/http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=27 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Evomorales-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), [[President of Bolivia]]]]

The first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in Latin America was [[Benito Juárez]], a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] Mexican; he was elected President of Mexico in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Rise-Evo-Morales-MAS/dp/1848135238/ref=dp_return_1?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evo Morales]] (Aymara people) was the first indigenous candidate elected as [[president of Bolivia]], in 2006, and the first in South America. He has been twice re-elected. His election encouraged the indigenous movement across Latin America.

Representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European "foreign [[power elite]]" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. It questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries that elected leftist leaders, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name="plenglish"&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&amp;language=EN Plenglish.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409050852/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D%29&amp;language=EN |date=9 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called "Crescent departments" in Bolivia to impose autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency. Amongst others, representatives of [[CONAIE]], the [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia]], the Chilean Council of All Lands, and the Brazilian Landless Movement participated in the forum.&lt;ref name="plenglish"/&gt;

Colours of the arrows correspond to approximate timing of the events and are decoded in the coloured time-bar. The initial peopling of Berinigia (depicted in light yellow) was followed by a standstill after which the ancestors of indigenous Americans spread swiftly all over the New World while some of the Beringian maternal lineages–C1a-spread westwards. More recent (shown in green) genetic exchange is manifested by back-migration of A2a into Siberia and the spread of D2a into north-eastern America that post-dated the initial peopling of the New World.]]
[[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]  primarily focuses on [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups]] and [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups]].

A 2013 study in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy from the [[Mal'ta-Buret' culture|archaeological Mal'ta-Buret' culture]] suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to [[Eurasia#Anthropology and genetics|western Eurasians]], who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought".&lt;ref name="Raghavan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raghavan |first1=Maanasa |last2=Skoglund |first2=Pontus |last3=Graf |first3=Kelly E. |last4=Metspalu |first4=Mait |last5=Albrechtsen |first5=Anders |last6=Moltke |first6=Ida |last7=Rasmussen |first7=Simon |last8=Stafford Jr |first8=Thomas W. |last9=Orlando |first9=Ludovic |last10=Metspalu |first10=Ene |last11=Karmin |first11=Monika |last12=Tambets |first12=Kristiina |last13=Rootsi |first13=Siiri |last14=Mägi |first14=Reedik |last15=Campos |first15=Paula F. |last16=Balanovska |first16=Elena |last17=Balanovsky |first17=Oleg |last18=Khusnutdinova |first18=Elza |last19=Litvinov |first19=Sergey |last20=Osipova |first20=Ludmila P. |last21=Fedorova |first21=Sardana A. |last22=Voevoda |first22=Mikhail I. |last23=DeGiorgio |first23=Michael |last24=Sicheritz-Ponten |first24=Thomas |last25=Brunak |first25=Søren |last26=Demeshchenko |first26=Svetlana |last27=Kivisild |first27=Toomas |last28=Villems |first28=Richard |last29=Nielsen |first29=Rasmus |last30=Jakobsson |first30=Mattias |last31=Willerslev |first31=Eske |title=Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans |journal=Nature |volume=505 |issue=7481 |pages=87–91 |year=2014 |pmid=24256729 |pmc=4105016 |doi=10.1038/nature12736 |laysummary=http://news.ku.dk/all_news/2013/2013.11/ancient_siberian_genome_reveals_genetic_origins_of_native_americans/ |laysource=University of Copenhagen |laydate=November 20, 2013|bibcode=2014Natur.505...87R }}&lt;/ref&gt; "We estimate that 14 to 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population", the authors wrote. Professor Kelly Graf said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons like Buhl Woman with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day indigenous Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the [[Solutrean hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=Raghavan/&gt; Kashani et al. 2012 state that "The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians. Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America."&lt;ref name=Kashani&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kashani |first1=Baharak Hooshiar |last2=Perego |first2=Ugo A. |last3=Olivieri |first3=Anna |last4=Angerhofer |first4=Norman |last5=Gandini |first5=Francesca |last6=Carossa |first6=Valeria |last7=Lancioni |first7=Hovirag |last8=Semino |first8=Ornella |last9=Woodward |first9=Scott R. |last10=Achilli |first10=Alessandro |last11=Torroni |first11=Antonio |title=Mitochondrial haplogroup C4c: A rare lineage entering America through the ice-free corridor? |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=35–39 |year=2012 |pmid=22024980 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[partition of British India]] in 1947 and creation of modern states of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], the two South Asian countries have been involved in four [[conventional warfare|wars]], including one [[undeclared war]], and many border skirmishes and military stand-offs. Most of these wars and conflict have ended with defeat or disaster for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shooting for a Century: The India-Pakistan Conundrum |last=Cohen |first=Stephen P. |publisher=[[Brookings Institution|Brookings Institution Press]] |year=2013 |isbn=9780815721871 |page=129 |quote=The India-Pakistan wars fall into two categories. The first were probes, to see if one side could gain an advantage by initiating conflict (or to avoid suffering a disadvantage if it did not take the initiative...

The [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir issue]] has been the main cause of all major conflicts between the two countries with the exception of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] where conflict originated due to turmoil in erstwhile [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]).

[[File:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Five nations ([[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Dominion of Ceylon]], [[Union of Burma]], and [[Kingdom of Sikkim]]) that gained independence in 1947 and 1948]]
The [[Partition of British India]] came about in the [[aftermath of World War II]], when both Great Britain and [[British India]] were dealing with the economic stresses caused by the war and its [[demobilisation]].&lt;ref name="Khan, 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Yasmin|title=The great Partition: the making of India and Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9WdQp2pwOYC|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=18 September 2007|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-12078-3|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the intention of those who wished for a Muslim state to come from British India to have a clean partition between independent and equal "Pakistan" and "Hindustan" once independence came.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar, 1946"&gt;* {{citation |last=Ambedkar |first=Bhimrao Ramji |title=Pakistan or Partition of India |year=1945 |publisher=Thacker and company |location=Bombay |origyear=first published as ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', 1940 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50130 |p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=July 2018}}

The partition itself, according to leading politicians such as [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]], leader of the [[All India Muslim League]], and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], leader of the [[Indian National Congress]], should have resulted in peaceful relations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} As the Hindu and Muslim populations were scattered unevenly in the whole country, the partition of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947 was not possible along religious lines. Nearly one third of the Muslim population of British India remained in India.&lt;ref name="Dixit, 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=India-Pakistan in War &amp; Peace |last=Dixit |first=Jyotindra Nath |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-30472-6 |page=13 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=July 2018}} Inter-communal violence between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims resulted in between 500,000 and 1 million casualties.&lt;ref name="Khan, 2007" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

[[Princely state|Princely-ruled territories]], such as Kashmir and Hyderabad, were also involved in the Partition. Rulers of these territories had the choice of joining India or Pakistan.

{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}

[[File:Indian soldiers fighting in 1947 war.jpg|thumb|right|Indian soldiers during the 1947–1948 war.]]

The war, also called the '''First Kashmir War''', started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the [[Maharaja]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu]] would accede to India. Following partition, [[princely states]] were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]]. Tribal Islamic forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] of the princely state to the [[Dominion of India]] to receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 47|Resolution 47]] on 22 April 1948.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1965===
{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1965}}
This war started following Pakistan's [[Operation Gibraltar]], which was designed to infiltrate forces into [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on [[West Pakistan]]. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II.{{sfn|David R.

This war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle brewing in erstwhile [[East Pakistan]] between [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], Leader of [[East Pakistan]], and [[Yahya Khan]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in the declaration of Independence of [[Bangladesh]] from the state system of Pakistan. Following [[Operation Searchlight]] and the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]], about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Other armed engagements==
Apart from the aforementioned wars, there have been skirmishes between the two nations from time to time. Some have bordered on all-out war, while others were limited in scope. The countries were expected to fight each other in 1955 after warlike posturing on both sides, but full-scale war did not break out.&lt;ref name="Lyon2008" /&gt;

===Past skirmishes and standoffs===

* '''[[Indian integration of Junagadh]]:''' The [[princely state]] of [[Junagadh]], which had a Hindu majority and a Muslim ruler acceded to Pakistan on 15 September 1947, claiming a connection by sea.

Following communal tensions Indian military entered the territory which was protested by Pakistan as a violation of International law. Later a plebiscite was held and the accession was reversed for the state to join India.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;[http://www.hellojunagadh.com/history_introduction.aspx History introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326005341/http://www.hellojunagadh.com/history_introduction.aspx |date=26 March 2012 }} at hellojunagadh.com: "On September 15, 1947, Nawab Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III of Junagadh, a princely state located on the south-western end of Gujarat and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten's views, arguing that Junagadh adjoined Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh Mangrol and Babariawad reacted by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RJ"&gt;{{cite book

The '''International Tracing Service''' (ITS), in German '''Internationaler Suchdienst''', in French  '''Service International de Recherches''' in [[Bad Arolsen]], Germany, is an internationally governed centre for documentation, information and research on Nazi persecution, forced labour and the Holocaust in [[Nazi]] Germany and its occupied regions. The archive contains about 30 million documents from [[concentration camps]], details of [[forced labour]], and files on [[displaced persons]]. ITS preserves the original documents and clarifies the fate of those persecuted by the Nazis. The archives have been accessible to researchers since 2007.

== History ==
In 1943, the international section of the [[British Red Cross]] was asked by the [[Headquarters of the Allied Forces]] to set up a registration and tracing service for missing persons. The organization was formalized under the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces]] and named the ''Central Tracing Bureau'' on February 15, 1944. As the war unfolded, the bureau was moved from [[London]] to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], then to [[Frankfurt am Main]], and finally to Bad Arolsen, which was considered a central location among the areas of Allied occupation and had an intact infrastructure unaffected by war.

On July 1, 1947, the [[International Refugee Organization]] took over administration of the bureau, and on January 1, 1948 the name was changed to its current '''International Tracing Service'''. In April 1951, administrative responsibilities for the service were placed under the [[Allied High Commission for Germany]]. When the status of occupation of Germany was repealed in 1954, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] took over the administration of the ITS. The [[Bonn Agreement (Germany)|Bonn Agreement]] of 1955 (which stated that no data that could harm the former Nazi victims or their families should be published) and their amendment protocols dating from 2006 provided the legal foundation of the International Tracing Service. The daily operations were managed by a director appointed by the ICRC, who had to be a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizen. After some discussion, in 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany renewed its continuing commitment to funding the operations of the ITS. The documents in the ITS archives were opened to public access on November 28, 2007.

Tracing missing persons, clarifying people's fates, providing family members with information, also for compensation and pension matters, have been the principal tasks of the ITS since its beginning. Since the opening of the archives, new tasks such as research and education and the archival description of the documents gain more importance in relation to the tasks of tracing and clarifying fates. Since these new activities are not part of its humanitarian mission, the ICRC withdrew from the management of the ITS in December 2012. The Bonn Agreement was replaced on December 9, 2011, when the eleven member states of the International Commission signed two new agreements in Berlin on the future tasks and management of the ITS.&lt;ref name="Auswaertiges Amt Berlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Aussenpolitik/InternatRecht/Vertraege/InternatSuchdienst2011/%C3%9Cbersicht.html?nn=607352 |title=Agreement on the International Tracing Service of December 9, 2011 |publisher=Auswaertiges-amt.de |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ITS was founded as an organization dedicated to finding missing persons, typically lost to family and friends as a result of war, persecution or forced labour during [[World War II]]. The service operates under the legal authority of the Berlin Agreements from December 2011 and is funded by the government of Germany. The German Federal Archives are the institutional partner for the ITS since January 2013.

== Organization ==
The organization is governed by an International Commission with representatives from [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. The Commission draws up the guidelines for the work to be carried out by the ITS and monitors these in the interests of the former victims of persecution.

The director of the ITS is appointed by the International Commission and is accountable directly to the Commission. Since January 2016, Floriane Azoulay is the director. There are about 240 staff employed by the ITS. The institution is funded by the German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media (BKM).

== Application for information — answers ==

=== Application forms ===
On 28 November 2007 the ITS archives were made broadly available to the general public. The ITS records may be consulted in person, or by mail, telephone, fax or e-mail; addresses and contact numbers are available on the ITS website. Inquiries can be submitted to the ITS using the online form on the organization's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/information/request-for-information-on-victims-of-nazi-persecution/ |title=Online application: Inquiries by survivors and family members |publisher=Its-arolsen.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives are also open for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/research/research-request/ |title=Research application for research purposes |publisher=Its-arolsen.org |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New obligations ===
After the end of the Second World War the main task of the ITS was initially to conduct a search for the survivors of Nazi persecution and their family-members. Today, this accounts for no more than about three percent of its work, which is why the name of the organisation is no longer really up-to-date. However, a large number of new obligations have been taken on over the course of the decades.

These include certification of the forms persecution took, confirmation for pension and compensation payments, allowing victims and their family members to inspect copies of the original documents and enabling the following generations to find out what happened to their forebears.

=== Answers ===
More than 70 years after the end of World War II, the ITS receives more than 1,000 inquiries every month from all around the world. Most of them now come from younger generations who are seeking information about the fate of their family members. In 2015, the ITS received around 15,500 requests regarding the fate of 21,909 persons from survivors, family members or researchers.

During the compensation phase of Eastern European forced labourers through the "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future" Foundation between 2000 and 2007, around 950,000 enquiries were sent to the Tracing Service. As a result of this flood of enquiries, the ITS was tremendously over-extended. Consequently, this created a gigantic backlog, which temporarily did considerable damage to the standing of the institution. Especially enquiries, which had no direct bearing on the foundation, remained unprocessed.

== The archives ==

=== Inventory ===
ITS's total inventory comprises 26,000 linear metres of original documents from the Nazi era and post-war period, 232,710 meters of microfilm and more than 106,870 [[microfiche]]s. Work is under way to digitize the files, both for purposes of easier search and for preserving the historical record.

The inventory is split up into three main areas: incarceration, forced labour and displaced persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/overview-of-the-archival-holdings/ |title=Archives - collection - overview |publisher=Its-arolsen.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of documents is enormous. They include list material and individual documents, such as [[registration card]]s, [[transport list]]s, [[record of death|records of deaths]], questionnaires, [[labour passport]]s, health insurance and social insurance documents. Among the documents are also examples of prominent victims of Nazi persecution, i.e. Anne Frank and Elie Wiesel.

In addition to this there are smaller sections associated with the work of a tracing service: the alphabetical-phonetic Central Name Index, the child search archives and the correspondence files. The Central Name Index represents the key to the documents. With 50 million references on the fate of over 17.5 million people, it is based on an alphabetic-phonetic filing system that was developed especially for ITS.

=== Finding aids ===
Making the inventory researchable for all historical issues is an urgent responsibilities after opening the archives. To date, the arrangement of the documents having been collected over a period of six decades was subject to the requirements of a tracing service, which brought families together and clarified the fates of individuals. The Central Name Index was the key to the documents, while the documents were arranged according to victim groups.

This principle no longer is sufficient, since historians ask not only for names, but also for topics, events, locations or nationalities. The goal is to compile finding aids that can be accessed and published online and are based on international archival standards. The first series of inventories could be published on the Internet (for the time being in the German language only). The documents were indexed according to their origin and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.its-arolsen.org/en/archives/overview-of-the-archival-holdings/finding-aids/ |title=Finding-aids: Inventory of themes |publisher=Its-arolsen.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the volume of the documents to be described, this process will take some years' time.

=== Copies made available ===
The International Commission at its May 2007 meeting approved the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's proposal to permit advance distribution of the material, as it is digitized, to the designated repository institutions prior to the completion of the agreement ratification process officially opening the material. In August 2007, the USHMM received the first installment of records and in November 2007, received the Central Name Index. Materials will continue to be received as they are digitized.&lt;ref name=ITSFAQ&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/its/faq/ International Tracing Service FAQ at USHMM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919153701/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/its/faq/ |date=September 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One institution is designated for each of the 11 countries to receive a copy of the archive. The following locations have been designated by their respective countries.&lt;ref name=ITSFAQ/&gt;
*United States - [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]
*Israel - [[Yad Vashem]]
*Poland - [[Institute of National Remembrance]]
*Luxembourg - Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Resistance
*Belgium - National Archives of Belgium
*France - French National Archives (Archives Nationales)
*United Kingdom - [[Wiener Library|The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust &amp; Genocide]]

=== Specialized other archives ===
Archives on the fate of prisoners of war exist in Geneva at the ICRC, Central Tracing Agency. Inquiries are dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/contact-archives-290506.htm |title=Contacting the ICRC archives: Agency archives/Prisoners of war |publisher=Icrc.org |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other archives deal with missing Germans on occasion of flight and expulsion and with missing German [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers. [[German Red Cross]] searches for German [[Missing person]]s except those who were prosecuted by [[Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drk-suchdienst.de/de/suchanfragen |title=Suchanfragen beim Deutschen Roten Kreuz stellen.

==Controversy==
The ITS had been criticized before 2008 for refusing to open its archives to the public. The ITS, backed by the German government, had cited German archival law to support their position. The laws mandate a 100-year-gap between releasing records in order to protect privacy. However, their critics argued that the ITS as such is not subject to German law. One accusation raised against Germany and the ITS by critics was that the archive was kept closed out of a desire to repress information about the Holocaust.

Critics cited the fact that all eleven governments sitting on the International Commission of the ITS endorsed the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060823165606/http://www.holocaustforum.gov.se/pdfandforms/deklarat..pdf Stockholm International Forum Declaration of January 2000], which included a call for the opening of various Holocaust-era archives. However, since the Declaration was made, there had been little practical change in the operations of the ITS, despite repeated negotiations between the ITS, ICRC, and various Jewish and Holocaust survivor advocacy groups. A critical press release from the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] written in March 2006 charged that "'In practice, however, the ITS and the ICRC have consistently refused to cooperate with the International Commission board and have kept the archive closed.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/press/archives/detail.php?category=07-general&amp;content=2006-03-07 |title=Museum &amp;#124; Press Room &amp;#124; Press Room Archive |publisher=Ushmm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914065108/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/press/archives/detail.php?category=07-general&amp;content=2006-03-07 |archive-date=2013-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2006, several newspaper articles also raised questions about the quality of the ITS' management and the underlying reasons for the existing backlog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/24/AR2006032401684.html |title=A Holocaust Denial |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Loewenberg in Berlin Julian Borger in Washington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/secondworldwar/story/0,,1714413,00.html |title="Closed archive leads to Holocaust denial claim: Special reports", Guardian Unlimited |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/17/AR2006041701369.html |title=Tensions Rise In Long Feud Over Access To Nazi Archive |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the International Commission for the ITS decided to open the archives and documents for researchers use, and to transfer, upon request, one copy of the ITS archives and documents to each one of its member states. This took place once all 11 countries ratified the new ITS Protocol. On November, 28th, 2007 it was announced that Greece, as the last of the member countries, filed its ratification papers with the German Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/28/nazi.archive.ap/index.html Nazi archives finally made public - CNN.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130040110/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/28/nazi.archive.ap/index.html |date=November 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now been announced that the documents in the archive are open to public access.&lt;ref name="its-arolsen.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/press/press_releases/index.html?expand=714&amp;cHash=a7dfe709a7 |title=A new leaf has been turned over at the Tracing Service: Press release (April 30, 2008) |publisher=Its-arolsen.org |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2014-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209192520/http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/press/press_releases/index.html?expand=714&amp;cHash=a7dfe709a7 |archivedate=February 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covert role in Cold War==
[[Associated Press]] (AP) reporters who were given access to ITS files found a carton of documents related to an escapee program run by the Truman Administration.  The AP reporters used these files and declassified US documents to describe how the United States asked the ITS to run background checks on escapees from Eastern Europe.  The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] reviewed their histories and then recruited some of them to return to their countries of origin, to spy for the United States.  The program did not return very much useful intelligence, because these recruits, motivated to impress their handlers,  supplied information that was not reliable, and because by 1952, the Soviets had largely exposed these efforts.  Many recruits disappeared, presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?pnum=1&amp;bfromind=7405&amp;eeid=6295232&amp;_sitecat=1505&amp;dcatid=0&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ac=-2&amp;ck=&amp;ch=ne&amp;rg=blsadstrgt |title=Cold War humanitarian program had covert side, AT&amp;T News, December 28, 2008 |publisher=My.att.net |date=1985-01-01 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of students participated from 2013 to 2014 in the project "DENK MAL – Erinnerung im öffentlichen Raum" at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tz.de/muenchen/stadt/schwabing-west-ort62363/gisela-gymnasium-note-menschlichkeit-4275831.html Note 1 für die Menschlichkeit!] tz.de newsarticle, 28th of October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The students, including the author [[Tariq Abo Gamra]], erected a plaque at the entrance of the school in remembrance of the murdered and prosecuted Jewish students in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.its-arolsen.org/aktuell/news/detailseite/news/detail/News/denk-mal-geschichtsprojekt-von-muenchener-jugendlichen/?expand=8916&amp;cHash=45617db86557a64dc1fdfba6ae2804ea „Denk Mal“: Geschichtsprojekt von Münchener Jugendlichen]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} article of the International Tracing Service, 12th of November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A commemoration ceremony took place on the 10th of November 2014. The project received letters from German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and the German President [[Joachim Gauck]] congratulating them. The project was supported by the International Tracing Service.

'''Jan Marius Romein''' (30 October 1893 &amp;ndash; 16 July 1962) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[history|historian]], [[journalism|journalist]], literary scholar and professor of history at the University of Amsterdam. A [[Marxism|Marxist]] and a student of [[Johan Huizinga|Huizinga]], Romein is remembered for his popularizing books of Dutch national history, jointly authored with his wife [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]].{{r|bwn}} His work has been translated into English, German, French, Italian, Indonesian and Japanese.{{r|bwn}}

==Biography==
Born in [[Rotterdam]], Romein married the writer and historian [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]] (1895–1978) on 14 August 1920.

Romein began writing while studying humanities at the [[University of Leiden]] (1914–1920). Of his professors the historian [[Johan Huizinga]] inspired him the most. During his studies and impressed by the First World War and the [[Russian Revolution]] he became interested in [[Marxism]]. He translated [[Franz Mehring]]'s biography on [[Karl Marx]] into Dutch (1921; with an introductory essay). After a stay of seven months in Denmark, where Romein's friend and former fellow student Hans Kramers had become the assistant of the physicist [[Niels Bohr]], the couple moved to [[Amsterdam]] in 1921. Romein became an editor of the daily ''De Tribune'' of the young [[Communistische Partij Holland]] (CPH, Communist Party of Holland). In addition, he worked as a freelance writer and translator. Already in 1916-1918 he published a Dutch translation of [[Romain Rolland]]'s ''[[Jean Christophe]]'' (10 vols., with an introductory essay). In 1924 he received his doctoral degree, with the highest distinction, at the University of Leiden with the dissertation ''Dostoyevsky in the Eyes of Western Critics''. In 1927 he left the communist party, but he remained interested in Marxism and in the political development of the [[Soviet Union]] and of [[Asia]]. After publishing a book on the history of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (''Byzantium'', 1928) he translated and edited the ''Harmsworth's Universal History of the World'' into Dutch, in co-operation with other historians (1929–1932, 9 vols.), with three added chapters written by himself. His first book publication in the field of Dutch history was a pioneering study on the history of Dutch historical writing during the Middle Ages (1932). His most famous books include a history of ''The Low Countries'' (1934) and a four-volume work with 36 short biographies of important Dutch (1938–1940), both in cooperation with his wife and fellow historian Annie Romein-Verschoor. In 1939, Romein was appointed professor of history at the University of Amsterdam. He survived [[World War II in the Netherlands|World War II]] after being held hostage as a prisoner for three months by the German police in the notorious [[Amersfoort]] police detention camp, and returned to writing and teaching. In 2011 Jan Romein and his wife were posthumously awarded the title "Righteous among the Nations" by [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]], for offering a hiding place to a persecuted Jewish fellow-citizen during the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/pdf/righteous_june_2011.pdf; http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=8712453&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, he published an essay on technology called ''"The [[dialectics of progress]]"'' (in Dutch: ''"De dialectiek van de vooruitgang"'') in which he describes a phenomenon called the ''"[[Law of the handicap of a head start]]"'' (''"Wet van de remmende voorsprong"''), as part of the series ''"The unfinished past"'' (in Dutch: ''"Het onvoltooid verleden"''). This article was also published in German as "Dialektik des Fortschritts" in: ''Mass und Wert. Zweimonatsschrift für freie deutsche Kultur'' (eds. [[Thomas Mann]] and Konrad Falke), vol. 2 (Zurich, Switzerland, 1939).

In 1946, Annie Romein received a copy of [[Anne Frank]]'s diary which she tried to have published. When she was unsuccessful, she gave the diary to her husband, who wrote the first article about the diary and its writer, for the newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]''. Interest raised by his article led to the diary being published the following year. Romein was interested in the (auto)biographical approach to history. During the years of German occupation he wrote a book on this, which was published in 1946 (German translation 1948) and is still regarded as an informative and original contribution to the historiography of the genre.&lt;ref&gt; Rudolf M. Dekker, 'Jacques Presser's Heritage: Egodocuments in the Study of History', in: ''Memoria y Civilización'', vol. 5 (2002), pp. 13–37, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1946, he introduced the theory of history as a subject in the academic curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;See: André C. Otto, ''Het ruisen van de tijd. Over de Theoretische Geschiedenis van Jan Romein'' [The Rustle of Time: on the Theoretical History of Jan Romein]. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Amsterdam. Book edition published by the International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam 1998 (English summary on pp. 279–283).&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after the beginning of the [[Cold War]] his marxist conceptions, though undogmatic, had placed him in relative isolation, and in 1949 he was denied entry to the [[United States]] for an intended speaking engagement at an international scholarly conference in Princeton. Instead, he was welcomed as a guest professor in the young republic of Indonesia during the 1951–1952 academic year. He devoted the latter part of his life to writing a history of [[Europe]] during the 25-year period from 1889 to 1914: ''The Watershed of Two Eras. Europe in 1900'', which was published posthumously in 1967 (English edition 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1980/winter/douglas-marx-huizinga/ See the book review by Allen R. Douglas, 'Marx and Huizinga: Jan Romein As Historian', in: ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'' (VQR, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA., Winter 1980), pp. 152–161.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120212557/http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1980/winter/douglas-marx-huizinga/ |date=2008-11-20 }} Bruce Mazlish, 'The Watershed of Two Eras: Europe in 1900' by Jan Romein. A Book Review, in: ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Winter, 1981), p. 525–528.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attempt at writing "integral history" of the transitional decades from the 19th to the 20th century, during which Europe's supremacy in the world started waning. The book devotes chapters to all aspects of European history during this period: political, economic, social, cultural, scientific, literature, art, emancipation movements etc. Due to a chronic illness, which became manifest in 1959, he limited his professorship at the University of Amsterdam to solely Theoretical History. He died in Amsterdam in 1962.

==Political views==
Romein held Marxist views and was active within the Communist Party of Holland (CPH) from 1917 onwards, initially as a secretary for the communist parliamentarian [[Willem van Ravesteyn]], then as a high-ranking editor of the party's daily ''De Tribune''.{{r|bwn}} When internal struggles led to a Moscow-backed "palace revolution"{{r|bwn}} in 1925, Romein sided with Van Ravesteyn and [[David Wijnkoop]], and as a result was forced out of the ''Tribune'''s editorial board. Expulsion from the party for continued support of Wijnkoop followed in 1927, ending Romein's direct involvement in politics.&lt;ref name="bwsa"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Jan Marius Romein |first=Albert F. |last=Mellink |orig-year=1987 |year=2002 |url=http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/romein |encyclopedia=Biografish Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland |publisher=[[International Institute of Social History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romein's Marxism made him a controversial figure and affected his career when in 1938 he was a candidate for a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|professorship]] at the Municipal University of Amsterdam, where professors were appointed by the municipal council. On the one hand, the [[liberalism|liberals]] and right-wing factions disliked Romein for his continued support of the [[Soviet Union]]; on the other hand, the communist faction headed by Romein's old friend Wijnkoop were upset about his openly criticizing of Soviet [[Moscow Trials|show trials]], two years earlier.{{r|bwn}} This criticism, however, won him some sympathy within [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|SDAP]] faction. A majority that included Wijnkoop's communists voted against Romein's appointment.{{r|bwsa}} A year later, when a different professorship was vacant, Romein was appointed professor of Dutch history, this time with support from Wijnkoop and despite a vehement campaign against his candidature.{{r|bwn}}

In the [[Cold War]] years of the early 1950s, Romein and his collaborators became increasingly isolated. He condemned the Soviet crackdown on the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian uprising]], in a pamphlet that simultaneously denounced the French and British involvement in Egypt during the [[Suez Crisis]].{{r|bwsa}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">[[File:Johann Friedrich Boehmer by Amelie de Barrelier 1845.jpg|thumb|Johann Friedrich Böhmer.]]
'''Johann Friedrich Böhmer''' (22 April 1795{{snd}}22 October 1863) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]].  His historical work was chiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and other imperial documents of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Böhmer, Johann Friedrich|volume=4|pages=136-137}} This work in turn cites:
*[[Johannes Janssen]], ''J. F. Böhmers Leben, Briefe und kleinere Schriften'' (Freiburg, 1868).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Böhmer was born in [[Frankfurt]] as the son of the Palatine official [[Karl Ludwig Böhmer]]. Educated at the universities of [[university of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]], he showed an interest in art and visited [[Italy]]; but returning to Frankfurt he turned his attention to the study of history, and became secretary of the ''Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde''. He was also archivist and then librarian of the city of Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Böhmer had a great dislike of [[Prussia]] and the [[Protestant]] faith, and a corresponding affection for [[Austria]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], to which, however, he did not belong. His critical sense was, perhaps, somewhat warped; but his researches are of great value to students. He died unmarried.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Historical work==
Böhmer's historical work was chiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and other imperial documents of the Middle Ages. First appeared an abstract, the ''Regesta chronologico-diplomatica regum atque imperatorum Romanorum 911-1313'' (Frankfurt, 1831), which was followed by the ''Regesta chronologico-diplomatica Karolorum. Die Urkunden sämtlicher Karolinger in kurzen Auszügen'' (Frankfurt, 1833), and a series of ''Regesta imperii''. For the period 1314-1347 (Frankfurt, 1839) the ''Regesta'' was followed by three, and for the period 1246-1313 (Frankfurt, 1844) by two supplementary volumes. The remaining period of the ''Regesta'', as edited by Böhmer, is 1198-1254 ([[Stuttgart]], 1849). These collections contain introductions and explanatory passages by the author.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Very valuable also is the ''Fontes rerum Germanicarum'' (Stuttgart, 1843–1868), a collection of original authorities for German history during the 13th and 14th centuries. The fourth and last volume of this work was edited by A. Huber after the author's death. Other collections edited by Böhmer are: ''Die Reichsgesetze 900-1400'' (Frankfurt, 1832); ''Wittelsbachische Regesten von der Erwerbung des Herzogtums Bayern bis zu 1340'' (Stuttgart, 1854); and ''Codex diplomaticus Moeno-Francofurtanus''. ''Urkundenbuch der Reichsstadt Frankfurt'' (Frankfurt, 1836; new edition by F Law, 1901).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Other volumes and editions of the ''Regesta imperii'', edited by [[Julius von Ficker]], [[Engelbert Mühlbacher]], [[Eduard Winkelmann]] and others, are largely based on Böhmer's work. Böhmer left a great amount of unpublished material, and after his death two other works were published from his papers: ''Acta imperii selecta'', edited by J. Ficker ([[Innsbruck]], 1870); and ''Regesta archiepiscoporum Maguntinensium'', edited by C Will (Innsbruck, 1877–1886).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''John-Paul Himka''' (born May 18, 1949 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) is an [[Americans|American]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] historian and retired professor of history of the [[University of Alberta]] in [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref name="HimkaCV"&gt;{{cite web|last=Himka|first=John-Paul|format=PDF|url=http://www.historyandclassics.ualberta.ca/People/EmeritiRetired/HimkaJohnPaul/CV.aspx|title=John-Paul Himka: CV|publisher=University of Alberta, Department of History and Classics|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Himka received his BA in Byzantine-Slavonic Studies and Ph.D. in History from [[University of Michigan]] in 1971 and 1977 respectively.&lt;ref name="HimkaCV"/&gt; The title of his Ph.D. dissertation was "Polish and Ukrainian Socialism: Austria, 1867-1890". As a historian Himka was a [[Marxist]] in the 1970s-80s, but became influenced by [[postmodernism]] in the 1990s. In 2012 he defined his methodology in history as "[[Eclecticism|eclectic]]".&lt;ref name="historians.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historians.in.ua/index.php/en/intervyu/205-ivan-pavlo-khymka-ya-perezhyv-bahato-metodolohichnykh-mod |script-title=uk:Інтерв'ю: Іван-Павло Химка: 'Я пережив багато методологічних мод'|trans-title=Interview: John Paul Himka 'I have lived through many methodological trends' |language=uk |publisher=Historians.in.ua |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Himka is of mixed ethnic background, Ukrainian (on father's side) and Italian (on mother's). Initially he wanted to become a Greek Catholic priest and studied at [[St. Basil Seminary in Stamford]], Connecticut. However, due to the radicalization of his political views to the left by the end of the 1960s he did not pursue that vocation.&lt;ref name="historians.in"/&gt;

==Career==

Since 1977, he taught at University of Alberta, Department of History and Classics.&lt;ref&gt;John-Paul Himka, [http://www.historyandclassics.ualberta.ca/~/media/history/People/Himka/HimkaCV2015.pdf Curriculum vitae.] Department of History and Classics, University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt; He became full Professor in 1992 and retired from the university in 2014.&lt;ref name="HimkaCV"/&gt; Himka is the recipient of several awards and fellowships, most notably the Rutherford Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2006, the Philip Lawson Award for Excellence in Teaching,&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/research/competitive-academic-programs/fellows-and-scholars/all-fellows-and-scholars/john-paul-himka-2009 Fellow Professor John-Paul Himka.] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and the J. Gordin Kaplan Award for Research Excellence.&lt;ref name="JPHi"/&gt; He served as co-editor of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' for three volumes devoted to history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciuspress.com/authors/55/john-paul-himka John-Paul Himka] Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Himka, who traveled to Ukraine to conduct research since 1976, began to work with academics at [[Lviv University]]'s Department of History. Initially Himka focused on [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]'s social history in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Janelle_2002_Himka"/&gt; The 1988 [[1000th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus']] kindled his interest in the history of [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]] and the influence of the church in terms of the development of Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="Janelle_2002_Himka"/&gt; In 2002 he researched  [[socialism]] in [[Habsburg]] [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], a formerly autonomous region in Western Ukraine, sacred culture of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavs]] (on [[iconography]] in particular) and the [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|Holocaust in Ukraine]]. Since the late 1990s his contention with what he calls Ukrainian "nationalist historical myths" became subject of increasing, sometimes heated, debates both in Ukraine and [[Ukrainian diaspora|Ukrainian Diaspora]] (especially in North America). Himka challenged the interpretation of [[Holodomor]] as a [[genocide]] and the view that [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalism and nationalists]] played no or almost no role in the [[Holocaust]] in Ukraine. He also opposed official glorification of such nationalistic heroes as [[Roman Shukhevych]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] in Ukraine during presidency of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].&lt;ref name="historians.in"/&gt;

{{quote|The fundamental point of contention between the adherents of the national myth and me is whether or not the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (hereafter OUN) and its armed force, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (hereafter UPA, from its Ukrainian initials) participated in the Holocaust. They deny this entirely. My research indicates, however, as does the research of scholars around the world, that the participation was significant.|John-Paul Himka &lt;ref name="JPHi"&gt;John-Paul Himka, [http://www.viaevrasia.com/documents/celebration_jph_march28.pdf Challenging the Myths of Twentieth-Century Ukrainian History.] Department of History and Classics, University of Alberta, page 3 in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his 1996 article, "Krakivski visti and the Jews, 1943: A Contribution to the History of Ukrainian-Jewish Relations during the Second World War", published in the ''Journal of Ukrainian Studies'', based on earlier Ukrainian-language versions presented in 1991 in Kyiv and 1993 in Jerusalem at Ukrainian-Jewish relations conferences, Himka wrote that the history of Ukrainian-Jewish relations during WWII remained surprisingly under investigated. Himka cited the Raul Hinberg's "monumental study", ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' as the source used by historians.&lt;ref name="Hinberg_TheDestruction_1961"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Destruction of the European Jews]] |orig-year=1961 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=2003 |first=Raul |last=Hinberg |pages=1,388 |isbn=0300095929}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this lacuna, Himka presented his detailed study of the publishing of a series of antisemitic articles in 1943 in the "flagship of Ukrainian journalism under Nazi occupation," Krakov's daily newspaper, the ''[[Krakivs'ki Visti]]''.&lt;ref name="Himka_1996_Krakivski_visti"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Krakivski visti and the Jews, 1943: A Contribution to the History of Ukrainian-Jewish Relations during the Second World War |first=John-Paul |last=Himka |journal=Journal of Ukrainian Studies |volume=21 |date=Summer–Winter 1996 |pages=81–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} The primary sources for his study included the articles as well as the records of the ''Krakivs'ki Visti'' maintained by [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian-Canadian]], Michael Chomiak, who was born in the Ukraine in the 1910s as Mykhailo Khomiak and changed his name to Michael Chomiak when he emigrated to Canada at the end of WWII. The Provincial Archives of Alberta acquired Chomiak's records in 1985 following Chomiak's death. He was the chief editor of ''Krakivs'ki Visti'' from 1940 to 1945. Himka is his son-in-law.&lt;ref name="Himka_1996_Krakivski_visti"/&gt;{{rp|82}} Himka described how ''Krakivs'ki Visti'' "played an important and, generally, positive role in Ukrainian life,"&lt;ref name="Himka_1996_Krakivski_visti"/&gt;{{rp|83}} "serving as a buffer between the German occupation authorities and the population of the  [[General Government|Generalgouvernement]]."&lt;ref name="Himka_1996_Krakivski_visti"/&gt;{{rp|84}} In response to a May 1943 order by the German press chief, the newspaper published antisemitic articles from May 25 through July&lt;ref name="Himka_1996_Krakivski_visti"/&gt;{{rp|85}} which were received negatively by the Ukrainian intelligentsia in general.&lt;ref name="Himka_1996_Krakivski_visti"/&gt;{{rp|95}}

Himka completed a series of three major studies on the history of Ukrainian Galicia in the 19th century. The first, ''Socialism in Galicia: the emergence of Polish social democracy and Ukrainian radicalism (1860-1890)'' was published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Socialism in Galicia: the emergence of Polish social democracy and Ukrainian radicalism (1860-1890) |first=John-Paul |last=Himka |publisher=Harvard University Press for |agency=Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute |year=1983 |pages=244 |isbn=0-916458-07-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John-Paul |last=Himka |title=Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin’s Press|year= 1988 |isbn=0920862543}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1988. The third, ''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine: The Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian National Movement in Galicia, 1867-1900'', which is "devoted to the interrelations between church and state", was published in 1999.&lt;ref name="Himka_1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine: The Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian National Movement in Galicia, 1867-1900 |year=1999 |location=Montreal and Kingston |publisher=McGill/Queen’s University Press |pages=236 |first=John-Paul |last=Himka|isbn= 978-0-7735-1812-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book review in the ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'', Larry Wolff described ''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine'' subtle, sophisticated and insightful account of an "important and profoundly complex historical problem." Wolff writes that Himka's research "makes the case for a contingent and evolutionary perspective on nationality in which several different forms and inflections of national identity jostle one another in cultural competition, enhanced or diminished by various historical forces, including religion, without any predetermined outcome. "engaged with the all-important issue of national identity, makes a brilliant contribution, not just to the history of Ukrainian nationality, but also to the general theoretical understanding of modern nationalism."&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Larry |last=Wolff |title=Review of |journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies |volume=XXI |number=3-4 |pages=475 |date=December 1997 |jstor=41036711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Serhii |last=Plokhy |title=Review: Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine.

His 2009 book,  ''Last Judgment Iconography in the Carpathians'', was the result of ten years of research "throughout the region of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where he "found a distinctive and transnational blending of Gothic, Byzantine, and Novgorodian art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Scholarly Publishing |pages=328 |year=2009 |first=John-Paul |last=Himka |isbn=0802098096 |title=Last Judgment Iconography in the Carpathians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Japan|Shoso-in.jpg| Image explanation = [[Shōsōin]]}}

{{nihongo|'''Jōji'''|貞治|}} was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) of the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Court]] during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Kōan (Muromachi period)|''Kōan'']] and before [[Oan|''Ōan'']]. This period spanned the years from September 1362 through February 1368.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 430; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor in Kyoto was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Kōgon]]|後光厳天皇|''Go-Kōgon-tennō''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP302&amp;dq= ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 302-308;] Nussbaum, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Go-Kōgon's [[Southern Court]] rival in Yoshino during this time-frame was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Murakami]]|後村上天皇|''Go-Murakami-tennō''}}.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[File:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]   
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Re4djF3oaTMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA199&amp;dq=1911+texbook+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology'', p. 199 n57], citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1362''', also called {{nihongo|''Jōji gannen''|貞治元年}}: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Kōan'' 2.

In this time frame, [[Shōhei]] (1346–1370) was a Southern Court equivalent ''nengō,''

==Events of the Jōji era ==

{{Nihongo|'''Keiun'''|慶雲}}, also known as '''Kyōun''', was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} following ''[[Taihō (era)|Taihō]]'' and preceding ''[[Wadō (era)|Wadō]]''. The period spanned the years from May 704 through January 708.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Keiun''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 506|page=506}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperors were {{nihongo|[[Emperor Monmu|Monmu]]''-tennō''|文武天皇|}} and {{nihongo|[[Empress Genmei|Genmei]]''-tennō''|元明天皇|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac.

''Gukanshō'', pp. 270–271; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki''. pp. 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''704''' {{nihongo|''Keiun gannen''|慶雲元年}}: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events.  The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Taihō'' 4, on the 7th day of the 5th month of 704.&lt;ref name="b271"&gt;Brown, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the ''Keiun'' era==
* '''697''' (''Keiun 4''): Emperor Monmu dies, but his son and heir was deemed too young to receive the succession (''senso''). Instead, the mother of the heir formally accedes to the throne (''sokui'') as Empress Gemmei until her son would grow mature enough to accept ''senso'' and ''sokui''.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]],  [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''July 18, 707''' (''Keiun 4, 15th day of the 6th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 慶雲四年六月十五日  --&gt;: Genmei is enthroned at the age of 48.&lt;ref name="b271"/&gt;
* '''707''' (''Keiun 4''): Deposits of copper was reported to have been found in [[Musashi Province]] in the region which includes modern day Tokyo.&lt;ref name="t63"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA63,M1  p. 63.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''708''' (''Keiun 5''):, The era name was about to be changed to mark the accession of Empress Genmei; but the choice of ''Wadō'' as the new ''[[nengō]]'' for this new reign became a way to mark the welcome discovery of copper in the [[Chichibu District, Saitama|Chichibu District]] of what is now [[Saitama Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="t63"/&gt;  The Japanese word for copper is ''dō'' (銅); and since this was indigenous copper, the ''"wa"'' (the ancient Chinese term for Japan) could be combined with the ''"dō"'' (copper) to create a new composite term—''"wadō"''—meaning "Japanese copper."

Though autonomous in nature, the IEG has close connections to the [[University of Mainz|Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Partner Institutions|url=http://www.historische.kulturwissenschaften.uni-mainz.de/eng/986.php|website=University of Mainz|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Partner Institutions|url=http://www.ieg-mainz.de/forschung/kooperationen|website=IEG|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it joined the [[Leibniz Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leibniz Institute of European History|url=http://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/institute-museen/einrichtungen/ieg/|website=Leibniz Association|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Institute ==
[[Image:Domus Universitatis Mainz.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Institute of European History]]
Founded in 1950 on the initiative of Raymond Schmittlein, the head of the Direction Générale des Affaires Culturelles of the French military government, the new institution had the aim of helping to overcome the longstanding nationalist and confessional divides between the European states and their populations through “non-prejudiced” historical research and, in so doing, to support Franco-German reconciliation in particular. Specifically, it was intended that research conducted at the Institute would assist a revision (“detoxification”) of the history (text)books, and eventually enable the establishment of a “European history book”.

This idea had surfaced in the late-1940s during dialogues between German and French historians in Speyer, which Schmittlein had set up in 1948/49. It became mixed with concepts of a Christian, “Occidental” history which were prevalent among a group of German historians, which included the medieval historian Fritz Kern (1884–1950) based in Bonn. He had headed the German delegation in 1948. The Catholic theologian and church historian [[Joseph Lortz]] (1887–1975) had also participated in these dialogues.

The first plans for the foundation of an “Institute for cultural and religious history” were drafted by Kern, who – as the first director of the Institute – in addition to the didactic goal also wanted to realize a multi-volume history of the world (“Historia Mundi”) that would be based on religion and would adopt a universal-historical perspective. Lortz served as an additional founding director. In 1950, he took up an extraordinary professorship for western religious history which was created especially for him in the philosophical faculty of Mainz University. These founding aims and history explain the structure of the research institute that was established in 1950 under the title “Institut für Europäische Geschichte” (IEG) (its charter came into effect on 19 April 1951), with its department of “Western Religious History” (Abteilung fuer Abendlaendische Religionsgeschichte) and its department of “Universal History” (Abteilung fuer Universalgeschichte). Both departments were headed up by a director, as they still are (currently [[Irene Dingel]] and [[Johannes Paulmann]]). Today, the directors also hold professorships at [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz|Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]].

== Function and Research Areas ==
The IEG's research on the historical foundations of Europe considers both integrating and antagonistic movements and forces shaping the [[geography|geographic]] continent as well as the cultural context of Europe over [[century|centuries]] and setting up its distinct characteristics in contrast to the other continents. Research at the IEG thus targets pan-European and partly European communicative connections originating in [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] transfer processes. Their [[protagonist]]s did not necessarily have to be aware of their taking part in "Europe-wide" interrelations. The religious and confessional developments of these transfer processes are one important focus of [[research]] at the IEG.

Also, research on the foundations of Europe maps the history of [[Conscience|conscious]] reflections on Europe and Europeans, and [[Analysis|analyses]] attempts at political unification, existing political plans for Europe, ideal conceptions and [[utopia]]n visions of Europe – always including anti-European ideas in the picture. An integral element of this approach is the history of [[historiography]] on Europe.

This [[concept]]ual [[formulation]] includes a reflexion of [[theory]] and methods of historical research on Europe. The Leibniz Institute of European History questions the focus of interest of 'European' approaches and reflects the underlying ideological propositions in [[Historical Research|historical research]] on the history of Europe.

The Institute’s charter defines the primary goals of the IEG as follows: "Research on the religious and intellectual traditions of Europe, their development and crises, and particularly on religious differences, their effects and the possibilities of overcoming these differences", and "Europe-focused fundamental research which assists the historical understanding of the process of the coalescence of Europe and the individual historical paths of the European states and peoples".
In accordance with its charter, IEG pursues these goals through:
* its own research projects conducted by staff members individually or jointly with other academics from Germany and abroad
* the funding it provides to young postgraduate researchers from Europe and the other continents, who work on research projects on European history and who live at the Institute as fellows and scholarship holders
* collaboration with other institutions in Germany and abroad that pursue similar aims
* its own publications and the support it provides to other publications, in which contentious aspects of research on European history are discussed
* the transfer of knowledge to the wider society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aims of the Leibniz Institute of European History|url=http://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/institute/aims/|website=Leibniz Institute of European History|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Research Programme ==
The Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) researches the historical foundations of Europe in the modern era. Its research projects are developed in an interdisciplinary way by the sections "Abendländische Religionsgeschichte" and "Universalgeschichte". They span the historical periods from the beginning of the early modern period to contemporary history.
The central theme of the current research programme at the IEG is "negotiating difference" – the ways in which difference is established, confronted and enabled in its religious, cultural, political and social dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Programme of the Leibniz Institute of European History|url=http://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/research/research-program/|website=Leibniz Institute of European History|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz|Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]], the IEG runs the graduate project "The Christian Churches and the Challenge of 'Europe'”, which is part-funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – DFG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding details by the DFG|url=http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/list/projectdetails/index.jsp?id=91768529/|website=Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Fellowship Programme ==
Since 1950, the IEG has awarded [[Postdoctoral research|doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships]] for research stays in [[Mainz]]. It also welcomes international researchers as fellows in residence with external funding. The IEG states that its research fellowship programme combines research, [[training]] and international [[Business networking|networking]]. Fellows can pursue their individual research projects. They discuss problems and methods of European historical research in an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and international surrounding. According to their special fields and [[interest]]s, they are invited to participate in the [[Academy|academic]] activities of the Institute. In cooperation with its international partners, the Institute supports the exchange of fellows to embed them in a network of European historical research.

The Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) awards research scholarships and fellowships to young academics (doctoral and postdoctoral researchers) from Germany and abroad. Funding is provided for both doctoral and postdoctoral research dealing with the religious, political, social and cultural history of Europe from the early modern period to 1989/90. Comparative, transnational and transfer-historical research projects are particularly welcome, as are projects which deal with topics of intellectual, church or theological history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Fellowship Programme of the Leibniz Institute of European History|url=http://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/fellowships/funding/fellowship_programme/|website=Leibniz Institute of European History|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, the IEG established the Senior Research Fellowship Programme for established researchers. It enables the directors to invite respected academics from other European countries and outside Europe to Mainz to pursue their own research and to exchange ideas with the academics working at the IEG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Research Fellowship Programme of the Leibniz Institute of European History|url=http://www.ieg-mainz.de/studentships/promotion/senior-research-fellowship-programme/|website=Leibniz Institute of European History|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For decades, the IEG has been receiving other scholarship holders and fellows funded by organizations abroad and in Germany (for example, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the DAAD) as visiting academics. Additionally, the Institute participates in the Leibniz-DAAD Research Fellowship Programme. These visiting researchers, who are usually young academics, usually stay at the Institute where they become part of the international community of IEG fellows and scholarship holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Fellows at the Leibniz Institute of European History|url=http://www.ieg-mainz.de/studentships/promotion/visiting-fellows/|website=Leibniz Institute of European History|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Humanities and Open Access==
The IEG works to promote innovative Open Access publications, the use of digital tools in historical research, and the expansion of digital research infrastructures. Far beyond the confines of academia, there exists a wide interest in research findings and resources published in Open Access – for instance, the wide range of digitized historical maps or [[European History Online|European History Online (EGO)]], published in German and English, which provides an overview of 500 years of modern European history across boundaries of geography, discipline, and methodology. Core questions of European history are also addressed in the Jahrbuch für Europäische Geschichte/European History Yearbook, which has been published in an Open Access format since 2014 and contains articles in English and German. 

Another Open Access publication, "On site, in time - Negotiating differences in Europe", looks at events that took place in European locations and cast new light on the historical development of Europe since 1500. Approximately 60 articles illustrate the manifold conflict-laden approaches to difference and inequality have been.

The Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG) is part of the new [[mainzed | Mainz Centre for Digitality in the Humanities and Cultural Studies (mainzed)]]. mainzed is a joint initiative of six scientific institutions to promote digital methodology in the humanities and cultural sciences in Mainz, Germany.

==Library==
The library offers approximately 90,000 printed titles and 900,000 licensed online resources on the history of Europe from the mid-15th century. There is an emphasis on general European history and international history, as well as on church history and the history of theology since the period of Humanism and the Reformation.

The library holds numerous international learned journals and periodicals, with more than 500 running subscriptions (see the Overview of Journals ZDB). Additionally, a large number of both special and general bibliographical aids are available. The library’s entire collection is contained in the Institute’s Online Catalogue (OPAC). The catalogue also contains the new acquisitions of the current year and a large array of online resources and databases funded by the German Research Foundation. In the context of the HeBIS union of libraries, the Institute’s library is part of the local library system (Lokales Bibliothekssystem – LBS) of Rhine-Hesse (organization and technical support is provided by Mainz University Library).

==Publications==
The IEG edits a monograph serial and a serial for conference reports, the latter being published online or in print. It runs a server for historical digital maps (IEG-MAPS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieg-maps.uni-mainz.de Server for historical digital maps]&lt;/ref&gt;) and publishes European peace treaties of the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieg-friedensvertraege.de European peace treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Majiabang culture''' was a [[China|Chinese]] [[Neolithic]] culture that existed at the mouth of the [[Yangtze River]], primarily around [[Lake Tai]] near [[Shanghai]] and north of [[Hangzhou Bay]]. The culture spread throughout southern [[Jiangsu]] and northern [[Zhejiang]] from around 5000 BC to 3300 BC.{{sfnp|Wang|2001|p=207}}  The later part of the period is now considered a separate cultural phase, referred to as the [[Songze culture]].{{sfnp|Wang|2001|p=206}}

Initially, archaeologists had considered the Majiabang sites and sites in northern Jiangsu to be part of the same culture, naming it the {{Interlanguage link multi|Qingliangang culture|zh|3=青莲岗文化}}. Archaeologists later realized that the northern Jiangsu sites were of the [[Dawenkou culture]] and renamed the southern Jiangsu sites Majiabang culture. Some scholars state that the Hemudu culture co-existed with the Majiabang culture as two separate and distinct cultures, with cultural transmissions between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Other scholars group Hemudu in with [[Majiabang]] subtraditions.{{sfnp|Wang|2001|p=209}}

Majiabang people cultivated rice. At Caoxieshan and Chuodun, sites of the Majiabang culture, archaeologists excavated [[paddy fields]], indicating the centrality of rice to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, H. (ed.). ''Search for the Origin of Rice Cultivation: The Ancient Rice Cultivation in Paddy Fields at the Cao Xie Shan Site in China''. Miyazaki: Society for Scientific Studies on Cultural Property, 1996.

World Archaeology 41(1): 88-111&lt;/ref&gt; In addition [[fauna]]l remains excavated from Majiabang archaeological sites indicated that people had domesticated pigs. However, the remains of [[Sika deer|sika]] and [[Siberian roe deer|roe deer]] have been found, showing that people were not totally reliant on agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;Tsude, Hiroshi. Yayoi Farmers Reconsidered: New Perspectives on Agricultural Development in East Asia. ''Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association'' 21(5):53-59, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological sites also bear evidence that Majiabang people produced [[jade]] ornaments.

In the lower stratum of the Songze excavation site in Shanghai's modern day [[Qingpu District, Shanghai|Qingpu District]], archaeologists found the prone skeleton of one of the area's earliest inhabitants{{mdash}}a 25-30-year-old male with an almost complete skull dated to the Majiabang era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.shqp.gov.cn/gb/content/2009-03/03/content_238558.htm|title=The Shanghainese of 6000 Years Ago - the Majiabang Culture|publisher=Shanghai Qingpu Museum|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mourning''' is, in the simplest sense, [[grief]] over someone's [[death]]. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. [[Customs]] vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant.

Wearing black clothes is one practice followed in many countries, though other forms of dress are seen. Those most affected by the loss of a loved one often observe a period of grieving, marked by withdrawal from [[social event]]s and quiet, respectful behavior. People may follow [[religious traditions]] for such occasions.

Mourning may apply to the death of, or anniversary of the death of, an important individual like a local [[leader]], [[monarch]], religious figure,family etc. State mourning may occur on such an occasion. In recent years, some traditions have given way to less strict practices, though many customs and traditions continue to be followed.

==Steps==

[[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] has developed a well known model, not yet scientifically proven, the subject of many highly contested transpositions and adaptations.  It is a theoretical cycle consisting of five steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|title= Milestones |date=Aug 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Shock, denial'': This short phase of mourning occurs when one finds out the loss. The person refuses to believe it. This is a more or less intense period where emotions seem virtually absent. The affected person can faint and may even vomit without being conscious. After this short stage of mourning the reality of loss sets in.
# ''Anger'': This phase is characterized by a sense of outrage due to the loss. Guilt can be installed in some cases. Questioning period.
# ''Bargaining'': Phase of internal bargaining and negotiation.
# ''Depression'': A more or less long phase of the mourning process which is characterized by great sadness, questioning, and distress. Mourners in this phase sometimes feel that they will never complete their mourning. They have experienced a wide range of emotions and their sorrow is great.
# ''Acceptance'': Last stage of mourning where the bereaved gets better. The reality of the loss is much more understood and accepted. The bereaved can still feel sadness, but has regained full functioning and has also reorganized life adjusting to the loss.

The above five phases can be linear but often a mourner can flip back before starting to move forward. A good way to pass through grief is to understand what has happened and share the feelings and emotions with relatives or people who also are grieving. These steps do not necessarily follow each other. It is not an inevitable process.

Mourning is a personal and collective response which can vary depending on feelings and contexts. It starts with denial and ends with acceptance.

Grief can be defined as the period following the death of someone close. This is both psychological and social:

* '''psychological''': when someone close dies, they enter a period of sorrow and questioning, or even nervous breakdown. There are three stages in the grieving process:
*# the ''denial or stunning'' phase, during which the death of the loved one is not yet integrated. It lasts a relatively short time.
*# the second phase is that of ''depression'' with physical pain (loss of sleep and appetite, lump in throat, body aches etc.), and mental pain (lack of concentration, loss of self-confidence). The duration of this phase varies.
*# ''restructuring'' phase during which we try to regain a taste for life.
* '''social''':
*# the feelings and mental state of the mourner affect the ability to maintain or enter into relations with others (including in the field of sex), on the other hand in mourning new expectations develop and attention, caring, calm, isolation, or distraction may be needed.
*# after the burial customs, which are often abandoned in highly urbanized areas, many cultures follow a number of traditions (wearing specific clothes, forbidden to remarry for a while in case of widowhood ...) determined generally by the degree of kinship and social importance of the deceased.
Death can be a release in the case of a tyrannical person or when death terminates a long, painful illness. However, this release may add remorse and guilt for the mourner.

====Ethiopia ====
In [[Ethiopia]], an ''Edir'' (var. ''eddir'', ''idir'') is a traditional community organization whose members assist each other during the mourning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wokineh Kelbessa &lt;!-- see [[Habesha name]] --&gt;| title=Traditional Oromo Attitudes towards the Environment: An Argument for Environmentally Sound Development|journal=Social Science Research Report Series|issue=19|year=2001|url=http://www.publications.ossrea.net/images/stories/ossrea/ssrr-19-p-9.pdf | page=89 | format=PDF | accessdate={{Date|2014-02-04}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comboni"&gt;{{Cite web | authors=Mark and Maggie Banga | title=Mourning and healing | url=http://www.laymission-comboni.org/post-2/ | publisher=Comboni Lay Missionaries | date={{Date|2012|03|02}} | accessdate={{Date|2015|06|01}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members make monthly financial contributions forming the Edir's fund. They are entitled to receive a certain sum of money from this fund to help cover funeral and other expenses associated with deaths.&lt;ref name="comboni" /&gt; Additionally, Edir members comfort the mourners: female members take turns doing housework, such as preparing food for the mourning family, while male members usually take the responsibility to arrange the funeral and erect a temporary tent to shelter guests who come to visit the mourning family.&lt;ref name="comboni" /&gt; Edir members are required to stay with the mourning family and comfort them for three full days.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

White is the [[color in Chinese culture|traditional color]] of mourning in [[Chinese culture]], with white clothes and hats formerly having been associated with death.&lt;ref name="provideocoalition.com"&gt;[http://provideocoalition.com/shullfish/story/psychology_of_color Psychology of Color: Does a specific color indicate a specific emotion? By Steve Hullfish | July 19, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[imperial China]], [[Confucianism|Confucian]] mourning obligations required even the [[emperor of China|emperor]] to retire from public affairs upon the death of a parent. The traditional period of mourning was nominally 3 years, but usually 25–27 [[Chinese calendar|lunar month]]s in practice and even shorter in the case of necessary officers. (The emperor, for example, typically remained in seclusion only 27 days.)

[[File:JapaneseFuneralArrangementTokyo.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese people|Japanese]] funeral arrangement.]]

The Japanese term for mourning dress is ''mofuku'' (喪服). The term refers to either primarily black Western-style formal wear or to black traditional [[Japanese clothing]] worn at [[Japanese funeral|funerals]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] memorial services. Other colors, particularly reds and bright shades, are considered inappropriate for mourning dress. If wearing Western clothes, women may wear a single strand of white [[pearl]]s. Japanese-style mourning dress for women consists of a five-[[Mon (emblem)|crested]] plain black silk [[kimono]], black [[Obi (sash)|obi]] and black accessories worn over white undergarments, black [[zori|sandals]] and white [[tabi|split-toe socks]]. Men's mourning dress consists of clothing worn on extremely formal occasions: a plain black silk five-crested kimono and black and white or gray and white striped [[hakama]] trousers over white undergarments, black crested [[haori]] jacket with a white closure, white or black zori and white tabi. It is customary for Japanese-style mourning dress to be worn only by the immediate family and very close friends of the deceased; other attendees wear Western-style mourning dress or subdued Western or Japanese formal clothes.

In [[Thailand]] people will wear black when attending a funeral. Black is considered the mourning color, although historically it was white. Widows may wear purple when mourning the death of their spouse.&lt;ref name="mysendoff"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knos|first1=T.|title=Colors of Mourning|url=https://mysendoff.com/2011/08/colors-of-mourning/|website=mysendoff.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Filipino practices for mourning have influences from [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and folk [[Catholic]] beliefs. People may wear white or black. The color red is frowned upon in the time of mourning, it is believed that those who wear red within 9–40 days will die or suffer illness. The consumption of chicken during the wake and funeral is believed to bring death among the relatives. There is an initial nine-day mourning practice called ''Pasiyam'', a [[novena]] is to be prayed by those who are mourning. During those days the spirit of the deceased is believed to be roaming. 40 days is a Catholic practice of commemorating the dead after 40 days from their death date. A Mass and a small feast are held to commemorate the dead during the 40-day period, the 40th day as their judgment day. The immediate family wear black. When the one-year period is over, the first death anniversary will signal the end of mourning celebrated by a feast.

====West Asia====
In the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] tradition, just after a person passes way, the mourning family host guests in an open house style. Only [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] coffee and tea are served, showcasing the sorrowful state of the family. On the funeral day, a memorial mass is held in the church. At the graveyard, the people gather and burn [[incense]] around the grave as [[clergy]] chant [[hymn]]s in the [[Syriac language]]. The closest female relatives traditionally bewail or [[lament]] in a public display of grief, as the casket descends. A few others may sing a [[dirge]] or a sentimental [[threnody]]. During all these occasions, everyone is expected to dress in complete black. Following the burial, everyone would return to the church hall for afternoon lunch and [[eulogy]]. At the hall, the closest relatives sit on a long table facing the guests (akin to a bridegroom’s table at a wedding) as many people walk by before leaving shaking hands, offering their condolences. On the third day, mourners would customarily visit the grave site with a [[pastor]] to burn incense, symbolising Jesus’ triumph over death on the third day, and 40 days after the funeral (representing Jesus ascending to heaven), and in conclusion one year to the date. Mourners also wear only black until the 40 day mark and would typically not dance or celebrate any major events for one year.&lt;ref&gt;Troop, Sarah. “The Hungry Mourner.” Modern Loss, 22 Jul 2014.

The custom of wearing unadorned black clothing for mourning dates back at least to the [[Roman Empire]], when the ''toga pulla'', made of dark-colored wool, was worn during mourning.

Through the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], distinctive mourning was worn for general as well as personal loss; after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of [[Huguenot]]s in [[France]], [[Elizabeth I of England]] and her court are said to have dressed in full mourning to receive the French Ambassador.

Women in mourning and widows wore distinctive black [[Widow's cap|caps]] and veils, generally in a conservative version of the current fashion.

In areas of Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Mexico, Portugal, and Spain, widows wear black for the rest of their lives. The immediate family members of the deceased wear black for an extended time. Since the 1870s, mourning practices for some cultures, even those who have emigrated to the United States, are to wear black for at least two years, though lifelong black for widows remains in Europe.

In Belgium the Court went in public mourning after publication in the [[Moniteur Belge]]. In 1924 the court went in mourning after the death of   [[Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg]], (10 days); The duke of Montpensier ( 5 days) and a full month for the death of [[Princess Louise of Belgium]].

[[File:Victorian mourning garb.jpg|Advertisement for Victorian mourning garb|left|thumb]]

The color of deepest mourning among [[Middle Ages|medieval]] European queens was white. In 1393, Parisians were treated to the unusual spectacle of a royal funeral carried out in white, for [[Leo V, King of Armenia]], who died in exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919, 1924:41).&lt;/ref&gt; This royal tradition survived in Spain until the end of the 15th century. In 1934, Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] reintroduced white mourning after the death of her husband [[Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Prince Henry]]. It has remained a tradition in the Dutch royal family. [[File:Koningin Wilhelmina najaar 1934.jpg|thumb|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wearing white mourning after the death of husband in 1934.]] In 2004, the four daughters of Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] all wore white to their mother's funeral. In 1993, the Spanish-born [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium|Queen Fabiola]] introduced it in Belgium for the funeral of her husband, King [[Baudouin of Belgium]]. The custom for the Queens of France to wear {{lang|fr|deuil blanc}} [white mourning] was the origin of the White Wardrobe created in 1938 by [[Norman Hartnell]] for [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] (later called Queen Mother).

Today, no special dress or behaviour is obligatory for those in mourning in the general population, although ethnic and religious faiths have specific rituals, and black is typically worn at funerals. Traditionally, however, there were strict social rules to be observed.

=====Georgian and Victorian Eras=====
[[File:Ragamuffins.JPG|thumb|Poor orphans depicted wearing a makeshift black armband to mourn for their mother ([[work (painting)|Work]] by [[Ford Madox Brown|F.M. Brown]]), 1865]]

By the 19th century, mourning behaviour in [[England]] had developed into a complex set of rules, particularly among the upper [[social class|classes]]. For women, the customs involved wearing heavy, concealing, [[black]] clothing, and the use of heavy [[veil]]s of black [[crêpe (textile)|crêpe]]. The entire ensemble was colloquially known as "widow's weeds" (from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|waed}}, meaning "garment").

Special [[Widow's Cap|caps]] and bonnets, usually in black or other dark colours, went with these ensembles. There was mourning [[jewellery]], often made of [[jet (lignite)|jet]]. Jewellery was also occasionally made from the hair of the deceased. The wealthy would wear [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] or [[locket]]s designed to hold a lock of the deceased's hair or some similar [[relic]].

Widows were expected to wear special clothes to indicate that they were in mourning for up to four years after the death, although a widow could choose to wear such attire for the rest of her life. To change the costume earlier was considered disrespectful to the deceased and, if the widow was still young and attractive, suggestive of potential sexual promiscuity. Those subject to the rules were slowly allowed to re-introduce conventional clothing at specific times; such stages were known by such terms as "full mourning", "half mourning", and similar descriptions. For half mourning, muted colours such as [[lilac (color)|lilac]], [[grey]] and [[lavender (color)|lavender]] could be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=English Funeral and mourning clothing |url=http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-funeral-clothing.html |website=England: The Other Within: Analysing the English Collections at the Pitt Rivers Museum |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |accessdate=2015-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Princess Beatrice mourning.jpg|left|thumb|The five daughters of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] wore black dresses and posed for a portrait with his statue following his death in 1861.]]
Friends, acquaintances, and employees wore mourning to a greater or lesser degree depending on their relationship to the deceased. Mourning was worn for six months for a sibling. Parents would wear mourning for a child for "as long as they feel so disposed". A widow was supposed to wear mourning for two years and was not supposed to enter society for twelve months. No lady or gentleman in mourning was supposed to attend social events while in deep mourning. In general, [[servant (domestic)|servants]] wore black armbands when there had been a death in the household. However, amongst polite company the wearing of a simple black armband was seen as appropriate only for military men, or others compelled to wear uniform in the course of their duties—a black arm band instead of proper mourning clothes was seen as a degradation of proper etiquette and to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;''The Universal Cyclopædia'', W. Ralston Balch, Griffith Farran Okeden &amp; Welsh, London, {{circa|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, men were expected to wear mourning suits (not to be confused with [[tailcoat|morning suits]]) of black [[frock coat]]s with matching [[trousers]] and [[waistcoat]]s. In the later [[interbellum]] period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], as the frock coat became increasingly rare, the mourning suit consisted of a black morning coat with black trousers and waistcoat, essentially a black version of the morning suit worn to weddings and other occasions, which would normally include coloured waistcoats and striped or checked trousers.

Formal mourning culminated during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], whose long and conspicuous grief over the death of her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], may have had much to do with it. Although fashions began to be more functional and less restrictive for the succeeding [[Edwardian era|Edwardians]], appropriate dress for men and women—including that for the period of mourning—was still strictly prescribed and rigidly adhered to.

[[File:The Hessian children with their grandmother, Queen Victoria.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Victoria]] with the five surviving children of her daughter, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]], dressed in mourning clothing for their mother and their sister [[Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (1874–1878)|Princess Marie]] in early 1879.]]

The rules were gradually relaxed, and it became acceptable practise for both sexes to dress in dark colours for up to a year after a death in the family. By the late 20th century, this no longer applied, and black had been widely adopted by women in cities as a fashionable colour.

Mourning generally followed [[#United Kingdom|English forms]] into the 20th century. Black dress is still considered proper etiquette for attendance at funerals, but extended periods of wearing black dress is no longer expected. However, attendance at social functions such as weddings when a family is in deep mourning is frowned upon. Men who share their father's given name and use a suffix such as "Junior" retain the suffix at least until the father's funeral is complete.

In the antebellum South, with social mores that imitated those of England, mourning was just as strictly observed by the upper classes.

In the 19th century, mourning could be quite expensive, as it required a whole new set of clothes and accessories or, at the very least, overdying existing garments and taking them out of daily use. For a poorer family, this was a strain on the resources.&lt;ref&gt;See Taylor, Jupp and Litten.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] explains to [[Glinda]] that she must return home because her aunt and uncle cannot afford to go into mourning for her because it was too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=L.

====Tonga====
{{Main|Tongan funerals}}
In [[Tonga]], family members of deceased persons wear black for an extended time, with large plain [[Taʻovala]]. Often, black [[bunting (textile)|bunting]] is hung from homes and buildings. In the case of the death of royalty, the entire country adopts mourning dress and black and purple [[bunting (textile)|bunting]] is displayed from most buildings.

==State and official mourning==
{{Main|National day of mourning}}
[[File:George W. Bush John Paul II funeral.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Paola of Belgium]] in "grand deuil"]]

'''State mourning''' or, in the case of a [[monarchy]], court mourning refers to displays of mourning behavior on the death of a public figure or member of a royal family.

The degree and duration of public mourning is generally decreed by a protocol officer. It was not unusual for the British court to declare that all citizens should wear full mourning for a specified period after the death of the [[monarch]] or that the members of the court should wear full- or half-mourning for an extended time. On the death of [[Queen Victoria]] (January 22, 1901), the ''[[Canada Gazette]]'' published an "extra" edition announcing that court mourning would continue until January 24, 1902. It directed the public to wear deep mourning until March 6, 1901 and half-mourning until April 17, 1901.

The black-and-white costumes designed by [[Cecil Beaton]] for the [[Royal Ascot]] sequence in ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' were inspired by the "Black Ascot" of 1910, when the court was in mourning for Victoria's son, [[Edward VII]].

[[File:Half mast Bangkok School 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Thailand]] national flag flown at half mast at a high school in Bangkok during the '''state mourning''' of the [[King Bhumibol]]]]

All over the world, states usually declare a period of 'official mourning' after the death of a [[Head of State]]. The signs may vary but usually include the lowering or posting [[half-mast]] of flags on public buildings. (In contrast, the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]] is not flown at half-mast, because there is [[Demise of the Crown|always a monarch on the throne]].)

In January 2006, on the death of [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]], the [[Emir of Kuwait]], a mourning period of 40 days was declared. In [[Tonga]], the official mourning lasts for a year; only afterwards is the royal heir crowned the new king.

On the other hand, the principle of continuity of the State must be respected. The principle is reflected in the French saying "''Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi!''" [The king is dead, long live the king!]. Regardless of the formalities of mourning, power must be handed on; if the succession is uncontested, that is best done immediately. Yet, a short interruption of work in the civil service may result from one or more days of closing the offices, especially on the day of the [[State funeral]].

===Confucianism===
{{main|Chinese funeral rituals}}
There are five grades of mourning obligations in the Confucian Code. A man is expected to honor most of those descended from his great-great-grandfather, and most of their wives. One's father (and mother) would merit 27 months. One's grandfather on the male side, as well as one's wife, would be grade two, or twelve months of austerities. A paternal uncle is grade three at nine months. Grade four is reserved for one's father's first cousin, maternal grandparents, siblings and sister's children (five months). First cousins once removed, second cousins and a man's wife's parents were to get grade five (three months).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia B.|title=The Inner Quarters|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-08156-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] usually hold the funeral either the day after death or on the third day, and always during the daytime. In traditional Orthodox communities the body of the departed would be washed and prepared for burial by family or friends, and then placed in the coffin in the home. A house in mourning would be recognizable by the lid of the coffin, with a cross on it, and often adorned with flowers, set on the porch by the front door.

Special prayers are held on the third, seventh or ninth (number varies in different national churches), and [[40th Day after death|40th days after death]]; the third, sixth and ninth or twelfth month;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thyateira.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=103&amp;Itemid=119 |title=Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain – Funerals &amp; Memorials |publisher=Thyateira.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and annually thereafter in a [[Pannikhida|memorial service]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.

[[Kolyva]] is ceremoniously used to honor the dead.

Sometimes men in mourning will not shave for the '''40 days'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Living in Crete.Net |url=http://www.livingincrete.net/bereavement2.html |title=Funeral Traditions in Crete and Greece |publisher=Livingincrete.net |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty seems to have recurring pre-Judaic origins e.g. in the Rites of Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganizingfaithofyeshua.netfirms.com/40_days_wilderness.htm 40 days wilderness...truth or sun myth retold?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207153305/http://paganizingfaithofyeshua.netfirms.com/40_days_wilderness.htm |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece and other Orthodox countries, it is not uncommon for widows to remain in mourning dress for the rest of their lives.

When an Orthodox [[bishop]] dies, a successor is not elected until after the 40 days of mourning are completed, during which period his [[diocese]] is said to be "[[widow]]ed".

The 40th day has great significance in Orthodox religion. That is the period during which soul of deceased wanders on earth. On the 40th day ascension of his soul occurs. Therefore, it's the most important day in mourning period, when special prayers should be held on grave site of deceased. 

As in the Roman Catholic rites, there can be symbolic mourning. During [[Holy Week]], some temples in the [[Church of Cyprus]] draw black curtains across the icons.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, V. (2000) ''Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe from Byzantium to Kosovo'' (Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; The services of [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] morning are patterned in part on the Orthodox [[Christian burial]] service, and funeral [[Epitaphios (liturgy)|lamentations]].

====Western Christianity====
The European social forms are, in general, forms of Christian religious expression transferred to the greater community.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Mass of Paul VI]], adopted in 1969, allows several options for the [[liturgical color]] used in Masses for the Dead. Before the liturgical reform, black was the ordinary color for [[funeral]] Masses; in the revised use, several options are available, though black is the norm. According to the General Instruction of the Roman Missal (§346d-e), [[black vestments]] is to be worn at Offices and Masses for the dead; an insult was given for several countries to use violet or white vestments, and in some of those nations those colours have largely supplanted the use of black vestments. 

Christian churches often go into mourning symbolically during the period of [[Lent]] to commemorate the sacrifice and death of [[Jesus]]. Customs vary among the denominations and include the covering or removal of statuary, icons and paintings, and use of special liturgical colors, such as violet/purple, during Lent and [[Holy Week]].

In more formal congregations, parishioners also dress according to specific forms during Holy Week, particularly on [[Maundy Thursday]] and [[Good Friday]], when it is common to wear black or sombre dress or, as mentioned, the liturgical color purple.

===Hinduism===
Death is not seen as the final "end", but is seen as a turning point in the seemingly endless journey of the indestructible "[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]" or soul through innumerable bodies of animals and people. Hence, Hinduism prohibits excessive mourning or lamentation upon death, as this can hinder the passage of the departed soul towards its journey ahead: "As mourners will not help the dead in this world, therefore (the relatives) should not weep, but perform the obsequies to the best of their power."&lt;ref&gt;Viṣṇu smṛti 20.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu mourning is described in [[dharma]] shastras.&lt;ref&gt;Viṣṇu smṛti 20.30–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Āpastamba dharma sūtra 2.6.15.6–9&lt;/ref&gt; It begins immediately after the cremation of the body and ends on the morning of the thirteenth day. Traditionally the body is cremated within 24 hours after death; however, cremations are not held after sunset or before sunrise. Immediately after the death, an oil lamp is lit near the deceased, and this lamp is kept burning for three days.

Hinduism associates death with [[ritual purification|ritual impurity]] for the immediate blood family of the deceased, hence during these mourning days, the immediate family must not perform any religious ceremonies (except funerals), must not visit temples or other sacred places, must not serve the sages (holy men), must not give alms, must not read or recite from the sacred scriptures, nor can they attend social functions such as marriages, parties, etc. The family of the deceased is not expected to serve any visiting guests food or drink. It is customary that the visiting guests do not eat or drink in the house where the death has occurred. The family in mourning are required to bathe twice a day, eat a single simple vegetarian meal, and try to cope with their loss.

On the day on which the death has occurred, the family do not cook; hence usually close family and friends will provide food for the mourning family. [[White clothing (religious)|White clothing]] (the color of purity) is the color of mourning, and many will wear white during the mourning period.

The male members of the family do not cut their hair or shave, and the female members of the family do not wash their hair until the 10th day after the death. On the morning of the 10th day, all male members of the family shave and cut their hair, and female members wash their hair. This day is called ''Dasai'' or ''Daswan''. After ''Daswan'', some vedic rituals are started. If the deceased was young and unmarried, the "Narayan Bali" is performed by the Pandits. The Mantras of "Bhairon Paath" are recited. This ritual is performed through the person who has given the Mukhagni (Ritual of giving fire to the dead body).

On the morning of the 13th day, a [[Śrāddha]] ceremony is performed. The main ceremony involves a fire sacrifice, in which offerings are given to the ancestors and to gods, to ensure the deceased has a peaceful afterlife. [[Pind Sammelan]] is performed to ensure the involvement of the departed soul with that of God. Typically after the ceremony, the family cleans and washes all the idols in the family shrine; and flowers, fruits, water and purified food are offered to the gods. Then, the family is ready to break the period of mourning and return to daily life.

===Islam===

In Shi’ah Islam, examples of mourning practices are held annually in the month of Muharram, i.e. the first month of Islamic Lunar calendar. This mourning is held in the commemoration of Imam Al Husayn ibn Ali, who was martyred along with his 72 companions by Yazid bin Muawiyah. Shi’ah Muslims wear black clothes and take out processions on road to mourn on the tragedy of Karbala. 
{{Main|Islamic funeral#Mourning}}
[[File:Srebrenica Massacre - Reinterment and Memorial Ceremony - July 2007 - Women Mourners 2.jpg|thumb|Women mourners at the reburial of newly identified victims of the [[Srebrenica massacre]] in Bosnia.]] Shi’ah Muslims also mourn the death of Fatima (the only daughter of Muhammad) and the Shi’ah Imams.

Mourning is observed in Islam by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry.

Loved ones and relatives are to observe a three-day mourning period.&lt;ref name = "Shahih"&gt;[[Sahih Muslim]] [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.369 Volume 2, Book 23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Number 369-371--&gt; Widows observe an extended mourning period ([[Iddah]]), four months and ten days&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;(Number 370-371)&lt;/ref&gt; long, in accordance with the Qur'an 2:234. During this time, she is not to remarry, move from her home, or wear decorative clothing or jewelry.

Grief at the death of a beloved person is normal, and weeping for the dead is allowed in Islam.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;(Number 391)&lt;/ref&gt; What is prohibited is to express grief by wailing ("bewailing" refers to mourning in a loud voice), shrieking, tearing hair or clothes, breaking things, scratching faces, or uttering phrases that make a Muslim lose faith.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;(Number 375-393)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Directives for widows====
The Qur'an prohibits [[widow]]s from engaging themselves for four [[lunar month]]s and ten days after the death of their husbands. According to Qur'an:
{{cquote|And those of you who die and leave widows behind, they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days. Then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you about what they do with themselves in accordance with the norms [of society]. And Allah is well acquainted with what you do. And there is also no blame on you if you tacitly send a marriage proposal to these women or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that you would definitely talk to them. [Do so] but do not make a secret contract. Of course you can say something in accordance with the norms [of the society]. And do not decide to marry until the law reaches its term. And know that Allah has knowledge of what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him and know that Allah is Most forgiving and Most Forbearing.|author=[[Qur'an]]{{Quran-usc-range|2|234|235}} }}

Islamic scholars consider this directive a balance between mourning a husband's death and protection of the widow from censure that she became interested in remarrying too soon after her husband’s death.&lt;ref&gt;Islahi(1986), pp. 546&lt;/ref&gt; This is also to ascertain whether or not she is pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Shehzad Saleem. ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Marislaw2y4.html The Social Directives of Islam: Distinctive Aspects of Ghamidi's Interpretation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403024603/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Marislaw2y4.html |date=2007-04-03 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Bereavement in Judaism}}
[[File:Prager Beerdigungsbruderschaft.jpg|thumb|A woman mourning the death of her husband, [[Prague]], 1772]]
Judaism looks upon mourning as a process by which the stricken can re-enter into society, and so provides a series of customs that make this process gradual. The first stage, observed as all the stages are by immediate relatives (parents, spouse, siblings and children) is the [[Shiva (Judaism)|Shiva]] (literally meaning seven), which consists of the first seven days after the funeral. The second stage is the Shloshim (thirty), referring to the thirty days following the death. The period of mourning after the death of a parent lasts one year. Each stage places lighter demands and restrictions than the previous one in order to reintegrate the bereaved into normal life.

The most known and central stage is [[Shiva (Judaism)|Shiva]], which is a Jewish mourning practice in which people adjust their behaviour as an expression of their bereavement for the week immediately after the burial. In the West, typically, mirrors are covered and a small tear is made in an item of clothing to indicate a lack of interest in personal vanity. The bereaved dress simply and sit on the floor, short stools or boxes rather than chairs when receiving the condolences of visitors. In some cases relatives or friends take care of the bereaved's house chores, as cooking and cleaning. English speakers use the expression "to sit shiva".

During the [[Shloshim]] the mourners are no longer expected to sit on the floor or be taken care of (cooking/cleaning). However, some customs still apply. There is a prohibition on getting married or attending any sort of celebrations and men refrain from shaving or cutting their hair.

Restrictions during the year of mourning include not wearing new clothes, not listening to music and not attending celebrations. In addition, the sons of the deceased recite the Kaddish prayer for the first eleven months of the year.

The Narragansett runestone was first reported to the [[Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission]] (HPHC) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=ri.gov /&gt; The [[New England Antiquities Research Association]] (NEARA) ran several studies and published a number of papers in the 1980s and 1990s about the rock. According to NEARA, the stone was discovered by a [[quahog]]ger in December 1984 while digging in the mud flats of Narragansett Bay.&lt;ref name=iir&gt;{{cite web|last=Church|first=Chris|title=Mysterious rune stone moving to Goddard Park|url=http://www.independentri.com/independents/north_east/article_3f790edb-91b5-5cb5-8a11-1ce509986465.html?TNNoMobile|publisher=Independent RI|accessdate=9 February 2014|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HPHC was unable to find any information about the stone in any previous inventories of Narragansett Bay. They found that as early as 1939, the runestone was located [[Upland (freshwater ecology)|upland]] and may have been buried.&lt;ref name=ri.gov /&gt; Recently, the inscriptions on the stone were visible only for a short period of time between the shifting tides, due to dramatic erosion of the shoreline at Pojac Point and the fact that the stone was positioned 20 feet from the extreme low tide line mark.&lt;ref name=ri.gov /&gt;

In 2014, Everett Brown of Providence reported that he and his brother Warren had carved the runes on Quidnessett Rock in summer 1964. He said that he had forgotten about the incident until the stone was removed and recovered in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stonewings.wordpress.com/2014/06/19/a-perfectly-good-story-gets-runed/ |title=Rune stone records Viking visit … in 1964 &amp;#124; Stone Wings |publisher=Stonewings.wordpress.com |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independentri.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Church |first=Chris |url=http://www.independentri.com/independents/north_east/article_fe598e73-8b9f-548f-9130-9cce4460a356.html/ |title=Man claims he carved rune stone markings in '64 – Independent Newspapers: North East |publisher=Independentri.com |date=2014-06-28 |accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His account has been disputed by other local people, who state that they saw the stone before 1964, and have challenged other elements of his statements.&lt;ref name=Cranston&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schieldrop|first1=Mark|title=With Childhood Stories, Locals Dispute Claim Narragansett Rune Stone was Carved in 1960s|url=http://cranston.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/with-childhood-stories-locals-dispute-claim-narragansett-rune-stone-was-carved-in-1960s52942|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=Cranston Patch|date=July 20, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160756/http://cranston.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/with-childhood-stories-locals-dispute-claim-narragansett-rune-stone-was-carved-in-1960s52942|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Church |first=Chris |url=http://www.independentri.com/independents/north_east/article_9877eeab-8002-54f2-aa3b-d05867dbf4b9.html |title=Rune stone origin claim challenged – Independent Newspapers: North East |publisher=Independentri.com |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The stone is referenced in episode 11 of [[America Unearthed#Season 1 (2012–13)|season 1]] of ''[[America Unearthed]].''&lt;ref name=iir /&gt;

==Disappearance and recovery==
The state Coastal Resources Management Council reported that the runestone had been removed from the tidal waters off Pojac Point between July and August 2012. In May 2013, the state Attorney General’s Environmental Unit and DEM’s Criminal Investigation Unit announced that they had recovered the stone.

Town historian and independent columnist G. Timothy Cranston said that a Pojac Point resident had removed the stone, as he was tired of having tourists scouring the neighborhood and shoreline looking for the stone. He said that the resident – who was not named – was ordered by state officials to retrieve the stone after having sunk it in deeper waters off the coast.&lt;ref name="independentri.com"/&gt; After the stone was recovered, in October 2015 it was placed for long-term public viewing in Wickford, a village of the Town of North Kingstown, Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20151030/NEWS/151039923 |title=Mysterious Narragansett Runestone unveiled in Wickford |date=October 30, 2015 |first=Donita |last=Naylor |work=The Providence Journal |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Zealand Wars''' were a series of armed conflicts that took place in New Zealand from 1845 to 1872 between the New Zealand government and the [[Māori people|Māori]]. Until at least the 1980s, European New Zealanders referred to them as the '''Māori wars''';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/new-zealand-wars/page-1|title=Story: New Zealand wars }}&lt;/ref&gt; the historian [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]] was one of the first to refer to them as the "New Zealand wars", in his 1987 book ''The New Zealand wars and the Victorian interpretation of racial conflict.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/video/36902/the-end-of-the-war|title=The end of the war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the wars were initially localised conflicts triggered by tensions over disputed land purchases, they escalated dramatically from 1860 as the government became convinced it was facing united Māori resistance to further land sales and a refusal to acknowledge Crown sovereignty. The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops to mount major campaigns to overpower the [[Māori King Movement|Kīngitanga (Māori King) movement]] and also acquire farming and residential land for British settlers.&lt;ref name="King 1977, p. 26"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=King |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael King |year=1977 |title=Te Puea: A Biography |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton  |location=Auckland |page=26 |isbn=0-340-22482-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Dalton |first=B.J. |title=War and Politics in New Zealand 1855–1870 |publisher=Sydney University Press  |year=1967 |location=Sydney |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later campaigns were aimed at quashing the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the [[Pai Mārire]] religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity.&lt;ref name="Belich 1986x, pp=204–205"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |first=James |last=Belich |year=1986x |title=The New Zealand Wars and the Victorian Interpretation of Racial Conflict |edition=1st |publisher=Penguin |location=Auckland|pages=204–205 |isbn=0-14-011162-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of hostilities in the 1860s, 18,000 British troops, supported by artillery, cavalry and local militia, battled about 4,000 Māori warriors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Belich |first=James |authorlink=James Belich (historian) |title=The New Zealand Wars |publisher=Penguin |year=1986a |location=Auckland |pages=126–133 |isbn=0-14-027504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what became a gross imbalance of manpower and weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=24–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although outnumbered, the Māori were able to withstand their enemy with techniques that included anti-artillery bunkers and the use of carefully placed [[pā]], or fortified villages, that allowed them to block their enemy's advance and often inflict heavy losses, yet quickly abandon their positions without significant loss. [[Guerrilla warfare|Guerilla-style tactics]] were used by both sides in later campaigns, often fought in dense bush. Over the course of the Taranaki and Waikato campaigns, the lives of about 1,800 Māori and 800 Europeans were lost,&lt;ref name="King 1977, p. 26"/&gt; and total Māori losses over the course of all the wars may have exceeded 2,100.

Violence over land ownership broke out first in the [[Wairau Valley]] in the [[South Island]] in June 1843, but rising tensions in [[Taranaki]] eventually led to the involvement of British military forces at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] in March 1860. The war between the government and Kīngitanga Māori spread to other areas of the [[North Island]], with the biggest single campaign being the [[invasion of the Waikato]] in 1863–1864, before hostilities concluded with the pursuits of warlord [[Tītokowaru|Riwha Tītokowaru]] in Taranaki (1868–1869) and guerrilla fighter [[Te Kooti|Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki]] on the east coast (1868–1872).

Although Māori were initially fought by British forces, the New Zealand government developed its own military force, including local militia, rifle volunteer groups, the specialist Forest Rangers and [[kūpapa]] (pro-government Māori). The government also responded with legislation to imprison Māori opponents and [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscate]] expansive areas of the North Island for sale to settlers, with the funds used to cover war expenses&lt;ref name="Belich 1986a, p. 126"&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=181–182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—punitive measures that on the east and west coasts provoked an intensification of Māori resistance and aggression.

==Background==
The 1840 [[Treaty of Waitangi]] guaranteed that individual Māori ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) should have undisturbed possession of their lands, forests, fisheries and other ''[[taonga]]'' (treasures) in return for becoming British subjects, selling land to the government only and surrendering sovereignty to the British Government. Historians, however, have debated whether Māori signatories fully understood this last point, due to the possible mistranslation of the word "sovereignty" in the treaty copies. The majority of Māori wanted to sign in order to consolidate peace and in hopes of ending the long intertribal [[Musket Wars]] (1807–1842). They also wished to acquire the technological culture of the British.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

All pre-treaty colonial land-sale deals had taken place directly between two parties. In the early period of contact, Māori had generally sought trade with Europeans. The British and the French had established [[Mission (station)|mission stations]], and missionaries had received land from iwi for houses, schools, churches, and farms.

Traders, [[Sydney]] [[businessmen]] and the [[New Zealand Company]] had bought large tracts of land before 1840,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orange |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Orange |title=The Treaty of Waitangi |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |year=1987 |location=Wellington |pages=32–33 |isbn=086861-634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British government at Westminster became concerned about protecting Māori from exploitation. As part of the Treaty of Waitangi, colonial authorities{{which|date=June 2014}} decreed that Māori could sell land only to [[the Crown]] (the [[Pre-emption right|Right of Pre-emption]]). But as the New Zealand colonial government, pressured by immigrant European settlers, tried to speed up land sales to provide farmland, it met resistance from the [[Māori King Movement|Kīngitanga (Māori King) movement]] that emerged in the 1850s and opposed further European encroachment.

Governor [[Thomas Gore Browne]]'s provocative purchase of a disputed block of land at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] in 1859 set the government on a collision course with the Kīngitanga movement, and the government interpreted the Kīngitanga response as a challenge to the Crown's authority.&lt;ref name="King 2003, p. 214"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |first=Michael |last=King |title=The Penguin History of New Zealand |year=2003 |page=214 |isbn=0-14-301867-1 |publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Gore Browne succeeded in bringing 3500 Imperial troops from the Australian colonies to quash this perceived challenge, and within four years a total of 9,000 British troops had arrived in New Zealand, assisted by more than 4,000 colonial and ''[[kūpapa]]'' (pro-government Māori) fighters as the government sought a decisive victory over the "rebel" Māori.

The use of a punitive [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] policy from 1865, depriving "rebel" Māori of the means of living, fuelled further Māori anger and resentment, fanning the flames of conflict in [[Second Taranaki War|Taranaki]] (1863–1866) and on the [[East Cape War|east coast]] (1865–1866).

==Conflicts==

The various conflicts of the New Zealand wars span a considerable period, and the causes and outcomes differ widely. The earliest conflicts in the 1840s happened at a time when Māori were still the predominant power, but by the 1860s settler numbers and resources were much greater. From about 1862 British troops began arriving in much greater number, summoned by Governor [[George Grey]] for his Waikato invasion, and in March 1864 total troop numbers peaked at about 14,000 (9,000 Imperial troops, more than 4,000 colonial and a few hundred ''kūpapa'').&lt;ref name="Belich 1986a, pp. 125–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=125–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wairau Affray===
{{Main|Wairau Affray}}
The first armed conflict between Māori and the European settlers took place on 17 June 1843 in the [[Wairau Valley]], in the north of the [[South Island]]. The clash was sparked when settlers led by a representative of the [[New Zealand Company]]—which held a false title deed to a block of land—attempted to clear Māori off the land ready for surveying. The party also attempted to arrest [[Ngāti Toa]] chiefs [[Te Rauparaha]] and [[Te Rangihaeata]]. Fighting broke out and 22 Europeans were killed, as well as four to six Māori. Several Europeans were slain after being captured. In early 1844, the new [[Governor of New Zealand|Governor]], [[Robert FitzRoy]], investigated the incident and declared the settlers were at fault. The Wairau Affray—described as the Wairau Massacre in early texts—was the only armed conflict of the New Zealand Wars to take place in the South Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|2003|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moon |first=Paul |title=FitzRoy: Governor in Crisis 1843–1845&amp;#124; |publisher=David Ling Publishing |year=2000 |pages=81–98|isbn=0-908990-70-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Northern War===
{{Main|Flagstaff War}}
[[File:HekeFlagstaff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hone Heke]] cuts down the flagstaff on Flagstaff Hill at [[Russell, New Zealand|Kororāreka]].]]
The [[Flagstaff War]] took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the [[Bay of Islands]], between March 1845 and January 1846. In 1845 [[George Grey]] arrived in New Zealand to take up his appointment as governor. At this time [[Hōne Heke]] challenged the authority of the British, beginning by cutting down the flagstaff on [[Flagstaff Hill, New Zealand|Flagstaff Hill]] at [[Kororāreka]]. The flagstaff had previously flown the colours of [[United Tribes of New Zealand]] but now carried the [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] and therefore symbolised the grievances of Heke and his ally [[Te Ruki Kawiti]], as to changes that had followed the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

There were many [[Flagstaff War#Causes|causes of the Flagstaff War]] and Heke had a number of [[Flagstaff War#Grievance of the Ngāpuhi|grievances in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi]]. While [[Henry Williams (missionary)#Controversy over land purchases|land acquisition]] by the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) had been controversial, the rebellion led by Heke was directed against the colonial forces with the CMS missionaries trying to persuade Heke to end the fighting.&lt;ref name="CARv2-4"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Carleton |first1=Hugh |year=1874 |title=The Life of Henry Williams: "Early Recollections" written by Henry Williams |publisher=[[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB), University of Auckland Library |pages=[http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1048&amp;page=1&amp;action=null 12, 28, 30–31, 35 ff.] |volume=Vol. II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAR87"&gt;{{harv|Carleton|1874|loc=[http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1056&amp;page=0&amp;action=null Appendix to Vol. II]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] and most of Ngāpuhi sided with the government, the small and ineptly led British had been beaten at [[Battle of Ohaeawai]]. Grey, armed with the financial support and far more troops armed with 32-pounder cannons that had been denied to FitzRoy, attacked and occupied [[Kawiti]]'s fortress at [[Ruapekapeka]], forcing Kawiti to retreat. Heke's confidence waned after he was wounded in battle with [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] and his warriors, and by the realisation that the British had far more resources than he could muster, including some [[Pākehā Māori]], who supported the colonial forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=John |title=White Chief – The Story of a Pakeha Maori |publisher=Penguin Books (NZ) |year=2006 |pages=100–140 |isbn=978-0-14-302022-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Battle of Ruapekapeka, Heke and Kawiti were ready for peace.&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kawiti |first1=Tawai  |title=Hekes War in the North |url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22.html |accessdate=10 October 2012 |date=October 1956|publisher=No. 16 Ao Hou, Te / The New World, National Library of New Zealand Library |pages=38–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Tāmati Wāka Nene they approached to act as the intermediary to negotiate with Governor Grey, who accepted the advice of Nene that Heke and Kawiti should not be punished for their rebellion. The fighting in the north ended and there was no punitive confiscation of Ngāpuhi land.&lt;ref&gt;The Colonial New Zealand Wars, Tim Ryan and Bill Parham, pg28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hutt Valley and Wanganui campaigns===
{{Main|Hutt Valley Campaign|Wanganui Campaign}}
The Hutt Valley campaign of 1846 came as a sequel to the [[Wairau Affray]]. The causes were similar—dubious land purchases by the [[New Zealand Company]] and the desire of the settlers to move on to land before disputes over titles were resolved—and the two conflicts shared many of the same protagonists. The campaign's most notable clashes were the Māori dawn raid on an imperial stockade at Boulcott's Farm on 16 May 1846 in which eight British soldiers and an estimated two Māori died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Cowan |first=James |authorlink=James Cowan (New Zealand writer) |year=1922a |title=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period |volume=Vol. 1, 1845–1864 |publisher=RNZ Government Printer |location=Wellington |chapter=Chapter 11: The Fight at Boulcott's Farm |chapter-url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Battle of Battle Hill]] from 6–13 August as British troops, local militia and ''kūpapa'' pursued a Ngāti Toa force led by chief [[Te Rangihaeata]] through steep and dense bushland. [[Ngāti Toa]] chief [[Te Rauparaha]] was also taken into custody during the campaign; he was detained without charge in Auckland for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Steven |title=Te Rauparaha |work=Te Ara the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=30 October 2012 |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t74/te-rauparaha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bloodshed heightened settlers' fears in nearby Wanganui, which was given a strong military force to guard against attack. In April 1847 an accidental shooting of a minor Wanganui Māori chief led to a bloody revenge attack on a settler family; when the perpetrators were captured and hanged, a major raid was launched on the town as a reprisal, with homes plundered and burned and livestock stolen. Māori besieged the town before mounting a frontal attack in July 1847. A peace settlement was reached in early 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|1922a|loc=[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c14.html Chapter14: The War at Wanganui]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Taranaki War===
{{Main|First Taranaki War}}
The catalyst for the First Taranaki War was the disputed sale to [[the Crown]] of a 240 hectare block of land at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]], despite a veto by the paramount chief of [[Te Āti Awa]] tribe, [[Wiremu Kīngi]], and a "solemn contract" by local Māori not to sell. [[Thomas Gore Browne|Governor Browne]] accepted the purchase with full knowledge of the circumstances and tried to occupy the land, anticipating it would lead to armed conflict, and a demonstration of the substantive sovereignty the British believed they had gained in the 1840 [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. Hostilities began on 17 March 1860. The war was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia, as well as volunteer soldiers and militia, against Māori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500.&lt;ref name="King 2003, p. 214"/&gt; After a series of battles and actions the war ended in a ceasefire, with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other. Total losses among the imperial, volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238, while Māori casualties totalled about 200. Though there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986x|p={{page needed|date=November 2010}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]] has claimed that Māori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them, and had therefore been victorious. However, he also states that the Māori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the [[Waikato]].

===Invasion of Waikato===
{{Main|Invasion of Waikato}}
[[File:GeorgeEdwardGrey01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Premier Sir George Grey]] [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] Thomas Gore-Browne began making arrangements for a Waikato campaign to destroy the ''Kīngitanga'' stronghold at the close of the First Taranaki War. Preparations were suspended in December 1861 when he was replaced by Sir [[George Edward Grey|George Grey]], but Grey revived plans for an invasion in June 1863. He persuaded the Colonial Office in London to send more than 10,000 Imperial troops to New Zealand and General Sir [[Duncan Cameron (general)|Duncan Cameron]] was appointed to lead the campaign. Cameron used soldiers to build the 18&amp;nbsp;km-long [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] to the border of Kīngitanga territory and on 9 July 1863 Grey ordered all Māori living between [[Auckland]] and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]] or be expelled south of the Waikato River; when his ultimatum was rejected the vanguard of the army crossed the frontier into Kīngitanga territory and established a forward camp. A long series of bush raids on his supply lines forced Cameron to build an extensive network of forts and redoubts through the area. In a continual buildup of force, Cameron eventually had 14,000 British and colonial soldiers at his disposal as well as steamers and armoured vessels for use on the Waikato River. They fought a combined Māori contingent of about 4,000.&lt;ref name="Belicht 1986a, pp. 125–127"&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=125–127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron and his Kīngitanga foe engaged in several major battles including the [[Battle of Rangiriri]] and a three-day siege at Orakau, capturing the Kīngitanga capital of [[Ngaruawahia]] in December 1863, before completing their Waikato conquest in April 1864. The Waikato campaign cost the lives of 700 British and colonial soldiers and about 1,000 Māori.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|2003|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kīngitanga'' Māori retreated into the rugged interior of the North Island and in 1865 the New Zealand Government confiscated about 12,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Māori land (4% of New Zealand's land area) for white settlement—an action that quickly provoked the [[Second Taranaki War]].

===The Second Taranaki War===
{{Main|Second Taranaki War}}
Between 1863 and 1866 there was a resumption of hostilities between Māori and the New Zealand Government in Taranaki, which is sometimes referred to as the Second Taranaki War. The conflict, which overlapped the wars in [[Waikato]] and [[Tauranga Campaign|Tauranga]], was fuelled by a combination of factors: lingering Māori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] policy launched by the government in late 1863; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the [[Pai Marire]] [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity.&lt;ref name="Belich204-5"&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986x|pp=204–205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki Māori in the absence of individual Māori commanders.

The style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860–1861 conflict, in which Māori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest. From 1863 the army, working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery, systematically took possession of Māori land by driving off the inhabitants, adopting a "[[scorched earth]]" strategy of laying waste to Māori villages and cultivations, with attacks on villages, whether warlike or otherwise. Historian Brian Dalton noted: "The aim was no longer to conquer territory, but to inflict the utmost 'punishment' on the enemy; inevitably there was a great deal of brutality, much burning of undefended villages and indiscriminate looting, in which loyal Maoris often suffered."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|p=241}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the troops advanced, the Government built an expanding line of redoubts, behind which settlers built homes and developed farms. The effect was a creeping confiscation of almost {{convert|4000|km2|abbr=on}} of land, with little distinction between the land of loyal or rebel Māori owners.&lt;ref name=kaupapa&gt;{{cite web| url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68453721/Taranaki%201996.compressed.pdf| title=The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi| publisher=the Waitangi Tribunal| date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the armed conflict in Taranaki between 1860 and 1869 was a series of enforced confiscations of Taranaki tribal land from Māori blanketed as being in rebellion against the Government.&lt;ref name="kaupapa4"&gt;[http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/scripts/reports/reports/143/2C247BFB-7D96-412F-A013-B0CBAD0F6989.pdf ''"...the greater part of northern Taranaki was invaded, occupied, and finally confiscated without any act of rebellion having taken place..."''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510010433/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/scripts/reports/reports/143/2C247BFB-7D96-412F-A013-B0CBAD0F6989.pdf |date=10 May 2012 }}, waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Cape War===
{{Main|East Cape War}}

East coast hostilities erupted in April 1865 and, as in the Second Taranaki War, sprang from Māori resentment of punitive government land confiscations coupled with the embrace of radical Pai Marire expression.&lt;ref name="Belich204-5"/&gt; The religion arrived on the east coast from [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] in early 1865. The subsequent ritual killing of missionary [[Völkner Incident|Carl Volkner]] by [[Pai Mārire]] (or Hauhau) followers at [[Opotiki]] on 2 March 1865 sparked settler fears of an outbreak of violence and later that year the New Zealand government launched a lengthy expedition to hunt for Volkner's killers and neutralise the movement's influence. Rising tensions between Pai Mārire followers and conservative Māori led to a number of wars between and within Māori ''iwi'', with ''kūpapa'' armed by the government in a bid to exterminate the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=224–225, 240}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major conflicts within the campaign included the cavalry and artillery attack on Te Tarata pā near Opotiki in October 1865 in which about 35 Māori were killed, and the seven-day siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in November 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Cowan |first=James |authorlink=James Cowan (New Zealand writer) |year=1922b |title=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period |volume=Vol. 2, 1864–1872 |publisher=RNZ Government Printer |location=Wellington |chapter=Chapter 11: East Coast Operations |chapter-url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government confiscated northern parts of Urewera land in January 1866 in a bid to break down supposed Māori support for Volkner's killers and confiscated additional land in Hawke's Bay a year later after a rout of a Māori party it deemed a threat to the settlement of Napier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Deed of settlement of historical claims, Maungaharuru-Tangitu hapu and the Crown |publisher=Office of Treaty Settlements |date=25 May 2013 |pages=21–22 | url=https://www.govt.nz/dmsdocument/5391.pdf| accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titokowaru's War===
{{Main|Titokowaru's War}}
[[Image:Von Tempsky's death Kennett Watkins.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[New Zealand Defence Force|Armed Constabulary]] ambushed by Titokowaru's forces at Te Ngutu o Te Manu]]
War flared again in Taranaki in June 1868 as [[Titokowaru|Riwha Titokowaru]], chief of the Ngāti Ruanui's Ngaruahine ''[[hapu]]'' (sub-tribe), responded to the continued surveying and settlement of confiscated land with well-planned and effective attacks on settlers and government troops in an effort to block the occupation of Māori land. Coinciding with a violent raid on a European settlement on the East Coast by [[Te Kooti]], the attacks shattered what European colonists regarded as a new era of peace and prosperity, creating fears of a "general uprising of hostile Māoris".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986x|p={{page needed|date=August 2017}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Morris, Speaker of the House of Representatives, March 1869, as cited by Belich.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titokowaru, who had fought in the [[Second Taranaki War]], was the most skilful West Coast Māori warrior. He also assumed the roles of a priest and prophet of the extremist Hauhau movement of the [[Pai Marire|Pai Mārire]] religion, reviving ancient rites of [[cannibalism]] and [[propitiation]] of Māori gods with the human heart torn from the first slain in a battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|1922b|loc=[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c20.html Chapter 20: Opening of the Titokowaru's Campaign]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Titokowaru's forces were numerically small and initially outnumbered in battle 12 to one by government troops,&lt;ref name="Belich 1986x, pp=204–205" /&gt; the ferocity of their attacks provoked fear among settlers and prompted the resignation and desertion of many militia volunteers, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of most government military forces from South Taranaki and giving Titokowaru control of almost all territory between [[New Plymouth]] and [[Wanganui]]. Although Titokowaru provided the strategy and leadership that had been missing among tribes that had fought in the Second Taranaki War and his forces never lost a battle during their intensive campaign, they mysteriously abandoned a strong position at Tauranga-ika Pā&lt;ref name="Cowan 1922b, Chapter 29"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|1922b|loc=[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow02NewZ-c29-0.html Chapter 29: (pp. 285–294)]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Titokowaru's army immediately began to disperse. [[Kimble Bent]], who lived as a slave with Titokowaru's ''hapu'' after deserting from the 57th Regiment, told Cowan 50 years later the chief had lost his ''mana tapu'', or sacred power, after committing adultery with the wife of another chief.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1922b, Chapter 29"/&gt;

Once Titokowaru was defeated and the East Coast threat minimised, the alienation of Māori land, as well as the political subjugation of Māori, continued at an even more rapid pace.&lt;ref&gt;Ranginui Walker, ''Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou – Struggle Without End'', Penguin Books, 1990, chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Te Kooti's War===
{{Main|Te Kooti's War}}
Te Kooti's War was fought in the East Coast region and across the heavily forested central [[North Island]] and [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] between government military forces and followers of spiritual leader [[Te Kooti]] Arikirangi Te Turuki. The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti's return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the [[Chatham Islands]], from where he had escaped with almost 200 Māori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, asked that he and his followers be left in peace, but within two weeks they were being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and Māori volunteers. The pursuit turned into a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions&lt;ref name="Belich 1986a, p. 126"/&gt; by colonial and Māori troops against Te Kooti's dwindling number of warriors.

Although initially fighting defensively against pursuing government forces, Te Kooti went on the offensive from November 1868, starting with the so-called [[Poverty Bay]] massacre, a well-organised lightning strike against selected European settlers and Māori opponents in the Matawhero district, in which 51 men, women and children were slaughtered and their homes set alight. The attack prompted another vigorous pursuit by government forces, which included a siege at Ngatapa pā that came to a bloody end: although Te Kooti escaped the siege, Māori forces loyal to the government caught and executed more than 130 of his supporters, as well as prisoners he had earlier seized. Dissatisfied with the [[Māori King Movement]]'s reluctance to continue its fight against European invasion and confiscation, Te Kooti offered Māori an [[Old Testament]] vision of salvation from oppression and a return to a [[promised land]]. Wounded three times in battle, he gained a reputation for being immune to death and uttered prophecies that had the appearance of being fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Binney |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Binney |title=Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki |work=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=30 October 2012 |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t45/te-kooti-arikirangi-te-turuki |accessdate=10 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1870 Te Kooti gained refuge from [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tūhoe]] tribes, which consequently suffered a series of damaging raids in which crops and villages were destroyed, after other Māori ''iwi'' were lured by the promise of a ₤5,000 reward for Te Kooti's capture. Te Kooti was finally granted sanctuary by the Māori king in 1872 and moved to the [[King Country]], where he continued to develop rituals, texts and prayers of his [[Ringatū]] faith. He was formally pardoned by the government in February 1883 and died in 1893.

A 2013 [[Waitangi Tribunal]] report said the action of Crown forces on the East Coast from 1865 to 1869—the [[East Coast Wars]] and the start of Te Kooti's War—resulted in the deaths of proportionately more Māori than in any other district during the New Zealand wars. It condemned the "illegal imprisonment" on the Chatham Islands of a quarter of the East Coast region's adult male population and said the loss in war of an estimated 43 percent of the male population, many through acts of "lawless brutality", was a stain on New Zealand's history and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mangatu Remedies Report |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |date=23 December 2013 |url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_69285748/Mangatu%20Pre-pub%20Website.pdf |access-date=1 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216151926/https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_69285748/Mangatu%20Pre-pub%20Website.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
The New Zealand campaigns involved Māori warriors from a range of ''iwi'', most of which were allied with the Kīngitanga movement, fighting a mix of [[British Empire|Imperial]] troops, local militia groups, the specialist Forest Rangers and [[kūpapa]], or "loyalist" Māori.

===Imperial and colonial===
[[File:Portrait of Gustavus Ferdinand von Tempsky, ca 1868 by Webster, Hartley (Auckland) fl 1852-1900.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Gustavus Von Tempsky]], captain of the Forest Rangers.]]In 1855 just 1,250 Imperial troops, from two under-strength British regiments, were in New Zealand. Although both were scheduled to depart at the end of the year, Browne succeeded in retaining one of them for use in New Plymouth, where settlers feared the spread of intertribal violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=28–30, 52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of Taranaki hostilities in 1860, reinforcements were brought from Auckland to boost the New Plymouth garrison, raising the total force of regulars to 450 and for many months the total number of Māori under arms exceeded the number of troops in Taranaki. In mid-April the arrival of three warships and about 400 soldiers from Australia marked the beginning of the escalation of imperial troop numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=103–104, 108–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildup increased rapidly under Grey's term as governor: when the [[Second Taranaki War|second round]] of hostilities broke out in Taranaki in May 1863 he applied to the [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] in London for the immediate dispatch of three more regiments and also wrote to the Australian governors asking for whatever British troops that could be made available.&lt;ref name="Dalton 1967, pp. 174, 180"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=174, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant-General [[Duncan Alexander Cameron|Duncan Cameron]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British troops in New Zealand, began the Waikato invasion in July with fewer than 4,000 effective troops in Auckland at his disposal, but the continuous arrival of regiments from overseas rapidly swelled the force.&lt;ref name="Belicht 1986a, pp. 125–127"/&gt;

The Colonial Defence Force, a cavalry unit of about 100 men, was formed by Colonel Marmaduke Nixon in May 1863&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1n15/nixon-marmaduke-george "Marmaduke George Nixon", The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; and served in Waikato&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/new-zealand-wars/page-6 |title=New Zealand wars |work=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; and militia forces were also used throughout the New Zealand wars. The Militia Ordinance 1845 provided for the compulsory training or service within 40&amp;nbsp;km of their town by all able-bodied European men aged between 18 and 60; the Auckland Militia and Volunteers reached a peak of about 1650 on active service in the early stages of the Waikato campaign;&lt;ref name="Belicht 1986a, pp. 125–127" /&gt; and the last force—the Taranaki Militia—was released from service in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/armed-forces/page-1 "Armed forces", The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

A special 65-man bush-scouring corps, the Forest Rangers, composed of local farmers who were familiar with the bush, had proven guerrilla techniques and were capable of "roughing it", was formed in August 1863; the Forest Rangers split into two separate companies in November, with the second led by [[Gustavus von Tempsky]] and both served in Waikato and Taranaki. Other rangers corps during the New Zealand wars included the Taranaki Bush Rangers, Patea Rangers, Opotiki Volunteer Rangers, Wanganui Bush Rangers and Wellington Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stowers |first=Richard |title=Forest Rangers |publisher=self-published |year=1996 |location=Hamilton |pages=1, 10–11, 34 |isbn=0-473-03531-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1863 the first contingents of what was planned as 5,000 military settlers—recruited on the goldfields of Australia and [[Otago]] with promises of free grants of land confiscated from "rebel" Māori—also began service in the Waikato. By the end of October the number of military settlers, known as the Waikato Militia, had reached more than 2,600&lt;ref name="Dalton 1967, pp. 174, 180" /&gt; and total troop numbers peaked at about 14,000 in March 1864 (9,000 Imperial troops, more than 4,000 colonial and a few hundred ''kūpapa'').&lt;ref name="Belich 1986a, pp. 125–133"/&gt;

In November 1864 Premier [[Frederick Weld]] introduced a policy of "self-reliance" for New Zealand, which included the gradual but complete withdrawal of Imperial troops, who would be replaced by a colonial force of 1,500. The move came at a time of rising conflict between Grey, who sought more extensive military operations to "pacify" the west coast of the North Island between Taranaki and Wanganui, and Cameron, who regarded such a campaign as unnecessary, impractical and contrary to Imperial policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=209–211, 218, 239}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Grey blocked Cameron's attempts to dispatch the first regiments from New Zealand in May 1865 and the first regiment finally embarked in January 1866. By May 1867 only the 2/18th Regiment remained in the country, their departure delayed by political pressure over the "peril" still facing settlers; the last soldiers finally left in February 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=227–230, 245, 275}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Māori===
[[File:Rewi Maniapoto.jpg|thumb|394x394px|Chief Rewi Maniapoto]]
About 15 of the 26 major North Island tribal groups sent contingents to join the Waikato campaign, although sometimes they represented a single ''hapu'', or clan, within the tribe. Continual presence on battlefields remained difficult for most, however, because of the constant need for tribal labour in their home community, so there was a constant turnover of small tribal groups. At Meremere, Paterangi, Hangatiki and Maungatatauri, between August 1863 and June 1864 Māori maintained forces of between 1,000 and 2,000 men, but troops were forced to disperse after each campaign because of labour and domestic needs at home. Belich has estimated that the total Māori mobilisation was at least 4,000 warriors, representing one-third of the total manpower available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=128–130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they were not part of a structured command system, Māori generally followed a consistent strategic plan, uniting to build skilfully engineered defensive lines up to {{convert|22|km}} long. Māori united under proven military commanders including Rewi Maniapoto and Tikaokao of [[Ngāti Maniapoto]] and [[Wiremu Tamihana]] of [[Ngāti Hauā]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=131–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy and tactics==
Campaigners on both sides of the New Zealand wars had developed distinctive war strategies and tactics. The British set out to fight a European-style war, based on engaging with the opposing forces, besieging and then capturing fortified positions. The British Army were professional soldiers who had experience fighting in various parts of the Empire, many from [[India]] and [[Afghanistan]], and were led by officers who were themselves trained by men who had fought at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

Many of the Māori fighters had been raised during the [[Musket Wars]], the decades-long bitter intertribal fighting during which warriors had perfected the art of building defensive fortifications around a ''[[pā]]''. During the Flagstaff War Kawiti and Heke appear to have followed a strategy of drawing the colonial forces into attacking a fortified pā, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire.

The word ''pā'' means a fortified strong point near a Māori village or community. They were built with a view to defence, but primarily they were built to safely store food. Puketapu Pā and then [[Ohaeawai]] Pā were the first of the so-called "gunfighter ''pā''", built to engage enemies armed with muskets and cannons. A strong, wooden palisade was fronted with woven flax leaves (''[[Phormium tenax]]'') whose tough, stringy foliage absorbed much of the force of the ammunition.&lt;ref name="NZW-O2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=James |title=Flax-masked Palisade |publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845–64) |pages= |year=1955 |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ053c.html |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palisade was lifted a few centimetres from the ground so muskets could be fired from underneath rather than over the top. Sometimes there were gaps in the palisade, which led to killing traps. There were trenches and rifle pits to protect the occupants and, later, very effective artillery shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=294–295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually built so that they were almost impossible to surround completely, but usually presented at least one exposed face to invite attack from that direction. They were cheap and easily built—the L-Pa at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] was constructed by 80 men overnight—and they were completely expendable. The British repeatedly mounted often lengthy expeditions to besiege a ''pā'', which would absorb their bombardment and possibly one or two attacks, and then be abandoned by the Māori. Shortly afterwards, a new ''pā'' would appear in another inaccessible site. ''Pā'' like these were built in the dozens, particularly during the [[First Taranaki War]], where they eventually formed a cordon surrounding [[New Plymouth]], and in the Waikato campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=106–107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ALEXANDER(1873) p010 ATTACK ON A MAORI PAH.jpg|thumb|230px|Attack on a Māori ''pā'']]
For a long time, the modern ''pā'' effectively neutralised the overwhelming disparity in numbers and armaments. At [[Battle of Ohaeawai|Ohaeawai Pā]] in 1845, at [[Rangiriri]] in 1863 and again at [[Tauranga Campaign|Gate Pā]] in 1864, British and colonial forces discovered that frontal attacks on a defended ''pā'' were extremely costly. At Gate Pā, during the 1864 [[Tauranga Campaign]], Māori withstood a day-long bombardment in their underground shelters and trenches. The palisade destroyed, the British troops rushed the ''pā'' whereupon Māori fired on them from hidden trenches, killing 38 and injuring many more in the most costly battle for the Pākehā of the New Zealand Wars. The troops retired and Māori abandoned the ''pā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=178–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British troops soon realised an easy way to neutralise a ''pā''. Although cheap and easy to build, a gunfighter ''pā'' required a significant input of labour and resources. The destruction of the Māori economic base in the area around the ''pā'' made it difficult for the ''hapu'' to support the fighting men. This was the reasoning behind the bush-scouring expeditions of Chute and McDonnell in the [[Second Taranaki War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|p=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest problem for the Māori was that their society was ill-adapted to support a sustained campaign. A long campaign would disrupt food supplies and epidemics resulted in significant numbers of deaths among the Māori.&lt;ref name="LMR1874"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Lawrence M. |title=Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams |year=1973 |publisher=Pegasus Press |pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the British could defeat Māori in battle, the defeats were often not decisive. For example, the capture of Ruapekapeka Pā can be considered a British tactical victory, but it was purpose-built as a target for the British, and its loss was not damaging; Heke and Kawiti managed to escape with their forces intact.&lt;ref name="Ian McGibbon p.373"&gt;Ian McGibbon, The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History, p.373&lt;/ref&gt; However the British force consisted of professional soldiers supported by an economic system capable of sustaining them in the field almost indefinitely, in contrast the Māori warrior was a part-time fighter who also needed to work on producing food.

==Weapons==
The main weapon used by the British forces in the 1860s was the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]]. Properly described as a rifled musket, it was loaded down the barrel like a conventional musket but the barrel was rifled. While muskets were accurate to about 60–80&amp;nbsp;m, an 1853 Enfield was accurate to about 300&amp;nbsp;m to 400&amp;nbsp;m in the hands of an experienced soldier; at 100&amp;nbsp;m an experienced soldier could easily hit a human target. The rifle was 1.44&amp;nbsp;m long, weighed 4&amp;nbsp;kg and had a 53&amp;nbsp;cm socket bayonet. This rifle was also commonly used in the [[American Civil War]] by both sides.

The [[Calisher and Terry carbine]] (short rifle) was ordered by the New Zealand Government from Calisher and Terry, Birmingham gunsmiths in 1861 after earlier fighting against Māori showed the need for a carbine suited to fighting in heavy bush. This was the favoured weapon of the New Zealand Forest Rangers because of its shortness, its lightness, and its ability to be reloaded while the marksman lay down—unlike the Enfield, which required the soldier to stand to load the powder—and could be loaded on the run. This feature led to a decisive victory for the New Zealand forces at Orakau: several groups of soldiers harried the fleeing Māori but only the Forest Rangers, equipped with carbines were able to follow them 10&amp;nbsp;km to the [[Puniu River]] shooting as they went.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stowers |first=Richard |title=Forest Rangers |publisher=self-published |year=1996 |location=Hamilton |page=106 |isbn=0-473-03531-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Tempsky, Artist and Adventurer. King M and Rose G.1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of NZ Biography. Tempsky, Gustavaus Ferdinand von. N. McMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolvers were mainly used by officers, but were a general issue for the Forest Rangers. The most common revolver appears to have been the five-shot [[Beaumont–Adams revolver|Beaumont–Adams]] .44 percussion revolver. Other revolvers in use were the [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver|Colt Navy]] .36 1851 model with open top frame. The Colt was favoured by the Forest Rangers because it was light and accurate being a [[single-action]] revolver. Von Tempsky's second company of the Forest Rangers also used the [[Bowie knife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stowers |first=Richard |title=Forest Rangers |publisher=self-published |year=1996 |location=Hamilton |pages=270–283 |isbn=0-473-03531-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|New Zealand land confiscations}}
Large areas of land were confiscated from the Māori by the government under the New Zealand Settlements Act in 1863, purportedly as punishment for rebellion.&lt;ref name="land loss maps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maori land loss, 1860–2000 |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/maori-land-1860-2000 |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=20 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, land was confiscated from both "loyal" and "rebel" tribes alike. More than {{convert|16000|km2|abbr=on}} of land was confiscated. Although about half of this was subsequently paid for or returned to Māori control, it was often not returned to its original owners.&lt;ref name="Treaty of Waitangi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty of Waitangi |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/category/tid/133 |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=20 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The confiscations had a lasting impact on the social and economic development of the affected tribes.

The legacy of the New Zealand Wars continues, but these days the battles are mostly fought in courtrooms and around the negotiation table. Numerous reports by the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] have criticised Crown actions during the wars, and also found that the Māori, too, had breached the treaty.&lt;ref name="Turanganui"&gt;{{cite web |title=Turanga Tangata Turanga Whenua: The Report on the Turanganui a Kiwa Claims |url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid={DE526A10-DDDF-45E1-9E09-FEA0F939832D} |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |accessdate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525041322/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid=%7BDE526A10-DDDF-45E1-9E09-FEA0F939832D%7D |archivedate=25 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the negotiated out-of-court settlements of tribes' historical claims ([[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements]]), as of 2011 the Crown is making formal apologies to tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2011/0273/latest/whole.html?search=qs_all%40act%40bill%40regulation_apology_noresel&amp;p=1#dlm3562516 |title=Ngāti Pāhauwera Treaty Claims Settlement Bill 273-2 (2011), Government Bill – New Zealand Legislation |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=The Crown unreservedly apologises for not having honoured its obligations to Ngāti Pāhauwera under the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and through this settlement the Crown seeks to atone for its wrongs and to begin the process of healing.

The [[State of Israel]] is widely believed to possess [[nuclear weapons]].

However, Israel maintains a policy of [[deliberate ambiguity]], never officially denying nor admitting to having nuclear weapons, instead repeating over the years that "Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the [[Middle East]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/books/14book.html?ref=bookreviews | title= Vague, Opaque and Ambiguous — Israel's Hush-Hush Nuclear Policy |last= Bronner | first = Ethan |newspaper= The New York Times |date= October 13, 2010 |accessdate= March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01korblt.html | title = The Quiet Bomb | last= Korb | first = Lawrence | newspaper = The New York Times |date=November 1, 1998 |accessdate= March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v20/d349 | work = Office of the Historian | format = historical documents | title = Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968 | volume = XX, Arab-Israeli Dispute, 1967–68 | at = Document 349 | publisher= Department of State | date= December 12, 1968 | accessdate = July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has also declined to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT) despite international pressure to do so, saying that would be contrary to its national security interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Shalom Life | date = September 21, 2010 | url = http://www.shalomlife.com/eng/13853/Israel_Rejects_Offer_to_Join_UN_Atomic_Agency/ | title = Israel Rejects Offer to Join UN Atomic Agency}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, Israel developed the [[Begin Doctrine]] of [[counter-proliferation]] and [[Preventive war|preventive strikes]], denying other regional actors the ability to acquire their own nuclear weapons. The [[Israeli Air Force]] conducted [[Operation Opera]] and [[Operation Orchard]], destroying the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction#Program development 1960s – 1980s|Iraqi]] and 
[[Syria and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear program|Syrian nuclear reactor]]s in 1981 and 2007, respectively, and the [[Stuxnet]] [[malware]] that severely damaged [[Nuclear facilities in Iran|Iranian nuclear facilities]] in 2010 is widely thought to have been developed by Israel. As of 2018, Israel remains the only country in the Middle East believed to possess nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name = "NTI" /&gt; The [[Samson Option]] refers to Israel's [[Deterrence theory|deterrence strategy]] of [[massive retaliation]] with nuclear weapons as a "last resort" against a country whose military has invaded and/or destroyed much of Israel.&lt;ref name=doctrine /&gt;

Israel started investigating the nuclear field soon after it [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] in 1948, and with French co-operation secretly began building the [[Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center]],{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | Then known simply as the ''Negev Nuclear Research Center''
}} a facility near [[Dimona]] housing a [[nuclear reactor]] and [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plant]] in the late 1950s. The first extensive details of the weapons program came in October 5, 1986, with news coverage of information provided by [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a technician formerly employed at the center. Vanunu was later captured by the [[Mossad]] and brought back to Israel, where he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for [[treason]] and [[espionage]].&lt;ref name = sunday-times-20040421 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-20040420&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3640613.stm |title=Vanunu: Israel's nuclear telltale |publisher=BBC |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==

===Pre-Dimona 1949–1956===
Israel's first [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] was "nearly obsessed" with obtaining nuclear weapons to prevent the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from recurring.  He stated, "What [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]], and [[Edward Teller|Teller]], the [[American Jews|three of them are Jews]], [[Manhattan Project|made for the United States]], could also be done by scientists in Israel, for their own people".&lt;ref name="goldberg201009"/&gt; Ben-Gurion decided to recruit Jewish scientists from abroad even before the end of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] that established Israel's independence. He and others, such as head of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] and defense ministry scientist [[Ernst David Bergmann]], believed and hoped that Jewish scientists such as Oppenheimer and Teller would help Israel.&lt;ref name="is2002"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=30246784 | title= Atomic Power to Israel's Rescue: French-Israeli Nuclear Cooperation, 1949–1957 | last1 = Pinkus | first1 = Binyamin | last2 = Tlamim | first2 = Moshe | journal=Israel Studies |date=Spring 2002 | volume=7 | issue= 1 | pages =104–38 | doi=10.1353/is.2002.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 a unit of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] Science Corps, known by the [[Hebrew]] acronym HEMED GIMMEL, began a two-year [[geological survey]] of the [[Negev]]. While a preliminary study was initially prompted by rumors of [[petroleum]] fields, one objective of the longer two year survey was to find sources of [[uranium]]; some small recoverable amounts were found in [[phosphate]] deposits.&lt;ref name = "FAS"/&gt; That year Hemed Gimmel funded six Israeli physics graduate students to study overseas, including one to go to the [[University of Chicago]] and study under [[Enrico Fermi]], who had overseen the world's first artificial and self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]].{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 26}} In early 1952 Hemed Gimmel was moved from the IDF to the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]] and was reorganized as the Division of Research and Infrastructure (EMET). That June, Bergmann was appointed by Ben-Gurion to be the first chairman of the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] (IAEC).{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 30–1}}

Hemed Gimmel was renamed Machon 4 during the transfer, and was used by Bergmann as the "chief laboratory" of the IAEC; by 1953, Machon 4, working with the Department of Isotope Research at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science|Weizmann Institute]], developed the capability to extract uranium from the phosphate in the Negev and a new technique to produce indigenous [[heavy water]].&lt;ref name= "FAS" /&gt;{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 19}}  The techniques were two years more advanced than American efforts.&lt;ref name="is2002" /&gt; Bergmann, who was interested in increasing nuclear cooperation with the French, sold both patents to the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] (CEA) for 60 million francs. Although they were never commercialized, it was a consequential step for future [[French-Israeli cooperation]].{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 33–4}}  In addition, Israeli scientists probably helped construct the G-1 plutonium production reactor and UP-1 reprocessing plant at [[Marcoule]]. France and Israel had close relations in many areas.  France was principal arms supplier for the young Jewish state, and as instability spread through French colonies in North Africa, Israel provided valuable intelligence obtained from contacts with [[Sephardi Jews]] in those countries.{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}  At the same time Israeli scientists were also observing [[France and nuclear weapons|France's own nuclear program]], and were the only foreign scientists allowed to roam "at will" at the nuclear facility at Marcoule.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 30}}  In addition to the relationships between Israeli and French Jewish and non-Jewish researchers, the French believed that cooperation with Israel could give them access to international Jewish nuclear scientists.{{r |is2002}}

After [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] announced the [[Atoms for Peace]] initiative, Israel became the second country to sign on (following Turkey), and signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States on July 12, 1955.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 44}}&lt;ref name="is2002" /&gt; This culminated in a public signing ceremony on March 20, 1957, to construct a "small swimming-pool research reactor in [[Soreq Nuclear Research Center|Nachal Soreq]]", which would be used to shroud the construction of a much larger facility with the French at [[Dimona]].{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 65}}

In 1986 [[Francis Perrin]], [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|French high-commissioner for atomic energy]] from 1951 to 1970 stated publicly that in 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]], this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the [[Manhattan Project]].{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}&lt;ref name="wisconsinproject.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wrmea.org"/&gt;   According to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the [[USAF Counterproliferation Center]] while France was previously a leader in nuclear research "Israel and France were at a similar level of expertise after the war, and Israeli scientists could make significant contributions to the French effort. Progress in nuclear science and technology in France and Israel remained closely linked throughout the early fifties."  Furthermore, according to Farr, "There were several Israeli observers at the French nuclear tests and the Israelis had 'unrestricted access to French nuclear test explosion data.'"{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}

===Dimona 1956–1965===
{{Main article|Negev Nuclear Research Center}}

====Negotiation====
The French justified their decision to provide Israel a nuclear reactor by claiming it was not without precedent. In September 1955 Canada publicly announced that it would help the Indian government build a heavy-water research reactor, the [[CIRUS reactor]], for "peaceful purposes".{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 37}}  When Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the [[Suez Canal]], France proposed Israel attack Egypt and invade the Sinai as a pretext for France and Britain to invade Egypt posing as "peacekeepers" with the true intent of seizing the Suez Canal (see [[Suez Crisis]]). In exchange, France would provide the nuclear reactor as the basis for the Israeli nuclear weapons program. [[Shimon Peres]], sensing the opportunity on the nuclear reactor, accepted. On September 17, 1956, Peres and Bergmann reached a tentative agreement in [[Paris]] for the CEA to sell Israel a small research reactor. This was reaffirmed by Peres at the [[Protocol of Sèvres]] conference in late October for the sale of a reactor to be built near Dimona and for a supply of uranium fuel.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 53–4}}&lt;ref name="is2002" /&gt;

Israel benefited from an unusually pro-Israel French government during this time.&lt;ref name="is2002" /&gt; After the Suez Crisis led to the threat of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intervention and the British and French were being forced to withdraw under pressure from the U.S., Ben-Gurion sent Peres and [[Golda Meir]] to France. During their discussions the groundwork was laid for France to build a larger nuclear reactor and chemical reprocessing plant, and Prime Minister [[Guy Mollet]], ashamed at having abandoned his commitment to fellow [[socialist]]s in Israel, supposedly told an aide, "I owe the bomb to them,"{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 42–43}} while General Paul Ely, [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], said that "We must give them this to guarantee their security, it is vital." Mollet's successor [[Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury]] stated "I gave you [Israelis] the bomb in order to prevent another Holocaust from befalling the Jewish people and so that Israel could face its enemies in the Middle East."{{r |is2002}}

The French–Israeli relationship was finalized on October 3, 1957, in two agreements whose contents remain secret:{{r |is2002}} One political that declared the project to be for peaceful purposes and specified other legal obligations, and one technical that described a 24 [[megawatt]] EL-102 reactor. The one to actually be built was to be two to three times as large{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 59}} and be able to produce 22 [[kilogram]]s of [[plutonium]] a year.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 45–6}}  When the reactor arrived in Israel, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion declared that its purpose was to provide a pumping station to desalinate a billion gallons of seawater annually and turn the desert into an "agricultural paradise". Six of seven members of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission promptly resigned, protesting that the reactor was the precursor to "political adventurism which will unite the world against us".&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = Gordon | authorlink =Gordon Thomas (author)| title = [[Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad]] | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excavation====
Before construction began it was determined that the scope of the project would be too large for the EMET and IAEC team, so Shimon Peres recruited Colonel [[Manes Pratt]], then Israeli [[military attaché]] in Burma, to be the project leader. Building began in late 1957 or early 1958, bringing hundreds of French engineers and technicians to the [[Beersheba]] and Dimona area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In addition, thousands of newly immigrated [[Sephardi Jews]] were recruited to do digging; to circumvent strict [[labor law]]s, they were hired in increments of 59 days, separated by one day off.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 60–1}}

====Creation of LEKEM====
By the late 1950s Shimon Peres had established and appointed a new intelligence service assigned to search the globe and clandestinely secure technology, materials and equipment needed for the program, by any means necessary. The new service would eventually be named [[Lekem|LEKEM]] (pronounced LAKAM, the Hebrew acronym for ‘Science liaison Bureau’). Peres appointed IDF Internal Security Chief, Benjamin Blumberg, to the task. As head of the LEKEM, Blumberg would rise to become a key figure in Israel’s intelligence community, coordinating agents worldwide and securing the crucial components for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite   news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=179209 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625043534/http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=179209 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 25, 2010 |title=Netanyahu: Pollard acted as Israeli agent |last=Hoffman |first=Gil |date=June 22, 2010 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |quote=One of those agents, [[Arnon Milchan]], was considered among the most successful and prolific agents who secured items such a [[uranium enrichment]] centrifuges and [[Krytron]] nuclear triggers, would latter become one of the most successful movie producers in [[Hollywood]] history. |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/business/global/new-book-tells-tale-of-israeli-arms-dealer-in-hollywood.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=New Book Tells Tale of Israeli Arms Dealer in Hollywood | date=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/world/israel/lekem/index.html "Lekem"] Federation of American Scientists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/pollard1.html "Report of an Investigation Commission on the Pollard Case"] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rift between Israel and France====
When [[Charles de Gaulle]] became [[French President]] in late 1958 he wanted to end French–Israeli nuclear cooperation, and said that he would not supply Israel with uranium unless the plant was opened to international inspectors, declared peaceful, and no plutonium was reprocessed.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 73–4}}  Through an extended series of negotiations, Shimon Peres finally reached a compromise with Foreign Minister [[Maurice Couve de Murville]] over two years later, in which French companies would be able to continue to fulfill their contract obligations and Israel would declare the project peaceful.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 75}}  Due to this, French assistance did not end until 1966.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 70}}  However the supply of uranium fuel was stopped earlier, in 1963.&lt;ref name=nsa-20130625/&gt; Despite this, a French uranium company based in [[Gabon]] may have sold Israel uranium in 1965. The US government launched an investigation but was unable to determine if such a sale had taken place.&lt;ref name=FP/&gt;

Britain was challenged about the heavy water deal at the International Atomic Energy Agency after it was exposed on Newsnight in 2005. British Foreign Minister [[Kim Howells]] claimed this was a sale to Norway. But a former [[British intelligence]] officer who investigated the deal at the time confirmed that this was really a sale to Israel and the Noratom contract was just a charade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Meirion|last=Jones|date=March 13, 2006|title=Britain's dirty secret | accessdate = July 2, 2006|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200603130011| publisher= [[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] finally admitted in March 2006 that Britain knew the destination was Israel all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Statement from the Foreign Office|work= Newsnight | date = March 9, 2006| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4791360.stm| accessdate = July 2, 2006 | publisher =BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel admits running the Dimona reactor with Norway's heavy water since 1963.

===Criticality===
In 1961, the [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] informed the [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[John Diefenbaker]] that a pilot plutonium-separation plant would be built at Dimona. British intelligence concluded from this and other information that this "can only mean that Israel intends to produce nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name = "JIC/1103/61" /&gt; The nuclear reactor at Dimona [[critical mass|went critical]] in 1962.{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}} After Israel's rupture with France, the Israeli government reportedly reached out to Argentina. The Argentine government agreed to sell Israel [[yellowcake]] (uranium oxide).&lt;ref name=FP&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Report-Argentina-sold-Israel-yellowcake-uranium-in-the-1960s-318432 'Argentina sold Israel yellowcake uranium in 1960s'] – ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=10425 Report: Argentina sold yellowcake to Israel for nuclear program] – ''[[Israel Hayom]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1963 and 1966, about 90 tons of yellowcake were allegedly shipped to Israel from Argentina in secret.&lt;ref name=nsa-20130625&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb432/ |title=The Israel-Argentina Yellowcake Connection |publisher=George Washington University |work=National Security Archive |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965 the Israeli reprocessing plant was completed and ready to convert the reactor's [[fuel rod]]s into [[weapons grade plutonium]].{{Sfn | Hersh | p = 130}}

====Costs====
The exact costs for the construction of the Israeli nuclear program are unknown, though Peres later said that the reactor cost $80 million in 1960,{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 70}} half of which was raised by foreign Jewish donors, including many American Jews. Some of these donors were given a tour of the Dimona complex in 1968.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 66–7}}

===Weapons production 1966–present===
[[File:Nuclear reactor in dimona (israel).jpg|thumb|right|Completed Dimona complex as seen by US [[Corona (satellite)|Corona satellite]] on November 11, 1968]]
Israel is believed to have begun full-scale production of nuclear weapons following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], although it had built its first operational nuclear weapon by December 1966.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; A [[CIA]] report from early 1967 stated that Israel had the materials to construct a bomb in six to eight weeks{{Sfn |Cohen |1998 |p=298}} and some authors suggest that Israel had two crude bombs ready for use during the war.{{Sfn|Farr|1999}} According to US journalist [[Seymour Hersh]], everything was ready for production at this time save an official order to do so. Israel crossed the nuclear threshold on the eve of the Six-Day War in May 1967. "[Prime Minister Levi] Eshkol, according to a number of Israeli sources, secretly ordered the Dimona [nuclear reactor] scientists to assemble two crude nuclear devices. He placed them under the command of Brigadier General Yitzhak Yaakov, the chief of research and development in Israel's Defense Ministry. One official said the operation was referred to as Spider because the nuclear devices were inelegant contraptions with appendages sticking out. The crude atomic bombs were readied for deployment on trucks that could race to the Egyptian border for detonation in the event Arab forces overwhelmed Israeli defenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/israels-nuclear-weapons-program-and-lessons-iran|title=Israel’s Nuclear Weapons Program and Lessons for Iran|author=|date=|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another CIA report from 1968 states that "Israel might undertake a nuclear weapons program in the next several years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001211143/DOC_0001211143.pdf|title=Special National Intelligence Estimate 11-12-68: Emplacement of Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed|date=August 15, 1968|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105065948/http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001211143/DOC_0001211143.pdf|archivedate=November 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe Dayan]], then Defense Minister, believed that nuclear weapons were cheaper and more practical than indefinitely growing Israel's conventional forces.&lt;ref name="time19760412"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,914023,00.html |title=Violent Week: The Politics of Death |accessdate=March 4, 2011 |date=April 12, 1976 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; He convinced the Labor Party's economic boss [[Pinchas Sapir]] of the value of commencing the program by giving him a tour of the Dimona site in early 1968, and soon after Dayan decided that he had the authority to order the start of full production of four to five nuclear warheads a year. Hersh stated that it is widely believed that the words "[[Never Again (disambiguation)#Other uses|Never Again]]" were welded, in English and Hebrew, onto the first warhead.{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|p=179–80}}

In order to produce plutonium the Israelis needed a large supply of [[uraninite|uranium ore]]. In 1968, the [[Mossad]] purchased 200 tons from [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] mining company, on the pretense of buying it for an Italian chemical company in [[Milan]]. Once the uranium was shipped from [[Antwerp]] it was transferred to an Israeli freighter at sea and brought to Israel. The orchestrated disappearance of the uranium, named [[Operation Plumbat]], became the subject of the 1978 book ''The Plumbat Affair''.{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|p=181}}

Estimates as to how many warheads Israel has built since the late 1960s have varied, mainly based on the amount of fissile material that could have been produced and on the revelations of Israeli nuclear technician [[Mordechai Vanunu]].

[[File:Vanunu-glove-box-bomb-components.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mordechai Vanunu]]'s photograph of a [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] glove box containing nuclear materials in a model bomb assembly, one of about 60 photographs he later gave to the British press]]
By 1969, [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Melvin Laird]] believed that Israel might have a nuclear weapon that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cohen |first1=Avner |last2=Burr |first2=William |title=Israel crosses the threshold |date=May–June 2006|pages=22–30|work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |url=http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/606516727155388r/?p=42d4b8aee86d4f51a7ddfbd9b818289c&amp;pi=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Melvin |last=Laird |authorlink=Melvin Laird |title=Stopping the introduction of nuclear weapons into the Middle East |work=Memorandum to the secretary of state |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=March 17, 1969 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB189/IN-06.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] pressed Israel to "make no visible introduction of nuclear weapons or undertake a [[nuclear test]] program", so maintaining a policy of nuclear ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Henry |last=Kissinger |authorlink=Henry Kissinger |title=Discussions with the Israelis on nuclear matters |work=Memorandum for the President |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=October 7, 1969 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB189/IN-22.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Yom Kippur War]], Peres nonetheless wanted Israel to publicly demonstrate its nuclear capability to discourage an Arab attack, and fear of Israeli nuclear weapons may have discouraged Arab military strategy during the war from being as aggressive as it could have been.&lt;!--"1967" in the cite is almost certainly an error for "1973", given the context--&gt;{{Sfn|Farr|1999}}

The CIA believed that Israel's first bombs may have been made with [[highly enriched uranium]] stolen in the mid-1960s from the [[U.S. Navy]] nuclear fuel plant operated by the [[The Apollo Affair|Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation]], where sloppy material accounting would have masked the theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17104|title=Israel's Bomb|first=Victor (former Commissioner U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) |last=Gilinsky |publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=May 13, 2004 |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |type=image |format=[[JPEG]] |publisher=Iran affairs |url=http://iranaffairs.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/israel_stole_uranium.jpg |title=CIA said in 1974 Israel had A-bombs |first=David |last=Burnham |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 27, 1978 |page=A5 |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;!-- June 27 date on image is incorrect per New York Times website: https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60E16FE355A13728DDDAE0A94D9405B888BF1D3   and http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60E16FE355A13728DDDAE0A94D9405B888BF1D3--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence community]] believed Israel had stockpiled a small number of [[fission weapon]]s,&lt;ref name=SNIE-4-1-74&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB240/snie.pdf|series=Special National Intelligence Estimate|format=[[PDF]] |title=Prospects for Further Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|publisher=[[CIA]]|date=August 23, 1974|id=SNIE 4-1-74|accessdate=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1979 were perhaps in a position to test a more advanced small [[tactical nuclear weapon]] or [[thermonuclear weapon]] trigger design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The 22 September 1979 Event |series=Interagency Intelligence Memorandum |id=MORI DocID: 1108245 |format=PDF |pages=5, 9 (paragraphs 4, 26) |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=December 1979 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB190/03.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA believed that the number of Israeli nuclear weapons stayed from 10 to 20 from 1974 until the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="FAS" /&gt; Vanunu's information in October 1986 said that based on a reactor operating at 150 megawatts and a production of 40&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium per year, Israel had 100 to 200 nuclear devices. Vanunu revealed that between 1980 and 1986 Israel attained the ability to build [[thermonuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name=sunday-times-20040421&gt;{{cite news|title=Mordechai Vanunu: The Sunday Times articles |work=The Times |date=April 21, 2004 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1-1081668,00.html |accessdate=July 2, 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513150116/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C1-1081668%2C00.html |archivedate=May 13, 2006 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 2000s estimates of Israel's arsenal ranged from 75 to 400 nuclear warheads.&lt;ref name="FAS" /&gt;{{Sfn|Brower|1997}}

Several reports have surfaced claiming that Israel has some [[uranium enrichment]] capability at Dimona. Vanunu asserted that [[gas centrifuge]]s were operating in Machon 8, and that a laser enrichment plant was being operated in Machon 9 (Israel holds a 1973 patent on [[laser isotope separation (disambiguation)|laser isotope separation]]).

In 1991 alone, as the Soviet Union dissolved, nearly 20 top Jewish Soviet scientists reportedly emigrated to Israel, some of whom had been involved in operating nuclear power plants and planning for the next generation of Soviet reactors. In September 1992, German intelligence was quoted in the press as estimating that 40 top Jewish Soviet nuclear scientists had emigrated to Israel since 1989.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/Israel-nuclear-shopping.html |title=Israel's Nuclear Shopping List |date=July–August 1996 |journal=The Risk Report |volume=2 |number=4 |publisher=Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview, Uzi Eilam, former head of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission, told the Israeli daily ''[[Maariv]]'' that the nuclear reactor in Dimona had been through extensive improvements and renovations and is now functioning as new, with no safety problems or hazard to the surrounding environment or the region.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Citation |first=Sara |last=Leibovitz-Dar |title=This secret is fiction |newspaper=Maariv-Amusaf Le'Shabat |date=May 21, 2010 |pages=10–3 |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/109/204.html |publisher=NRG}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the [[USAF Counterproliferation Center|US Air Force Counterproliferation Center]], much lateral proliferation happened between pre-nuclear Israel and France, stating "the French nuclear test in 1960 made two nuclear powers, not one—such was the depth of collaboration" and that "the Israelis had unrestricted access to French nuclear test explosion data," minimizing the need for early Israeli testing, although this cooperation cooled following the success of the French tests.{{Sfn|Farr|1999}}

In June 1976, a West Germany army magazine, ''Wehrtechnik'' ("military technology"), claimed that Western intelligence reports documented Israel conducting an underground test in the Negev in 1963. The book ''Nuclear Weapons in the Middle East: Dimensions and Responsibilities'' by Taysir Nashif cites other reports that on November 2, 1966, the country may have carried out a non-nuclear test, speculated to be zero yield or [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]] in nature in the Israeli [[Negev]] desert.&lt;ref name="FAS" /&gt;{{Sfn|Farr|1999}}

On September 22, 1979, Israel may have been involved in a possible nuclear bomb test, also known as the [[Vela Incident]], in the southern Indian Ocean. A committee was set up under then-U.S. president Jimmy Carter, headed by Professor [[Jack Ruina]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Most of the committee's members assumed that South African navy vessels had sailed out of [[Simonstown]] port, near [[Cape Town]], to a secret location in the Indian Ocean, where they conducted the nuclear test. The committee defined the nuclear device tested as compact and especially clean, emitting little radioactive fallout, making it very nearly impossible to pinpoint. Another committee assessment concluded a cannon had fired a nuclear artillery shell, and the detected test was focused on a small tactical nuclear weapon. After [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|renouncing their nuclear weapons program]] South Africa was revealed to only have six large, primitive, aircraft-deliverable atomic bombs with a seventh being built, but no sophisticated miniaturized devices of the artillery shell size.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/did-israel-play-a-role-in-1979-south-africa-nuclear-test-1.281226|title=Did Israel play a role in 1979 South Africa nuclear test?|date=August 2, 2009|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what they called the "Last Secret of the Six-Day War", ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that in the days before the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] Israel planned to insert a team of paratroopers by helicopter into the [[Sinai]] set up and remote detonate a nuclear bomb on command from the prime minister and military command on a mountaintop as a warning to belligerent surrounding states. The greatly outnumbered Jewish state in a surprising turn of events effectively eliminated the [[Egyptian Air Force]] and occupied the Sinai winning the war before the test could even be set up. Retired Israeli brigadier general Itzhak Yaakov referred to this operation as the Israeli [[Samson Option]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/world/middleeast/1967-arab-israeli-war-nuclear-warning.html|title=‘Last Secret’ of 1967 War: Israel’s Doomsday Plan for Nuclear Display |first1=William J.|last1=Broad|first2=David E.|last2=Sanger|date=June 3, 2017|accessdate=June 5, 2017|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneering American nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] commented on the uncertainties involved in the process of boosting small fission weapons and the thermonuclear designs seen in the Vanunu leaked photographs. He stated that these designs required more than theoretical analysis for full confidence in the weapons' performance. Taylor therefore concluded that Israel had "unequivocally" tested an advanced series miniaturized nuclear device.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/israel-aims.html |title=Israel Aims to Improve Missile Accuracy|work=Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control|date=June 1995 |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003212249/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/israel-aims.html |archivedate=October 3, 2014 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelations==

===Negev Nuclear Research Center (Dimona)===
{{main article|Negev Nuclear Research Center}}
The Israeli nuclear program was first revealed publicly on December 13, 1960, in a small ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873321,00.html The Nth Power]", ''Time'' magazine, December 19, 1960. Retrieved July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which said that a non-[[Communist]] non-[[NATO]] country had made an "atomic development". On December 16, the ''[[Daily Express]]'' revealed this country to be Israel, and on December 18, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] chairman [[John McCone]] appeared on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' to officially confirm the Israeli construction of a nuclear reactor and announce his resignation.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p =  72}}  The following day ''[[The New York Times]]'', with the help of McCone, revealed that France was assisting Israel.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 88–9}}

The news led Ben-Gurion to make the only statement by an Israeli Prime Minister about Dimona. On December 21 he announced to the [[Knesset]] that the government was building a 24 megawatt reactor "which will serve the needs of industry, agriculture, health, and science", and that it "is designed exclusively for peaceful purposes".{{Sfn | Cohen | 1991 | p = 91}}  Bergmann, who was chairman of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1954 to 1966, however said that "There is no distinction between nuclear energy for peaceful purposes or warlike ones"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=3&amp;cid=1222017486941&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | title = One on One: Existential espionage | newspaper = Jerusalem Post | accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "We shall never again be led as lambs to the slaughter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Gallagher | title= Israel and Palestine | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir-iUPZZJ-0C&amp;pg=PT26 | accessdate = June 4, 2011 |date=July 30, 2005 |publisher=Black Rabbit Books |isbn=978-1-58340-605-2 |pages = 26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons production===
The first public revelation of Israel's nuclear capability (as opposed to development program) came from [[NBC News]], which reported in January 1969 that Israel decided "to embark on a crash course program to produce a nuclear weapon" two years previously, and that they possessed or would soon be in possession of such a device.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 327}}  This was initially dismissed by Israeli and U.S. officials, as well as in an article in ''The New York Times''. Just one year later on July 18, ''The New York Times'' made public for the first time that the [[U.S. government]] believed Israel to possess nuclear weapons or to have the "capacity to assemble atomic bombs on short notice".{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 338}}  Israel reportedly assembled 13 bombs during the [[Yom Kippur War]] as a last defense against total defeat, and kept them usable after the war.{{r |time19760412}}

The first extensive details of the weapons program came in the London-based [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''Sunday Times'']] on October 5, 1986, which printed information provided by [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a technician formerly employed at the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] near [[Dimona]]. For publication of state secrets Vanunu was [[kidnap]]ped by the [[Mossad]] in Rome, brought back to Israel, and sentenced to 18 years in prison for [[treason]] and [[espionage]].  Although there had been much speculation prior to Vanunu's revelations that the Dimona site was creating nuclear weapons, Vanunu's information indicated that Israel had also built [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref name = sunday-times-20040421 /&gt;

[[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]], a former U.S. weapon designer leading the field in small, efficient nuclear weapons, reviewed the 1986 leaks and photographs of the Israeli nuclear program by Mordechai Vanunu in detail. Taylor concluded that Israel's thermonuclear weapon designs appeared to be "less complex than those of other nations," and as of 1986 "not capable of producing yields in the megaton or higher range." Nevertheless, "they may produce at least several times the yield of fission weapons with the same quantity of plutonium or highly enriched uranium." In other words, Israel could "boost" the yield of its nuclear fission weapons. According to Taylor, the uncertainties involved in the process of boosting required more than theoretical analysis for full confidence in the weapons' performance. Taylor therefore concluded that Israel had "unequivocally" tested a miniaturized nuclear device. The [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA) concluded after reviewing the evidence given by Vanunu that as of 1987, "the Israelis are roughly where the U.S. was in the fission weapon field in about 1955 to 1960." and would require supercomputers or parallel computing clusters to refine their hydrogen bomb designs for improved yields without testing, though noting they were already then developing the computer code base required.&lt;ref name="wisconsinproject.org"/&gt;  Israel was first permitted to import US built supercomputers beginning in November 1995.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

According to a 2013 report by the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', which cited US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] figures, Israel began the production of nuclear weapons in 1967, when it produced its first two nuclear bombs. According to the report's calculations, Israel produced nuclear weapons at an average rate of two per year, and stopped production in 2004. The report stated that Israel has 80 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce 190 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-80-nuclear-warheads-report-says/|title=Israel has 80 nuclear warheads, report says|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4429556,00.html|title=Report: Israel halted nuclear warheads production in 2004|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, former US president [[Jimmy Carter]] stated that "Israel has, what, 300 or more, nobody knows exactly how many" nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="israelhayom.com"&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=16847 Carter says Israel has stockpile of over 300 nuclear bombs] by Yoni Hirsch and Israel Hayom Staff, [[Israel Hayom]], April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===South African documents===
{{see also|Israel–South Africa relations|South Africa and weapons of mass destruction}}
In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' released South African government documents that it alleged confirmed the existence of Israel's nuclear arsenal. According to the newspaper, the documents are minutes taken by the South African side of alleged meetings between senior officials from the two countries in 1975. ''The Guardian'' alleged that these documents reveal that Israel had offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons that year. The documents appeared to confirm information disclosed by a former South African naval commander [[Dieter Gerhardt]] – jailed in 1983 for spying for the Soviet Union, who said there was an agreement between Israel and South Africa involving an offer by Israel to arm eight Jericho missiles with atomic bombs.&lt;ref name= "McGreal"&gt;{{cite news | title = Revealed: how Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/23/israel-south-africa-nuclear-weapons | newspaper = The Guardian| date= May 24, 2010| location= London | first= Chris | last = McGreal | accessdate = May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The memos and minutes that confirm Israel's nuclear stockpile | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/23/israel-south-africa-nuclear-documents | newspaper = The Guardian | date=May 24, 2010 | location=London | first= Chris | last= McGreal | accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Waldo Stumpf—who led a project to dismantle [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa's nuclear weapons program]]&lt;ref&gt;Von Wielligh, N. &amp; von Wielligh-Steyn, L. (2015). The Bomb – South Africa’s Nuclear Weapons Programme. Pretoria: Litera.&lt;/ref&gt;—doubted Israel or South Africa would have contemplated a deal seriously, saying that Israel could not have offered to sell nuclear warheads to his country due to the serious international complications that such a deal could entail. [[Shimon Peres]], former Israeli President and then Defense Minister, has rejected the newspaper's claim that the negotiations took place. He also asserted that ''The Guardian''’s conclusions were "based on the selective interpretation of South African documents and not on concrete facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3893589,00.html | newspaper = Ynet news | date = May 24, 2010 | title = S.

Avner Cohen, author of ''Israel and the Bomb'' and ''The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb'', said "Nothing in the documents suggests there was an actual offer by Israel to sell nuclear weapons to the regime in [[Pretoria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/avner-cohen-yitzhak-rabin-would-have-opposed-sale-of-nuclear-weapons-1981962.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Avner Cohen: Yitzhak Rabin would have opposed sale of nuclear weapons | date=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US pressure===
{{main article|Israel–United States relations}}
The United States was concerned over possible Israeli nuclear proliferation. US intelligence began to notice the Dimona reactor shortly after construction began, when American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes overflew the reactor,&lt;ref name=relevance&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/policy-library|title=Policy Library|author=|date=|website=NRDC|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a diplomatic clash. In 1960, the outgoing [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration asked the Israeli government for an explanation for the mysterious construction near Dimona. Israel's response was that the site was a future textile factory, but that no inspection would be allowed. When Ben-Gurion visited Washington in 1960, he held a series of meetings with [[United States Department of State|State Department]] officials, and was bluntly told that for Israel to possess nuclear weapons would affect the balance of power in the region.&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt; After [[John F. Kennedy]] took office as US President in 1961, he put continuous pressure on Israel to open the plant to American inspection. Reportedly, every high-level meeting and communication between the US and Israeli governments contained a demand for an inspection of Dimona. To increase pressure, Kennedy denied Ben-Gurion a meeting at the [[White House]] – when they met in May 1961, it was at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York. The meeting itself was dominated by this issue. Ben-Gurion was evasive on the issue for two years, in the face of persistent US demands for an inspection. Finally, in a personal letter dated May 18, 1963, Kennedy threatened Israel with total isolation unless inspectors were allowed into Dimona. However, Ben-Gurion resigned as Prime Minister shortly afterward. His successor, [[Levi Eshkol]], received a similar letter from Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/When-Ben-Gurion-said-no-to-JFK When Ben-Gurion said no to JFK] – ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel eventually accepted an inspection, and Kennedy made two concessions – the US would sell Israel [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] anti-aircraft missiles after having refused to sell Israel any major weapon systems for years. In addition, the US government agreed to the Israeli demand that the inspections would be carried out by an all-American team which would schedule its visits weeks in advance, rather than the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]].

In 1964, the US government tried to prevent Argentina's sale of [[yellowcake]] to Israel, with no success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/07/01/israels_secret_uranium_buy|title=Israel’s Secret Uranium Buy|work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly, because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors' visits, it was able to disguise the true purpose of the reactor. The inspectors eventually reported that their inspections were useless, due to Israeli restrictions on what parts of the facility they could investigate. According to British writer and intelligence expert [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]], former [[Mossad]] agent [[Rafi Eitan]] told him how the inspectors were fooled:&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A bogus control center was built over the real one at Dimona, complete with fake control panels and computer-lined gauges that gave a credible impression of measuring the output of a reactor engaged in an irrigation scheme to turn the Negev into a lush pastureland. The area containing the "heavy" water smuggled from France and Norway was placed off-limits to the inspectors "for safety reasons". The sheer volume of heavy water would have been proof the reactor was being readied for a very different purpose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1968, the CIA stated in a top-secret National Intelligence Estimate that Israel had nuclear weapons. This assessment was given to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The basis for this claim was the CIA's belief, although never proven, that the uranium that went missing in the [[The Apollo Affair|Apollo Affair]] had been diverted to Israel (Seymour Hersh claims that during the plant decommissioning nearly all of the missing uranium was recovered trapped in the facility pipes or accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, Seymour (1991). The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and America's Foreign Policy. Random House. pp. 243, 250, 252, 255. {{ISBN|0-394-57006-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as evidence gathered from [[National Security Agency|NSA]] electronic eavesdropping on Israeli communications, which proved that the [[Israeli Air Force]] had engaged in practice bombing runs that only made sense for the delivery of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=relevance/&gt;

In 1969, the US government terminated the inspections. That same year, [[Richard Nixon]] became President. According to US government documents declassified in 2007, the Nixon administration was concerned with Israel's nuclear program, worrying that it could set off a regional nuclear arms race, with the [[Soviet Union]] possibly granting the Arab states a nuclear guarantee. In a memorandum dated July 19, 1969, National Security Adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] warned that "The Israelis, who are one of the few peoples whose survival is genuinely threatened, are probably more likely than almost any other country to actually use their nuclear weapons."  However, Kissinger warned that attempting to force Israel to disarm could have consequences, writing that "Israel will not take us seriously on the nuclear issue unless they believe we are prepared to withhold something they very much need" (Kissinger was referring to a pending sale of [[F-4 Phantom]] fighter jets to Israel). Kissinger wrote that "if we withhold the Phantoms and they make this fact public in the United States, enormous political pressure will be mounted on us. We will be in an indefensible position if we cannot state why we are withholding the planes. Yet if we explain our position publicly, we will be the ones to make Israel’s possession of nuclear weapons public with all the international consequences this entails." Among the suggestions Kissinger presented to Nixon was the idea of the United States adopting a policy of "nuclear ambiguity", or pretending not to know about Israel's nuclear program.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/world/middleeast/29nixon.html Israel's Nuclear Arsenal Vexed Nixon] – ''[[The New York Times]]'',  November 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Israeli historian [[Avner Cohen]], author of ''Israel and the Bomb'', historical evidence indicates that when Nixon met with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] at the White House in September 1969, they reached a secret understanding, where Israel would keep its nuclear program secret and refrain from carrying out nuclear tests, and the United States would tolerate Israel's possession of nuclear weapons and not press it to sign the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Stockpile==
The State of Israel has never made public any details of its nuclear capability or arsenal. The following is a history of estimates by many different sources on the size and strength of Israel's nuclear arsenal. Estimates may vary due to the amount of material Israel has on store versus assembled weapons, and estimates as to how much material the weapons actually use, as well as the overall time in which the reactor was operated.

In June 2002, former State Department and Pentagon officials confirmed that the US Navy observed Israeli missile tests in the Indian Ocean in 2000, and that the Dolphin-class vessels have been fitted with nuclear-capable cruise missiles of a new design. It is believed by some to be a version of [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems|Rafael]] Armament Development Authority's Popeye turbo cruise missile while some believe that the missile may be a version of the Gabriel 4LR that is produced by Israel Aircraft Industries. However, others claim that such a range implies an entirely new type of missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Ed | last = Blanche | title = Israel denies sub-launched missile tests | journal = Jane's Missile and Rockets | date = August 1, 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gabriel", ''Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems'', August 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Uzi | last1 = Mahnaimi | first2 = Matthew | last2 = Campbell | title = Israel Makes Nuclear Waves with Submarine Missile Test | newspaper = The Sunday Times | date = June 18, 2000 | place = London, England}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the second half of the 1990s, Israel asked the United States to sell it 50 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] land-attack cruise missiles to enhance its deep-strike capabilities.  Washington rejected Israel's request in March 1998, since such a sale would have violated the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] guidelines, which prohibit the transfer of missiles with a range exceeding 300&amp;nbsp;km. Shortly after the rejection, an Israeli official told [[Defense News]], "History has taught us that we cannot wait indefinitely for Washington to satisfy our military requirements.  If this weapon system is denied to us, we will have little choice but to activate our own defense industry in pursuit of this needed capability."  In July 1998, the Air Intelligence Center warned the US Congress that Israel was developing a new type of cruise missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Israel Moves — Quickly — To Beef Up Its Submarine Force | publisher = Stratfor | date = October 26, 2000 | url = http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/2526/analysis/israel_moves_quickly_beef_its_submarine_force}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Israeli defense sources, in June 2009 Israeli Dolphin-class submarine sailed from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Red Sea]] via the [[Suez Canal]] during a drill that showed that Israel can access the [[Indian Ocean]], and the Persian Gulf, far more easily than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=44342 | title = Israeli nuclear submarine sailed Suez Canal to the Red Sea | newspaper = World bulletin | date = July 3, 2009 | accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] sources said the decision to allow navy vessels to sail through the canal was made recently and was a definite "change of policy" within the service.  Israeli officials said the submarine was surfaced when it passed through the canal. In the event of a conflict with Iran, and if Israel decided to involve its Dolphin-class submarines, the quickest route would be to send them through the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5621XZ20090703 | work = Reuters | title=Israeli sub sails Suez, signaling reach to Iran | date=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli fleet was expanded after Israel signed a 1.3 billion euro contract to purchase two additional submarines from [[ThyssenKrupp|ThyssenKrupp's]] subsidiary [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]] in 2006. These two [[Type 212 submarine|U212s]] are to be delivered to the [[Israeli navy]] in 2011 and are "Dolphin II" class submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Siemens | type = brochure | url = http://www.industry.siemens.com/broschueren/pdf/marine/en/Electr_Equ_Nasal_Vess_Subm_en.pdf | title = Electrical Equipment for Naval Vessels and Submarines | format = PDF | accessdate = June 4, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The submarines are believed to be capable of launching cruise missiles carrying nuclear warheads, despite statements by the German government in 2006, in confirming the sale of the two vessels, that they were not equipped to carry nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4299455&amp;c=EUR&amp;s=SEA | title = Israel Takes Delivery of 2 German-Built U212 Subs | newspaper = Defense news | accessdate = June 4, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two new boats are an upgraded version of the old Dolphins, and equipped with an [[air-independent propulsion]] system, that allow them to remain submerged for longer periods of time than the three nuclear arms-capable submarines that have been in Israel's fleet since 1999.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plushnick-Masti, Ramit.

==Policy==
{{main article|Policy of deliberate ambiguity}}
Israel's deliberately ambiguous policy to confirm or deny its own possession of nuclear weapons, or to give any indication regarding their potential use, make it necessary to gather details from other sources, including diplomatic and intelligence sources and 'unauthorized' statements by its political and military leaders. Alternatively, with the [[Begin Doctrine]], Israel is very clear and decisive regarding the country's policy on potential developments of nuclear capability by any other regional adversaries, which it will not allow.

===Possession===
Although Israel has officially acknowledged the existence of Dimona since Ben-Gurion's speech to the Knesset in December 1960, Israel has never officially acknowledged its construction or possession of nuclear weapons.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 343}}  In addition to this policy, on May 18, 1966, Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] told the Knesset that "Israel has no atomic weapons and will not be the first to introduce them into our region," a policy first articulated by Shimon Peres to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in April 1963.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 233–4}}  In the late 1960s, Israeli Ambassador to the US [[Yitzhak Rabin]] informed the [[United States State Department]] that its understanding of "introducing" such weapons meant that they would be tested and publicly declared, while merely possessing the weapons did not constitute "introducing" them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Avner | last1 = Cohen | first2 = William | last2 = Burr | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042801326_pf.html | title = The Untold Story of Israel's Bomb | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = April 30, 2006 | page = B01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= kissinger-19690716&gt;{{Citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://nixon.archives.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/mr/071969_israel.pdf | title =Memorandum for the President: Israeli Nuclear Program | first = Henry A | last = Kissinger | date= July 16, 1969| publisher= The White House| accessdate = July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avner Cohen defines this initial posture as "nuclear ambiguity", but he defines the stage after it became clear by 1970 that Israel possessed nuclear weapons as a policy of ''amimut'',&lt;ref name = "goldberg201009"&gt;Goldberg, Jeffrey. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2010/09/the-point-of-no-return/8186/ The Point of No Return]" ''The Atlantic'', September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or "nuclear opacity".{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 277, 291}}

In 1998, former Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] said that Israel "built a nuclear option, not in order to have a [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] but an [[Oslo Accords|Oslo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Federation of American Scientists| title= Peres admits to Israeli nuclear capability| date = July 14, 1998|url=https://fas.org/news/israel/980714-israel1.htm|accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "nuclear option" may refer to a nuclear weapon or to the nuclear reactor near Dimona, which Israel claims is used for scientific research. Peres, in his capacity as the Director General of the Ministry of Defense in the early 1950s, was responsible for building Israel's nuclear capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel and the Bomb: Principal players|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/israel/players.htm|accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2006 interview, [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ehud Olmert]] stated that Iran aspires "to have a nuclear weapon as America, France, Israel and Russia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate = December 11, 2006 | title = Olmert: Iran wants nuclear weapons like Israel| newspaper = Y net news | url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3338783,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olmert's office later said that the quote was taken out of context; in other parts of the interview, Olmert refused to confirm or deny Israel's nuclear weapon status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate= December 11, 2006| title= Olmert Says Israel Among Nuclear Nations| url = https://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2006/12/11/ap3245636.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215001309/http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2006/12/11/ap3245636.html |archivedate = December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrine===
{{main article|Nuclear strategy|Deterrence theory|Assured destruction}}
Israel's nuclear doctrine is shaped by its lack of strategic depth: a subsonic fighter jet could cross the {{convert |72|km|nmi}} from the [[Jordan River]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in just 4 minutes.  It additionally relies on a reservist-based military which magnifies civilian and military losses in its small population. Israel tries to compensate for these weaknesses by emphasising [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], maneuverability and firepower.&lt;ref name=doctrine&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/israel/doctrine.htm | title=Strategic Doctrine| publisher = Global Security | date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, its strategy is based on the premise that it cannot afford to lose a single war, and thus must prevent them by maintaining deterrence, including the option of [[preemptive war|preemption]]. If these steps are insufficient, it seeks to prevent escalation and determine a quick and decisive war outside of its borders.&lt;ref name=doctrine /&gt;

Strategically, Israel's long-range missiles, nuclear-capable aircraft, and possibly its submarines present an effective [[second strike]] deterrence against unconventional and conventional attack, and if Israel's defences fail and its population centers are threatened, the [[Samson Option]], an all-out attack against an adversary, would be employed. Its nuclear arsenal can also be used tactically to destroy military units on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=doctrine /&gt;

Although nuclear weapons are viewed as the ultimate guarantor of Israeli security, as early as the 1960s the country has avoided building its military around them, instead pursuing absolute conventional superiority so as to forestall a last-resort nuclear engagement.&lt;ref name=doctrine /&gt;

According to historian [[Avner Cohen]], Israel first articulated an official policy on the use of nuclear weapons in 1966, which revolved around four "red lines" that could lead to a nuclear response:{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 237}}
# A successful military penetration into populated areas within Israel's [[Green Line (Israel)|post-1949 (pre-1967) borders]].
# The destruction of the [[Israeli Air Force]].
# The exposure of Israeli cities to massive and devastating air attacks or to possible [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological]] attacks.
# The use of nuclear weapons against Israeli territory.

===Deployment===
Seymour Hersh alleges weapons were deployed on several occasions. On October 8, 1973, just after the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]], [[Golda Meir]] and her closest aides decided to put eight nuclear armed [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4s]] at [[Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base|Tel Nof Airbase]] on 24-hour alert and as many nuclear missile launchers at [[Sedot Mikha Airbase]] operational as possible. Seymour Hersh adds that the initial target list that night "included the Egyptian and Syrian military headquarters near [[Cairo]] and [[Damascus]]".{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 225}}  This nuclear alert was meant not only as a means of precaution, but to push the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s to restrain the Arab offensive and to convince the US to begin sending supplies. One later report said that a [[Soviet intelligence]] officer did warn the Egyptian chief of staff, and colleagues of US National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] said that the threat of a nuclear exchange caused him to urge for a [[Operation Nickel Grass|massive Israeli resupply]].{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 227, 230}}  Hersh points out that before Israel obtained its own satellite capability, it engaged in [[espionage]] against the United States to obtain nuclear targeting information on Soviet targets.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 17, 216, 220, 286, 291–96}}

After [[Iraq]] attacked Israel with [[Scud|Scud missile]]s during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], Israel went on full-scale nuclear alert and mobile nuclear missile launchers were deployed.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1998a | p = 318}}  In the buildup to the United States [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], there were concerns that Iraq would launch an unconventional weapons attack on Israel. After discussions with President [[George W. Bush]], the then Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] warned "If our citizens are attacked seriously — by a [[weapon of mass destruction]], chemical, biological or by some mega-terror attack act — and suffer casualties, then Israel will respond." Israeli officials interpreted President Bush's stance as allowing a nuclear Israeli retaliation on Iraq, but only if Iraq struck before the U.S. military invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Ross | last = Dunn | url = http://www.news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1223502002 | title = Sharon eyes 'Samson option' against Iraq | newspaper = The Scotsman | date = November 3, 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli military and nuclear doctrine increasingly focused on [[preemptive war]] against any possible attack with conventional, chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, or even a potential conventional attack on [[Israel's weapons of mass destruction]].{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Louis René | last = Beres | author-link = Louis René Beres | url = http://www.acpr.org.il/english-nativ/issue1/beres-1.htm | publisher = ACR | place = [[Israel|IL]] | title = Israel's Bomb in the Basement: Reconsidering a Vital Element of Israeli Nuclear Deterrence | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis René Beres]], who contributed to [[Project Daniel]], urges that Israel continue and improve these policies, in concert with the increasingly preemptive nuclear policies of the United States, as revealed in the [[Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Louis René | last = Beres | author-link = Louis René Beres | url = http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/beres.htm | publisher = Army | title = Israel's Uncertain Strategic Future | journal = Parameters |date=Spring 2007 | place =United States| pages = 37–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintaining nuclear superiority===
Alone or with other nations, Israel has used diplomatic and military efforts as well as covert action to prevent other Middle Eastern countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Ze'ev | last = Schiff | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=18387 | title = Israel Urges US Diplomacy on Iran | publisher = Carnegie Endowment | date = May 30, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and United Nations' Resolutions===
Israel was originally expected to sign the 1968 [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) and on June 12, 1968, Israel voted in favor of the treaty in the [[UN General Assembly]].

However, when the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August by the Soviet Union delayed ratification around the world, Israel's internal division and hesitation over the treaty became public.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 300–1}} The [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson administration]] attempted to use the sale of 50 [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]] to pressure Israel to sign the treaty that fall, culminating in a personal letter from [[Lyndon Johnson]] to Israeli Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]]. But by November Johnson had backed away from tying the F-4 sale with the NPT after a stalemate in negotiations, and Israel would neither sign nor ratify the treaty.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 315}}  After the series of negotiations, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security [[Paul Warnke]] was convinced that Israel already possessed nuclear weapons.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 318–9}}  In 2007 Israel sought an exemption to non-proliferation rules in order to import atomic material legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=George |last=Jahn |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j_4W7czAS_qwahtut4_GkhQ3iuCQ |title=Israel Seeks Exemption From Atomic Rules |publisher=The Associated Press |date=September 25, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement to the May 2009 preparatory meeting for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, the US delegation reiterated the longstanding US support for "universal adherence to the NPT", but uncharacteristically named Israel among the four countries that have not done so.  An unnamed Israeli official dismissed the suggestion that it would join the NPT and questioned the effectiveness of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20090506_1113.php | title = Stronger Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Needed, Obama Says | newspaper = Global Security Newswire | date = May 6, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Washington Times]]'' reported that this statement threatened to derail the 40-year-old secret agreement between the US and Israel to shield Israel's nuclear weapons program from international scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lake | first = Eli | url = http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/06/us-weighs-forcing-israel-to-disclose-nukes/ | title = Secret US-Israel Nuclear Accord In Jeopardy | newspaper = [[The Washington Times]] | date = May 6, 2009 | page = 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Cohen, by not stating that Israel has atomic weapons, the US avoids having to sanction the country for violating American non-proliferation law.&lt;ref name="politico20161208"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/1979-vela-incident-nuclear-test-israel-south-africa-214507 |title=What the U.S. Government Really Thought of Israel’s Apparent 1979 Nuclear Test |last=Cohen |first=Abner |date=2016-12-08 |work=Politico |last2=Burr |first2=William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen, author of ''Israel and the Bomb'', argued that acknowledging its nuclear program would allow Israel to take part constructively in efforts to control nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/06/nuclear-ban-benefits-for-israel/ | title = Nuclear ban benefits for Israel | first = Avner | last = Cohen | newspaper = The Washington Times | date = May 6, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference called for a conference in 2012 to implement a resolution of the 1995 NPT Review Conference that called for the establishment of a Middle East Zone free of weapons of mass destruction.  The United States joined the international consensus for Final Document, but criticized the section on the Middle East resolution for singling out Israel as the only state in the region that is not party to the NPT, while at the same time ignoring Iran's "longstanding violation of the NPT and UN Security Council Resolutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-national-security-advisor-general-james-l-jones-non-proliferation-treaty- | type = statement | first = General James L | last = Jones | title = National Security Advisor on the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference | publisher = White House, Office of the Press Secretary | date = May 28, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8709">A '''physical training uniform''' is a military uniform used during exercise, calisthenics, drills, and in some cases, very casual periods of time (off-duty time during Initial Entry Training in the U.S. Army, for example). The [[United States Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] require use of a physical training (PT) uniform during unit exercise (including formation runs, [[calisthenics]], and conditioning exercises). Some military units produce unique T-shirts with their unit insignia and motto, and for special events, this shirt is part of the uniform. Occasionally, exercise will be conducted in that branch's [[Battledress|utility uniforms]], normally with the blouse removed and the undershirt exposed (also known as "''boots and utes''" {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} ).

The '''Society of Archivists''' ('''SoA'''), which was in existence from 1947 to 2010, was the principal professional body for [[archivist]]s, archive [[Art conservation|conservators]] and [[records manager]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]. In 2010 the Society amalgamated with the National Council on Archives (NCA) and the Association of Chief Archivists in Local Government (ACALG) to become the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland), otherwise known as the ARA. Of the three bodies which merged, the Society was by far the largest, and many of its structures and activities were inherited by the new body with little obvious change.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1947 as the '''Society of Local Archivists''', but changed its name to the Society of Archivists in 1954 due to its membership expanding beyond archivists working in [[local government]].

==Aims==
The Society was constituted as a registered charity with the express aim to:
* Foster the care and preservation of [[archive]]s in the [[public interest]] and to promote the better administration of [[archive|archive repositories]]
* Advance the professional education and training of Archivists, Archive Conservators and Records Managers and those engaged in related activities
* Commission and support research into the creation, use, administration and conservation of archives and the development of new techniques and the publication of the useful results of such research.

==Membership==
In 2010, the Society had over 2,000 members, mainly made up of professional archivists, records managers and archive conservators from all the different types of organisations that employ such professionals. Through an affiliate membership scheme, those who worked at a [[paraprofessional]] level or who were generally interested in the work of the Society and its members were also able to join. There was a student membership option for those who were studying for a professional qualification in archives, records management or archive conservation.

==Structure==
The Society was governed by a Council (partially elected every two years), along with a number of committees and sub-committees relating to specific areas of business. The membership was divided geographically into eleven regions spanning the UK and Ireland, each with its own regional committee. Seven special interest groups also existed, representing members’ different employment backgrounds and/or concerns.

The Society had an office in [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]], which dealt with day-to-day administration. In 2010, this was taken over by the Archives and Records Association.

==Publications==
The Society published a biannual publication entitled the ''Journal of the Society of Archivists'', covering mainly professional issues. After the creation of the Archives and Records Association in 2010, the title remained ''Journal of the Society of Archivists'' until 2012 (volume 33); after which, from 2013, the journal was retitled the ''Archives and Records: The Journal of the Archives and Records Association''.

The Society also published a monthly newsletter, ''ARC'' (Archives, Records Management, Conservation); and a fortnightly recruitment supplement called ''ARC Recruitment''. Periodically more in depth guides on particular types of records or professional issues were published.

==Training==
In terms of professional training for archives and records management, the Society accredited externally provided postgraduate diploma/degree programmes. For some twenty years the Society itself ran a [[distance-learning]] Diploma in Archives Administration, but this was discontinued in 2001.

For [[Book#Paper and conservation|archive conservation]], the Society ran a Certificate in Archive Conservation as an in-service scheme restricted to Society members only. It was also involved in the Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers (PAC-R) scheme.

Other training events for members were organised by the Regional committees or Special Interest Groups of the Society and co-ordinated by the Society’s Training Officer.

Professional members were encouraged to participate in the Society’s Registration Scheme, which acted as a formal process of [[Continuing Professional Development|continued professional development]]. A register was first established in 1987, initially with a clause allowing professional members to be accepted automatically if they had been working in a recognised post for at least two years. This clause was closed in 1996, and full completion of the scheme made the only way to become a Registered Member of the Society of Archivists (RMSA).

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Žižkov''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in a cadastral district [[Žižkov]] of [[Prague]]. The district has been split off. Since 2002 it belongs mainly to Praha 3, but smaller parts belong to Praha 8 and Praha 10. The district is named after [[Hussite]] military leader [[Jan Žižka]]. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeared.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

The '''Stolpersteine in Ratenice''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in [[Ratenice]] in the [[Central Bohemian Region]] (Czech: Středočeský kraj), the central part of Bohemia. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeareds.

&lt;small&gt;The lists are sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Tadeusz Korzon''' (1839—1918) was a [[historian]] specializing in the [[history of Poland]].

== Biography ==

Korzon was born to [[Poland|Polish]] parents in [[Lithuania]], and as a youth he studied law at [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Historians |last=Zawadzki |first=W. H. |editor=[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] |year=1988 |publisher=Basil Blackwell Ltd. |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-631-14708-X |page=227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in the [[January Uprising]] (1863-1865) of Poles against the Russian occupation ([[partitions of Poland]]) by organising pro-Polish patriotic demonstrations. After the defeat of the Uprising  he was sentenced to death, later changed to exile to [[Orenburg]] until 1867. Afterwards from 1869 he lived in Warsaw, where he became of the teachers in the [[Flying University]]. From 1897 he was the head librarian of the [[Biblioteka Zamojskich]]. From 1903 member of the [[Polska Akademia Umiejętności]].

== Works ==
* ''Kurs historyi wieków średnich'' (Warsaw, 1871),
* ''Nowe dzieje starożytnéj Mezopotamii i Iranu'' (1872),
* ''Historycy pozytywisci" and "Poranek filozofii greckiej'' (Bibl. Warszawska), 
* ''Ludzie przehistoriczny'' (Tygodn. Illustrow.), 
* ''Historyja starożytną'' (Warsaw, 1876),
* ''Stan ekonowiczny Polski w latach 1782—1792'' (Ateneum, 1877),
* ''O życiu umysłowlym Grecyi'' (Tygodn. Illustrow.), 
* ''Historyk w obec swego narodu i w obec ludzkości'' (1878)

His earliest work was related to the French and English system of punishments and was published in 1861. His main work was published by the Krakow academy of sciences "Wewnętrne dzieje Polski za Stanislawa-Augusta, 1764—94" (1882 - 1886) (4 tomes) and gave many new statistical, administrative and economic details about the internal life of Poland in the 18th century. One of his last works was the "Dzieje wojen i wojskowości w Polsce" (3 tomes) published in 1912.

The '''Tangaroa Expedition''' of 2006 closely resembled the [[Kon-Tiki]] expedition sailing a balsa raft from [[Peru]] to [[Polynesia]]. Tangaroa outperformed Kon-Tiki by having an improved sail rig and by actively using [[Guara (centerboard)|guaras (centerboards)]]. As such, the expedition represents a scientific continuation of [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s experiments in recreated maritime technology.&lt;ref&gt;Campoletti, P J [http://exarc.net/issue-2012-1/ea/theory-archaeological-raft-motivation-method-and-madness-experimental-archaeology "The Theory of the Archaeological Raft: Motivation, Method, and Madness in Experimental Archaeology"], ''[[EXARC]]'', Issue 2012/1. Retrieved on 19 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The raft was named after the Māori sea-god [[Tangaroa]]. Based on records of ancient vessels, the raft used a relatively sophisticated [[square sail]] that allowed sailing into the wind, or [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking]]. It was {{convert|16|m|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} wide. The raft also included a set of modern [[navigation]] and [[communication]] equipment, including [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]], [[portable computers]], and [[desalination]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Equipment on the Tangaroa included GPS (Global Positioning System), F-77 satellite antenna, AUS (Automatic Identification System), six solar panels to generate electricity, wind generators, desalination equipment, telephone, Internet, 3 Apple Mac iBook computers, DVD player and an iPod. [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai144_folder/144_graphics/kon_tiki_tangaroa_chart.jpg Azerbaijan International, Vol. 14:4] (Winter 2006), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The crew posted to their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangaroa.no |title=www.tangaroa.no |publisher=www.tangaroa.no |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangaroa's six-man crew was led by Norwegian [[Torgeir Sæverud Higraff|Torgeir Higraff]] and included [[Olav Heyerdahl]], grandson of [[Thor Heyerdahl]], Bjarne Krekvik (captain), Øyvin Lauten (executive officer), Swedish Anders Berg (photographer) and Peruvian Roberto Sala.&lt;ref&gt;Tangaroa Crew. Azerbaijan International, Vol 14:4 (Winter 2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Tangaroa was launched on the same day that Kon-Tiki had been—April 28—and it reached its destination on July 7, which was 30 days faster than Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki which had taken 101 days for the voyage. Tangaroa's speed was credited to the proper use of the quara centerboards in navigation. Heyerdahl had not known how to correctly use them.

A documentary, ''The Tangaroa Expedition'' (''Ekspedisionen Tangaroa''), was produced by Videomaker (Norwegian), 2007, shot by photographers Anders Berg and Jenssen.

The Chinese ''[[History of the Northern Dynasties]]'' states that the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalite]] emperor of the [[Gandhara]] state was from a ruling clan of the neighboring Tegin state. &lt;ref&gt;Zuev Yu.A. ''"The strongest tribe Esgil"'' //Materials of International Round Table, Almaty, 2004, p.44, {{ISBN|9965-699-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With time, the title ''tegin'' became a popular personal name, and now perseveres both as personal and family name, predominantly in the South Asia and Middle East areas.

'''''The Asaṭīr''''' ({{lang-ar|الاساطير}}), also known as ''The Samaritan Book of the "Secrets of Moses,"'' is a collection of Samaritan Biblical legends, parallel to the Jewish [[Midrash]], and which draws heavily upon [[oral traditions]] known among Jews in the 2nd and 3rd centuries [[Common Era|CE]]. [[Moses Gaster]] places its compilation about the middle or end of the third century [[Before the Common Era|BCE]], and rendered a translation of the work in 1927 with the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Gaster (ed.), Preface to ''The Asatir'', Royal Asiatic Society: London 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Others have said that its language style resembles more the Arabic language used by the scholar Ab Ḥisda [Isda] of Tyre (Abū'l-Ḥasan aṣ-Ṣūrī)&lt;ref&gt;Ab Isda (Ab Ḥisda) of Tyre of the eleventh century, also known by his [[Kunya (Arabic)|''kunya'']] '''أبو الحسن''' (Abu'l Ḥasan), to whom the authorship of the first (original) Samaritan Arabic translation is attributed, is the author of the '''كتاب الطباخ''' (''Kitāb aṭ-Ṭabbāḫ'') [see: ''JRUL'' Sam. codex 9A], the famous polemic treatise against Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Karaism. A certain number of prayers in late Aramaic are also ascribed unto him [see: ''SL'' 70–72, 79–81, 875–877].&lt;/ref&gt; in his poems of the eleventh century CE, and place its composition in the second-half of the tenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Crown (ed.), ''The Samaritans'', Tübingen: Mohr 1989, p. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=pzo6KAH3FmUC&amp;pg=PA466&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 466] {{ISBN|3-16-145237-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to Samaritan Studies'', ed. by Alan David Crown, ''et al.'' p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The book's title, ''Asatir'' (or ''Astir''), was thought by Gaster to mean "secrets," from which name, he applied to the book its newer title, "The Secrets of Moses." Even so, such an interpretation has nothing to do with the contents of the book, nor with its subject. A more precise translation of the Arabic title of the work, ''al-Asāṭīr'', would be "legends" or "tales," as in the Koranic expression ''asāṭīr al-Awwalīn'' ("the Legends of the Ancients").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', vol. 2, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. ''Al-Asatir'', pp. 510–511&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book's narrative covers the whole of the Pentateuch, starting with [[Adam]], the first man, and concluding with the death of [[Moses]], adding thereto anecdotal material not available in the Hebrew Bible. It deals mainly with the succession of personages from Adam to Moses, some 26 generations. The whole book is written around the story of their lives, as handed down by oral traditions. 

The book, preserved by the Samaritan community of [[Nablus]], compiled on parchment in late Samaritan [[Aramaic]] mixed with an antiquated Arabic vernacular, and divided into twelve chapters, was discovered by Gaster in 1907. Its antiquity is attested to by the fact that it was written when the vestiges of a "peculiar Samaritan Hebrew-Aramaic" was still in practice, and Arabic had only begun to supersede it. Since there is no evidence that Moses actually conveyed the oral traditions contained therein, various Samaritan writers merely refer to its author as "the Master of the Asatir," or the "Author of the Asatir" (''Baal Asatir''), leaving it undecided as to whether Moses had actually conveyed its legends. The book is therefore largely ascribed as being [[pseudepigraphic]]. The account tells of the [[Pharaoh]] at the time of Moses being from the progeny of [[Japheth]], rather than of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]].&lt;ref&gt;Moses Gaster (ed.), ''The Asatir: The Samaritan Book of the "Secrets of Moses"'', [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|The Royal Asiatic Society]]: London 1927, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The Pharaoh at the time of Joseph, the same account says, was from the progeny of [[Ishmael]].

==Literary style and content==
The epithet used to describe [[Nimrod]] in Genesis 10:8, namely, ''Gibbor'', is rendered by the author of ''The Asatir'' as "giant," rather than "mighty one."&lt;ref&gt;''The Asatir'' (ed. Moses Gaster), Character and Title of the Book, London 1927, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Asatir'', there were several kings, one in succession after the other, whose names were Nimrod. [[Seth]] is said to have built the city of Antokia ([[Antioch]]), one of the cities inhabited before the [[Great Deluge]], while Noah, after the Great Deluge, is said to have been buried in the [[Tomb of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]], along with Adam, the first man. The alleged burial-place of Adam mirrors that of Jewish tradition. 

Although in today's Modern Age it is near futile to trace the migration patterns of Noah's progeny because of mass-migrations of peoples, ''The Asatir'' describes the descendants of two of the sons of Shem, viz. Laud (Ld) and [[Arameans|Aram]], as having settled in a region of [[Afghanistan]] formerly known as [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (Charassan), but known by the Arabic-speaking peoples of Afrikia (North Africa) as simply "the isle" ([[Arabic Language|Arabic:]] ''Al-gezirah'').&lt;ref&gt;''The Asatir'' (ed. Moses Gaster), The Royal Asiatic Society: London 1927, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elam]] and [[Ashur]] are said to have settled in places north of [[Ur of the Chaldees]]. 

The first half of the 11th chapter contains a description of the borders of the Land of Israel, in which some of the place names mentioned are no longer identifiable. Some suggest that the author's familiarity with the geography of northern [[Erez Israel]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] leads to the conclusion that he may have lived in this region, where large Samaritan communities then flourished in Acre, Tyre, and Damascus.
===Traditions parallel with Jewish tradition===
While the author of ''The Asatir'' and Jewish traditions are in general agreement,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, ''The Origins and Evolution of the Moses Nativity Story'', E.J.Brill: Leiden 1993, pp. 137–ff {{ISBN|90-04-09652-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there are differences in minor details. For example, according to ''[[Seder Olam Rabba]]'', there were 340 years from the Great Deluge in the time of Noah (dated at 1656 ''[[anno mundi]]'') to the Division of the earth (dated at 1996 ''anno mundi'') when his sons were sent into their respective countries at the confounding of the languages, only ten years before the death of Noah, when he was aged 940. The Samaritan tradition, as conveyed by ''The Asatir'', avers differently, that Noah divided the earth among his three sons and their descendants some twenty years before his death, when he was aged 930.&lt;ref&gt;''The Asatir'' (ed. Moses Gaster), The Royal Asiatic Society: London 1927, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations of work==
Today, there exists an English translation of the work, made by [[Moses Gaster]]. A partial Hebrew translation was later published by Z. Ben-Ḥayyim, in 'The Book of Asatir', ''Tarbiẕ'' 14 (1943), 104–252, 174–190; ''Tarbiẕ'' 15 (1944), 71–87.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.jstor.org/journal/tarbiz ''Tarbiẕ''] - A Quarterly for Jewish Studies. Published by the Mandel Institute for Jewish Studies, Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; An Arabic translation was also made of the text, as also a Samaritan modern Hebrew translation, called ''Pitron''. An English translation of the Samaritan modern Hebrew translation, ''Pitron'', was made by Gaster.

'''Tovma Artsruni''' ({{lang-hy|Թովմա Արծրունի}}; also known in English-language historiography as '''Thomas Artsruni'''; precise birth date and date of death unknown) was a ninth-century to tenth-century [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[historian]] and author of the ''History of the House of Artsrunik'' ({{lang-hy|Պատմություն Արծրունյաց Տան}}). Contrary to the given title, the four-volume work not only relates the history of [[Artsruni]] royal family, of which he was a member of, and its origins near [[Lake Van]] but also comprehensively covers the history of Armenia.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} Vardanyan, Vrezh M. ''«Թովմա Արծրունի»'' (Tovma Artsruni). [[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]. vol. iv. Yerevan: Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1978, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Robert W.

[[Richard G. Hovannisian]] (ed.) New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997, p. 228. {{ISBN|0-312-10169-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''History of the House of Artsrunik''==
Tovma began writing ''History'' sometime in the 870s.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Much like other histories composed by Armenian historians, the first volume starts at the beginning of the Armenian nation and ends in the middle of the fifth century. However, Tovma's most valuable contributions are found in the second and third volumes which accurately detail Armenian life under the rule of the [[Arab]] [[Caliphates]] and in particular the 851 Arab military expedition led by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general [[Bugha al-Kabir]], its subsequent consequences, and the establishment of the independent [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia|Bagratid state]] north of Lake Van.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Tovma was a relative of the king of [[Vaspurakan]] [[Gagik I of Vaspurakan|Gagik I]],&lt;ref&gt;Redgate, Anne Elizabeth. ''The Armenians (The Peoples of Europe)''. Cornwall: Blackwell, 1998, p. 7. {{ISBN|0-631-22037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a detailed account in ''History'' about the famous palace and church Gagik constructed on [[Akhtamar]] Island.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson. "Armenian Literary Culture", p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise date that Tovma completed his work is unknown although some historians have determined that it was composed sometime after 905.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebeos]]. ''The Armenian History Attributed to Sebeos''. Trans. and edited by Robert W. Thomson, James Howard-Johnston, and Tim Greenwood. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1999, p. xxxv, n. 23. {{ISBN|0-85323-564-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tovma's work ends with an incomplete 29th chapter yet several unknown authors (referred to as "Anonymous"; {{lang-hy|Անանուն}}) took it upon themselves to continue ''History'' down to the 1370s and added an appendix and [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]].&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Tovma's ''History'' was first published in 1852 in [[Constantinople]] in Armenian and was subsequently translated into [[French language|French]] by [[Marie-Félicité Brosset]] in 1862.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;

In [[archaeology]] a '''type site''' (also known as a '''type-site''' or '''typesite''') is a [[archaeological site|site]] that is considered the model of a particular [[archaeological culture]]. For example, the type site of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] culture is [[Jericho]], in the [[West Bank]]. A type site is also often the [[eponym]] (the site after which the culture is named). For example, the type site of the pre-Celtic/[[Celt]]ic [[Bronze Age]] [[Hallstatt culture]] is the lakeside village of [[Hallstatt]], [[Austria]].

In [[geology]] the term is used similarly for a site considered to be typical of a particular rock formation etc.

A type site contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], in an [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]], that are typical of that culture. Type sites are often the first or foundational site discovered about the culture they represent. The use of this term is therefore similar to that of the ''specimen type'' in [[biology]] (see [[biological type]]s) or ''locus typicus'' ([[type locality (geology)|type locality]]) in [[geology]].
