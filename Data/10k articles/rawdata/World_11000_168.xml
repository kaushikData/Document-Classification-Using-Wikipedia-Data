'''.dj''' is the [[country code top-level domain]] (ccTLD) for [[Djibouti]].

It has been marketed for music-related sites due to the common use of "DJ" to mean [[disc jockey]]. A project is also under development to use it for "Data Journals". However, this TLD has not proven especially popular to date. Other similar ccTLDs are [[.fm]], [[.am]], [[.tv]], [[.cd]], [[.mu]] and [[.me]]. Such unconventional usage of [[TLD]]s in domain names are known as [[domain hack]]s.

{{lang|sl|'''Ajdovi žganci'''}} is a sort of {{lang|sl|[[žganci]]}}.  Translated to English, it would be termed "[[buckwheat]] [[spoonbread]]". It is a national [[Slovenia|Slovene]] dish. [[Balthasar Hacquet]] (1739–1815) mentions that {{lang|sl|žganci}} was served with [[sauerkraut]] in Upper Carniola.&lt;ref name="Taste"&gt;Taste Slovenia. Bogataj Janez, 2007. Rokus Gifts. {{ISBN|978-961-6531-39-9}}. {{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest preparation method explains the word {{lang|sl|žganci}}. The word {{lang|sl|žganci}} is derived from the Slovenian verb {{lang|sl|žgati}} meaning "to burn" or "to toast".&lt;ref name="Taste"/&gt; {{lang|sl|Ajdovi žganci}} are served together with [[obara]]s, [[meat]] sauces, [[sauerkraut]], [[Black pudding]], various [[sausages]]. The ingredients may vary through different regions.

In general the main ingredients are:
* [[buckwheat]] [[flour]]
* [[water]]
* [[salt]]
* [[Pork rind|cracklings]]
* [[oil]] or [[Fat|grease]]

and in some cases [[potato]]es are mixed in.

The '''Alliance PSD+PC''' ({{lang-ro|Alianța PSD+PC}}) was a center-left [[electoral alliance]] in [[Romania]] between 2008 and 2009.

==History==

===Formation===
In continuation with the 2004 [[National Union PSD+PUR]] alliance, the new alliance was founded in 2008 between the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] (PC), formerly ''Humanist Party of Romania'' (PUR) as a counterpart to the center-right [[Justice and Truth|Justice and Truth Alliance PNL-PD]].

===2008 and 2009 elections===
It took part in the [[Romanian legislative election, 2008|2008 general elections]] and in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Romania)|2009 European Parliament election]], with the alliance winning 11 seats, including one [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservatives']] candidate: [[George Sabin Cutaş]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partidulconservator.ro/?a=1688 |title=Partidul Conservator &amp;#124; Romania Valorilor: Credinta, Familie, Natiune |publisher=Partidulconservator.ro |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution===
In late 2010, the Alliance dissolved, as [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] joined  the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] to form the [[Centre Right Alliance]] (ACD).

An apparent contradiction in the observed cooling behavior of [[Antarctica]] between 1966 and 2000 became part of the public debate in the [[global warming controversy]], particularly between advocacy groups of both sides in the public arena&lt;ref name=Spotts2002&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0118/p02s01-usgn.html|title=Guess what?

In his novel ''[[State of Fear]]'', [[Michael Crichton]] asserted that the Antarctic data contradict global warming.&lt;ref name= "State_of_Fear" /&gt; The few scientists who have commented on the supposed controversy state that there is no contradiction,&lt;ref name="RealClim"/&gt; while the author of the paper whose work inspired Crichton's remarks has said that Crichton "misused" his results.&lt;ref name="DoranNYT"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/27/opinion/27doran.html | author=Peter Doran |title=Cold, Hard Facts |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2006-07-27 | accessdate=2008-08-14 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411124340/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/27/opinion/27doran.html| archivedate=April 11, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no similar controversy within the scientific community,&lt;ref name="keay2013"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/02/04/MN159039.DTL | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | title=Media goofed on Antarctic data / Global warming interpretation irks scientists | first=Keay | last=Davidson | date=2002-02-04|accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the small observed changes in Antarctica are consistent with the small changes predicted by climate models, and because the overall trend since comprehensive observations began is now known to be one of warming. At the South Pole, where some of the strongest cooling trends were observed between the 1950s and 1990s, the mean trend is flat from 1957 through 2018.

==Background==
Changes in the average temperature of the Antarctic continent has been the subject of various measurements. The trend differs at different locations on the continent.&lt;ref name="keay2013" /&gt; These trends have been labelled as "contradictory" in some accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/01/25/antarctica.hot.cold/index.html | publisher=[[CNN]] | title=Scientific winds blow hot and cold in Antarctica | date=2002-01-25 | accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/02/science/melting-freezing-antarctica-deciphering-contradictory-climate-patterns-largely.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=The Melting (Freezing) of Antarctica; Deciphering Contradictory Climate Patterns Is Largely a Matter of Ice | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | date=2002-04-02 | accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/01/0125_020125_antarcticaclimate.html|title=Antarctica Gives Mixed Signals on Warming|author=Bijal P.

Observations unambiguously show the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] to be warming. Some trends elsewhere on the [[Antarctica|continent]] have shown cooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3289934/Antarctic-cools-in-warmer-world.html| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | title=Antarctic cools in warmer world | first=David | last=Derbyshire | date=2002-01-14 | accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/cold-science/2002-01-13-antarctic-cooling.htm | work=[[USA Today]]| title=Antarctic cooling pushing life closer to the edge | date=2002-01-16 | accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/03/us/ozone-hole-is-now-seen-as-a-cause-for-antarctic-cooling.html| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Ozone Hole Is Now Seen as a Cause for Antarctic Cooling | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | date=2002-05-03 | accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others show warming over the entire continent,&lt;ref name="ChapmanWalsh"/&gt; but overall trends are smaller and dependent on season and the timespan over which the trend is computed. Climate models predict that temperature trends due to global warming will be much smaller in Antarctica than in the [[Arctic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Houghton |editor1-last=John Theodore |chapter=Figure 9.8: Multi-model annual mean zonal temperature change (top), zonal mean temperature change range (middle) and the zonal mean change divided by the multi-model standard deviation of the mean change (bottom) for the CMIP2 simulations |chapterurl=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig9-8.htm |title=Climate change 2001: the scientific basis: contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-80767-0 |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016210801/http://grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/ |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because heat uptake by the [[Southern Ocean]] acts to moderate the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases.

In a study released in 2009, historical weather station data was combined with satellite measurements to deduce past temperatures over large regions of the continent, and these temperatures indicate an overall warming trend. One of the paper's authors, [[Eric J. Steig]] of the [[University of Washington]], stated "We now see warming is taking place on all seven of the earth’s continents in accord with what models predict as a response to greenhouse gases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/science/earth/22climate.html?ref=science | author=Kenneth Chang | title=Warming in Antarctica Looks Certain|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2009-01-21 | accessdate=2009-01-21 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141113191509/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/science/earth/22climate.html?ref=science| archivedate=November 13, 2014&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study by O'Donnell and others that strongly criticized the Steig et al. work, finding significant warming in West Antarctica but general cooling over the bulk of the continent. O'Donnell et al. also confirmed that Antarctica overall has been warming since the 1950s, but disagreed with Steig et al. about the strength of that warming. Subsequent measurements of temperatures in a borehole at the center of the West Antarctic ice sheet, by Orsi and others,&lt;ref name="Orsi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051260/full|title=Little Ice Age cold interval in West Antarctica: Evidence from borehole temperature at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide |author1=A.

Both RSS and UAH satellite data, which began in 1979, have shown a net cooling. Work by Stenni, (et al., 2017) computes a cooling trend in all major regions of the continent for the past 2000 years.

== Origin of the controversy ==

[[Michael Crichton]], in his 2004 novel ''State of Fear'', asserted that cooling observed in the interior of the [[Antarctica]] shows the lack of reliability of the models used for global warming predictions, and thus of climate theory in general. This novel has a [[docudrama]] plot based upon the idea that there is a deliberately alarmist conspiracy behind [[global warming]] activism. As presented in page 193 of the novel: "The data show that one relatively small area called the Antarctic Peninsula is melting and [[Ice calving|calving]] huge icebergs. That's what gets reported year after year. But the continent as a whole is getting colder, and the ice is getting thicker."&lt;ref name= "State_of_Fear"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Crichton | first = Michael | year = 2004 | title = State of Fear| publisher = [[HarperCollins]], New York| isbn = 0-06-621413-0| pages = 109|language=}} First Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources then picked up the argument,&lt;ref name=Spotts2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Senate2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="DoranNYT" /&gt; labeling it the "Antarctic Cooling Controversy", despite the fact that the small and variable observed trends are broadly consistent with the small magnitude of model-predicted temperature trends for Antarctica.

Crichton footnoted his assertion of Antarctic cooling as originating from the paper Doran ''et al.'', 2002,&lt;ref name="Doran02"/&gt; although the paper referenced did not directly state that their measurements was evidence against global warming.

The [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] have cooled by 0.7&amp;nbsp;°C per decade between 1986 and 2000, with similar pronounced seasonal trends.... Continental Antarctic cooling, especially the seasonality of cooling, poses challenges to models of climate and ecosystem change.

In response to Crichton, the lead author of the research paper, [[Peter Doran]], published a statement in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="DoranNYT"/&gt; stating, "... our results have been misused as 'evidence' against global warming by Michael Crichton in his novel ''State of Fear''.... Our study did find that 58 percent of Antarctica cooled from 1966 to 2000. But during that period, the rest of the continent was warming. And climate models created since our paper was published have suggested a link between the lack of significant warming in Antarctica and the ozone hole over that continent. These models, conspicuously missing from the warming-skeptic literature, suggest that as the ozone hole heals — thanks to worldwide bans on ozone-destroying chemicals — all of Antarctica is likely to warm with the rest of the planet. An inconvenient truth?" He also emphasized the need for more stations in the Antarctic continent in order to obtain more robust results.

A rebuttal to Crichton's claims was presented by the group [[Real Climate]]:&lt;ref name="RealClim"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=18 |author1=Eric Steig |author2=Gavin Schmidt |title=Antarctic cooling, global warming? |publisher=[[Real Climate]] | date=2004-12-03 | accessdate=2008-08-14 | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Long term temperature data from the Southern Hemisphere are hard to find, and by the time you get to the Antarctic continent, the data are extremely sparse. Nonetheless, some patterns do emerge from the limited data available. The Antarctic Peninsula, site of the now-defunct Larsen-B ice shelf, has warmed substantially. On the other hand, the few stations on the continent and in the interior appear to have cooled slightly (Doran et al., 2002; GISTEMP).

:At first glance this seems to contradict the idea of "global" warming, but one needs to be careful before jumping to this conclusion. A rise in the global mean temperature does not imply universal warming. Dynamical effects (changes in the winds and ocean circulation) can have just as large an impact, locally as the radiative forcing from greenhouse gases. The temperature change in any particular region will in fact be a combination of radiation-related changes (through greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone and the like) and dynamical effects. Since the winds tend to only move heat from one place to another, their impact will tend to cancel out in the global mean.&lt;ref name="RealClim"/&gt;

It is common to find statements that "climate models generally predict amplified warming in polar regions" (''e.g.'', Doran ''et al''.&lt;ref name="Doran02"/&gt;), a phenomenon called [[polar amplification]]. In fact, however, Arctic and Antarctic climates are out of phase with each other (the "[[polar see-saw]]" effect), and climate models predict amplified warming primarily for the Arctic and not for Antarctica.&lt;ref name="RealClim"/&gt;

==Observations of trends==
{{main article|Global warming in Antarctica}}

There are few long term weather observations for Antarctica. There are less than twenty permanent stations in all and only two in the interior. More recently [[Automatic weather station|AWS]]s supplement this, but their records are relatively brief. Hence calculation of a trend for the entire continent is difficult. [[Satellite temperature measurements|Satellite observations]] only exist since 1981 and provide surface temperature measurements only in cloud-free conditions.

The 2007 IPCC [[AR4|Fourth Assessment Report]] states, "Observational studies have presented evidence of pronounced warming over the Antarctic Peninsula, but little change over the rest of the continent during the last half of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Regional Climate Projections (In: Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

All seasons show warming, with winter trends being the largest at +0.172&amp;nbsp;°C per decade while summer warming rates are only +0.045&amp;nbsp;°C per decade. The 45-year temperature trend for the annual means is +0.082&amp;nbsp;°C per decade corresponding to a +0.371&amp;nbsp;°C temperature change over the 1958–2002 period of record. Trends computed using these analyses show considerable sensitivity to start and end dates, with trends calculated using start dates prior to 1965 showing overall warming, while those using start dates from 1966 to 1982 show net cooling over the region."

In early 2013, David Bromwich, a professor of polar meteorology at Ohio State University, and a team including Antarctic weather station experts from the University of Wisconsin, published a paper in ''Nature Geoscience'' showing that the warming in central West Antarctica was unambiguous—and likely about twice the magnitude estimated by Steig et al. The key to Bromwich et al.'s work was the correction for errors in the temperature sensors used in various incarnations of the [[Byrd Station]] record (the only long record in this part of Antarctica); miscalibration had previously caused the magnitude of the 1990s warmth to be underestimated, and the magnitude of the 2000s to be overestimated. The revised Byrd Station record is in very good agreement with the borehole temperature data from nearby WAIS Divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bromwich | first1 = D.

Summer and fall trends, are insignificant except over the Antarctic Peninsula where they are widespread only in fall. These finding are in good agreement with the 2009 study in Nature, though in general the new results show greater warming in West Antarctica and less warming over East Antarctica as a whole. Nicholas and Bromwich&lt;ref name="NicholasBromwich2013"/&gt; argue that while the warming in East Antarctica is not statistically significant, it would be greater in magnitude if not for the ozone hole. There is no evidence that any significant region of Antarctic has been cooling over the long term, except in fall. In a 2016 paper, Turner and others&lt;ref&gt;{doi=10.1038/nature18645}&lt;/ref&gt; point out that if one considers just the last ~18 years, the trend on the Antarctic Peninsula has been cooling. This is likely connected with tropical variability,&lt;ref&gt;{doi:10.1038/535358a}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps associated with the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;{doi:10.1038/NCLIMATE2341}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ice makes polar climate sensitive by introducing a strong [[positive feedback]] loop.
* Melting of continental Antarctic ice could contribute to global [[sea level rise]].
* [[Climate model]]s predict more snowfall than ice melting during the next 50 years, but models are not good enough for them to be confident about the prediction.
* Antarctica seems to be both warming around the edges and cooling at the center at the same time. 
* Sea ice extent surrounding Antarctica has trended higher since satellite measurements began in 1979.
* The central and southern parts of the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula have warmed by nearly 3&amp;nbsp;°C. The cause is not known.

'''Asian Caribbeans''' are people who live in the [[Caribbean]], but were born in [[Asia]], or are descended from people who were born in [[Asia]].

The Asian Caribbean populations were the result of Coolie slaves and indentured labourers that were brought here by the [[Coolie|Coolie Trade]] to work in mines, sugar plantations etc. .

===History===
The Astana Economic Forum traces its roots to a proposal for a series of Eurasian integration initiatives made in a 1994 speech at [[Moscow State University]] by [[President of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan President]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]].

'''Black Star''' (also known as '''Mavro Asteri'''; {{lang-el|Μαύρο Αστέρι}}) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[anarchist terrorism|anarchist terrorist]] group involved in [[anarchism and violence|violent]] [[direct action]].

During the period between May 1999 and October 2002, Black Star was one of the most active [[Anarchism in Greece|anarchist groups in Greece]]. They are [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], [[anti-establishment]], and [[anti-capitalist]]. The group has declared itself to be dedicated to "resistance against the mass organizations of US imperialism and to their local collaborators."&lt;ref&gt;Morou, October 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that "the only terrorists are the US imperialist forces, their European allies, and their local capitalist associates."&lt;ref&gt;FBIS London Bureau, June 22, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Star often demands the release of [[political prisoner]]s (among whom they number as [[Simeon Seisidis]], and [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]]) when calling to claim responsibility for attacks. The group's favorite targets are the cars of [[embassy|embassies]] and [[diplomat]]s, but they have also attacked the offices and cars of international organizations and businesses.

'''Burcu Özsoy''' (born in [[Gaziantep]], [[Turkey]], in 1976) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] scientist who works with sea ice remote sensing in [[Antarctica]]. Özsoy is head of the first Turkish polar research center, [[Istanbul Technical University Polar Research Center|ITU PolReC]].&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey should sign Antarctica protocol, says Turkish expedition chief|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-should-sign-antarctica-protocol-says-turkish-expedition-chief.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=97910&amp;NewsCatID=341|website=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Özsoy is a native of Turkey and graduated from [[Yıldız Technical University]] with degrees of Bachelor and Master in Geodesy-Photogrammetry Engineering. In 2001 she started serving as Research Assistant (RA) in [[Istanbul Technical University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozsoy-Cicek|first=Burcu|date=2010|title=Antarktika Deniz Buzullarinda Yersel Gozlem|url=|journal=Bilim ve Teknik|language=Turkish|volume=|issue=|page=61|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 she joined the Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics Lab, Department of Geological Sciences at [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] (UTSA). Özsoy always had an interest in statistical mathematics and geo-physical sciences and combined both fields by becoming a remote sensing expert. In 2005, she worked on her PhD at the UTSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UTSA graduate students honored for commitment to teaching, learning|url=http://www.utsa.edu/today/2010/05/taawards.html|publisher=University of Texas at San Antonio|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her work there, she met key U.S. and other international scientists and institutions, including those who worked at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Progress Report Year 1 (3 June 2008- 2 June 2009)|url=http://www.utsa.edu/lrsg/SeaIceThickness/NASAannualReport1.pdf|publisher=University of Texas at San Antonio|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was interested in Antarctic remote sensing and looked forward to the chance to hop onto an icebreaker to cruise to Antarctica and see, feel, smell, hear, and taste Antarctic sea ice and landscape for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B.Ö. Çiçek; "Antarctic Sea Ice in Climate Change...", July 10, 10:40|url=http://fens.sabanciuniv.edu/tr/events-detail/4435|publisher=Sabancı University|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW with PROFESSOR STEPHEN ACKLEY|url=https://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/oden-antarctic-expedition-06/journals/2007-01-14-0|website=www.polartrec.com|publisher=PolarTrec}}&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled to Antarctica in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Atasoy gundeme getirdi|last=|first=|date=3 October 2013|work=Milliyet|page=12|language=Turkish|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this experience she doubled her forces and filled an important knowledge gap in remote sensing of Antarctic sea ice with her Ph.D. thesis.In 2007, she established American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) chapter in UTSA

==Career and impact==
While she was working on her Ph.D, she learned that communication across disciplines and across scientific knowledge levels is the key to make people understand new results and theories in the field of and the threats accompanied with [[climate change]]. Therefore, after having returned to Turkey in 2011, she worked hard against resistance and old-fashioned opinions to promote the importance of polar research in Turkey; from the 1st grade school kid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA KULÜBÜ'NDEN "İKLİM DEĞİŞİMİ VE KÜRESEL ISINMA" SEMİNERİ|url=http://www.dogaokullari.com/haberetkinlik/nasa-kulubunden-iklim-degisimi-ve-kuresel-isinma-semineri|website=www.dogaokullari.com|publisher=Doga College|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the well-established professor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seminar : Burcu Özsoy Çiçek of the University of Delaware|url=http://som.sabanciuniv.edu/news_detail/37572|publisher=Sabancı Üniversitesi|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up into the highest political levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İçişleri Bakanı o telefonu açınca Mehmet kardeşim acaba ne hissetti|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/icisleri-bakani-o-telefonu-acinca-mehmet-kardesim-acaba-ne-hissetti-24867635|website=Hürriyet|publisher=Hürriyet Gazetesi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her initiations also started public awareness about the importance of the Polar Regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İTÜ Denizcilik Fakültesi 131.

'''''Crusader''''' was a [[Jet engine|jet]]-powered speed boat piloted by [[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]].

The combination of an aerodynamically stable hullform and turbojet propulsion was proposed by [[Reid Railton]], Cobb's adviser. A rocket-powered scale model was tested at Haslar. The full size design was by [[Peter du Cane]] and built by [[Vosper &amp; Company|Vospers]] of Portsmouth. Technical assistance came from Saunders-Roe and Vickers-Supermarine. It cost £15,000 in 1949.

It was silver and scarlet in colour and 10 m long.  
The engine was a [[de Havilland Ghost]] 48 centrifugal turbojet provided as a loan by the [[Ministry of Supply]] at the request of Major Halford, the engine designer. The engine was rated at 5,000&amp;nbsp;lb thrust fed by two scoop inlets forward of the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;''Flight'' p325&lt;/ref&gt;

The hull was of [[trimaran]] form, a main hull with a planing step, and two smaller rear-mounted outriggers. Construction was of birch plywood frames and stringers. The hull was skinned in birch ply covered in doped fabric with metal skin reinforcement for planing surfaces. Aircraft-style riveted aluminium was used for the box-section [[Aka (sailing)|cantilever]]s to the [[outrigger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Can Jet Boat Blast Speed Record."] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1952, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Flight'' p325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectation was that the boat could achieve more than 200&amp;nbsp;mph or 320 kmh.&lt;ref&gt;''Flight'' p326&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat was destroyed and Cobb killed on 29 September 1952 when on a world record attempt at [[Loch Ness]], Scotland.

Fifty years later on 5 July 2002 the wreckage of ''Crusader'' was discovered by the Loch Ness Project in {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lochnessproject.org/loch_ness_reflections_news_links/cobb_crusader_found.htm |title=John Cobb's Crusader Found by The Loch Ness Project |work=lochnessproject.org |year=2009 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Don't Ever Cry'''" was the [[Croatia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993]], performed partly in [[English Language|English]] and partly in [[Croatian Language|Croatian]] by [[Put (band)|Put]]. This was Croatia's debut as an independent nation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

The song written by [[Đorđe Novković]] was performed twenty-first on the night (following the [[Netherlands]]'s [[Ruth Jacott]] with "[[Vrede (song)|Vrede]]" and preceding [[Spain]]'s [[Eva Santamaría]] with "[[Hombres (song)|Hombres]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 31 points, placing 15th in a field of 25.

The song is a plea for peace, set against the backdrop of the war of aggression which had recently engulfed Croatia. The song ends with the dramatic line "Don't ever cry, my Croatian sky".

It was succeeded as [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Croatian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 Contest]] by [[Tony Cetinski]] with "[[Nek' ti bude ljubav sva]]".

The '''Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council''' (EYCS) is a configuration of the [[Council of the European Union]] &lt;ref name="Council of the EU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/|title=The Council of the European Union - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It meets three or four times a year, twice in its full configuration. This Council brings together the [[Minister (government)|ministers]] responsible for education, culture, youth, media, communication and sport of the [[EU member states]]. Its exact composition depends on the items on the agenda.

The Council configuration on Education, Youth, Culture and Sport was created by merging the former Education and Youth Council and the former Cultural and Audiovisual Council.&lt;ref name="Decision of the Council"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:315:0046:0047:EN:PDF/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council usually adopts recommendations in the field of education, culture, youth and sport. However, in some areas such as audiovisual policy or mutual recognition of diplomas, the Council can adopt legislative acts.

'''Faunistic Park Le Cornelle''' is a [[zoo]] and [[amusement park]] in [[Valbrembo]], in the [[Lombardy]] province, northern [[Italy]], created by [[Angelo Ferruccio Benedetti]] in 1981; extending over an area of 100,000 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regioni-italiane.com/parco-faunistico-le-cornelle.htm Info Cornelle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The purpose of the park is to preserve wildlife in captivity, according to the project EEP ([[European Endangered Species Programme]]), to which the park has adopted from the foundation.
The animals live in enclosures that reconstruct the environment of origin, and reproduce themselves: the puppies are reintroduced in the original places of origin, according to the guidelines of the project.
The park is the home of 1,000 animals belonging to 120 different species, including mammals, birds and reptiles.
Le Cornelles has besides the largest [[aviary]] in [[Italy]], called "Selva Tropicale", it's an area of 7,000 m2, closed by a grid placed on high poles to prevent the flight of birds, which live in a state of semi-freedom.

'''Gromada''' {{IPAc-pl|g|r|o|'|m|a|d|a|}} is a [[Polish language|Polish]] word meaning  "gathering", "group", or "assembly". In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the term referred to a [[village]] organization which embraced all the inhabitants of a village and acted as a local authority, as well as overseeing [[tax]] payments. In this sense the gromada developed between the 16th and 18th centuries, and continued to function in [[Congress Poland]]. Their chiefs took the title of [[sołtys]] and were elected by the local population.

The gromada continued to function in [[interwar Poland]], as a subdivision of a [[gmina]].

In [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] between 1954 and 1972, gromadas constituted the lowest tier of local government, taking over the role previously played by gminas. A gromada would generally consist of several villages, but they were smaller units than the gminas had been. In 1973 gminas were reintroduced and gromadas abolished. At present the smallest unit of local government in rural Poland (subordinate to the gmina) is the [[sołectwo]].

A gromada is a former Polish unit of local government e.g.
* [[Gromada Osiek]]
* [[Gromada Tursko Wielkie]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">'''Kulm law''', '''Culm law'''  or '''Chełmno Law''' ({{lang-de|Kulmer Recht}}; {{lang-lat|Jus Culmense vetus}}; {{lang-pl|Prawo chełmińskie}}) was a legal [[constitution]] for a [[municipal]] [[form of government]] used in several Central European cities during the [[Middle Ages]].

It was initiated on 28 December 1233 in the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] by [[Hochmeister]] [[Hermann von Salza]] and [[Hermann Balk]] when the towns of [[Toruń|Thorn]] (Toruń) and [[Chełmno]] (Kulm) received [[German town law]], in particular as a modification of [[Magdeburg rights]]. Named after the town it was signed in, the original  document was lost in 1244 when the town hall burned due to an attack by [[Swantopolk II, Duke of Pomerania]]. The renewed charter of 1 October 1251 was based on a copy in Thorn, but the rights were reduced.

This type of law was mostly granted by the [[Teutonic Order]] to cities within their monastic state, but also adopted by cities elsewhere, mainly in the neighboring independent [[Duchy of Masovia]]. In addition, the Kulm law was expanded, independently from the Knights, to a larger set of laws called ''[[Alter Kulm]]''.

Cities located under Kulm law include:

'''''Le Quotidien''''' is a major independent daily [[newspaper]] in [[Senegal]], based in the capital of [[Dakar]].  It also publishes a glossy weekly, entitled ''Week end''.&lt;ref name=ccg&gt;[http://www.buyusa.gov/westafrica/en/senegal_ccg.pdf Senegal Country Commercial Guide 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507200048/http://www.buyusa.gov/westafrica/en/senegal_ccg.pdf |date= 7 May 2009 }}. [[U.S. Commercial Service]] (2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
Launched by owner/editor Madiambal Diagne—a former reporter for Dakar's [[Wal Fadjri]] -- and his [[Avenir Communications SA]] company in February 2003, Le Quotidien is generally critical of the government, as well as political and religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;One example is the unsigned editorial [http://www.lequotidien.sn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=656&amp;Itemid=13 CIMETIERE HOMO], 8 August 2008, in which the paper criticises government, religious, and cultural leaders for their intolerance towards homosexuality, a major taboo in Senegalese society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In July 2004 Diange was arrested pending charge by the government for publishing articles alleging fraud in the customs service and government interference in the judiciary.  The arrest came from an alleged breach of Article 80 of the Penal Code, which mandates up to 5 years in jail for anyone convicted of "acts that might compromise public security or cause serious political problems."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CPJ,,SEN,47c566ee2d,0.html UNHCR: Attacks on the Press in Senegal, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released following international pressure and a press strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3886269.stm Senegal's Day Without Press], BBC, 12 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
In 2006, Le Quotidien purchased its own press facilities, freeing it from use of government owned printing facilities.

In 2007 the company's attempt to launch a sister radio station in Dakar was halted by the government, but [[Premiere FM]] opened after appeal at the end of that year.

'''Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John''' were former slaves and members of the elite ruling family of [[Calabar|Old Town, Calabur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbEkAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Ancona+Robin+Robin+John&amp;dq=Ancona+Robin+Robin+John&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB4JmKtILfAhWp8YMKHVttDzQ4ChDoAQg2MAM|title=The American Promise, Volume A: A History of the United States: To 1800|last=Roark|first=James L.|last2=Johnson|first2=Michael P.|last3=Cohen|first3=Patricia Cline|last4=Stage|first4=Sarah|last5=Hartmann|first5=Susan M.|date=2012-03-01|publisher=Macmillan Higher Education|year=|isbn=9781457626524|location=|pages=123-124|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were captured and sold into slavery by English traders while the King of Old Town, Grady King George, Little Ephraim's brother and Ancona's uncle, was negotiating trade with the Duke of New Town. The Robin Johns were deceived twice by ship captains promising to bring them home to Africa. Upon the second time the two were in England, where they petitioned the court system for their freedom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childs|first=Matt|date=2004|title=Captors to Captives to Christians to Calabar: Navigating the Boundaries of Slavery and Freedom in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade|url=https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=hist_facpub|journal=Common-place|volume=5|pages=1-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The two men belonged to an ethnic group called Erik were seen as valuable assets because of their intelligence, as they spoke multiple languages including English, were literate, could negotiate, and had a strong knowledge of the inner workings of the slave trade.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slaveryandremembrance.org/people/person/?id=PP012|title=Ancona Robin John and Little Ephraim Robin John {{!}} Slavery and Remembrance|website=slaveryandremembrance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack and Capture  ==
By the mid 1700's a bitter rivalry had formed between Old Town and New Town in Old Calabar.  In 1767 trade negotiations between Grady King George and Duke Ephriam of New Town turned bitter, which stalled the typical slave-trading operation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; New Town's slave traders then recruited the help of British ship captains to ambush those involved in the slave trade in Old Town, during which hundreds of men were slaughtered and hundreds of men enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195382075.001.0001/acref-9780195382075-e-1760|title=Robin, John, Little Ephraim and Ancona - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195382075.001.0001/acref-9780195382075-e-1760|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the city was focused on the ambush, a British captain was able to capture Little Ephraim and Ancona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1lCZYT2TWEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Ancona+Robin+Robin+John&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv9IbisILfAhVq6YMKHR3dCJgQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Ancona%20Robin%20Robin%20John&amp;f=false|title=The Substance of the Evidence of Sundry Persons on the Slave-trade: Collected in the Course of a Tour Made in the Autumn of the Year 1788|last=Clarkson|first=Thomas|date=1789|publisher=James Phillips|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhe6NR-1KlwC&amp;pg=PT60&amp;dq=Ancona+Robin+Robin+John&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv9IbisILfAhVq6YMKHR3dCJgQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Ancona%20Robin%20Robin%20John&amp;f=false|title=The Atlantic in World History|last=Kupperman|first=Karen Ordahl|date=2012-08-08|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199986552|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Captivity ==

=== Dominca ===
Once captured, their odyssey began on Captain Bivins ship the ''Duke of York'' which set sail for Dominica in the Caribbean.  The pair were sold together to a French physician, which scholar Randy Sparks states was extremely uncommon. After being on the island less than a year, Captain William Sharp of Liverpool on one of his regular trips to the island discovered the two Robin Johns.  He promised to return both Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John back to Africa if they could make it to his ship before he left.  In one of the letters that the Robin Johns sent the pair stated that they were "determined to get home".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/221175566|title=The two princes of Calabar : an eighteenth-century Atlantic odyssey|last=J.|first=Sparks, Randy|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674032057|oclc=221175566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Escaping at night, both Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John were able to make it to Captain William Sharp's ship.  Once there, they discovered that they had been tricked, as Captain William Smith had no intention of sailing to Africa. He instead sailed up the coast of North America and docked in Virginia where the Robin Johns were once again sold.  

=== Virginia ===
Once in Virginia, Captain William Sharp sold Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John to John Thompson of Williamsburg, Virginia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  John Thompson was a trader and often took the Robin Johns to sea with him. He was a man with a temper and often beat the Robin Johns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In March of 1772, John Thompson died.  Shortly after Thompson's death, Captain Terence O'Neil sailed the ''Greyhound''  into Virginia.  O'Neil had previously sailed from England to Old Calabar, where he picked up 132 slaves to transport to South Carolina. After delivering the slaves O'Neil sailed to Virginia where two of his sailors, who were from Old Town, recognized the Robin Johns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Aware of the details of the ambush where they were captured, these sailors urged Captain O'Neil to take action. Captain O'Neil offered the Robin Johns a trip home if they could escape at night and board his ship.  Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John were able to escape and board the ''Greyhound'', which was headed to Bristol, England, a major slave-trading post.  

=== England ===
Upon arriving in England O'Neil transferred the Robin Johns to another ship that was headed back to Virginia, with plans to sell them again. The Robin Johns spent two weeks locked in a ship before they sent a letter to the prominent slave trader Thomas Jones, who knew the Robin Johns personally, as he had made many trips to Old Calabar in the 1760s.  Jones had formed close relationships with the ruling family of Old Town. Immediately after the ambush Grady King George had written to Thomas Jones, asking for his help with bringing his brother and nephew home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

==== Court Case in England ====

Through Thomas Jones, the Robin Johns petitioned for their freedom. Jones used the 1772 ruling on the [[Somerset v Stewart|James Somerset]] case, attempting to use Habeas Corpus to free the Robin Johns.  A judge ruled that the Robin Johns were free and could not be returned to America to be sold again.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After being declared free, the two traveled back to Calabur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   

== Later life ==
While in Bristol the Robin Johns interacted with Charles Wesley and converted to Methodism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a84efcfa8b2b01c39eb110f/t/5b89e31670a6ad81f193893c/1535763223263/Cruickshank+Aldersgate_7_September_2009.pdf|title=CHARLES WESLEY, THE MEN OF OLD CALABAR, AND THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY|last=Cruickshank|first=Johanna|date=|website=Aldersgate Papers V7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4679">'''Melka Kuntureመልካ ቁንጥሬ''' is a [[Paleolithic]] site in the upper Awash Valley, [[Ethiopia]]. It is located 50 kilometers south of [[Addis Ababa]] by road, across the [[Awash River]] from the village of Melka Awash, with a latitude and longitude of {{coord|8|42|9|N|38|36|30|E}}. Three waterfalls lie downstream of the bridge across the Awash here, which provides access south to [[Butajira]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Briggs, ''Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide'', 3rd edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2002), p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Research ==
The site, discovered by Gerard Dekker in 1963, was surveyed by Gérard Bailloud in 1964, and then systematically explored by a French mission directed by Jean Chavaillon (1965-1982 / 1993-1995). Since 1999, an Italian mission directed by Marcello Piperno for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the University of Rome “La Sapienza” has worked at the site in agreement with the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage of the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Oromia Culture and Tourism Bureau.

== Archaeological Sequences ==
Archaeologists have uncovered over 30 occupation sites at Melka Kunture. The finds are dated by volcanic depositions left by eruptions of [[Mount Zuqualla]], northeast of Melka Kunture.&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence begins with the [[Oldowan]] site of Karre, about 1.7 million years old, which can be correlated to level B of Gombore I, on the right bank of the Awash. A probably contemporaneous Oldowan site is documented at Garba IV. The magneto-stratigraphic sequence of Jaramillo lies between Tuff A, which overlies the Oldowan sites, and Tuff B, which is dated between 1.0 and 0.84 million years ago. Some important sites, such as Garba XII and Simbiro III, datable to a transitional phase from the late Oldowan to the Early [[Acheulean]] (Garba XII) or to an archaic phase of the Acheulean (Simbiro), also lie within this chronological span.

A later phase of the African Acheulean is well represented by several sites in the area of Gombore II (dated to about 0.8 mya). The latest Acheulean site is Garba I, dated to ca. 0.5 mya, while the end of this long sequence is represented, at Melka Kunture, by the site of Garba III, approximately dated to 0.2 mya, which can be regarded as a transitional site towards the [[Middle Stone Age]]. Some of the above-listed levels yielded hominid remains: a humerus fragment of H. cf. erectus at Gombore I; a hemimandible of a H. cf. erectus child at Garba IV; two [[Homo erectus|H. erectus]] skull fragments at Gombore II; and three [[Archaic humans|archaic H. sapiens]] skull fragments at Garba III.

The East African [[Later Stone Age]] is poorly documented at Melka Kunture, being represented so far by some finds at Wofi and Kella. A little less than 7 km from Melka Kunture, in a site known as Balchit, are imposing outcrops of obsidian. As recent analyses from samples from several sites in Melka Kunture bear out, these outcrops were used, ever since the earliest Oldowan phases, as an important source of raw material. The exploitation of obsidian in the Melka region went on until historical times, leaving numerous and extensive accumulations of tens of thousands of blades, cores, and scars of this volcanic rock.

== Exhibits ==
A museum was built at the site by the Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission with financial assistance from the [[European Community]], consisting of four buildings with exhibits—one on [[prehistoric Africa]], another on geology and volcanology, a third on paleoanthropology, the fourth on the prehistory of Melka Kunture. There is also an "Open Air Museum," which displays the excavation of two [[Acheulean]] sites that have been dated to 0.8 million years BP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melkakunture.it "Melka Kunture - Home"], University of Rome, "La Sapienza", Dipartimento di Scienze dell’Antichità.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently (May, 2016) a new museum is under construction, which is funded by the World Bank.

'''"Mil etter mil"''' was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]], performed in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] by [[Jahn Teigen]].

The song is a ballad, with Teigen describing his long journey to find someone and telling this person that he simply cannot walk any further - having walked "[[Scandinavian mile|mile]] after mile" already.

By all accounts, Teigen did not like [[Carsten Klouman]]'s brass-dominated jazz arrangement; when the song was issued as a record a few weeks after the contest, it was in a rock version with more drums and guitar, a bit of strings and no brass. This version was recorded in Norwegian and English (English lyric by American singer/songwriter David Cooper), it was a huge hit in Norway and was also issued in many other countries. Teigen also recorded a mock-Russian version on his best-selling comedy album ''[[Brakara]]'' with the group [[Prima Vera (band)|Prima Vera]]; this version had most of the guitars mixed out.

The song was performed second on the night, following [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Colm C. T. Wilkinson]] with "[[Born To Sing (song)|Born To Sing]]" and preceding [[Italy]]'s [[Ricchi e Poveri]] with "[[Questo amore]]". At the close of voting, it had received no points, placing 20th (last) in a field of 20.

It was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 contest]] by [[Anita Skorgan]] (who later married Teigen) with "[[Oliver (song)|Oliver]]".

The '''Party of Popular Movement''' (PMP) was a political party of [[French Somaliland]] and the [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]].

==History==
It was created in 1958 by Somali nationalist militants. Its candidate [[Ahmed-Idriss Moussa|Moussa Ahmed Idriss]] , was elected deputy of the territory to the French National Assembly in 1962. He sits on the benches of the Union for the New Republic (UNR), the Gaullist party. Its president is Obsieh Bouh Abdallah (born in 1932) and Ahmad Farah Dalieh. In 1963, the PMP allied with [[Ali Aref Bourhan|Ali Aref]] with which it won the territorial elections. Its leaders signed the agreement of Arta. In 1965, the PMP is joined by activists of the [[Democratic Union Issa]] led by [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]]. With the [[Democratic Union Afar]], PMP involved in the organization of nationalist demonstration in [[Djibouti]] in August 1966 to mark the passing of [[General de Gaulle]]. The formations then divide. The PMP calls for a vote of "no", i.e. in favor of independence, in the referendum of March 1967. Its ministers then leave the government. Consequently, on July 13, 1967, the PMP was dissolved by decision of the administrative authorities of the territory. One of its militants, Omar Osman Rabeh be sentenced to death, commuted to life in prison for the attempted murder of [[Ali Aref Bourhan]] in 1968. It will eventually traded against France's ambassador to Somalia kidnapped in [[Mogadishu]] by a commando the liberation Front of the Somali Coast (FLCS) in 1975.

'''SERVIR-Mekong project''' is a joint initiative by the US agency for International Development ([[USAID]]), [[NASA]] and five other countries which are Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. "Servir" is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word which means "to serve". The project aims to use the latest technologies to help the [[Mekong River|Mekong river]] region protect its vital ecosystem. It helps to connect USAID's development network with NASA's technology and satellite data to provide mapping information and satellite imagery.&lt;ref name="preventionweb.net"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia: USAID and NASA today launched 'SERVIR-Mekong' - News - Professional Resources - PreventionWeb.net|url = http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/news/v.php?id=45582|website = www.preventionweb.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introducing SERVIR-Mekong – NASA’s New Environmental Monitoring Project | date=20 September 2015  |website=Envirotech Online |url=http://www.envirotech-online.com/news/environmental-laboratory/7/breaking_news/introducing_servir-mekong_nasas_new_environmental_monitoring_project/36065/ |accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the organisation had presence in Himalayas when a hub, SERVIR-Himalaya, was established at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu, Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SERVIR Himalaya|url = http://www.icimod.org/servir-himalaya|website = www.icimod.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has launched similar projects in past for other regions also like Latin America, Africa and Asia. 

==Target==
The project stresses the vital issues associated in the [[Mekong River Basin|Mekong river basin]] region which encompasses all the five countries which are also known as ''the rice bowl of Asia''. The project will also allow these countries to better deal with natural disasters and climate studies like green house gas emissions and its effects. It also enables them to use their water resources more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Knowledge Products|url = http://servir.adpc.net/knowledge-products|website = SERVIR MEKONG|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical and strategical importance==
[[File:Mekongbasin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mekong River Basin Area is about 5000km long]]
The Mekong basin is covers almost {{convert|5000|km|mi}} from Tibetan plateau up to the South China Sea region. It gives livelihood to almost 40 million people. The environment is considered one of the most volatile ones in the world. The project uses space applications and helps to create geospatial data which is later analyzed to avoid natural disasters like floods and others in the lower Mekong region.&lt;ref name="preventionweb.net"/&gt;

==Implementation==
The implementation of the project is undertaken by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) in consortium with [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (SEI),  Spatial Informatics Group (SIG) and Deltares. The first phase of the project was launched on 31 August 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home {{!}} SERVIR-Mekong|url = http://index.servirmekong.opendata.arcgis.com/|website = index.servirmekong.opendata.arcgis.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future perspectives==
SERVIR-Mekong is an example of the technical collaboration in the region and development of a common analysis. It also aims to see environmental planning agencies leading in technical support and take better development decisions. SERVIR has also served in development of more than 30 countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia which includes providing tools and training to thousands of people of the region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Earsc: NASA and USAID Launch SERVIR-Mekong|url = http://earsc.org/news/nasa-and-usaid-launch-servir-mekong|website = Earsc: NASA and USAID Launch SERVIR-Mekong|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of parading, the Unit and Formation [[Regimental Colours]] of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) are arranged according to an order of protocol. This is the order in which the 35 Regimental Colours of the Singapore Armed Forces parade. The oldest Colours is placed on the left of the observer, and the sequence follows, with the youngest Colours taking the last position on the right. There are exceptions to this rule in the Singapore context, such as the placement of the Regimental Colours of the [[Singapore Commandos|Commandos]]. SAFTI MI and Commandos Regimental Colours do not observe the order-by-date-of grant arrangement. These Colours precede the SAF’s first Regimental Colours (1SIR - 27 July 1961), despite being granted on a later date.

'''World Space Week''' ('''WSW''') is an annual holiday observed from 4–10 October in various parts of the world, including [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].  World Space Week is officially defined as "an international celebration of science and technology, and their contribution to the betterment of the human condition."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/spaceweek/background.shtml World Space Week], General Assembly, The United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On December 6, 1999, The United Nations General Assembly declared World Space Week as an annual event celebration to be commemorated between October 4–10. The choice of dates was based on recognition of two important dates in space history: the launch of the first human-made Earth satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], on October 4, 1957; and the signing of the [[Outer Space Treaty]] on October 10, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldspaceweek.org/wsw/index.php World Space Week] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012040332/http://www.worldspaceweek.org/wsw/index.php |date=2012-10-12 }} UN General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

World Space Week is the largest annual space event in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43212&amp;Cr=outer+space&amp;Cr1=#.UHePC65rMT4 UN launches into World Space Week highlighting contributions of space science to humanity] The United Nations News Center; October 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, World Space Week was celebrated with over 3,700 events in 80 countries.  Events included school activities, exhibitions, government events, and special activities at planetaria around the world. 

==Annual themes==
Each year, a theme for World Space Week is established by the Board of Directors of World Space Week Association.

Under the theme "Exploring New Worlds in Space", many events of World Space Week 2017 focused on plans for human exploration of space and recent discoveries of Earth-like planets in nearby solar systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldspaceweek.org/annual_reports.html |title=Report on World Space Week 2000/2007 |publisher=Worldspaceweek.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008084639/http://www.worldspaceweek.org/annual_reports.html |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldspaceweek.org/annual_reports.html |title=UN Report on World Space Week 2007, ST/SPACE/38 |publisher=Worldspaceweek.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008084639/http://www.worldspaceweek.org/annual_reports.html |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
