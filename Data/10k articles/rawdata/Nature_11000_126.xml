'''AISSat-1''' is a [[satellite]] used to receive [[Automatic Identification System]] (AIS) signals. Launched on 12 June 2010 from 
[[Satish Dhawan Space Center]] as a [[secondary payload]], AISSat-1 is in a [[sun-synchronous]] [[low-Earth orbit]]. Initially a development project, the satellite has since passed into ordinary operations. Via downlinks at [[Svalbard Satellite Station]] and at [[Vardø Vessel Traffic Service Centre]] it tracks vessels in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]] for the [[Norwegian Coastal Administration]], the [[Norwegian Coast Guard]], the [[Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries]] and other public agencies.

The satellite was developed as a cooperation between the [[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] (NDRE), the [[Norwegian Space Centre]] and the Coastal Administration. The payload was developed by [[Kongsberg Seatex]] while the [[University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies]] built the [[satellite bus|bus]] and completed manufacture. The satellite measures {{convert|20|cm|sp=us}} cube and weighs {{convert|6|kg}}. Ownership and operation passed to [[Statsat]] in 2013. The satellite has since 2014 been supplemented with [[AISSat-2]] and from 2015 by [[AISSat-3]].

==Background==
The Automatic Identification System was developed as a navigational aid for shipping traffic, initially primarily as a [[collision avoidance]] system. The system became mandatory most commercial ships from 2008. AIS was designed as a terrestrial system with AIS transponders operating on the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) range. In addition to ship-to-ship tracking, AIS could be monitored by a series of coastal base stations. The idea for satellite monitoring arose later and was mostly intended for maritime surveillance and control, as well as safety monitoring.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carson-Jackson |first=J. |title=Satellite AIS – Developing Technology or Existing Capability? |journal=The Journal of Navigation |year=2012 |volume=65|pages=303–321 |DOI=10.1017/S037346331100066X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment took the first steps towards AIS satellite use in 2003 paper. A main concern was the low transmitting power of AIS, typically one to twelve watts. Simultaneous transmission could also result in data packet collision and thus make all transmissions unreadable.&lt;ref name=jackson /&gt; Research later concluded that satellite monitoring of heavily trafficked areas would be near impossible, but that satellite surveying of the sparsely used Arctic waters would be effective. The AIS infrastructure in Norway was built and is operated by the Norwegian Coastal Administration in cooperation with the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]]. It was this cooperation which led to the development of the satellite AIS system.&lt;ref name=ffi&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ffi.no/no/Publikasjoner/Documents/AISSAT-1_Norways%20first%20observation%20satellite.pdf |title=AISSat-1 – Norway’s first observation satellite |publisher=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920072350/http://www.romsenter.no/Aktuelt/Siste-nytt/Norsk-satellitt-innfrir |deadurl=no |archivedate=20 September 2015 |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased focus on the High North arose following the appointment of [[Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet]] in 2005. The AISSats are part of a larger policy to strengthen Norway's grip on the Arctic areas.&lt;ref name=bo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bekkevold |first=Jo Inge |last2=Offerdal |first2=Kristin |title=Norway’s High North Policy and New Asian Stakeholders |journal=Strategic Analysis |year=2014 |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=825–840 |DOI=10.1080/09700161.2014.952934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) covers sea areas around [[Svalbard]] and [[Jan Mayen]],&lt;ref name=eo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/a/aissat-1-2 |title=AISSat-1 and 2 |publisher=Earth Observation Portal / [[European Space Agency]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912025919/https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/a/aissat-1-2 |archivedate=12 September 2015 |deadurl=no |accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in addition to the continental EEZ gives it an area of {{convert|1878953|km2|sp=us}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Eighty percent of all Arctic shipping traffic passes through Norway's EEZ.&lt;ref name=bo /&gt;

==Development==
Specific research into what became AISSat-1 began in 2005 as a cooperation between the Norwegian Space Centre, Norwegian Defence Research Establishment and Kongsberg Seatex. The initial research concluded that a satellite within an [[orbit]] of {{convert|1000|km|sp=us}} would be able to receive AIS communication. A particular challenge during this period was the need for an antenna with sufficient length to match the wavelength, which would be difficult with a small satellite profile.&lt;ref name=ffi /&gt; As part of the development, an AIS tranceiver was attached to the [[International Space Station]] to test out the receptivity of AIS signals in low-Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10599774 |title=Norway launches AISSat ship-tracking spacecraft |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-22 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831143021/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10599774 |archivedate=31 August 2010 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; AISSat-1 was Norway's first non-commercial satellite.&lt;ref name=barstein /&gt;

The satellite was regarded as experimental by the involved parties. Design of the payload and AIS components was carried out by Kongsberg Seatex. The project is owned by the Norwegian Space Centre while NDRE was responsible for technical aspects. Once operational, the data was fed to the Coastal Administration. Production was subcontracted to the [[University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies]] (UTIAS) using their [[Generic Nanosatellite Bus]] as the [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name=eo /&gt;

AISSat-1 is built around the University of Toronto's Generic Nanosatellite Bus. The satellite measures {{convert|20|cm|sp=us}} cubed. It is solar-powered collected by thirty-six panels and stored in two batteries. There are three onboard computers, each with a [[ARM7]] microcontroller. One operates household issues such as telemetry while one handled [[attitude control]]. The third handles payload operations. There are four [[ultra high frequency]] antennas for telemetry. Attitude is adjusted through three [[reaction wheel]]s. The payload consists of a VHF antenna and an onboard computer for storing and processing of AIS data.&lt;ref name=eo /&gt;

==Launch==
AISSat was a [[secondary payload]] which was launched on 12 July 2010 at 03:52 UTC from the [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre First Launch Pad|First Launch Pad]] at [[Satish Dhawan Space Center]] in India. The satellite was carried on board a [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] operated by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]. The main payload of the mission was the reconnaissance satellite [[Cartosat-2B]]. In addition to AISSat-1, secondary payloads were [[AlSat-2A]], [[TISat-1]] and [[StudSat]].&lt;ref name=eo /&gt;

AISSat was placed into a [[sun-synchronous]] [[polar orbit]] with an altitude of {{convert|635|km|sp=us}}. It received an inclination of 97.71° and a period of 97.4 minutes. UTIAS retained responsibility for launch and commissioning, after which operational responsibility was transferred to NDRE.&lt;ref name=eo /&gt; The satellite was designed, built and launched within schedule and budget.&lt;ref name=ffi /&gt;

==Mission==
[[File:ISS Benefits for Humanity Found at Sea HD.webm|thumb|[[NASA]] video demonstrating the advantages of the Norwegian AIS satellite program]]
AISSat-1 was built as an experimental satellite to investigate the feasibility of collecting AIS data from space. The satellite quickly proved to meet its expectations and has since been regarded as an operational satellite.&lt;ref name=ffi /&gt; [[Telemetry]] including data download is handled from [[Svalbard Satellite Station]]. From 2015 a second [[ground station]], at Vardø Vessel Traffic Service Centre, was opened. Since 2013 operation of the satellite passed to Statsat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stensvold |first=Tore |url=http://www.tu.no/industri/2015/05/07/nytt-satellitt-senter-i-vardo-gir-sikrere-skipstrafikk-i-arktis |title=Nytt satellitt-senter i Vardø gir sikrere skipstrafikk i Arktis |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=7 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715093211/http://www.tu.no/industri/2015/05/07/nytt-satellitt-senter-i-vardo-gir-sikrere-skipstrafikk-i-arktis | archivedate=15 July 2015 |accessdate=20 September 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary operational goal is the gathering of positioning and course information from fisheries and ship traffic within the Norwegian EEZ with the intent of environmental surveillance. The vessel data is used by the Coastal Administration and in particular Vardø Vessel Traffic Service Centre to monitor ship traffic. The data is stored and can also be used to collect accurate statistics on ship traffic in the Arctic.&lt;ref name=innfrir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romsenter.no/Aktuelt/Siste-nytt/Norsk-satellitt-innfrir |title=Norsk satellitt innfrir |date=6 May 2011 |publisher=[[Norwegian Space Centre]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike terrestrial data collection, the satellite information is not made publicly available. A contributing cause is that certain fishers many not want to reveal their fishing positions and could then have chosen to turn off their AIS instead.&lt;ref name=barstein&gt;{{cite web|last=Barstein |first=Geir |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/04/29/nyheter/miljo/norsk_romsenter/romfart/forskning/11506063/ |title=– En historisk dag for Norge som romfartsnasjon |work=[[Dagbladet]] |date=29 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66qi4M6Wu?url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/04/29/nyheter/miljo/norsk_romsenter/romfart/forskning/11506063/ |archivedate=11 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIS data is used by the [[Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries]] for surveillance of the fisheries fleet to identify illegal fishing. Controls involve checking if ships rendezvous with other ships and when they dock. This information is then controlled with logs. This means of controlling has been an efficient preventative measure. Beyond use in the high north, AISSat-1 gradually sweeps above the entire globe in the course of a twenty-four hour period. This allows tracking of ship traffic in other areas under Norwegian jurisdiction around [[Bouvetøya]] and for instance data for combating piracy off Africa.&lt;ref name=innfrir /&gt;

Data can also be used to identify any ship causing an oil spill.&lt;ref name=innfrir /&gt; There are more than one thousand annual oil spills and illegal dumping in Norwegian waters. While observation satellites have previously been able to identify spills, the satellite AIS monitoring can normally identify the culprit and the data used as evidence. The [[Norwegian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[Norwegian Customs Service|Custom Service]], the [[Norwegian Police Service|Police Service]] and the Armed Force can utilize the data from the data.&lt;ref name=barstein /&gt;

A build-to-print copy of the satellite, AISSat-2, was launched on 8 July 2014. It is intended to be followed by a third satellite, AISSat-3, in 2015. The added satellites are intended to provide redundancy in case of data capturing failure in one satellite.&lt;ref name=eo /&gt;

[[Image:Chapel of the Holy well Marianka Slovakia.jpg|thumb|right|Chapel of the Holy well]]
'''Chapel of the Holy well''' is a chapel located in [[Marianka]], [[Slovakia]]. Rotunda Chapel of the Holy well was commissioned in 1696 for 1000 golden coins by earl [[Paul I, Prince Esterhazy|Paul Eszterhazy]] and local baron Ján Macholány, who can be found pictured with his family on one of the ceiling frescos. In 1722, a renovated baroque altar was built, replacing the original one. In 1877, the statues of St. Anthony and St. Paul the Hermits were erected in front of the chapel. These statues came from the workshop of [[Georg Rafael Donner|Rafael Donner]], eventually being replaced by replicas created in Brno in 1981. Originals were transferred to the Slovak National Gallery, where they are a part of the original [[Baroque]] Art exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110901161332/http://visit.marianka.sk/Why%2Bvisit%2BMarianka/Sites%2Band%2Battractions/Object%2Bdetail/?contentId=955&amp;languageId=6 Page about the chapel on village's website]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel was constructed directly above the stream, out of which the water is directed to the front of the chapel directly accessible to the visitors. The stream beneath was reported to have miraculous healing effect on physically handicapped pilgrims visiting the site.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  In the book of Kummer from the record of the local cloister, 140 recoveries were reported between 1634 - 1730.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''Devonian''' is a [[period (geology)|geologic period and system]] of the [[Paleozoic]], spanning 60 million years from the end of the [[Silurian]], {{Period start|Devonian}} million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the [[Carboniferous]], {{Period end|Devonian}} Mya.&lt;ref name="ICS 2004"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Geologic Time Scale 2004 |last1=Gradstein |first1=Felix M. |last2=Ogg|first2=J.

The first significant [[adaptive radiation]] of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. [[Pteridophyte|Free-sporing vascular plants]] began to spread across dry land, forming extensive [[forest]]s which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the [[Pteridospermatophyta|first seed-bearing plants]] appeared. Various terrestrial [[arthropod]]s also became well-established.&lt;!--Arthropods had been on the land since the Silu/Ordovican. See Tumblagooda sandstone.--&gt;

[[Fish]] reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the "'''Age of Fish'''". The first [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned]] and [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned]] [[osteichthyes|bony fish]] appeared, while the [[placodermi|placoderms]] began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. The ancestors of all four-limbed vertebrates ([[tetrapod]]s) began adapting to walking on land, as their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan|title=Fossil tracks record 'oldest land-walkers'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8443879.stm|accessdate=24 December 2016|work=news.bbc.co.uk|agency=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the oceans, primitive [[shark]]s became more numerous than in the Silurian and [[Ordovician#Subdivisions|Late Ordovician]].

The first [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]], species of molluscs, appeared. [[Trilobite]]s, the mollusc-like [[brachiopod]]s and the great [[coral reef]]s, were still common. The [[Late Devonian extinction]] which started about 375 million years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newitz|first1=Annalee|title=How Do You Have a Mass Extinction Without an Increase in Extinctions?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/how-do-you-have-a-mass-extinction-without-an-increase-in-extinctions/276836/|website=The Atlantic|date=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; severely affected marine life, killing off all placodermi, and all trilobites, save for a few species of the order [[Proetida]].

The [[palaeogeography]] was dominated by the [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] to the south, the continent of [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] to the north, and the early formation of the small continent of [[Euramerica]] in between.

==History==
[[File:Lummaton Quarry 1.JPG|thumb|left|The rocks of Lummaton Quarry in [[Torquay]] in Devon played an early role in defining the Devonian period.]]
The period is named after [[Devon]], a county in southwestern England, where a controversial argument in the 1830s over the age and structure of the rocks found distributed throughout the county was eventually resolved by the definition of the Devonian period in the geological timescale. [[The Great Devonian Controversy]] was a long period of vigorous argument and counter-argument between the main protagonists of [[Roderick Murchison]] with [[Adam Sedgwick]] against [[Henry De la Beche]] supported by [[George Bellas Greenough]]. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named the period they proposed as the Devonian System.&lt;ref&gt;Rudwick M.S.J. 1985 ''The great Devonian controversy: the shaping of scientific knowledge among gentlemanly specialists''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note:
* Sedgwick and Murchison coined the term "Devonian system" in:  Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Impey Murchison (1840) "On the physical structure of Devonshire, and on the subdivisions and geological relations of its older stratified deposits, etc.," ''Transactions of the Geological Society of London'', 2nd series, '''5''' (part II) :  633-687 (Part I) and 688-705 (Part II).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=QknWzPRnVRQC&amp;pg=PA701#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From p. 701:]  "We propose therefore, for the future, to designate these groups collectively by the name ''Devonian system'', … ."
*  Sedgwick and Murchison acknowledged William Lonsdale's role in proposing, on the basis of fossil evidence, the existence of a Devonian stratum between those of the Silurian and Carboniferous periods.  From (Sedgwick and Murchison, 1840), p. 690:  "Again, Mr. Lonsdale, after an extensive examination of the fossils of South Devon, had pronounced them, more than a year since, to form ''a group intermediate between those of the Carboniferous and Silurian systems'', … ."
*  William Lonsdale stated that in December 1837 he had suggested the existence of a stratum between the Silurian and Carboniferous ones.  See:  William Lonsdale (1840) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QknWzPRnVRQC&amp;pg=PA721#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Notes on the age of limestones from south Devonshire,"] ''Transactions of the Geological Society of London'', 2nd series, '''5''' (part II) : 721-738 ; see especially pp. 724 and 727.  From p. 724:  " … Mr. Austen's communication [was] read December 1837, … .  It was immediately after the reading of that paper … that I formed the opinion relative to the limestones of Devonshire being of the age of the old red sandstone; and which I afterwards suggested first to Mr. Murchison and then to Prof. Sedgwick, … ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rse4v1P-f9kC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=subdivisions+of+the+devonian+period#v=onepage&amp;q=subdivisions%20of%20the%20devonian%20period&amp;f=false|title=A Geologic Time Scale 2004|last=Gradstein|first=Felix M.|last2=Ogg|first2=James G.|last3=Smith|first3=Alan G.|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521786737|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[stratum|rock bed]]s that define the start and end of the Devonian period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] ([[#References|Ogg, 2004]]), the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian {{Period end|Silurian}} [[annum|Mya]], to the beginning of the [[Carboniferous]] {{Period start|Carboniferous}} Mya (in [[North America]], the beginning of the [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian subperiod]] of the Carboniferous).&lt;ref name="ICS 2004"/&gt;

In nineteenth-century texts the Devonian has been called the "Old Red Age", after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the [[Old Red Sandstone]] in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is "Age of the Fishes",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ageoffishes.org.au Age of Fishes Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the evolution of several major groups of [[fish]] that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, W.J. 1989. ''Geology of the South Wales Coalfield Pt II, the country around Abergavenny'', 3rd edn. Memoir of the British Geological Survey Sheet 232 (Eng &amp; Wales) pp18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonian has also erroneously been characterised as a "greenhouse age", due to [[sampling bias]]: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the [[stratum|strata]] of [[western Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], which at the time straddled the [[Equator]] as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where [[fossil]] signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical [[climate]]s that were warm and moderately humid but in fact the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its [[geologic time scale|epochs]] and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and [[South America]] had a warm [[temperate climate]]. In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and [[temperate climate]]s were more common.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Subdivisions{{anchor|subdivisions}}==
The Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those [[series (stratigraphy)|epoch]]s are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.

;Early Devonian
The Early Devonian lasted from {{period span|Early devonian}} and began with the [[Lochkovian]] stage, which lasted until the [[Pragian]]. It spanned from {{period span|Pragian}}, and was followed by the [[Emsian]], which lasted until the Middle Devonian began, {{ma|middle devonian|error=show}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  
During this time, the first [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] appeared, descending from [[Bactritida|bactritoid]] [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]]. Ammonoids during this time period were simple and differed little from their nautiloid counterparts. These ammonoids belong to the order [[Agoniatitida]], which in later epochs evolved to new ammonoid orders, for example [[Goniatite|Goniatitida]] and [[Clymeniida]]. This class of [[cephalopod]] molluscs would dominate the marine fauna until the beginning of the [[Mesozoic]] era.

;Middle Devonian
The Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the [[Eifelian]], which then gave way to the [[Givetian]] {{Mya|Givetian|error=show}}.
During this time the jawless [[agnathan]] fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation and diversity of [[gnathostomata|jawed fishes]]. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs, and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

;Late Devonian
Finally, the Late Devonian started with the [[Frasnian]], {{period span|Frasnian}}, during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing [[Famennian]] subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian, {{Mya|Carboniferous|error=show}}.{{citation needed|reason=these values differ from those published by the International Commission of Stratigraphy|date=May 2014}}

==Climate==
The Devonian was a relatively warm period, and probably lacked any [[glacier]]s. The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009/&gt; Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from [[conodont]] [[apatite]] implies an average value of {{convert|30|C|4=0|abbr=on}} in the Early Devonian.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009/&gt; {{Co2}} levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian period as the burial of the newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere into sediments; this may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around {{convert|5|C-change|4=0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009/&gt; The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in {{co2}} concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.

The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids.

==Paleogeography==
[[File:380 Ma plate tectonic reconstruction.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]] opened during the Devonian]]
The Devonian period was a time of great [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity, as [[Euramerica]] and [[Gondwana]] drew closer together.

The continent [[Euramerica]] (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of [[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]], which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great air-masses, the [[Hadley cell]] and the [[Ferrel cell]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidised iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Devonian-Period|title=Devonian Period {{!}} geochronology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the [[equator]], the [[plate tectonics|plate]] of Euramerica and Gondwana were starting to meet, beginning the early stages of the assembling of [[Pangaea]]. This activity further raised the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and formed the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]].

The west coast of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in [[Idaho]] and [[Nevada]]; an approaching volcanic [[island arc]] reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in Late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode at the beginning of the Carboniferous called the [[Antler orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/devpaleo.html Devonian Paleogeography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay under shallow seas, where tropical [[reef]] organisms lived. The deep, enormous [[Panthalassa]] (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the [[planet]]. Other minor oceans were the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Rheic Ocean]], and [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed during the collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and Baltica).

During the Devonian [[Chaitenia]], an [[island arc]], [[accretion (geology)|accreted]] to Patagonia.&lt;ref name=Herve2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hervé |first1=Francisco|author-link1=Francisco Hervé |last2=Calderón |first2=Mauricio |last3=Fanning |first3=Mark |last4=Pankhurst |first4=Robert|author-link4=Robert John Pankhurst |last5=Rapela |first5=Carlos W. |last6=Quezada |first6=Paulo |date=2018 |title=The country rocks of Devonian magmatism in the North Patagonian Massif and Chaitenia |url=http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/V45n3-3117 |journal=[[Andean Geology]] |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=301–317 |doi=10.5027/andgeoV45n3-3117  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Marine biota===
[[File:Fish evolution.png|thumb|300px|right|Spindle diagram for the evolution of fish and other vertebrate classes. The diagram is based on [[Michael Benton]], 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, M. J. (2005) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=VThUUUtM8A4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Benton+2005+%22%27Vertebrate+Palaeontology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wUDVVI6IO8fQmAW44YKoDw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Vertebrate Palaeontology''] John Wiley, 3rd edition, page 14. {{ISBN|9781405144490}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{see also|Evolution of fish#Devonian: Age of fishes}}

Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopod]]s, the enigmatic [[hederellid]]s, [[microconchida|microconchids]] and [[coral]]s. Lily-like [[crinoid]]s (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and [[trilobite]]s were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jawless armored fish ([[ostracoderm]]s) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and [[fresh water]]. Armored placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Osteichthyes]]) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark, ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name "The Age of Fish" in popular culture.

The first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400 Mya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Devonian/Devonian.2.htm#Life Palaeos Paleozoic: Devonian: The Devonian Period - 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reefs===
A now dry barrier reef, located in present-day [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley Basin]] of northwest [[Australia]], once extended a thousand kilometres, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs in general are built by various [[carbonate]]-secreting organisms that have the ability to erect wave-resistant frameworks close to sea level. The main contributors of the Devonian reefs were unlike modern reefs, which are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous [[algae]]. They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]], and tabulate and [[Rugosa|rugose corals]], in that order of importance.{{Clarify|reason= Difference between  "corals and calcareous [[algae]]" and "calcareous algae and coral-like [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]] [and corals]"|date=December 2010}}

===Terrestrial biota===
By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonisation of the land. The [[moss]] forests and [[bacteria]]l and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable [[soil]]s and harbored arthropods like [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[Trigonotarbida|trigonotarbids]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Dunlop |first2=Jason |date=July 2014 |title=The walking dead: Blender as a tool for paleontologists with a case study on extinct arachnids |url=https://www.academia.edu/7625529 |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=735–746 |doi=10.1666/13-088 |issn=0022-3360 |accessdate=2015-07-21|bibcode=1974JPal...48..524M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Myriapoda|myriapods]] (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian&lt;ref name="Garwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=Gregory D. |date=September 2011 |title=Early Terrestrial Animals, Evolution, and Uncertainty |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1007/s12052-011-0357-y |url=https://www.academia.edu/891357 |issn=1936-6426 |accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the existence of fossils such as ''[[Climactichnites]]'' suggest that land arthropods may have appeared as early as the [[Cambrian]]).

====The greening of land====

Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall.

Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[lignin]].) These are the oldest-known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the "Devonian Explosion".

The 'greening' of the continents acted as a [[carbon sink]], and [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric concentrations]] of [[carbon dioxide]] may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive [[extinction event]]. See [[Late Devonian extinction]].

====Animals and the first soils====
Primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterised a recognisably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian period. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of [[erosion]] and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first [[vertebrate]]s to seek out a terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gess | first1 = R.W. | year = 2013 | title = The earliest record of terrestrial animals in Gondwana: A scorpion from the Famennian (Late Devonian) Witpoort Formation of South Africa | url = http://africaninvertebrates.org/ojs/index.php/AI/article/view/284 | journal = [[African Invertebrates]] | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 373–379 | doi=10.5733/afin.054.0206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Devonian extinction==
{{Main article|Late Devonian extinction}}
[[File:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|The Late Devonian is characterised by three episodes of extinction ("Late D")]]
A major extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about {{Period start|Famennian}} Mya, when all the fossil [[agnatha]]n fishes, save for the [[psammosteida|psammosteid]] [[heterostraci]], suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, and was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.

The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef systems.

Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as [[agnatha|jawless fish]], and all placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (there is a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, George R. (2013). When the Invasion of Land Failed. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Digby McLaren]] suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the [[Alamo bolide impact]]), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater.

The '''dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field''' is a first order approximation of the rather complex true [[Earth's magnetic field]].  Due to effects of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]], and the [[solar wind]], the dipole model is particularly inaccurate at high [[L-shell]]s (e.g., above L=3), but may be a good approximation for lower L-shells.  For more precise work, or for any work at higher L-shells, a more accurate model that incorporates solar effects, such as the [[Tsyganenko magnetic field model]], is recommended.

==Equations==
The following equations describe the dipole magnetic field.&lt;ref name="walt"&gt;{{cite book |last= Walt |first= Martin |title= [[Introduction to Geomagnetically Trapped Radiation]] |pages = 29–33 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location = New York, NY |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-521-61611-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, define &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; as the mean value of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator on the Earth's surface.   Typically &lt;math&gt;B_0=3.12\times10^{-5}\ \textrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, the radial and azimuthal fields can be described as

&lt;math&gt;B_r = -2B_0\left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^3\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;B_\theta = -B_0\left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^3\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|B| = B_0\left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^3 \sqrt{1 + 3\cos^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt; is the mean [[Earth radius|radius of the Earth]] (approximately 6370&amp;nbsp;km), &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radial distance from the center of the Earth (using the same units as used for &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the azimuth measured from the north magnetic pole.

It is sometimes more convenient to express the magnetic field in terms of magnetic latitude and distance in earth radii.  The magnetic latitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is measured northwards from the equator (analogous to [[latitude|geographic latitude]]) and is related to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \pi/2 - \theta&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the radial and azimuthal components of the magnetic field (the latter still in the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; direction, measured from the axis of the north pole) are given by

&lt;math&gt;B_r = -\frac{2B_0}{R^3}\sin\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;B_\theta = \frac{B_0}{R^3}\cos\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|B| = \frac{B_0}{R^3} \sqrt{1 + 3\sin^2\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in this case has units of Earth radii (&lt;math&gt;R = r/R_E&lt;/math&gt;).

==Invariant latitude==
Invariant latitude is a parameter that describes where a particular magnetic field line touches the surface of the Earth. It is given by&lt;ref name="Kivelson-Russell"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kivelson |first1= Margaret |last2= Russell |first2= Christopher |title= [[Introduction to Space Physics]] |pages = 166–167 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location = New York, NY |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-521-45714-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \arccos\left(\sqrt{1/L}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;L = 1/\cos^2\left(\Lambda\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the invariant latitude and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the L-shell describing the magnetic field line in question.

On the surface of the earth, the invariant latitude (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the magnetic latitude (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:ECO Funnel, OSHA and EPA Compliant Waste Management System in Laboratory Use.jpg|thumb|An ECO Funnel in use]]
The '''ECO Funnel''', also known as the "Safety Ecological Funnel", is a funnel intended to be affixed to a receptacle for liquid [[chemical]] [[waste]]. It is designed to reduce environmental contamination, in compliance with OSHA and EPA mandated safety protocols.&lt;ref name=Einstein.yu.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Health &amp; Safety|url=http://www.einstein.yu.edu/administration/environmental-health-safety/radiation-safety/liquid-waste-container.aspx|publisher=Yeshiva University Health &amp; Safety|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:ECO Funnel Family, OSHA and EPA Compliant Waste Management System, March 2013.jpg|thumb|ECO Funnel Family, OSHA and EPA Compliant Waste Management System, March 2013]]
The ECO Funnel was first devised by Dr. [[Ron Najafi]] in 1996 while he was working at a facility in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ramin-najafi/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that facility, complaints arose throughout the building of odorous fumes originating from the laboratory. This raised the alarm that contamination was not limited to the laboratory where chemical waste is stored, and an investigation was initiated. As a member of the company's Health and Safety Committee, Dr. Najafi conducted tests to determine the severity of emissions from waste bottles typically left unsealed beneath a [[fume hood]]. By marking the rapid decrease in waste bottle volume over a limited period, he was able to verify that significant amounts of potentially hazardous chemicals were evaporating into the surrounding environment.

Once the source and severity of the situation had been confirmed, a need was recognized to improve standard practice for the safety of lab personnel and to bring laboratories into adherence with public safety protocol such as those outlined by the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):

*    29 CFR 1910.1450:  “Avoidance of routine exposure: develop and encourage safe habits; avoid unnecessary exposure to chemicals by any route.”
*    29 CFR 1910.1450:  “Indiscriminate disposal by pouring waste chemicals down the drain or adding them to mixed refuse for landfill burial is unacceptable. Hoods should not be used as a means of disposal for volatile chemicals.”
*    40 CFR 264.173:  “A container holding hazardous waste must always be closed during storage except with it is necessary to add or remove waste.”
*    40 CFR 264.175:  “The containment system must have sufficient capacity to contain 10% of the volume of containers or the volume of the largest container, whichever is greater...”
*    29 CFR 1910.1450:  “Stockrooms/Storerooms: ...chemicals which are highly toxic or other chemicals whose containers have been opened should be in unbreakable secondary containers...

Environmental regulations regarding waste containers were at this time becoming more rigorously enforced than previously, making the situation urgent. After researching available options, it became clear that no solution existed to the problem of effectively containing chemical waste evaporation aside from re-capping original waste containers after each use.&lt;ref name="Bioscience Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Protection|url=http://www.biosciencetechnology.com/articles/2012/08/personal-protection|publisher=Bioscience Technology|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to his findings, Dr. Najafi created the ECO Funnel.

==Concept==
The current design of the ECO Funnel utilizes a latching lid with gasket, and two internal tubes. One larger and longer tube extends into the container from the base of the funnel into the liquid waste to restrict the surface area of the contents and inhibit fume emission. The other tube is designed to sit above the liquid level as a means to warn against overfilling. When the ECO Funnel is secured to a container, this second shorter and smaller tube provide the only ventilation. When the volume of liquid inside the container reaches the smaller tube opening, it will obstruct the air flow through the smaller tube, the waste fluid backs up into the funnel to signal the user that the container is at capacity. Detaching the ECO Funnel allows the remaining liquid to flow into the container and be safely sealed inside. So long as the ECO Funnel's contents do not exceed the maximum volume indicated, the liquid will drain into the container without overflowing.

==Impact==

The ECO Funnel resolves a long standing incongruity between federally mandated safety protocol and standard laboratory practice. The traditional method for handling fluid waste is to set a standard funnel onto the mouth of an open bottle,&lt;ref name="Purdue University"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solutions for Open Hazardous Waste Containers|url=http://www.purdue.edu/rem/home/files/news/april97.htm#openwast|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes stored under a fume hood. This is out of compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Research Council Recommendations Concerning Chemical Hygiene in Laboratories|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10107|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and EPA 40 CFR 264.173.&lt;ref name="US Environmental Protection Agency"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance on Closed Containers|url=http://ehs.ucr.edu/waste/Closed%20Container%20Signed%20Document%201203091.pdf|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing confirms that these methods allow chemicals to evaporate, contaminating the surrounding atmosphere and posing a health risk not only to laboratory workers, but to neighboring areas. Additionally, chemical contaminants in the atmosphere, in combination with normal oxygen levels in the lab, fulfill two of the three components necessary to complete the [[fire triangle]]. Further, chemical spills in the laboratory preclude procedures of safe disposal, leading these toxins to end up in landfills, and consequently, soil, rivers and oceans. As plant and animal life are effected, the consequences escalate exponentially.

      <comment>Adding [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "Harvestable population growth in an ecosystem" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9410">{{short description|Harvestable population growth in an ecosystem}}
'''Ecological yield''' is the harvestable [[population growth]] of an [[ecosystem]].  It is most commonly measured in [[forestry]]: [[sustainable forestry]] is defined as that which does not [[logging|harvest]] more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of [[forest]].

However, the concept is also applicable to [[water]], [[soil]], and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed—called [[renewable resource]]s.  The [[carrying capacity]] of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt) is consumed.

[[Ecosystem services]] analysis calculates the global yield of the [[Earth]]'s [[biosphere]] to humans as a whole.  This is said to be greater in size than the entire human economy.  However, it is more than just yield, but also the natural processes that increase biodiversity and [[conserve habitat]] which result in the total value of these services.  "Yield" of [[Forest product|ecological commodities]] like wood or water, useful to humans, is only a part of it.

Very often an ecological yield in one place offsets an [[ecological load]] in another.  [[Greenhouse gas]] released in one place, for instance, is fairly evenly distributed in the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and so [[greenhouse gas control]] can be achieved by creating a [[carbon sink]] literally anywhere else.

== History ==
Some of the earliest academic papers on the subject were researching methods of sustainable fishing. Work of Russel et al. in 1931 observed in particular that ”it appears that the ideal of a stabilised fishery yielding a constant maximum value is impractical.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=E. S.|date=1931-03-01|title=Some theoretical Considerations on the "Overfishing" Problem|url=https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/6/1/3/641714|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.1093/icesjms/6.1.3|issn=1054-3139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was mostly theoretical. Practical work would begin later, performed by industry and government agencies.

== Motivation ==
Ecological yield is a theoretical construct which aggregates information from several physically measurable quantities. It can be used to reason about other ecological indicators such as the footprint. It can also be used as a decision-making tool for governments and corporations.

=== Ecological footprint ===
The idea of [[Ecological footprint|ecological footprints]] is to measure the cost of economic activity in terms of the amount of ecologically productive land required to sustain it. Doing this accurately requires estimating how productive the land is; in other words, it requires measuring ecological yield. Conversely, one can extract ecological yield estimates from ecological footprint estimates.

=== Avoiding overexploitation ===
Corporations take out loans to buy equipment and land use rights. In order to pay back these loans, they must extract and sell resources from the land. If the corporation is ignorant of the yield of the land in question, then the [[debt]] instruments may demand a [[yield (economics)|yield]] greater than the ecological capacity to renew. [[green economists|Green economics]] links this process with [[ecocide]] and poses solutions through [[monetary reform]]. 

Even well-meaning corporations may systematically overestimate the yield of an ecosystem. In the case of multiple corporations bidding for land rights, an economic phenomenon known as [[The Winner's Curse|the winner's curse]] causes the winning party to systematically overestimate the economic value of the land. Typically the economic value comes mostly from the ecological yield, in which case the corporation will overestimate that as well.

Another form of overestimation may come from generalizing data from other ecosystems. For example, the same species of fish in two different systems may have significantly different diets. If its diet in one region consists mostly of algae but in another region consists largely of smaller fish, then it will be more expensive for the latter ecosystem to produce the fish. Yield will be correspondingly lower in the second region. This example illustrates the need for ecosystem-specific study and monitoring in order to reason about ecological yield.

One may define yearly ecological yield for a fixed ecological product as follows: the yield is the amount of the product which may be removed from the ecosystem so that it is capable of recovering in one year. As a theoretical property of ecosystems, it cannot be measured directly but only estimated. Note that definition is sensitive to the time period which is allowed for recovery: the amount of product one can remove which regenerates over 3 years is not necessarily 3 times that which one can remove and regenerate over 1 year. The yearly ecological yield is most useful because of the [[Season|cycle of seasons]] and the commercial notion of the [[fiscal year]]. The seasons affect growth through temperature, sunlight, and rain, especially at the lowest trophic level. The fiscal year affects decisions by corporations to harvest resources: they may choose to harvest at or above ideal levels based on their need for short-term cash flow. 

== Calculation techniques ==

=== Yield of the whole biosphere ===
In 1986, Vitousek et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vitousek|last2=Ehrlich|first2=P. R.|last3=Ehrlich|first3=A. H.|last4=Matson|first4=P. A.|date=1986|title=Human appropriation of the products of photosynthesis|url=http://www.citeulike.org/group/2696/article/1382551|journal=Bioscience|volume=36|pages=368–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that humans made use of 50 petagrams (50 billion tons) per year of [[Primary production|biomass produced from photosynthesis]]. They also estimated that these 50 billion tons comprised between 20% and 40% of photosynthetic activity on earth. Separately, the Global Footprint Network estimates the total human footprint as 1.6 times the total biosphere. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/|title=Open Data Platform|website=data.footprintnetwork.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ecosystems are overexploited by a factor of 1.6 on average.

=== Theoretical prediction ===
In most biomes, the only form of primary production is [[photosynthesis]]. In other words, all new biomass can be traced back to photosynthetic plants and algae by a chain of [[predation]]. Therefore, one can predict the yield of one organism in an ecosystem as a function of the yield of its primary producers. When the biomass from prey is converted into biomass in its predator, some losses occur due to biological and thermodynamic inefficiency. The conversion rate is typically about 10%. In other words, 100 kg of plant matter may be converted into 10 kg of herbivores, which then may be converted to 1 kg of carnivores who exclusively eat herbivores. One can compute the [[trophic level]] of an organism as the weighted average of length of the predation chain from the organism to a primary producer. This trophic level determines an exponential multiplier to convert from primary producer biomass to the organism's biomass.

== Measurement techniques ==

=== Measuring forests ===
One can measure the amount of wood removed from a forest by asking the company who removed it; typically only one company has the logging rights to any given plot of land. In order to measure the regrowth of the forest in the coming year, typically one picks a representative subsample of the region and tracks every single tree in the subsample. 

One such study measured growth in a section of the [[Tapajós National Forest]] for 13 years after logging activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-02-01|title=Growth and yield of a tropical rain forest in the Brazilian Amazon 13 years after logging|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811279406106S|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|language=en|volume=71|issue=3|pages=267–274|doi=10.1016/0378-1127(94)06106-S|issn=0378-1127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loggers intended to harvest on a 30-year cycle. Logging in this region is restricted to mature trees measuring at least 45 cm [[Diameter at breast height|DBH]]. Before logging, the region had somewhere between 150 m³ and 200 m³ of mature tree volume per [[hectare]]. Loggers removed about 75 m³ of tree per hectare, between 40% and 50% of the standing mass. 

The authors show that growth rates in the region were elevated for up to 3 years after logging. After 13 years of growth, the [[basal area]] reached 75% of its original volume. They also show that logging makes substantial changes to the species composition and canopy structure of the forest. This introduces subjectivity into the notion of "recovery" for an ecosystem.

}}

The '''electricity sector in [[Peru]]''' has experienced impressive improvements in the past 15 years. Access to electricity has increased from 45% in 1990 to 88.8% in July 2011, while service quality and efficiency of service provision improved. These improvements were made possible through [[privatization]]s following reforms initiated in 1992. At the same time, electricity [[tariff]]s have remained in line with the average for [[Latin America]].

However, several challenges remain. Chief among them are the still very low level of access in rural areas and the untapped potential of some renewable energies, in particular [[wind power|wind]] and [[solar energy]], due to an inadequate regulatory framework.

The current electricity generation capacity is evenly divided between thermal and [[hydroelectric]] sources. A renewed recent dynamism of the electricity sector in the country is based on the shift to natural gas plants, which will be mainly fed from the production of the [[Camisea Gas Project|Camisea gas field]] in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].

The National Interconnected System (SEIN) serves 85% of the connected population, with several “isolated” systems covering the rest of the country. While investment in generation, transmission and distribution in urban areas is predominantly private, resources for [[rural electrification]] come solely from public sources.

== Electricity supply and demand ==

=== Installed capacity ===

Installed generating capacity Peru is evenly divided between thermal and [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric sources]]. In 2006, the country had 6.7 [[Watt#Multiples|GW]] of installed capacity, 52% being thermal and 48% hydroelectric, with a negligible share of other renewable sources. Of the total capacity, 84% (5.63 GW) enters the electricity market, while the remaining 16% (1,03 GW) is generated for self-consumption.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"&gt;Ministerio de Energía y Minas 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However, electricity generation is not evenly divided between the two dominating sources. In 2006, 72% of Peru’s total electricity generation came from hydroelectric plants (total generation was 27.4 TWh),&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; with conventional thermal plants only in operation during peak load periods or when hydroelectric output is curtailed by weather events.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Peru/Electricity.html EIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112222815/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Peru/Electricity.html |date=January 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This “underuse” of the country’s thermal capacity is due to the high variable costs of thermal generation. In 2004, the country’s reserve margin was estimated at 45%. However, when those high cost thermal plants were taken out of the equation, margins fell to as low as 15%.&lt;ref name="IPE2004"&gt;[http://www.ipe.org.pe/publicaciones/docs/Presentacion%20%20-%20Sector%20ELECTRICO%20(Ica)%20-%2017.07.2004.ppt Peruvian Economic Institute]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to reduce the country’s reliance upon hydroelectricity, the Peruvian government has encouraged greater investment in gas-fired power plants.  The controversial [[Camisea Gas Project]] has opened up natural gas production in Peru, with the first new 140 MW gas-fired power plant in Tumbes to start operations by the end of 2007.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The Camisea project is considered strategic for it is expected to contribute to reduce the existing deficit in Peru’s hydrocarbons trade balance by substituting imports (mainly of diesel and LPG) and allowing exports (naphta, LPG surpluses).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20020910065853/http://www.camisea.com.pe/project.asp Camisea Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamic nature of the electricity sector has continued during 2007, with an estimated 9.3% increase in generation, which is expected to reach 30 TWh. This increase is mainly due to the existing positive conditions for thermal generation through the use of natural gas in new plants and also to an increase in hydroelectric generation due to the availability of hydrological resources in the existing hydroelectric facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071020025049/http://www.surnoticias.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3159 Sur Noticias]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand ===

In 2006, total electricity consumption in Peru was 24 TWh, which corresponds to 872 kWh per capita per year. The consumption share for the different economic sectors is as follows:&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

* Industrial: 66%
* Residential: 24%
* Commercial: 19%
* Public lighting: 3%

=== Demand and supply projections ===

In terms of demand projections, the Ministry of Energy and Mines estimates that electricity demand will increase between 5.6% and 7.4% per year between 2007-2015.&lt;ref name="vicenergia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minem.gob.pe/archivos/ogp/GVEP/vicenergia.pdf |title=Ministerio de Energía y Minas, 2007. Presentation |access-date=2008-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313014142/http://www.minem.gob.pe/archivos/ogp/GVEP/vicenergia.pdf |archive-date=2008-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that per capita electricity demand will reach 1,632 kWh in 2030.&lt;ref name="APEC"&gt;APEC, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet this increasing demand, Peru will rely on natural gas, which is the most cost competitive option among all other fuel types. As such, it is expected that installed capacity of gas-fired electricity generation increases from 0.3 GW in 2002 to 6.0 GW in 2030. It is expected that, from 2026 onwards, natural gas will acquire the dominant share in the electricity generation mix, reaching 44% in 2030 compared with hydroelectricity's 37% share for the same year.&lt;ref name="APEC"&gt;APEC, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to electricity ==

In 2006, 79% of the population in Peru had access to electricity,&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; a percentage that is below the 94.6 average for the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] region &lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt; Peru has one of the lowest rural electrification rates in Latin America. Coverage in the predominantly poor rural areas is about 30%, with more than six million people without access to electricity. In its 2004 National Rural Electrification Plan (PNER), the Government of Peru reiterated its commitment to reduce the electrification gap, aiming to increase rural coverage from 30% to 75% by 2013.&lt;ref name="WB2006" &gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/02/21/000112742_20060221120152/Rendered/PDF/32686010PE.pdf World Bank 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==

=== Interruption frequency and duration ===

In 2005, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 14.5, while duration of interruptions per subscriber was 18.3 hours. Both numbers are very close to the [[weighted mean|weighted averages]] of 13 interruptions and 14 hours for the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] region.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;

=== Distribution and transmission losses ===

Losses in 2006 amounted to 11% of total production. Distribution losses were 6.3%,&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; down from 22% a decade before and below the 13.5% [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] average.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm Benchmarking data of the electricity distribution sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region 1995-2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902081216/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm |date=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission losses for the same year have been estimated at 4.7%.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

== Responsibilities in the electricity sector ==

=== Policy and regulation ===

The National Electricity Office (DGE - ''Dirección General de la Electricidad''), under the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), is in charge of setting electricity policies and regulations and of granting concessions. It is also responsible for elaborating generation and transmission expansion plans and has to approve the relevant procedures for the operation of the electricity system.&lt;ref name="OSINERG05" &gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The Energy and Mining Investment Supervisory Body (OSINERGMIN - ''Organismo Supervisor de Inversión en Energía y Miniería''), created in 1996 as OSINERG (Mining competences were added recently, in January 2007), is in charge of enforcing compliance with the Electricity Concessions Law (LCE) of 1992 and is also in charge of ensuring the electricity public service. OSINERG is as well the body responsible for enforcing the fiscal obligations of the license holders as established by the law and its regulation. Finally, it is responsible for monitoring compliance of the System Economic Operation Committees (COES) functions and for determining biannually the percentages of market participation by the companies.&lt;ref name="OSINERG05"&gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, OSINERG was merged with the Electricity Tariffs Commission (CTE), currently known as Adjunct Office for Tariff Regulation (GART). Together, they are in charge of fixing generation, transmission and distribution tariffs and the tariff adjustment conditions for the end consumers. They also determine the tariffs for transport and distribution of gas by pipeline.&lt;ref name="OSINERG05"&gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

As for rural electrification, the National Rural Electrification Office (DGER) is in charge of the National Rural Electrification Plan (PNER), which is framed under the policy guidelines set by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. DGER is in charge of the execution and coordination of projects in rural areas and regions of extreme poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minem.gob.pe/ministerio/dger.asp |title=Ministry of Energy and Mines |access-date=2007-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123015701/http://www.minem.gob.pe/ministerio/dger.asp |archive-date=2007-11-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the National Institute for Defense of Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property (INDECOPI) is in charge of monitoring compliance with the Anti-[[monopoly]] and Anti-[[oligopoly]] Law of 1997.&lt;ref name="OSINERG05"&gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generation ===

In 2006, 38 companies generated electricity for the market, while 78 companies produced electricity for their own use.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; Among the 38 companies supplying energy to the market, four of them accounted for 70% of the total capacity:&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

* EDEGEL S.A.A.: 1,574MW
* Electroperú S.A. (ELP): 1,032 MW
* KALLPA Generación
* ENERSUR: 725 MW
* EGENOR: 522 MW

ELP dominates hydroelectric production, with 32% of the total, while EDEGEL leads thermal generation also with 32% of the total.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

Private companies dominate the generation sector. In terms of participation, state companies hold 31% of generation capacity, with the remaining 69% in private hands. Production percentages are 40% and 60% for the public and private companies respectively.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

=== Transmission ===

In Peru, 100% of the transmission activities are in private hands. In 2006, there were 6 purely transmission companies that participated in electricity transmission in Perú: Red de Energía del Perú S.A. (REPSA), with 28% of the transmission lines; and Consorcio Energético Huancavelica (CONENHUA), Consorcio Transmantaro S.A. (S.A. Transmantaro), Eteselva S.R.L, Interconexión Eléctrica ISA Perú (ISAPERU) and Red Eléctrica del Sur.S.A. (REDESUR), with 15% of the lines. Generation and distribution utilities and the companies that generate electricity for their own consumption operate the remaining 57% of the transmission lines.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

=== Distribution ===

In 2006, 63% of the electricity was commercialized by 22 distribution companies, while the remaining 37% was commercialized directly by generation companies. The companies that stood out for their sales to end-consumers were: Luz del Sur (21%), Edelnor (21%), Enersur (9%), Edegel (8%), Electroperú (5%), [[Hidrandina]] (4%), Termoselva (4%) and Electroandes (4%).&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

Public distribution companies supply electricity to 55% of the existing clients, with the remaining 45% in hands of the private utilities. However, in terms of electricity distributed, private companies have the lead with 71% of the total as opposed to 29% for the public ones.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

== Renewable energy resources ==
The National Environment Fund (FONAM) was created in 1997 and received the mandate from the Peruvian Congress to identify and promote projects that exploit renewable energy sources, introduce clean technologies, and promote energy efficiency and the substitution of highly polluting fuels. However, the contribution of renewable energy sources other than hydroelectricity is still very limited in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fonamperu.org/general/quienes.php |title=FONAM |access-date=2007-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012150529/http://fonamperu.org/general/quienes.php |archive-date=2007-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[Hydroelectricity]] is the only renewable resource exploited in Peru.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; In 2006, it accounted for 48% of total installed capacity and 72% of electricity generated. The largest hydroelectric facility in the country is the 900 MW [[Mantaro Valley|Mantaro]] Complex in southern Peru, which is operated by state-owned Electroperu. The two hydroelectric plants at the complex generate over one-third of Peru’s total electricity supply. In February 2006, Egecen S.A. completed construction of the 130-MW, Yuncán hydroelectric plant, located northeast of Lima. The plant will be operated by EnerSur, a subsidiary of Brussels-based Suez Energy International.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/eedrb/data/PE-elico.html IAEA]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Construction on the multi-purpose [[Olmos Transandino Project]] has been underway since 2006 and in February 2010, the contract for its [[hydroelectricity]] [[power plant]] is expected to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrialinfo.com/showAbstract.jsp?newsitemID=151649 Peru's Olmos Hydropower Project PEOT Extends Bidding Timetable]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[power station]] in northwest Peru's [[Cajamarca]] province will have a 600 MW capacity and produce 4,000 GWh annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?Id=oJLwr4C8BRI= |title=Peru builds 20km water tunnel in Lambayeque March 18, 2008 |access-date=June 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626091212/http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=oJLwr4C8BRI= |archive-date=June 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the 406 MW dam on [[Marañón River]] in [[Chaglla District]] started in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sectorelectricidad.com/2781/peru-se-inicio-obra-de-central-hidroelectrica-chaglla-de-406mw/ |title=Perú: Se inició obra de Central Hidroeléctrica Chaglla de 406MW |work=www.sectorelectricidad.com |date=21 August 2012|accessdate=6 September 2017 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 525 MW Cerro del Águila was inaugurated in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sectorelectricidad.com/16433/peru-ministro-de-energia-y-minas-inauguro-central-hidroelectrica-cerro-del-aguila/ |title=Perú: Se inauguró central hidroeléctrica Cerro del Águila-525MW |work=www.sectorelectricidad.com |date=3 November 2016|accessdate=6 September 2017 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Salcca-Pucara hydroelectric project]] received the last of several approvals it needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aprueban construcción de hidroeléctrica Salcca Pucara |url=https://larepublica.pe/archivo/679068-aprueban-construccion-de-hidroelectrica-salcca-pucara |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=La República |date=11 December 2012 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wind ===
Studies from the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (SENAMHI) have estimated a total windpower potential of 19 GWh/year for Peru, or about 70% of current electricity consumption. The Departments of [[Talara Province|Talara]], Laguna Grande, Marcona and Pta. Atico are the regions with the largest wind potential. However, the absence of a regulatory framework and of a reliable record of wind potential, together with the lack of human, financial, and technical resources, has so far hindered the exploitation of Peru’s windpower potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minem.gob.pe/archivos/ogp/GVEP/6%20Mayorga%20Emilio%20CI.pdf |title=Wind potential in Peru |access-date=2007-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122185549/http://www.minem.gob.pe/archivos/ogp/GVEP/6%20Mayorga%20Emilio%20CI.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of [[wind power]] to the energy matrix in Peru was negligible in the first decade of the 21st century, with just 0.7 MW of installed capacity in 2006.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; In 2014 three large wind farms were inaugurated: the 32MW Marcona Wind Farm in the Ica region, the 83MW Cupisnique Wind Farm in Pacasmayo and the 30MW Talara Wind Farm in the Piura region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peruviantimes.com/24/humala-inaugurates-us71-million-wind-farm/23317/ "Humala Inaugurates US$71 Million Wind Farm"] in ''Peruvian Times'', 24 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/contourglobal-inaugurates-perus-largest-wind-farm-277000871.html "ContourGlobal Inaugurates Peru's Largest Wind Farm"], 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The 132 MW&lt;!--51% capfac--&gt; Wayra 1 in [[Marcona District]] is scheduled for completion in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/17/09/w10011582/enel-starts-construction-of-perus-largest-wind-farm |title=Enel Starts Construction of Peru&amp;#039;s Largest Wind Farm|work=Benzinga |date=4 September 2017 |accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar ===

It has been estimated that Peru has favorable conditions for the development of [[solar energy]] projects. However, the country’s solar potential has not been exploited yet. In the mountain ranges located in the South, solar energy reaches average levels above 6 kWh/m2/day, which are among the highest worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fonamperu.org/general/energia/documentos/promox.pdf |title=FONAM Renewable Energy |access-date=2007-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819144108/http://www.fonamperu.org/general/energia/documentos/promox.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises in Peru==
A study by the [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] found that despite the high potential for energy cost savings across the private sector, a number of barriers prevent businesses in Peru from identifying and implementing energy efficiency opportunities in their premises and operations. &lt;ref&gt;[https://cdkn.org/resource/inside-story-catalysing-energy-efficiency-small-medium-sized-enterprises-priority-sectors-peru/?loclang=en_gb INSIDE STORY: Catalysing energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises in priority sectors in Peru], the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy demand in Peru is expected to continue to increase over the coming decades, largely fuelled by industrial expansion and increasing economic prosperity. The Peruvian Government has, however, recognised the importance of energy efficiency as a key element in climate change mitigation strategy and action, with energy efficiency featuring among the climate change mitigation actions in Peru’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the [[Paris Agreement]] of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), and also in Peru’s Planning for Climate Change project, known as ‘PlanCC’. &lt;ref&gt;[https://cdkn.org/resource/inside-story-catalysing-energy-efficiency-small-medium-sized-enterprises-priority-sectors-peru/?loclang=en_gb INSIDE STORY: Catalysing energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises in priority sectors in Peru], the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, accessdate 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the electricity sector ==

=== Early history ===

From its inception, the Peruvian electricity system started to be developed by private initiative. In 1955, Law No. 12378 regulated the mechanisms of private participation, establishing a system of concessions with commitments to increase generation capacity by 10% annually. The National Tariff Commission and other mechanisms aiming at guaranteeing the profitability of the investments were then created. However, at the beginning of the 1970s, profound changes took place. In 1972, the ''de facto'' military government nationalized the electricity industry through Law No.19521, creating ELECTROPERU (Peru Electricity Company). ELECTROPERU became the owner of all the generation, transmission and distribution assets and came to be in charge of service provision and investment planning. Until the beginning of the 1980s there were large investments in hydroelectric and thermal projects. However, this dynamism started to fade during the 1980s mainly due to the debt crisis that started in 1982 and that precluded new financing in the region. By the beginning of the 1990s, the electricity sector in Peru showed an important deterioration due to low investment in infrastructure, the fact that tariffs did not cover production costs, the restricted investment in maintenance and the systematic destruction of infrastructures by terrorist activities. The results of this crisis were severe: in 1990 only 45% of the population had access to electricity, supply only covered 74% of the demand and distribution losses were above 20%.&lt;ref name="OSINERG05"&gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The structural reform process that started in 1992 under the government of President [[Alberto Fujimori]] led to the privatization of the electricity sector in a decade in which most of the countries in the region underwent a similar process. The restructuring process, articulated in the Electricity Concessions Law (LCE) of 1992, unbundled the vertically integrated state monopoly into [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electricity transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] and led the basis for the introduction of private operators and competition for generation and commercialization, with transmission and distribution regulated on the basis of free entry and open access. The 1992 Law was modified by Law No. 26876 (Anti-monopoly and Anti-oligopoly Law) in 1997. The process of concessions and transfer of generation assets to private companies was started in 1994 and relaunched in 2002 as it had not been completed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.osinerg.gob.pe/newweb/uploads/Estudios_Economicos/DT03-OEE-OSINERGa.pdf |title=ONISERG (2) |access-date=2011-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225553/http://www.osinerg.gob.pe/newweb/uploads/Estudios_Economicos/DT03-OEE-OSINERGa.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Private companies emerging from the 1992 reforms made substantial investment commitments that were fulfilled in the following years. Investment figures reached their highest levels in the period 1996-1999, declining afterwards once the commitments had been fulfilled. The high level of investment led to annual average increases in installed capacity of 9.2%, a rate that was not matched by the increase in demand, which increased at only 4.7% per year on average. As a result, the level of reserves in the National Interconnected System (SEIN) increased at average rates of 23.2%. Investments in transmission and distribution led to increases in coverage from 53% in 1993 to 76% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.osinerg.gob.pe/newweb/uploads/Estudios_Economicos/DT03a-OEE-OSINERGa.pdf |title=OSINERG (1) |access-date=2011-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225610/http://www.osinerg.gob.pe/newweb/uploads/Estudios_Economicos/DT03a-OEE-OSINERGa.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s developments ===

In September 2000, the Law for the Promotion of Energy Efficiency (Law No. 27345) was approved, declaring support for the efficient use of energy to be in the national interest. The regulation for this Law was approved in October 2007 (by Supreme Decree No. 053-2007-EM). The objectives of the Law are to contribute to energy security, improve the country’s competitiveness, generate surplus for exports, reduce environmental impacts, protect consumers and raise awareness about the importance of [[efficient energy use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://intranet.minem.gob.pe/AppWeb/AppIntranet/Notihoy/notihoy_3547.pdf |title=Ministry of Energy and Mines |access-date=2007-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122200604/http://intranet.minem.gob.pe/AppWeb/AppIntranet/Notihoy/notihoy_3547.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for rural electrification, there have been several attempts to change the existing institutional and legal framework. In recent years, there have been two laws passed by Congress (the Law for Electrification of Rural and Isolated or Frontier Areas in 2002 and the Law to Regulate the Promotion of Private Investment in Rural Electrification in 2004) but neither of them has been implemented due to conflicts with provisions in other laws.&lt;ref name="WB2006"/&gt;

== Tariffs and subsidies ==

=== Tariffs ===

In 2006, the average residential tariff in Peru was US$0.1046 per kWh,&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt; [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] [[weighted mean|weighted average]] in 2005 was US$0.115.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;

In the unregulated market, the average tariff for final customers was US$0.0558 per kWh for the electricity supplied directly from the generators and US$0.0551 per kWh for the electricity supplied by distribution companies.&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

=== Subsidies ===

Law No. 275010 created, in November 2001, the Electricity Social Compensation Fund (FOSE). This Fund established a cross-subsidy system among consumers that benefits users with monthly consumption below 100kWh through fixed and proportional discounts. The fixed discount applies to consumers between 30 and 100 kWh and the proportional discount is targeted to those with consumptions below 30 kWh. The amount of the discounts is financed through a surcharge in the tariff paid by the regulated consumers with monthly consumptions above 100 kWh.&lt;ref name="OSINERG05"&gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of households that benefit from this scheme is over 2.4 million (out of the 3.6 million connected households at the national level). In  July 2004, the FOSE was extended to cover up to 50% of the bill in the National Interconnected System (SEIN) and 62.5% in the isolated systems for the users with consumption below 30kWh, including as well a special focus by geographic location (rural-urban).&lt;ref name="OSINERG05"&gt;OSINERG 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

(See [https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225633/http://www.osinerg.gob.pe/newweb/uploads/Estudios_Economicos/DT07-OEE-OSINERGa.pdf Evaluation of the FOSE] for a detailed analysis of the results of the FOSE.)

== Investment and financing ==

=== Investment by subsector ===

In 2004, annual investment needs in the electricity sector up to 2016 were estimated at US$200 million, considering a projected annual demand increase of 5%.&lt;ref name="IPE2004"&gt;[http://www.ipe.org.pe/publicaciones/docs/Presentacion%20%20-%20Sector%20ELECTRICO%20(Ica)%20-%2017.07.2004.ppt Peruvian Economic Institute]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total investment in the electricity sector in 2006 was US$480.2 million, which was 22% higher than the amount for 2005. Investment in [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electricity transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] added up to US$446.2 million, while investment by the Executive Office for Projects (DEP) in the Rural Electrification was US$34 million. The table below summarizes the contribution of both the private and the public sector:&lt;ref name="MINEM07"/&gt;

Investment by private companies has taken off after having reached very low numbers by 2003 (US$120 million, matching public investment for that year) after the general decline in investment that happened from 1999 onwards.&lt;ref name="IPE2004"/&gt;

==== Investment requirements ====

To meet expected demand, total investment needs in electricity generation and transmission between 2002 and 2030 are estimated to be US$16.2-20.7 million.&lt;ref name="APEC"&gt;APEC, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing ===

====Rural electrification====

After the power sector reform in the early 1990s, rural electrification in Peru has been limited to direct investment by the central government, without any additional funds from communities, regional governments or service providers. One important issue deterring electricity distribution companies from investing in rural electrification is the fact that they hold concession areas concentrated in small areas around urban centers and are only under the obligation to meet service requests within 100 meters of the existing network.&lt;ref name="WB2006"/&gt;

To expand coverage, the Government of Peru has been spending an average of US$40–50 million per year in the last ten years for electrification. These investments were carried out through social funds (e.g. FONCODES – Cooperation Fund for Social Development) and, to a larger extent, by the Executive Office for Projects (DEP), a division of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM). The DEP, which is currently in the process of being absorbed by the National Rural Electrification Office (DGER),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minem.gob.pe/archivos/dge/publicaciones/compendio/ds026-2007.pdf |title=El Peruano |access-date=2007-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205095517/http://www.minem.gob.pe/archivos/dge/publicaciones/compendio/ds026-2007.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is in charge of planning, designing and constructing the rural electricity systems. Once they are finalized, the rural electricity systems are handed over for operation either to state-owned distribution companies or to a specially created state-owned asset-holding company that manages the systems under operation contracts with state-owned companies, or municipalities.&lt;ref name="WB2006"/&gt;

== Summary of private participation in the electricity sector ==

The structural reform process that started in 1992 unbundled the vertically integrated state monopoly and led to the privatization of the electricity sector. Today, private companies dominate the generation sector with almost 70% of capacity in their hands. Although there are about 40 companies that generate electricity for the market, just 4 of them (EDEGEL S.A.A., Electroperú S.A., Energía del Sur S.A. and EGENOR) account for 70% of the total capacity.

As for transmission, 100% is in the hands of several private companies, while 71% of electricity distributed and 45% of the existing clients were also controlled by private companies.

== Electricity and the environment ==

=== Responsibility for the environment ===

The National Environment Commission (CONAM), created in 1994, holds the Environmental responsibilities in Peru and promotes sustainable development. CONAM is a decentralized public agency under the Ministry of the Presidency. Its Management Committee consists of 10 members from the national, regional and local governments; economic sector representatives; NGOs; universities and professional associations. The National Environmental Agenda is the instrument that prioritizes environmental issues identified at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conam.gob.pe/modulos/home/queeselconam.asp National Environment Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026123908/http://www.conam.gob.pe/modulos/home/queeselconam.asp |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, CONAM created the National Climate Change Strategy, which was aimed at transmitting the relevance of Peru’s vulnerability to climate change. The main objective was to stress the need to incorporate in the country’s policies and programs the necessary adaptation measures and to make the population aware of the existing risks and the actions they can undertake to use resources responsibly. The Program to Strengthen the National Capacity to manage Climate Change and Air Pollution ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071104133612/http://www.conam.gob.pe/proclim/ PROCLIM]) was created to implement the aforementioned Strategy. PROCLIM aims to contribute to poverty reduction by promoting the integration of climate change and air quality issues in sustainable development policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.conam.gob.pe/cambioclimatico/peru_cambio_climatico/index_cambio_climatico.asp |title=Climate Change Peru |access-date=2007-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102103206/http://www.conam.gob.pe/cambioclimatico/peru_cambio_climatico/index_cambio_climatico.asp |archive-date=2007-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===

[http://www.olade.org OLADE] (Latin American Energy Association) estimated that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from electricity production in 2003 were 3.32 million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which corresponds to 13% of total emissions from the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olade.org/informe.html OLADE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074348/http://www.olade.org/informe.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CDM projects in electricity ===

Currently (November 2007), there are seven registered [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] projects in the electricity sector in Peru, with overall estimated emission reductions of 800,020 tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e per year.&lt;ref name="UNFCCC"&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html UNFCCC]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55705">'''Enactivism''' argues that [[cognition]] arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting [[organism]] and its environment.&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world.&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt; "Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: ''they enact a world''."&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about [[free will]] remains a topic of active debate.&lt;ref name=Manetti/&gt;

The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as "the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation".&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt; The introduction of the term ''enaction'' in this context is attributed to  [[Francisco Varela]], [[Evan Thompson]], and [[Eleanor Rosch]],&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt; who proposed the name to "emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs".&lt;ref name=Varela/&gt; This was further developed by Thompson and others,&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt;

The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as "cognitively marginal",&lt;ref name=ClarkA/&gt; but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions.&lt;ref name="Jaegher1"/&gt; "In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=Rohde/&gt;

Enactivism is closely related to [[situated cognition]] and [[embodied cognition]], and is presented as an alternative to [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Cartesian dualism]].

==Philosophical aspects&lt;!--'Enaction (philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;==

Enactivism is one of  a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the ''4Es''.&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

Enactivism proposes an alternative to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes.&lt;ref name=EThompson/&gt; The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology.   In this sense, individuals can be seen to "grow into" or arise from their interactive role with the world.&lt;ref name=Burman/&gt;
:"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act."&lt;ref name=Hutchins/&gt;

In ''The Tree of Knowledge'' Maturana &amp; Varela proposed the term ''enactive''&lt;ref name=Maturana/&gt; "to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism&lt;ref group=Note name=Cognitivism/&gt; or connectionism.&lt;ref group=Note name=Connectionism/&gt; They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of [[representationalism]] and [[solipsism]]. They seek to "confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a ''via media'': to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions.  Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close."[''Tree of Knowledge'', p.&amp;nbsp;241]

Enactivism also addresses the [[hard problem of consciousness]], referred to by Thompson as part of the ''[[explanatory gap]]'' in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body.&lt;ref name=EThompson2/&gt;  "The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction".&lt;ref name=EThompson3/&gt; Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as exemplified by [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] is to complement science and its objectification of the world. "The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression" (Merleau-Ponty, ''The phenomenology of perception'' as quoted by Thompson, p.&amp;nbsp;165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology "science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing."&lt;ref name=EThompson4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt;

Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin [[representationalism]] with [[phenomenalism]], that is, as adopting a [[constructivist epistemology]], an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality.&lt;ref name=Mutelesi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiari/&gt; However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it.&lt;ref name=Glaserfeld/&gt; Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower ''constructs'' a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt;

How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that [[Ernst von Glasersfeld|Glasersfeld]] expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize  the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the "perturbation relative to some expected result" that then leads to a new understanding.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt; It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes ''affect'',&lt;ref name=Ward2/&gt; that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that "perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another."&lt;ref name=Diettrich/&gt; The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and Glasersfeld.

Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an [[Introduction to evolution|evolutionary]] emphasis,&lt;ref name=Diettrich2/&gt; is [[evolutionary epistemology]]. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to [[universal Darwinism]], and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Donald T. Campbell]], [[Peter Munz]], and [[Gary Cziko]].&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt; According to Munz, "an organism is an ''embodied theory'' about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc."&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munz/&gt;

===Enactive views of perception===
In the enactive view, perception "is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits."&lt;ref name=McGann2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alva Noë]] in advocating an enactive view of perception&lt;ref name=Noe&gt;
{{cite book |author=Alva Noë |title= Action in Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFKvU2hPhxEC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 1: The enactive approach to perception: An introduction |isbn=9780262140881 |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input.  He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active  'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.

Noë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt; Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach.  He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, [[Two-streams hypothesis|the two-streams hypothesis]]. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called "sensorimotor summarizing").&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt;

These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item. The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.

Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that "the hand [is]...an organ of cognition", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a "bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity."&lt;ref name="Hutto"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Hutto]]: "Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non-representational and content-free."&lt;ref name="Hutto2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hutto calls this position 'REC' (&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;adical &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;nactive &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ognition): "According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible."&lt;ref name="Hutto2" /&gt;

===Participatory sense-making===

[[Hanne De Jaegher]] and [[Ezequiel Di Paolo]] (2007)&lt;ref name="DeJaeger0"/&gt; have extended the enactive concept of sense-making&lt;ref name="EThompson3"/&gt; into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter.&lt;ref name=DeJaegher_etal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanne De Jaegher |author2=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author3=Shaun Gallagher |title= Can social interaction constitute social cognition? |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2010  |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 |pmid=20674467}}
&lt;/ref&gt; De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.

The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010).&lt;ref name="DeJaegher1"/&gt; It has been applied to research in [[social neuroscience]]''&lt;ref name="DiPaolo3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchilbachTimmermans&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=Leonhard Schilbach |author2=Bert Timmermans |author3=Vasudevi Reddy |author4=Alan Costall |author5=Gary Bente |author6=Tobias Schlicht |author7=Kai Vogeley |title= Toward a second-person neuroscience |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=2013  |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=393–414 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X12000660}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and [[autism]].''&lt;ref name="DeJaegher_autism"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hanne De Jaegher |title= Embodiment and sense-making in autism|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience |year=2012  |volume=7 |pages=15 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2013.00015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;''

In a similar vein, "an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself".&lt;ref name=STorrance&gt;
{{cite journal |title=An Inter-Enactive Approach to Agency: Participatory Sense-Making, Dynamics, and Sociality |author1=Steve Torrance |author2=Tom Froese |url=http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdf/froese_humana_2011.pdf |journal=Human Mente |volume=15 |pages=21–53 |year=2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question "What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?" It is:&lt;ref name=STorrance/&gt;
:1. to be a biologically autonomous ([[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]]) organism
:2. to generate ''significance'' or ''meaning'', rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world
:3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment
:4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world
:5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world.

Torrance adds that "many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents." That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. "Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely ''social interaction''...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents."&lt;ref name=FuchsT&gt;

In [[cultural psychology]], enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=Verheggen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 8: Enactivism |author1=Cor Baerveldt |author2=Theo Verheggen |title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WljI1r2e-SUC&amp;pg=PA165 |pages=165''ff'' |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.013.0009 |isbn=9780195396430 |date=May 2012 |quote= Whereas the enactive approach in general has focused on sense-making as an embodied and situated activity, enactive cultural psychology emphasizes the expressive and dynamically enacted nature of cultural meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that "It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities." They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, "the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action....The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'.&lt;ref name=Baerveldt&gt;

==Artificial intelligence aspects==

{{main|Enactive interfaces}}
The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in [[Cognitive robotics|robotics]] and [[Human–computer interaction|man-machine interfaces]]. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that,&lt;ref name=Sandini&gt;
{{cite book |chapter=The ''iCub'' cognitive humanoid robot: An open-system research platform for enactive cognition |author1=Giulio Sandini |author2=Giorgio Metta |author3=David Vernon |title=50 Years of Artificial Intelligence: Essays Dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of Artificial Intelligence |editor1=Max Lungarella |editor2=Fumiya Iida |editor3=Josh Bongard |editor4=Rolf Pfeifer |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn= 9783540772958}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni&gt;
{{cite book |title=Emotional Engineering: Service Development |chapter=§4.5.2 Design tools based upon enactive interfaces |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow-UFDj15rUC&amp;pg=PA78 |pages=78 ''ff'' |isbn=9781849964234 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |author=Monica Bordegoni |editor=Shuichi Fukuda}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas it is common to refer to [[affordance]]s as a design concept, the idea that an environment or an interface affords opportunities for enaction, and good design involves optimizing the role of such affordances.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Design of Everyday Things |edition=Revised and expanded |quote=An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVQPAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 |year=2013 |page=11 |isbn=978-0465050659 |publisher=Basic Books |author=Don Norman |chapter=Affordances }}

The activity in the AI community also has influenced enactivism as whole. Referring extensively to modeling techniques for [[evolutionary robotics]] by Beer,&lt;ref name=Beer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, "an operational, empirically observable phenomenon."&lt;ref name=McGann3&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marek McGann |author2=Hanne De Jaegher |author3=Ezequiel Di Paolo |year= 2013 |title=Enaction and psychology |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=203–209 |url= https://www.academia.edu/4993021/Enaction_and_Psychology |doi= 10.1037/a0032935 |quote=Such modeling techniques allow us to explore the parameter space of coupling between agent and environment...to the point that their basic principles (the universals, if such there are, of enactive psychology) can be brought clearly into view.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.

[[Image:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|right|300px|By the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Silk Road]] was firmly established.]]
[[Image:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Eurasia around 200 CE]]

The '''history of Eurasia''' is the collective history of a continental area with several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Europe]], linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]] of [[Central Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Perhaps beginning with the [[Steppe Route]] trade, the early [[Silk Road]], the Eurasian view of history seeks establishing genetic, cultural, and linguistic links between European and Asian cultures of antiquity. In fact, much interest in this area lies with the presumed origin of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language]] and [[Chariot warfare]] in [[Central Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, for instance, gives an overall view of Central Eurasian history&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory ==
{{main|Prehistoric Europe|Prehistoric Asia}}

===Lower Paleolithic===

Fossilized remains of [[Homo ergaster]] and [[Homo erectus]] between 1.8 and 1.0 million years old have been found in Europe (Georgia ([[Dmanisi]]), Spain), Indonesia (e.g., [[Sangiran]] and [[Trinil]]), Vietnam, and China (e.g., Shaanxi). (See also:[[Multiregional hypothesis]].) The first remains are of [[Olduwan]] culture, later of [[Acheulean]] and [[Clactonian]] culture. Finds of later fossils, such as [[Homo cepranensis]], are local in nature, so the extent of human residence in Eurasia during 1,000,000 - 300,000 ybp remains a mystery.

=== Middle Paleolithic ===
[[Geologic temperature record]]s indicate two intense ice ages dated around [[Cromerian Stage|650000 ybp]] and [[Anglian Stage|450000 ybp]]. These would have presented any humans outside the [[tropics]] unprecedented difficulties. Indeed, fossils from this period are very few, and little can be said of human habitats in Eurasia during this period. The few finds are of [[Homo antecessor]] and [[Homo heidelbergensis]], and [Lantian Man]] in China. 

After this,[[Homo neanderthalensis]], with his [[Mousterian]] technology, emerged, in areas from Europe to western Asia and continued to be the dominant group of humans in Europe and the Middle East up until 40000-28000 ybp. [[Peking man]] has also been dated to this period. During the [[Eemian Stage]], humans probably (e.g. [[Wolf Cave]]) spread wherever their technology and skills allowed. TBhe [[Saharan pump theory|Sahara dried]] up, forming a difficult area for peoples to cross.

The birth of the first modern humans ([[Homo sapiens idaltu]]) has been dated between 200000 to 130000 ybp (see:[[Mitochondrial Eve]], [[Single-origin hypothesis]]), that is, to the coldest phase of the [[Riss glaciation]]. Remains of [[Aterian]] culture appear in the archaeological evidence.

==== Population bottleneck ====
In the beginning of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]] a [[Toba catastrophe theory|supervolcano]] erupted in Indonesia. Theory states the effects of the eruption caused global climatic changes for many years, effectively obliterating most of the earlier cultures. [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] (90000 - 60000 BP, [[Y-chromosomal_Adam#Time_frame|dated data]]) was initially dated here. [[Neanderthal]]s survived this abrupt change in the environment, so it's possible for other human groups too. According to the theory humans survived in Africa, and began to resettle areas north, as the effects of the eruption slowly vanished. [[Great Leap Forward (evolution)|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] began after this extreme event, the earliest finds are dated c.50000 BCE.

A divergence in genetical evidence occurs during the early phase of the glaciation. Descendants of female [[haplogroup]]s [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M]], [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N]] and male [[Haplogroup CT (Y-DNA)|CT]] are the  ones found among Eurasian peoples today.

=== Upper Paleolithic ===
[[Image:Upper Paleolihic Art in Europe.gif|thumb|300px|right|Humans populated all of ice-free Europe during the Upper Paleolithic]]
{{see|Early human migrations|Neanderthal admixture|Emireh culture|Ordosian culture|Châtelperronian|Aurignacian|Gravettian|Solutrean|Magdalenian}}
{{See also|Pre-history of the Southern Levant}}
The [[Southern Dispersal]] scenario postulates the arrival of [[anatomically modern humans]] to Eurasia beginning about 70,000 BC. Moving along the southern coast of Asia, they reached [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] by about 65,000 years ago. 
The establishment of population centers in Western Asia, the Indian subcontinent and in East Asia is attested by about 50,000 years ago.
The Eurasian Upper Paleolithic proper is taken after c. 45,000 years ago, with the [[Cro-Magnon]] expansion of [[European early modern humans|into Europe]] ([[Mousterian]]), and the expansion into the [[Mammoth steppe]] of Northern Asia.


==== Migrations ====
[[Image:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A model of human migration on the globe, based on mitochondrial genetics.]]
Tracing back minute differences in the [[genome]]s of modern humans by methods of [[genetic genealogy]], can and have been used to produce models of [[historical migration]]. Though these give indications of the routes taken by ancestral humans, the dating of the various genetic markers is improving. The earliest migrations (dated c. 75.000 BP) from the [[Red Sea]] shores have been most likely along southern coast of Asia. After this, tracking and timing genetical markers gets increasingly difficult. What is known, is that on areas, of what is now Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, genetic markers diversify (from about 60000 BCE), and subsequent migrations emerge to all directions (even back to the [[Levant]]) and North Africs. From the foothills of the [[Zagros]], [[big game hunting]] cultures developed which spread across the [[Eurasian]] [[steppe]].  Crossing the [[Caucasus]] and the Ural Mountains were the ancestors of Samoyeds and the ancestors of Uralic peoples, developing sleds, skis and canoes.  Through [[Kazakhstan]] moved the ancestors of the Indigenous Americans (dated 50000 - 40000 BCE). Eastbound (maybe through [[Dzungaria]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] went the ancestors of the northern Chinese and Koreans. It is possible that the routes taken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ancestors travelled across the Bosphorus. Genetic evidence suggests a number of separate migrations (1.Anatoleans 2.Tocharians, 3 Celto-Illyrians, 4.Germanic and Slav, - possibly in this order). Archaeological evidence has not been identified for a number of different groups. On historical linguistic evidence, see for example [[classification of Thracian]]. The traditional view of associating early Celts with the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] with Germanic peoples.   The Roman Empire spread after the first widespread use of iron outside Central Europe from the [[Villanovan culture]] area. Most likely there was trade also in these periods, e.g. with [[Amber#Amber art and ornament|amber]] and [[salt]] being major products. 

Influences from northern Africa via [[Cardium Pottery|Gibraltar]] and [[Sicani|Sicilia]] cannot be readily discounted. Many other questions remain open, too; for example, Neanderthals were still present at this time. More genetic data is being gathered by various research programs.

===Early Holocene===
{{main|Neolithic Revolution}}
{{See also|Mesolithic}}

[[File:European-middle-neolithic-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Primary cultural areas in Europe c.4500 BC]]

As the ice age ended, major environmental changes happened, such as [[sea level rise]] (est. 120m), vegetation changes, and animals disappearing in the [[Holocene extinction event]]. At the same time [[Neolithic revolution]] began and humans started to make [[pottery]], began to cultivate crops and [[Domestication|domesticated]] some animal species.  

Neolithic cultures in Eurasia are many, and best discussed in separate articles. Some of the articles on this subject include: [[Natufian culture]], [[Jōmon]] culture, [[List of Neolithic cultures of China]] and [[Mehrgarh]]. European sites are many, they are discussed in [[Prehistoric Europe]]. The finding of [[Ötzi the Iceman]] (dated 3300 BC) provides an important insight to [[Chalcolithic]] period in Europe. [[Proto-language]]s of various peoples have been forming in this period, though no literal evidence can (by definition) be found. Later migrations further complicate the study of migrations in this period.

==Writing, the civilizations emerge==
{{main|Ancient history|Civilisation}}
Origins of [[History of writing|writing]] are dated to fourth millennium BC. Writing may have started independently on various areas of Eurasia. It appears the skill spread relatively fast, giving people a new way of [[communication]].

The three regions of Western, Eastern and Southern Asia developed in a similar manner with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys.  The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], and [[History of China|China]] (along the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]) shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[History of mathematics|mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. [[Ancient Egypt]] also shared this model.   These civilizations were most likely in more or less regular contact with each other by the early versions of the [[silk road]]. 

Europe was different, however.  It was somewhat further north and contained no river systems to support agriculture.  Thus Europe remained comparatively undeveloped, with only the southern tips of the region ([[Greece]] and [[Italy]]) being able to fully borrow crops, technologies, and ideas from the Middle East and North Africa. Similarly, civilization didn't arise in [[Southeast Asia]] until contact was made with [[History of India|ancient India]], which gave rise to [[Indianized kingdom]]s in [[Indochina]] and the [[Malay archipelago]]. The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent.  The northern part of the silk road traversed this region. 

One such central expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] which spread their languages into the Middle East, India, Europe, and to the borders of China (with the [[Tocharians]]). Throughout their history, up to the development of [[gunpowder]], all the areas of Eurasia would be repeatedly menaced by the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] nomads from the steppe.

A difference between Europe and most of the regions of Eurasia is that each of the latter regions has few obstructions internally even though it is ringed by mountains and deserts. This meant that it was easier to establish unified control over the entire region, and this did occur with massive empires consistently dominating the Middle East, China, and at times, much of India. Europe, however, is riddled with internal mountain ranges: The [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]] and many others. Throughout its history, Europe has thus usually been divided into many small states, much like the [[Middle East]] and [[Indian subcontinent]] for much of their history.

The [[Iron Age]] made large stands of timber essential to a nation's success because smelting iron required so much fuel, and the pinnacles of human civilizations gradually moved as forests were destroyed.  In Europe the Mediterranean region was supplanted by the German and Frankish lands.  In the Middle East the main power center became [[Anatolia]] with the once dominant Mesopotamia its vassal.  In China, the economical, agricultural, and industrial center moved from the northern Yellow River to the southern Yangtze, though the political center remained in the north.  In part this is linked to technological developments, such as the mouldboard [[plough]], that made life in once undeveloped areas more bearable.

The civilizations in [[Han Dynasty|China]], [[Kushan Empire|India]], and [[Roman Empire|Mediterranean]], connected by the silk road, became the principal civilizations in Eurasia in early CE times. Later development of Eurasian history of mankind is told in other articles.

[[Image:Huon Peninsula NASA.jpg|thumb|280px|Huon Peninsula seen from space (false color)]]

'''Huon Peninsula''' is a large rugged peninsula on the island of [[New Guinea]] in [[Morobe Province]], eastern [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is named after [[France|French]] explorer [[Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec]]. The peninsula is dominated by the steep [[Saruwaged Range|Saruwaged]] and [[Finisterre Range|Finisterre]] and [[Cromwell Mountains]]. The nearest large town is the Morobe provincial capital [[Lae]] to the south, while settlements on the north coast include the former German town of [[Finschhafen]], the district capital of [[Wasu, Papua New Guinea|Wasu]], [[Malalamai]] and [[Saidor]] with its World War II era [[Saidor Airport]].

The area was the site of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] of [[World War II]], in 1943-44 as Japanese troops retreating from Lae fought their way over the Finisterre Mountains to [[Madang]] on the north coast.

==Flora and fauna==
The rainforests that cover these remote mountains provide habitats for many birds and animals and have been designated the '''Huon Peninsula Montane Rain Forests''' [[ecoregion]]. The rainforest of the hillsides consists of shorter trees and more herbs than you would find in lowland rainforests around the world, with predominant species of tree including ''[[Pometia (plant)|Pometia]]'', ''[[Canarium]]'', ''[[Anisoptera (plant)|Anisoptera]]'', ''[[Cryptocarya]]'' laurels, and ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]]'', while the higher slopes have thicker forests of yet smaller trees and the higher slopes of the Cromwell Range in particular hold the best-preserved large forest of ''[[Dacrydium]]'' conifers in the southern hemisphere.

Mammals indigenous to the Huon region include the endangered [[Matschie's tree-kangaroo]], while the birds include many of typical [[Australasia]]n families such as [[bowerbird]]s, [[Petroicidae|Australian robins]], [[honeyeater]]s  (including the endemic [[spangled honeyeater]]) and [[birds of paradise]] (including the endemic [[Huon astrapia]]). There are also endemic butterflies. Although some logging has taken place, the forests of the Huon Peninsula mountains are mostly undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Huon Peninsula montane rain forests|id=aa0107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
The [[raised beach]] coastal terraces of Huon were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on June 6, 2006 in the Mixed (Cultural + Natural) category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5066/ Houn Terraces - Stairway to the Past - UNESCO World Heritage Centre], Retrieved 2009-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[YUS Conservation Area]] was established in the northern part of the peninsula. YUS stretches over 760&amp;nbsp;km² and includes the three rivers, Yopno, Uruwa and Som, for which it was named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation.org/FMG/Articles/Pages/yus_conservation_agreement.aspx Conservation International], retrieved 19 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jell-O''' is a registered trademark of [[Kraft Foods]] for varieties of [[gelatin dessert]]s (fruit gels), [[pudding]]s, and no-bake [[cream pie]]s. The original gelatin desserts are sometimes referred to as '''jello'''.

==Description==
[[File:Day 18 - Still Eating The Green Jello (gifrancis).jpg|200px|thumb|Lime Jell-O]]
Jell-O is sold prepared (ready to eat) or in powder form, and is available in various colors and flavors. The powder contains powdered [[gelatin]] and flavorings, including [[sugar]] or [[artificial sweetener]]s. It is dissolved in hot water, then chilled and allowed to set.  Fruit, vegetables, and whipped cream can be added to make elaborate snacks that can be molded into shapes. Jell-O must be put in a refrigerator until served, and once set, it can be eaten.

Some nongelatin pudding and pie filling products are sold under the Jell-O brand. Pudding is cooked on the stove top with milk, then eaten warm or chilled until firmly set. Jell-O has an [[instant pudding]] product which is mixed with cold milk and chilled. To make pie fillings, the same products are prepared with less liquid.

==History==
===Early history===
[[Gelatin]], a protein produced from [[collagen]] extracted from boiled bones, connective tissues, and other animal products, has been a component of food, particularly desserts, since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Purdom|first=Candace|title=Program on History of Gelatin Breaks the Mold: Shedding Light on Familiar Dessert|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-10/news/0104100235_1_gelatin-jell-jell-o|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelatin was popularized in New York in the [[Victorian era]] with spectacular and complex jelly moulds. Gelatin was sold in sheets and had to be purified, which was time-consuming.  Gelatin desserts were the province of royalty and the relatively well-to-do. In 1845, a patent for powdered gelatin was obtained by industrialist [[Peter Cooper]], who built the first American [[steam]]-powered [[locomotive]], the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT4084|title=Improvement in the Preparation of ... &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=Google Patent Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/nyregion/04jello.html?ex=1210564800&amp;en=11a9dce77358ac6b&amp;ei=5070 | title=Upstate, Where It Was First Made, Unwavering Devotion to Jell-O | work=The New York Times | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=July 15, 2012 | author=Belson, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This powdered gelatin was easy to manufacture and easier to use in cooking.

In 1897, in [[Le Roy (town), New York|LeRoy, New York]], carpenter and cough syrup manufacturer [[Pearle Bixby Wait]] trademarked a gelatin dessert, called Jell-O. His wife May and he added [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], and [[lemon]] flavoring to granulated gelatin and sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellogallery.org/jellohistory.html|title=History of Jello|work=The Jell-O Gallery|publisher=Le Roy Historical Society|date=27 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213131934/http://www.jellogallery.org/jellohistory.html|archivedate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1899, Jell-O was sold to Orator Francis Woodward (1856–1906),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/2893 |title= Orator Francis Woodward| website=findagrave.com| accessdate= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose Genesee Pure Food Company produced the successful Grain-O health drink.

Various elements were key to Jell-O becoming a mainstream product: new technologies, such as [[refrigeration]], powdered gelatin and machine packaging, home economics classes, and the company's marketing.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |title=Mormonism’s Jell-O Mold |author=Christy Spackman |date=August 17, 2012 |work=[[Slate.com]] |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2012/08/jell_o_and_mormonism_the_stereotype_s_surprising_origins_.html |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Woodward struggled to sell the powdered product. Beginning in 1902, to raise awareness, Woodward's Genesee Pure Food Company placed [[advertisements]] in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' proclaiming Jell-O to be "America's Most Famous Dessert."&lt;ref name=Surprises&gt;{{cite web|title=The New JELL-O Book of Surprises|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/collections/collection-items/archives/ephemera/the-new-jell-o-book-of-surprises.aspx|website=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]]|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313123229/http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/collections/collection-items/archives/ephemera/the-new-jell-o-book-of-surprises.aspx|archivedate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jell-O was a minor success until 1904, when Genesee Pure Food Company sent armies of salesmen into the field to distribute free Jell-O cookbooks, a pioneering marketing tactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellomuseum.com/index.html#History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229061258/http://www.jellomuseum.com/index.html#History|title=The Jell-O Museum and Gallery|archivedate=29 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade, three new flavors, [[chocolate]] (discontinued in 1927), [[cherry]] and [[peach]], were added, and the brand was launched in Canada.&lt;ref name=Surprises/&gt; [[Celebrity]] testimonials and recipes appeared in advertisements featuring actress [[Ethel Barrymore]] and [[opera]] singer [[Ernestine Schumann-Heink]]. Some Jell-O illustrated advertisements were painted by [[Maxfield Parrish]].

In 1923, the newly rechristened Jell-O Company launched [[D-Zerta]], an artificially sweetened version of Jell-O. Two years later, [[Postum]] and Genesee merged, and in 1927 Postum acquired [[Clarence Birdseye]]'s frozen foods company to form the [[General Foods Corporation]].

[[File:Quick, Easy Jell-O Wonder Dishes 1930 Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|''Quick, Easy Jell-O Wonder Dishes'', Jell-O Cookbook]]
By 1930, there appeared a vogue in [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] for [[congealed salad]]s, and the company introduced [[Lime (fruit)|lime]]-flavored Jell-O to complement the add-ins that cooks across the country were combining in these [[aspic]]s and salads. Popular Jell-O recipes often included ingredients like cabbage, celery, green peppers, and even cooked pasta.&lt;ref name=Surprises/&gt;

By the 1950s, salads would become so popular that Jell-O responded with savory and vegetable flavors such as [[celery]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], mixed vegetable and seasoned [[tomato]]. These flavors have since been discontinued.&lt;ref name=Surprises/&gt;

In 1934, sponsorship from Jell-O made comedian [[Jack Benny]] the dessert's spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/640190382/A-timeline-set-in-Jell-O.html?pg=all | work=Deseret News (Salt Lake City) | title=A timeline set in Jell-O | date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate = July 15, 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Post introduced a [[jingle]] ("featured" by the agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/091000/bus_091000020.shtml Business – Jell-O pulls plug on longtime ad firm 09/10/00&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) that would be familiar over several decades, in which the spelling "J-E-L-L-O" was (or could be) sung over a rising five-note musical theme. The jingle was written by [[Don Bestor]], who was the bandleader for Jack Benny on his radio program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jello Again|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety141-1940-12#page/n97/mode/1up|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 11, 1940|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, chocolate returned to the Jell-O lineup, as an instant pudding made with milk. It proved enormously popular, and over time other pudding flavors were added such as [[vanilla]], [[tapioca]], [[coconut]], [[pistachio]], [[butterscotch]], [[egg custard]], [[flan]] and [[rice pudding]].

===Baby boom===
The [[baby boom]] saw a significant increase in sales for Jell-O. Young mothers didn't have the supporting community structures of earlier generations, so marketers were quick to promote easy-to-prepare prepackaged foods. By this time, creating a Jell-O dessert required simply boiling water, Jell-O and [[Tupperware]] molds.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

New flavors were continually added and unsuccessful flavors were removed: in the 1950s and 1960s, [[apple]], [[black cherry]], [[black raspberry]], [[grape]], lemon-lime, mixed fruit, orange-[[banana]], [[pineapple]]-[[grapefruit]], [[blackberry]], strawberry-banana, tropical fruit and more intense "wild" versions of the venerable strawberry, raspberry and cherry. In 1966, the Jell-O "No-Bake" dessert line was launched, which allowed a [[cheesecake]] to be made in 15 minutes. In 1969, [[Jell-O 1-2-3|Jell-O 1∗2∗3]] (later Jell-O 1•2•3), a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, was unveiled. Until 1987, Jell-O 1•2•3 was readily found in grocery stores throughout most of the United States, but the dessert is now rare. In 1971 packaged prepared pudding called Jell-O Pudding Treats were introduced. Jell-O Whip 'n Chill, a [[chocolate mousse|mousse]]-style dessert, was introduced and widely promoted; it remains available in limited areas today.  A similar dessert called Jell-O Soft Swirl was introduced in 1972, flavors included Chocolate Creme, Strawberry Creme, Vanilla Creme and Peach Creme.  [[Florence Henderson]] appeared in TV ads for this product.

===Sales decline and turnaround===
In 1964, the [[slogan]] "There's always room for Jell-O" was introduced, promoting the product as a "light dessert" that could easily be consumed even after a heavy meal.

Throughout the 1960s through the 1980s, Jell-O's sales steadily decreased. Many Jell-O dishes, such as desserts and Jell-O salads, became special occasion foods rather than everyday items. Marketers blamed this decline on decreasing family sizes, a "fast-paced" lifestyle and women's increasing employment. By 1986, a market study concluded that mothers with young children rarely purchased Jell-O.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

To turn things around, Jell-O hired [[Dana Gioia]] to stop the decline. The marketing team revisited the Jell-O recipes published in past cookbooks and rediscovered Jigglers, although the original recipe did not use that name. Jigglers are Jell-O snacks molded into fun shapes and eaten as finger food. Jell-O launched a massive marketing campaign, notably featuring [[Bill Cosby]] as spokesman. The campaign was a huge success, causing a significant gain.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

Cosby became the company's pudding spokesperson in 1974, and continued as the voice of Jell-O for almost thirty years. Over his tenure as the mouthpiece for the company, he would help introduce new products such as frozen Jell-O Pops (in gelatin and pudding varieties); the new Sugar-Free Jell-O, which replaced D-Zerta in 1984 and was sweetened with [[NutraSweet]]; Jell-O Jigglers concentrated [[gummi]] snacks; and Sparkling Jell-O, a carbonated version of the dessert touted as the "Champagne of Jell-O." In 2010, Cosby returned as Jell-O spokesperson in an on-line web series called "[[OBKB]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100520091034/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html| archivedate= May 20, 2010| deadurl= yes| first= Emily| last= Frederix| work=Huffington Post | title=Bill Cosby &amp; Jell-O: Together Again | date=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, a Jell-O advertising campaign slogan reminded consumers, "Don't forget—you have to remember to make it."

In 1990, General Foods merged into Kraft Foods by parent company [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] (now the Altria Group). New flavors were continually introduced: [[watermelon]], [[blueberry]], [[cranberry]], [[margarita]] and [[piña colada]] among others.  In 2001, the state Senate of [[Utah]] recognized Jell-O as a favorite snack food of Utah&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.le.state.ut.us/~2001/bills/sbillenr/SR0005.htm | title= Resolution Urging Jell-O Recognition | publisher= Utah State Senate| year=2001 | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Governor of Utah|Governor]] [[Michael O. Leavitt]] declared an annual "Jell-O Week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1156021.stm|publisher=BBC News| title=Utah loves Jell-O |date= February 6, 2001|first= Katty |last=Kay |location= Washington|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, the souvenir pins included one depicting green Jell-O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/893691/Theres-green-Jell-O-on-your-lapel---.html| first= Valerie |last= Phillips |title= There's green Jell-O on your lapel...

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jell-O's family-friendly reputation was slightly tarnished by [[Gelatin dessert#Gelatin shots|Jell-O shots]] and Jell-O wrestling.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

{{As of|2011}}, there were over 420 million boxes of Jell-O gelatin and over 1 billion Jell-O cups sold in the United States each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sunday Morning|title=Wiggle Room|publisher=CBS|date=27 November 2011|accessdate=1 August 2016|url=https://archive.org/details/KPIX_20111127_140000_CBS_News_Sunday_Morning?q=420+million+boxes#start/4881/end/4941}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, there were more than 110 products sold under the Jell-O brand name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jello.com/products Jell-O Products]. Kraft. Retrieved 4 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jell-O is used as a substantial ingredient in a well-known dessert, a "Jell-O mold" the preparation of which requires a [[Mold (cooking implement)|mold]] designed to hold gelatin, and the depositing of small quantities of chopped fruit, nuts, and other ingredients before it hardens to its typical form.  Fresh pineapple, papaya, kiwi, and ginger root cannot be used because they contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from "setting". In the case of pineapple juice and the enzyme bromelain that it contains though, the enzyme can be inactivated without denaturing through excessive heating and thus altering the flavor by the addition of a small measured amount of capsaicin sourced from hot chilies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38EVoUsVH1A|title=Pineapple Jelly.MPG|date=23 March 2010|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jell-O shots==
An alternative recipe calls for the addition of an [[alcoholic beverage]] to the mix, contributing approximately one third to one half of the liquid added after the gelatin has dissolved in the boil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A serving of the resulting mixture is called a "Jell-O shot" at parties. The quantity and timing of the addition of the alcohol are vital aspects; it is not possible to make Jell-O shots with alcohol alone, as the colloidal proteins in dry gelatin consist of chains which require a hot liquid to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] them before they can then reform as a semisolid colloidal suspension.&lt;ref name="myscience"/&gt; Pure alcohol cannot be heated sufficiently to break down these proteins, as it evaporates.&lt;ref name="myscience"&gt;[http://www.myscienceproject.org/j-shot.html My Science Project – What is the Ultimate Jell-O Shot?].&lt;/ref&gt;

Vodka or rum is used in Jell-O shots, but the shots can be made with almost any alcohol. It is important to adjust the proportions of alcohol and cold water to ensure that the mixture set when experimenting with different types of alcohol. The Jell-O shots can be served in shot glasses, small paper or plastic cups; the paper or plastic cups are easier to eat from, but shot glasses are more attractive. The alcohol in Jell-O shots is contained within the Jell-O, so the body absorbs it more slowly, causing people to underestimate how much alcohol they have consumed. Drinkers must monitor their intake because of this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drinkstreet.com/searchresults.cgi?drinkid=916 The Art &amp; Science of the Jello Shot] DrinkStreet.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012}}, [[Le Roy (village), New York|LeRoy, New York]], is known as the home of Jell-O and has the only Jell-O Museum in the world, located on the main road through the small town. Jell-O was manufactured here until General Foods closed the plant in 1964 and relocated manufacturing to [[Dover, Delaware]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The Jell-O Gallery museum is operated by the Le Roy Historical Society at the [[Le Roy House and Union Free School]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/|title=National Register Information System|date=2009-03-13|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the museum, visitors can learn about the history of the dessert from its inception. Visitors starting on East Main Street, follow Jell-O Brick Road, whose stones are inscribed with the names of former factory employees. The museum offers looks at starting materials for Jell-O, such as sturgeon bladder and calves' hooves, and various molds.

[[File:Jell-O Thermometer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Jell-O thermometer]]

[[Jack Benny]]'s top-rated radio show did not break for commercials. Instead, announcer Don Wilson incorporated speeches about Jell-O into the program at appropriate places, to Jack's feigned comic annoyance. [[Lucille Ball]]'s ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', the radio predecessor to TV's ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', was another popular program sponsored by Jell-O for much of its 124-episode run.  Ball's character Liz Cooper often opened the program with the lively greeting "jell-o everybody!"

Comedian [[Bill Cosby]] is associated with Jell-O and, more famously, Jell-O pudding, and he appeared in many commercials promoting both. Shows like ''[[Mad TV]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]''  and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' parody Cosby, using Jell-O references like "pudding pop".  In the 1960s, the cast of the sitcom ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' did a commercial with [[Carol Channing]] featuring Colonel Hogan, his men, Kommandant Klink and Sergeant Shultz having Jell-O and Dream Whip for dessert. Also, in the first few seasons of the first of Lucille Ball's two 1960s television series, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', cast members including Vivian Vance often did commercials for Jell-O.

In 1995, Jell-O carried the tagline "It's alive!" and had the phrase "J-E-L-L-OOOOOOO!".

In August 2018, Jell-O released an [[animated series]] on [[YouTube]] and [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]] titled "JELL-O Wobz" in partnership with [[DreamWorksTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketingdive.com/news/jell-o-teams-with-dreamworkstv-on-animated-series-for-youtube-amazon-prime/529246/|title=Jell-O teams with DreamworksTV on animated series for YouTube, Amazon Prime Video|work=Marketing Dive|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 [[LDS Cinema]] [[romantic comedy]] ''[[The Singles Ward]]'', which is filled with inside Mormon jokes and stereotypes, has a scene where someone slips and falls in Jell-O at a church social for young, single Mormons.

The stereotype of Mormons loving Jell-O does not appear to have a long history. Media reports in 1969 and 1988 on foods popular among Mormons or in Utah make no mention of Jell-O, and a 1988 article mentions Jell-O as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] tradition. In 1997, [[Kraft foods]] released sales figures revealing [[Salt Lake City]] to have the highest per-capita Jell-O consumption.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

[[File:Blea Tarn Lingmoor Fell.jpg|thumb|Blea Tarn from [[Lingmoor Fell]]]]
The following is a '''list of [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Cumbria]]''', [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=Natural England |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2012 there were 278 SSSIs within Cumbria. Of these, 70 are listed purely for their geological interest and 170 for their biological interest. A further 38 have both geological and biological interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/report.cfm?category=C,CF Natural England SSSI County Level Reports and Statistics] Accessed 27 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The county includes the whole of the [[Lake District National Park]], as well as three [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]: the [[Solway Coast]], part of [[Arnside and Silverdale]], and part of the [[North Pennines]].

For SSSIs in other counties, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="113325">Four federal agencies of the '''[[Federal Government of the United States]]''' administer the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]], which includes 765 '''[[Wilderness]]es''' and {{convert|109129657|acre|km2}} as of 2016 . These agencies are:

*[[United States Forest Service]]
*[[United States National Park Service]]
*[[United States Bureau of Land Management]]
*[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]

This is an area larger than [[Iraq]] or the state of [[California]]. In [[Alaska]], there are {{convert|57425569|acre|km2}} of wilderness. This represents about 52% of the wilderness area in the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) has oversight of {{convert|43890500|acre|km2}} of wilderness at 60 locations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has responsibility for {{convert|20702350|acre|km2}} in 71 areas. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees {{convert|8726011|acre|km2}} at 222 unique sites. The Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service oversees {{convert|36160078|acre|km2}} of wilderness areas in 442 areas. Some wilderness areas are managed by multiple agencies, so the above totals exceed the actual number of units (759) in the system. In addition, some of the 60 NPS areas with wilderness have multiple units designated as such (for example, [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area]]).

Some areas are designated [[List of U.S. state and tribal wilderness areas|wilderness by state or tribal governments]]. These are not governed by the Federal [[National Wilderness Preservation System]].

The following sortable table lists all U.S. areas that have been designated by the [[United States Congress]] under the [[Wilderness Act]]. The listed designation date is the date that the wilderness was signed into law. Some areas have been expanded or otherwise changed since the original designation date. For more information about a specific area, see the wilderness name link.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">[[File:Moon nearside LRO.jpg|thumb|The near side of the moon, from where energy would be beamed to Earth, according to the Luna Ring project.]]

'''Luna Ring''' is a speculative engineering project which consists in a series of solar generators, disposed around the equator of the Moon, that could send the generated electric energy back to the Earth via microwaves from the near side of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/the-luna-ring-concept/ |title=The Luna Ring concept |author= |date= |website=SSERVI |publisher=NASA |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was proposed by Japanese construction firm [[Shimizu Corporation]], after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, creating public opposition against nuclear electric energy. Until then, Japan had relied heavily on nuclear power.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/10480950/Japanese-firm-plans-250-mile-wide-solar-panel-belt-around-Moon.html |title=Japanese firm plans 250 mile-wide solar panel belt around Moon |author= |date= |website=The Telegraph |publisher= |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction == 

The construction of a concrete ring on the Moon's equator to support the solar panels would be performed by robots, that would be teleguided back from Earth. Then, the solar panels would be placed on the concrete layer, and connected to microwave and laser transmitting stations.&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2013-11-japanese-firm-luna-solar-energy.html |title=Japanese firm proposes LUNA RING to send solar energy from moon to Earth |author=Bob Yirka |date=November 29, 2013 |website=Phys.org |publisher= |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy sent to Earth that way could be captured by receiving stations all through the day. The fact that the ring would surround the entire moon would mean that at least half of it would always be lit by the sun, resulting in constant electric production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/moon-solar-energy-power |title=Beaming solar energy from the Moon could solve Earth's energy crisis |author=David Warmflash |date=29 March 2017 |website=Wired.co.uk |publisher=Condé Nast |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Shimizu Corporation stated that the construction of the Luna Ring could start as early as 2035.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; However, the practical drawbacks of putting such a technically vaste and complex project into place could hamp its construction, even if it could pave the way for simpler projects in clean energy production.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt;

[[File:Molten Salt Battery (Zebra).JPG|thumb|FIAMM Sonick 48TL200: Sodium–nickel battery with welding-sealed cells and heat insulation]]
'''Molten-salt batteries''' (including '''liquid-metal batteries''') are a class of [[electric battery|battery]] that uses [[molten salt]]s as an [[electrolyte]] and offers both a high [[energy density]] and a high [[power density]]. Traditional "use once" thermal batteries can be stored in their solid state at room temperature for long periods of time before being activated by heating. Rechargeable liquid-metal batteries are used for [[electric vehicle]]s and potentially also for [[grid energy storage]], to balance out intermittent [[Renewable energy|renewable power]] sources such as [[solar power|solar panels]] and [[wind power|wind turbines]].

== History ==
Thermal batteries originated during [[World War II]] when German scientist Georg Otto Erb developed the first practical cells using a salt mixture as an electrolyte. Erb developed batteries for military applications, including the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2]] rocket, and artillery fuzing systems. None of these batteries entered field use during the war. Afterwards, Erb was interrogated by British intelligence. His work was reported in "The Theory and Practice of Thermal Cells". This information was subsequently passed on to the United States Ordnance Development Division of the [[National Bureau of Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = 9th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference Proceedings | page = 665 | publisher = American Society of Mechanical Engineers | date = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the technology reached the [[United States]] in 1946, it was immediately applied to replacing the troublesome liquid-based systems that had previously been used to power artillery [[proximity fuzes]]. They were used for [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] applications (e.g., proximity fuzes) since WWII and later in [[nuclear weapons]]. The same technology was studied by [[Argonne National Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Martin, in "High Performance Batteries for Electric Vehicles Propulsion and Stationary Energy Storage", [[Argonne National Laboratories]] Report ANL-78-94 (1980); and Report ANL-79-39 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and other researchers in the 1980s for use in [[electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt; T.M. O'Sullivan,  C.M. Bingham, and  R.E. Clark, "[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1649778/ Zebra battery technologies for all electric smart car]", International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion, SPEEDAM 2006, IEEE, 23-26 May 2006. Retrieved 12 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermal (non-rechargeable) batteries ==
{{Distinguish | Molten salt thermal storage}}

===Technologies===
Thermal batteries use an electrolyte that is solid and inactive at ambient temperatures. They can be stored indefinitely (over 50 years) yet provide full power in an instant when required. Once activated, they provide a burst of high power for a short period (a few tens of seconds to 60 minutes or more), with output ranging from [[watt]]s to [[kilowatt]]s. The high power is due to the high [[ionic conductivity]] of the molten salt, which is three orders of magnitude (or more) greater than that of the [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid car battery]].

One design uses a fuze strip (containing [[barium chromate]] and powdered [[zirconium]] metal in a ceramic paper) along the edge of the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an [[electric match|electrical igniter]] or [[squib (explosive)|squib]] by application of electric current.

Another design uses a central hole in the middle of the battery stack, into which the high-energy electrical igniter fires a mixture of hot gases and [[incandescent]] particles. This allows much faster activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can be accomplished by a [[percussion primer]], similar to a [[shotgun shell]]. The heat source should be gasless. The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of [[iron]] powder and [[potassium perchlorate]] in weight ratios of 88/12, 86/14, or 84/16.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The higher the potassium perchlorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297&amp;nbsp;[[calories|cal]]/[[gram|g]] respectively). This property of unactivated storage has the double benefit of avoiding deterioration of the active materials during storage and eliminating capacity loss due to [[self-discharge]] until the battery is activated.

In the 1980s [[lithium]]-alloy anodes replaced [[calcium]] or [[magnesium]] anodes, with cathodes of [[calcium chromate]], [[vanadium pentoxide|vanadium]] or [[tungsten trioxide|tungsten oxides]]. Lithium–[[silicon]] alloys are favored over the earlier lithium–aluminium alloys. The corresponding cathode for use with the lithium-alloy anodes is mainly [[iron disulfide]] (pyrite) replaced by cobalt disulfide for high-power applications. The electrolyte is normally a [[eutectic mixture]] of [[lithium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]].

More recently, other lower-melting, eutectic electrolytes based on [[lithium bromide]], [[potassium bromide]], and lithium chloride or [[lithium fluoride]] have also been used to provide longer operational lifetimes; they are also better conductors. The so-called "all-lithium" electrolyte based on [[lithium chloride]], [[lithium bromide]], and [[lithium fluoride]] (no potassium salts) is also used for high-power applications, because of its high ionic conductivity. A [[radioisotope thermal generator]], such as in the form of pellets of &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, can be used for long-term delivery of heat for the battery after activation, keeping it in a molten state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4054724.html |title=Isotope heated deferred action thermal batteries – Catalyst Research Corporation |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===
Thermal batteries are used almost exclusively for military applications, notably for [[guided missiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/electrical/asb-group |title=ASB Group – Military Thermal Batteries |publisher=Army Technology |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}{{unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/contractors/electrical/eaglepicher-batteries |title=EaglePicher – Batteries and Energetic Devices |publisher=Naval Technology |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}{{unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the primary power source for many missiles such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], [[MIM-104 Patriot]], [[BGM-71 TOW]], [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] and others. In these batteries the electrolyte is immobilized when molten by a special grade of [[magnesium oxide]] that holds it in place by [[capillary action]]. This powdered mixture is pressed into [[wikt:pellet|pellet]]s to form a separator between the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] of each cell in the battery stack. As long as the electrolyte (salt) is solid, the battery is inert and remains inactive. Each cell also contains a [[pyrotechnic heat source]], which is used to heat the cell to the typical operating temperature of 400–550&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Rechargeable configurations ==
Since the mid-1960s much development work has been undertaken on [[rechargeable batteries]] using [[sodium]] (Na) for the negative electrodes. Sodium is attractive because of its high [[reduction potential]] of −2.71&amp;nbsp;volts, low weight, non-toxic nature, relative abundance, availability and low cost. In order to construct practical batteries, the sodium must be in liquid form. The [[melting point]] of sodium is {{convert|98|C|F}}. This means that sodium-based batteries operate at high temperatures between {{convert|400|and|700|C|F|sigfig=2}}, with newer designs running at temperatures between {{convert|245|and|350|C|F|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchmann|first1=Isidor|title=Weird and Wonderful Batteries:  But Will the Inventions Survive Outside the Laboratory?|url=http://www.buchmann.ca/article41-page1.asp|website=Batteries in a Portable World|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sodium–sulfur===
{{main|Sodium–sulfur battery}}
The [[sodium–sulfur battery]] (NaS battery), along with the related [[lithium–sulfur battery]] employs cheap and abundant electrode materials. It was the first [[alkali metal|alkali-metal]] commercial battery. It used liquid [[sulfur]] for the positive electrode and a [[ceramic]] tube of [[beta-alumina solid electrolyte]] (BASE). Insulator corrosion was a problem because they gradually became conductive, and the self-discharge rate increased. 

Because of their high specific power, NaS batteries have been proposed for space applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1109/IPSS.1990.145783 |chapter=Development of a high specific power sodium sulfur cell |title=Proceedings of the 34th International Power Sources Symposium |pages=30–33 |year=1990 |last1=Koenig |first1=A.A |last2=Rasmussen |first2=J.R |isbn=978-0-87942-604-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Auxer,  "The PB Sodium Sulfur Cell for Satellite Battery Applications", 32nd International Power Sources Symposium, Cherry Hill, NJ, June 9–12, 1986, ''Proceedings Volume A88-16601'', 04-44, Electrochemical Society, Inc.,  Pennington, NJ, pp. 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  A NaS battery for space use was successfully tested on the [[space shuttle]] mission [[STS-87]] in 1997,&lt;ref name="venus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2514/1.41886 |title=Batteries for Venus Surface Operation |journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=649–654 |year=2010 |last1=Landis |first1=Geoffrey A |last2=Harrison |first2=Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the batteries have not been used operationally in space.  NaS batteries have been proposed for use in the high-temperature environment of [[Venus]].&lt;ref name="venus" /&gt;

===Sodium–nickel chloride (Zebra) battery===

A lower-temperature&lt;ref&gt;Guosheng Li, Xiaochuan Lu, Jin Y. Kim, Kerry D. Meinhardt, Hee Jung Chang, Nathan L. Canfield, and Vincent L. Sprenkleb, ["Advanced intermediate temperature sodium–nickel chloride batteries with ultra-high energy density" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753253/], ''Nat Commun. 7'': 10683., Feb 11 2016 . doi:  10.1038/ncomms10683
&lt;/ref&gt; variant of NaS batteries was the development of the ZEBRA (originally, "Zeolite Battery Research Africa"; later, the "Zero Emissions Batteries Research Activity") battery in 1985, originally developed for electric vehicle applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Projects/Zebra_Pages.pdf 7.6 The Sodium Nickel Chloride "Zebra" Battery], Meridian International Research, 2006, p. 104-112. Accessed 2 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sudworth, J. L., "Zebra batteries," ''Journal of Power Sources, Vol. 51,'' No. 1, pp. 105-114, 1994. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994JPS....51..105S Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;  The battery uses NaAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-beta-alumina ceramic electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.K|first1=Shukla|last2=S. K.|first2=Martha|title=Electrochemical Power Sources|journal=[[Resonance (journal)|Resonance]] |date=July 2001|volume=6|issue=7|pages=52–63|url=http://educypedia.karadimov.info/library/July2001p52-63.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{chem|Na-NiCl|2}} battery operates at {{convert|245|C|F}} and uses molten [[sodium tetrachloroaluminate]] ({{chem|NaAlCl|4}}), which has a melting point of {{convert|157|C|F}}, as the electrolyte. The negative electrode is molten sodium. The positive electrode is [[nickel]] in the discharged state and [[nickel chloride]] in the charged state. Because nickel and nickel chloride are nearly insoluble in neutral and [[Alkaline|basic]] melts, contact is allowed, providing little resistance to charge transfer. Since both {{chem|NaAlCl|4}} and Na are liquid at the operating temperature, a sodium-conducting [[Beta-alumina solid electrolyte|β-alumina ceramic]] is used to separate the liquid sodium from the molten {{chem|NaAlCl|4}}. The primary elements used in the manufacture of these batteries have much higher worldwide reserves and annual production than lithium.&lt;ref name="Trouble with Lithium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evworld.com/library/lithium_shortage.pdf|title=The Trouble with Lithium, Implications of Future PHEV Production for Lithium Demand|author=William Tahil, Research Director|date=December 2006|publisher=Meridian International Research|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was invented in 1985 by the Zeolite Battery Research Africa Project (ZEBRA) group at the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)]] in [[Pretoria, South Africa]]. It can be assembled in the discharged state, using NaCl, Al, nickel and iron powder. The positive electrode is composed mostly of materials in the solid state, which reduces the likelihood of corrosion, improving safety.&lt;ref name="science.uwaterloo.ca"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Brian L.|last2=Nazar|first2=Linda F.|title=Sodium and sodium-ion energy storage batteries|journal=Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science|date=2012|volume=16|issue=4|pages=168–177|url=http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~lfnazar/publications/Current_Opinion_in_Solid_State_and_Materials_Science_16_2012_168-177.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cossms.2012.04.002|bibcode=2012COSSM..16..168E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its specific energy is 90 Wh/kg; specific power is 150 W/kg. The β-alumina solid ceramic is unreactive to sodium metal and sodium aluminum chloride. Lifetimes of over 1,500 cycles and five years have been demonstrated with full-sized batteries, and over 3,000 cycles and eight years with 10- and 20-cell modules.

In 2010 [[General Electric]] announced a {{chem|Na-NiCl|2}} battery that it called a sodium–metal halide battery, with a 20-year lifetime.

[[Sumitomo]] developed a battery using a salt that is molten at {{convert|61|C}}, far lower than sodium based batteries, and operational at {{convert|90|C}}.  It offers energy densities as high as 290 Wh/L and 224 Wh/kg and charge/discharge rates of 1C with a lifetime of 100 - 1000 charge cycles. The battery employs only nonflammable materials and neither ignites on contact with air nor risks thermal runaway. This eliminates waste-heat storage or fire- and explosion-proof equipment, and allows closer cell packing. The company claimed that the battery required half the volume of lithium-ion batteries and one quarter that of sodium–sulfur batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/11/sumitomo-2011111.html |title=Sumitomo considering marketing new lower-temperature molten-salt electrolyte battery to automakers for EVs and hybrids |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell used a nickel cathode and a glassy carbon anode.&lt;ref name="Nitta 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://global-sei.com/technology/tr/bn76/pdf/76-06.pdf |title=Development of Molten Salt Electrolyte Battery |publisher=SEI TECHNICAL REVIEW| author=Koji NITTA| author2=Shinji INAZAWA| author3=Shoichiro SAKAI| author4=Atsushi FUKUNAGA| author5=Eiko ITANI| author6=Kouma NUMATA| author7=Rika HAGIWARA| author8=Toshiyuki NOHIRA |last-author-amp=yes| date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 researchers identified a liquid sodium–cesium alloy that operates at {{Convert|50|C|F}} and produced 420 milliampere-hours per gram. The new material was able to fully coat, or "wet," the electrolyte. After 100 charge/discharge cycles, a test battery maintained about 97% of its initial storage capacity. The lower operating temperature allowed the use of a less-expensive polymer external casing instead of steel, offsetting some of the increased cost of cesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms5578 |title=Liquid-metal electrode to enable ultra-low temperature sodium–beta alumina batteries for renewable energy storage |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |last1=Lu |first1=Xiaochuan |last2=Li |first2=Guosheng |last3=Kim |first3=Jin Y |last4=Mei |first4=Donghai |last5=Lemmon |first5=John P |last6=Sprenkle |first6=Vincent L |last7=Liu |first7=Jun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not in use, {{chem|Na-NiCl|2}} batteries are typically kept molten and ready for use because if allowed to solidify they typically take 12 hours to reheat and charge.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This reheating time varies depending on the battery-pack temperature, and power available for reheating. After shutdown a fully charged battery pack loses enough energy to cool and solidify in 3–4 days.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Liquid-metal batteries===
Professor Donald Sadoway at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has pioneered the research of liquid-metal rechargeable batteries. Both Magnesium–antimony and more recently lead–antimony were used in experiments at MIT. The electrode and electrolyte layers are heated until they are liquid and self-segregate due to density and [[immiscibility]]. They may have longer lifetimes than conventional batteries, as the electrodes go through a cycle of creation and destruction during the charge–discharge cycle, which makes them immune to degradation affecting conventional battery electrodes.&lt;ref name="sadoway.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr300205k |title=Liquid Metal Batteries: Past, Present, and Future |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=2075–2099 |year=2012 |last1=Kim |first1=Hojong |last2=Boysen |first2=Dane A |last3=Newhouse |first3=Jocelyn M |last4=Spatocco |first4=Brian L |last5=Chung |first5=Brice |last6=Burke |first6=Paul J |last7=Bradwell |first7=David J |last8=Jiang |first8=Kai |last9=Tomaszowska |first9=Alina A |last10=Wang |first10=Kangli |last11=Wei |first11=Weifeng |last12=Ortiz |first12=Luis A |last13=Barriga |first13=Salvador A |last14=Poizeau |first14=Sophie M |last15=Sadoway |first15=Donald R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://sadoway.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sadoway_Resume/145.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was proposed in 2009 based on [[magnesium]] and [[antimony]] separated by a molten salt.&lt;ref name = Ambri&gt;Staff (2012) [http://www.ambri.com/technology/ Ambri Technology] Ambri company web page, Retrieved 6 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/liquid-battery.html|title=Liquid battery big enough for the electric grid?|author=David L. Chandler, MIT News Office|date=19 November 2009|work=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US20110014503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnesium was chosen as the negative electrode for its low cost and low solubility in the molten-salt electrolyte. Antimony was selected as the positive electrode due to its low cost and higher anticipated discharge voltage.

In 2011 the researchers demonstrated a cell with a lithium anode and a lead–antimony cathode, which had higher ionic conductivity and lower melting points (350–430&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="sadoway.mit.edu"/&gt; The drawback of the Li chemistry is higher cost. A Li/LiF + LiCl + LiI/Pb-Sb cell with about 0.9&amp;nbsp;V open-circuit potential operating at 450&amp;nbsp;°C had electroactive material costs of 100&amp;nbsp;[[USD]]/kWh and 100&amp;nbsp;USD/kW and a projected 25-year lifetime. Its discharge power at 1.1&amp;nbsp;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is only 44% (and 88% at 0.14&amp;nbsp;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Experimental data shows 69% storage efficiency, with good storage capacity (over 1000&amp;nbsp;mAh/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), low leakage (&lt; 1&amp;nbsp;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and high maximal discharge capacity (over 200&amp;nbsp;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja209759s |title=Magnesium–Antimony Liquid Metal Battery for Stationary Energy Storage |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=1895–1897 |year=2012 |last1=Bradwell |first1=David J |last2=Kim |first2=Hojong |last3=Sirk |first3=Aislinn H.

[[File:Kluay Tani26.JPG|thumb|The wild type of banana known in Thai language as ''Kluai Tani'' (กล้วยตานี)]]

'''Nang Tani''' ({{lang-th|นางตานี}}; "Lady of Tani")&lt;!-- , also known as '''Nang Phrai Tani''' (นางพรายตานี), '''Nang Fa Tani''' (นางฟ้าตานี), '''Phi Tani''' (ผีตานี), '''Mae Phrai Tani''' (แม่พรายตานี) or simply as '''Tani''' (ตานี), --&gt; is a female [[spirit]] of the [[Thai folklore]].

According to folk tradition this [[ghost]] appears as a young woman that haunts wild [[banana]] trees (''[[Musa balbisiana]]''), known as in [[Thai language]] as ''Kluai Tani'' (กล้วยตานี).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thailand-amulets.net/?p=3485 |title=Banana Tree Prai Lady Ghost |publisher=Thailand-amulets.net |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nang Tani'' belongs to a type of female [[ghost]]s or [[fairy|fairies]] related to trees known generically as ''[[Nang Mai]]'' (นางไม้; "Lady of the Wood") in the Thai lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm|title=Spirits|first=Regis|last=MADEC|website=www.thaiworldview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a similar spirit in the [[Cambodia]]n folklore, as well as in the [[Laos|Lao]] popular tradition.

''Nang Tani'' may also be called ''Phi Tani'' (ผีตานี; "Ghost of Tani") or ''Phrai Tani'' (พรายตานี; "Nymph of Tani").

== Legends ==
This ghost inhabits the clumps of wild banana trees and is popularly represented as a beautiful young woman wearing a green traditional Thai costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swu141km.swu.ac.th/images/0/04/%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B5.jpg|title=Nang Tani image|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time ''Phi Tani'' remains hidden, but she comes out of the tree and becomes visible especially on [[full moon]] nights. She has a greenish complexion, blending with the tree, but her lips have the red color of the ripe [[ivy gourd]]. Her hair is black, abundant and untied. She generally appears in a standing position and her feet don't touch the ground, but hover slightly above it. In some modern representations the lower part of her body is represented with an immaterial quality, her waist cloth ending in a kind of wisp emanating from the tree trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostsofthailand.com/Thai_Ghost_Types.html|title=Thailand, Types of Thai Ghosts and Spirits|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915012401/http://ghostsofthailand.com/Thai_Ghost_Types.html|archivedate=2012-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered a bad omen to cut trees from the clump ''Tani'' inhabits. Offerings are made to her in the form of sweets, [[incense stick]]s and flowers. People also often tie a length of colored satin cloth around the trunk of the banana tree believed to be haunted by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm |title=Spirits |publisher=Thaiworldview.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kluai Tani'' type of banana tree does not belong to the cultivated varieties. Owing to their connection with ghosts, people prefer not to have them growing near their homes and they are not found within village compounds. However, clumps of this tree are found not far from inhabited areas, often at the outskirts of villages or at the edge of cultivated fields by the roadside. They look very much like average banana trees, but their fruits are not edible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biogang.net/biodiversity_view.php?menu=biodiversity&amp;uid=1001&amp;id=112142|title=Kluai Tani trees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leaves are commonly used in Thailand to wrap locally produced sweets and the [[inflorescence]] for the treatment of [[ulcer]]s in [[traditional medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lib.cmu.ac.th/full/T/2005/biol0805uu_ch4.pdf Plant use in Southern Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413143722/http://archive.lib.cmu.ac.th/full/T/2005/biol0805uu_ch4.pdf |date=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends of the Thai [[oral tradition]] say that this spirit may harm men, especially those who have wronged women, but she is mostly considered benevolent. ''Nang Tani'' generally has a gentle disposition and may give food to passing [[Buddhist monk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghost555.com/%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87/ Phi Krahang]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amulets]] featuring Nang Tani are popular and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talad-pra.com/_files/prakard/2012_03_28_121327_0_jggddICG.jpg|title=Nang Tani Amulet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people tie lengths of colored silk around the trunks of the banana trees reputed to be haunted by ''Nang Tani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaosod.co.th/online/2012/05/13362964101336296872l.jpg|title=Silk cloth offering around the trunk of the Kluai Tani tree|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North American Carbon Program''' (NACP) is one of the major elements of the Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.
The central objective of NACP is to measure and understand carbon stocks and sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and carbon monoxide (CO) in North America and adjacent ocean regions.

This program consists of multiple agencies that focus on changes to the carbon cycle . Not only does this program rely on research conducted by multiple agencies, but it is also supported by federal agencies that assist in the funding of this program. To ensure the plan is effective, the ''Science Leadership Group (SLG)'' works to communicate among government program managers, independent research groups, and multiple institutions not affiliated to the government as well.

Alongside the SLG, there is the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group (CCIWG), which interacts across agencies and ensures the efficiency of research about the carbon cycle in the United States. It works with 11 federal agencies like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nacarbon.org/nacp/about.html?#group|title=About NACP|website=www.nacarbon.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCIWG specializes in communicating among agencies for the proposal of new projects, secures resources for the various research programs available, and reports results to the public.

== Program Goals ==
The specific program goals are as followed:

Develop quantitative scientific knowledge, robust observations, and models to determine the emissions and uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO, changes in carbon stocks, and the factors regulating these processes for North America and adjacent ocean basins.

Develop the scientific basis to implement full carbon accounting on regional and continental scales. This is the knowledge base needed to design monitoring programs for natural and managed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sinks and emissions of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Support long-term quantitative measurements of fluxes, sources, and sinks of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and develop forecasts for future trends.

The North American Carbon Program was designed to help with the process of providing data needed to model the synthesis activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nacp.ornl.gov/mast-dc/|title=MsTMIP|website=nacp.ornl.gov|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Carbon Cycle ==
[[File:Carbon_cycle.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carbon_cycle.jpg|thumb|This diagram simplifies the carbon cycle, a complex cycle that the North American Carbon Program focuses on.]]
The carbon cycle is subdivided into two sections, the rapid carbon exchange, and long-term cycling of carbon through the various geological processes.

=== Rapid exchange ===

This carbon cycle occurs in our biological processes, including respiration, photosynthesis, and is generated by autotrophs.

'''''Autotrophs''''' (usually photosynthetic) are plants or algae, which capture the carbon dioxide from the air. In water, the compounds removed are bicarbonate ions. They are converted into organic compounds like glucose. '''''Heterotrophs''''' consume the glucose, which further breaks down the compounds and passes them through webs (this process is called cellular respiration). Living systems and decomposers release the carbons as carbon dioxide.This carbon is cycled quickly, with estimates of 1,000 to 1000,000 million metric tons of carbon cycling through these pathways in a single year.

=== Long-term exchange ===

Like its name implies, this pathway takes longer than the pathway above, sometimes lasting millions of years. This form of carbon is found in rocks, in the ocean and other bodies of water, inside the core, and in fossil fuels. It is also found in the atmosphere, where it reacts with water and forms calcium carbonate- found in the shells of marine organisms which later become part of the sediment on the ocean floor.

Over time, the remains of shells, plants, and animals form fossils that are later decomposed and released once again as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/biogeochemical-cycles/a/the-carbon-cycle|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through volcanoes and eruptions, as well as hydrothermal vents, carbon dioxide is released.

[[File:Offshore platforms.jpg|thumb|Platforms offshore Mexico.]]

'''Offshore geotechnical engineering''' is a sub-field of [[geotechnical engineering]]. It is concerned with foundation design, construction, maintenance and decommissioning for human-made structures in the [[sea]].&lt;ref name="DeanP.1"&gt;Dean, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Oil platform]]s, [[artificial island]]s and [[submarine pipeline]]s are examples of such structures. The seabed has to be able to withstand the weight of these structures and the applied loads. [[Geohazard]]s must also be taken into account. The need for offshore developments stems from a gradual depletion of hydrocarbon reserves onshore or near the coastlines, as new fields are being developed at greater distances offshore and in deeper water,&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP.1"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; with a corresponding adaptation of the offshore site investigations.&lt;ref name="Kolk&amp;Wegerif"&gt;Kolk &amp; Wegerif, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are more than 7,000 offshore platforms operating at a water depth up to and exceeding 2000&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=" Randolph&amp;GourvenecP.1"/&gt; A typical field development extends over tens of square kilometers, and may comprise several fixed structures, infield flowlines with an export pipeline either to the shoreline or connected to a regional trunkline.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP.3"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between onshore and offshore geotechnical engineering==
An ''offshore'' environment has several implications for geotechnical engineering. These include the following:&lt;ref name="DeanP.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Randolph&amp;GourvenecP.3"/&gt;
*Ground improvement (on the seabed) and site investigation are expensive.
*Soil conditions are unusual (''e.g.'' presence of carbonates, shallow gas).
*Offshore structures are tall, often extending over {{convert|100|m|ft}} above their foundation.
*Offshore structures typically have to contend with significant lateral loads (''i.e.'' large moment loading relative to the weight of the structure).
*Cyclic loading can be a major design issue.
*Offshore structures are exposed to a wider range of [[geohazard]]s.
*The codes and technical standards are different from those used for onshore developments.
*Design focuses on ultimate limit state as opposed to deformation.
*Design modifications during construction are either unfeasible or very expensive.
*The design life of these structures often ranges between 25–50 years.
*The environmental and financial costs in case of failure can be higher.

==The offshore environment==
Offshore structures are exposed to various environmental loads: [[wind]], [[wind wave|wave]]s, [[Ocean current|currents]] and, in cold oceans, [[sea ice]] and [[iceberg]]s.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;Gourvenec2.4"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, Section 2.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerwick"&gt;Gerwick, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental loads act primarily in the horizontal direction, but also have a vertical component. Some of these loads get transmitted to the foundation (the seabed). Wind, wave and current regimes can be estimated from meteorological and oceanographic data, which are collectively referred to as [[metocean data]]. [[Earthquake]]-induced loading can also occur – they proceed in the opposite direction: from the foundation to the structure. Depending on location, other [[geohazard]]s may also be an issue. All of these phenomena may affect the integrity or the serviceability of the structure and its foundation during its operational lifespan – they need to be taken into account in offshore design.

===The nature of the soil===
Following are some to the features characterizing the soil in an offshore environment:&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;Gourvenec2.3"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, Section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;
*The soil is made up of [[sediment]]s, which are generally assumed to be in a [[water content|saturated]] state – saline water fills in the pore space.
*Marine sediments are composed of detrital material as well as remains of marine organisms, the latter making up calcareous soils.
*Total sediment thickness varies on a regional scale – it is normally higher near the coastline than it is away from it, where it is also finer grained.
*In places, the seabed can be devoid of sediment, due to strong bottom currents.
*The [[Soil Mechanics#Consolidation: transient flow of water|consolidation state]] of the soil is either normally consolidated (due to slow sediment deposition), overconsolidated (in places, a relic of glaciation) or underconsolidated (due to high sediment input).

===Metocean aspects===
[[File:Jacket Wave.ogv|thumb|Wave action against an offshore structure.]]
[[Wave]] forces induce motion of floating structures in all six degrees of freedom – they are a major design criterion for offshore structures.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP.24"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, a given structure may undergo 2x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; wave cycles during its design service life.&lt;/ref&gt; When a wave’s orbital motion reaches the seabed, it induces sediment transport. This only occurs to a water depth of about {{convert|200|m|ft}}, which is the commonly adopted boundary between ''shallow water'' and ''deep water''.The reason is that the orbital motion only extends to a water depth that is half the wavelength, and the maximum possible wavelength is generally considered to be {{convert|400|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Gerwick"/&gt; In shallow water, waves may generate pore pressure build-up in the soil, which may lead to flow slide, and repeated impact on a platform may cause [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]], and loss of support.&lt;ref name="Gerwick"/&gt;

[[Ocean current|Currents]] are a source of horizontal loading for offshore structures. Because of the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli effect]], they may also exert upward or downward forces on structural surfaces and can induce the vibration of wire lines and pipelines.&lt;ref name="Gerwick"/&gt; Currents are responsible for eddies around a structure, which cause [[Bridge scour|scouring]] and erosion of the soil.&lt;ref name=" Gerwick"/&gt; There are various types of currents: [[Ocean current|oceanic circulation]], [[Geostrophic current|geostrophic]], [[Tide#Observation and prediction|tidal]], wind-driven, and [[Gravity current|density currents]].&lt;ref name="Gerwick"/&gt;

=== Geohazards ===

[[Geohazard]]s are associated with geological activity, geotechnical features and environmental conditions. Shallow geohazards are those occurring at less than {{convert|400|m|ft}} below the seafloor.&lt;ref name="Peuchen&amp;Raap"&gt;Peuchen and Raap, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Information on the potential risks associated with these phenomena is acquired through studies of the geomorphology, geological setting and tectonic framework in the area of interest, as well as with geophysical and geotechnical surveys of the seafloor. Examples of potential threats include [[tsunami]]s, [[Submarine landslide|landslides]], active [[Fault (geology)|faults]], mud diapirs and the nature of the soil layering (presence of [[karst]], [[Clathrate hydrate|gas hydrates]], carbonates).&lt;ref name="Peuchen&amp;Raap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecFig3.14"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, Fig. 3.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolk&amp;WegerifP151"&gt;Kolk &amp; Wegerif, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In cold regions, [[Seabed gouging by ice|gouging ice features]] are a threat to subsea installations, such as pipelines.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;Been"&gt;Palmer and Been, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrette"&gt;Barrette 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The risks associated with a particular type of geohazard is a function of how exposed the structure is to the event, how severe this event is and how often it occurs (for episodic events). Any threat has to be monitored, and mitigated for or removed.&lt;ref name="Hogan&amp;al"&gt;Hogan et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Younes&amp;al"&gt;Younes et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site investigation==
Offshore site investigations are not unlike those conducted onshore (see [[Geotechnical investigation]]). They may be divided into three phases:&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecChap3"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, Chap. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
*A ''desk study'', which includes data compilation.
*''[[Geophysical survey]]s'', either shallow and deep seabed penetration.
*''Geotechnical surveys'', which includes sampling/drilling and in situ testing.

===Desk study===
In this phase, which may take place over a period of several months (depending on project size), information is gathered from various sources, including reports, scientific literature (journal articles, conference proceedings) and databases, with the purpose of evaluating risks, assessing design options and planning the subsequent phases. [[Bathymetry]], regional geology, potential geohazards, seabed obstacles and [[metocean]] data&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecChap3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanSect1.4"&gt;Dean, section 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the information that are sought after during that phase.

===Geophysical surveys===
[[Geophysical survey]]s can be used for various purposes. One is to study the bathymetry in the location of interest and to produce an image of the seafloor (irregularities, objects on the seabed, lateral variability, [[Seabed gouging by ice|ice gouges]], …). [[Seismic refraction]] surveys can be done to obtain information on shallow seabed [[stratigraphy]] – it can also be used to locate material such as sand and gravel for use in the construction of [[artificial island]]s.&lt;ref name="DeanP33"&gt;Dean, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geophysical survey]]s are conducted from a [[research vessel]] equipped with [[Scientific echosounder|sonar]] devices and related equipment, such as single-beam and [[multibeam echosounder]]s, [[side-scan sonar]]s,  ‘towfish’ and [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)]].&lt;ref name="DeanSect2.2"&gt;Dean, section 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP34"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; For the sub-bottom stratigraphy, the tools used include boomers, sparkers, pingers and chirp.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP32"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysical surveys are normally required before conducting the geotechnical surveys; in larger projects, these phases may be interwoven.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP32"/&gt;

===Geotechnical surveys===
Geotechnical surveys involve a combination of sampling, drilling, in situ testing as well as laboratory soil testing that is conducted offshore and, with samples, onshore. They serve to ground truth the results of the geophysical investigations; they also provide a detailed account of the seabed stratigraphy and soil engineering properties.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP31"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on water depth and metocean conditions, geotechnical surveys may be conducted from a dedicated [[Drillship|geotechnical drillship]], a [[semi-submersible]], a [[jackup rig]], a large [[hovercraft]] or other means.&lt;ref name="DeanP47"&gt;Dean, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; They are done at a series of specific locations, while the vessel maintains a constant position. [[Dynamic positioning]] and [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] with four-point anchoring systems are used for that purpose.

Shallow penetration geotechnical surveys may include soil sampling of the seabed surface or in situ mechanical testing. They are used to generate information on the physical and mechanical properties of the seabed.&lt;ref name="DeanSect2.3"&gt;Dean, section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; They extend to the first few meters below the mudline. Surveys done to these depths, which may be conducted at the same time as the shallow geophysical survey, may suffice if the structure to be deployed at that location is relatively light. These surveys are also useful for planning subsea pipeline routes.

The purpose of deep penetration geotechnical surveys is to collect information on the seabed [[stratigraphy]] to depths extending up to a few 100 meters below the mudline.&lt;ref name="Peuchen&amp;Raap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanSect2.4"&gt;Dean, section 2.4&lt;/ref&gt; These surveys are done when larger structures are planned at these locations. Deep drill holes require a few days during which the drilling unit has to remain exactly in the same position (see [[dynamic positioning]]).

Seabed surface sampling can be done with a grab sampler and with a [[box corer]].&lt;ref name="DeanFig.2.5"&gt;Dean, Fig. 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provides undisturbed specimens, on which testing can be conducted, for instance, to determine the soil’s [[relative density]], [[water content]] and [[soil mechanics|mechanical properties]]. Sampling can also be achieved with a tube corer, either gravity-driven, or that can be pushed into the seabed by a piston or by means of a vibration system (a device called a vibrocorer).&lt;ref name="DeanP43"&gt;Dean, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oil well|Drilling]] is another means of sampling the seabed. It is used to obtain a record of the seabed stratigraphy or the rock formations below it. The set-up used to sample an offshore structure's foundation is similar to that used by the oil industry to reach and delineate hydrocarbon reservoirs, with some differences in the types of testing.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP44"&gt;Randolph &amp; Gourvenec, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The [[drill string]] consists of a series of pipe segments {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter screwed end to end, with a drillbit assembly at the bottom.&lt;ref name="DeanP43"&gt;Dean, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As the dragbit (teeth extending downward from the drillbit) cut into the soil, soil cuttings are produced. Viscous drilling mud flowing down the drillpipe collects these cuttings and carry them up outside the drillpipe. As is the case for [[Geotechnical investigation|onshore geotechnical surveys]], different tools can be used for sampling the soil from a drill hole, notably "Shelby tubes", "piston samplers" and "split spoon samplers".

Information on the mechanical strength of the soil can be obtained in situ (from the seabed itself as opposed to in a laboratory from a soil sample). The advantage of this approach is that the data are obtained from soil that has not suffered any disturbance as a result of its relocation. Two of the most commonly used instruments used for that purpose are the [[cone penetration test|cone penetrometer (CPT)]] and the [[shear vane]].&lt;ref name="DeanSect2.3.4"&gt;Dean, section 2.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newson et al."&gt;Newson et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cone penetration test|CPT]] is a rod-shaped tool whose end has the shape of a cone with a known apex angle (''e.g.'' 60 degrees).&lt;ref name="DeanP45"&gt;Dean, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; As it is pushed into the soil, the resistance to penetration is measured, thereby providing an indication of soil strength.&lt;ref name="DasP646"&gt;Das, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt; A sleeve behind the cone allows the independent determination of the frictional resistance. Some cones are also able to measure [[pore water pressure]]. The shear vane test is used to determine the [[Soil mechanics#Drained and undrained shear|undrained shear strength]] of soft to medium [[Soil#Soil water|cohesive soils]].&lt;ref name="DeanP60"&gt;Dean, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DasP406"/&gt; This instrument usually consists of four plates welded at 90 degrees from each other at the end of a rod. The rod is then inserted into the soil and a torque is applied to it so as to achieve a constant rotation rate. The torque resistance is measured and an equation is then used to determine the undrained shear strength (and the residual strength), which takes into account the vane’s size and geometry.&lt;ref name="DasP406"&gt;Das, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offshore structures and geotechnical considerations==
''Offshore structures'' are mainly represented by [[Oil platform|platforms]], notably [[jackup rig]]s, steel jacket structures and [[gravity-based structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the seabed has to be taken into account when planning these developments. For instance, a gravity-based structure typically has a very large footprint and is relatively buoyant (because it encloses a large open volume).&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP9"&gt;Ramakrishnan, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, vertical loading of the foundation may not be as significant as the horizontal loads exerted by wave actions and transferred to the seabed. In that scenario, sliding could be the dominant mode of failure. A more specific example is that of the Woodside "North Rankin A" steel jacket structure offshore Australia.&lt;ref name="Randolph&amp;GourvenecP146"&gt;Randolph and Gourvenec, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The shaft capacity for the [[Deep foundation#Driven foundations|piles]] making up each of the structure's legs was estimated on the basis of conventional design methods, notably when driven into siliceous sands. But the soil at that site was a lower capacity calcareous sand. Costly remediation measures were required to correct this oversight.

Proper seabed characterization is also required for [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring systems]]. For instance, the design and installation of [[Suction caisson|suction piles]] has to take into account the soil properties, notably its undrained shear strength.&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP121"&gt;Bai and Bai, pp. 121, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for the installation and capacity assessment of ''plate anchors''.&lt;ref name="Bai&amp;BaiP131"&gt;Bai and Bai, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submarine pipelines===
{{Main|Submarine pipeline}}
[[Submarine pipeline]]s are another common type of man-made structure in the offshore environment.&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;King"&gt;Palmer and King 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These structures either rest on the seabed, or are placed inside a trench to protect them from [[fishing trawler]]s, dragging anchors or [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due current-induced oscillations.&lt;ref name="RamakrishnanP186"&gt;Ramakrishnan, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Trenching is also used to protect pipelines from [[Seabed gouging by ice#Arctic offshore oil &amp; gas|gouging by ice keels]].&lt;ref name="Palmer&amp;Been"&gt;Palmer and Been, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrette"&gt;Barrette 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, planning of the pipeline involves geotechnical considerations. Pipelines resting on the seabed require geotechnical data along the proposed pipeline route to evaluate potential stability issues, such as passive failure of the soil below it (the pipeline drops) due to insufficient [[bearing capacity]], or sliding failure (the pipeline shift sideways), due to low sliding resistance.&lt;ref name="Zhang&amp;Erbrich"&gt;Zhang and Erbrich, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catie et al"&gt;Catie et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The process of trenching, when required, needs to take into account soil properties and how they would affect ploughing duration.&lt;ref name="Bransby et al"&gt;Bransby et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Buckling potential induced by the axial and transverse response of the buried pipeline during its operational lifespan need to be assessed at the planning phase, and this will depend on the resistance of the enclosing soil.&lt;ref name="Catie et al"&gt;Catie et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ordovician–Silurian extinction events''', when combined, are the second-largest of the five major [[extinction events]] in Earth's history in terms of percentage of [[Genus|genera]] that became [[extinct]]. This event greatly affected marine communities, which caused the disappearance of one third of all brachiopod and bryozoan families, as well as numerous groups of [[conodont]]s, [[trilobite]]s, and [[graptolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Late Ordovician Mass Extinction|last=Elewa|first=Ashraf|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=978-3-540-75915-7|location=|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordovician–Silurian extinction occurred during the [[Hirnantian]] stage of the [[Ordovician Period]] and the subsequent Rhuddanian stage of the [[Silurian Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction|title=Ordovician-Silurian extinction|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last event is dated in the interval of 455–430 Ma ago, i.e., lasting from the Middle Ordovician to Early Silurian, thus including the extinction period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barash|first=M.|date=November 2014|title=Mass Extinction of the Marine Biota at the Ordovician–Silurian Transition Due to Environmental Changes|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134%2FS0001437014050014|journal=Oceanology|doi=10.1134/S0001437014050014|pmid=|access-date=|volume=54|pages=780–787|bibcode=2014Ocgy...54..780B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was the first of the big five [[Phanerozoic]] events and was the first to significantly affect animal-based communities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper, D.

Almost all major taxonomic groups were affected during this extinction event. Extinction was global during this period, eliminating 49-60% of marine genera and nearly 85% of marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christie, M., Holland, S. M., &amp; Bush, A.

[[Brachiopod]]s, [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], [[echinoderm]]s, [[bryozoa]]ns and [[coral]]s were particularly affected.&lt;ref name="sole"&gt;Sole, R. V., and Newman, M., 2002.

A combination of lowering of sea level and glacially driven cooling were likely driving agents for the Ordovician mass extinction.&lt;ref name="hanover" /&gt;

== Impact ==
The extinction occurred {{Ma|Silurian}}, during the [[Ordovician radiation|Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]].&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Munnecke | first1 = A.| last2 = Calner | first2 = M.| last3 = Harper | first3 = D.

During this extinction event there were several marked changes in biologically responsive [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s. The spread of anoxia (the absence of oxygen) greatly affected the organisms that lived in this time period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This complexity may indicate several distinct closely spaced events, or particular phases within one event.

At the time, most complex [[multicellular organism]]s lived in the sea, and around 100 marine [[Scientific classification|families]] became extinct, covering about 49%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rohde &amp; Muller|year=2005|title=Cycles in Fossil Diversity|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=208–210|doi=10.1038/nature03339|issue=7030|pmid=15758998|last2=Muller|first2=RA|bibcode=2005Natur.434..208R}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[fauna]]l [[Genus|genera]] (a more reliable estimate than species). The [[brachiopod]]s and [[bryozoa]]ns were decimated, along with many of the [[trilobite]], [[conodont]] and [[Graptolithina|graptolite]] families.

Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was mainly caused by a sharp increase in extinctions, rather than a decrease in [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522–542 | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;issn=0094-8373&amp;volume=30&amp;page=522 | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several groups of marine organisms with a planktonic lifestyle, more exposed to UV radiation than groups that lived in the benthos, suffered severely during the late Ordovician. Organisms that dwelled in the plankton were affected before benthic organisms during the mass extinction, and species dwelling in shallow water were more likely to become extinct than species dwelling in deep water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Possible causes ==
The analysis of the available information reveals that the conditions during the mass extinction at the Ordovician–Silurian transition were considerably different as compared with the environments during the other four Phanerozoic mass extinction events, although all the main factors that were responsible for these processes were the same: the sea level and climate fluctuations, impact events, and volcanism, which should yield ejection of harmful gases, ashes, and aerosols into the atmosphere and, thus, provoke the greenhouse effect, atmosphere darkening, reduction of the photosynthesis and bio-productivity, the destruction of food chains, and anoxia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Glaciation ===
Two environmental changes associated with the [[glaciation]] were responsible for much of the Late Ordovician extinction. First, the cooling global climate was probably especially detrimental because the biota was adapted to an intense greenhouse. Second, sea level decline, caused by sequestering of water in the ice cap, drained the vast [[Inland sea (geology)|epicontinental seaways]] and eliminated the habitat of many endemic communities.

Glaciation pulses appear to correspond to the beginning and end of the most severe [[ice age]] of the [[Phanerozoic]], which marked the end of a longer cooling trend in the [[Hirnantian]] faunal stage towards the end of the Ordovician,&lt;ref name="Munnecke2010" /&gt; which had more typically experienced [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth#Greenhouse Earth|greenhouse]] conditions.

As the southern [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]] drifted over the [[South Pole]], [[ice cap]]s formed on it. Correlating rock strata have been detected in Late Ordovician [[Stratum|rock strata]] of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time. [[Glacial period|Glaciation]] locks up water from the world-ocean, and the [[interglacial]]s free it, causing [[Sea level change|sea levels repeatedly to drop and rise]]; the vast shallow intra-continental Ordovician seas withdrew, which eliminated many [[ecological niche]]s, then returned, carrying diminished [[Founder effect|founder populations]] lacking many whole families of organisms. Then they withdrew again with the next pulse of glaciation, eliminating biological diversity at each change (Emiliani 1992 p.&amp;nbsp;491). In the North African strata, five pulses of glaciation from [[Seismology|seismic]] sections are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsletter.palass-pubs.org/pdf/News57a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727162143/http://newsletter.palass-pubs.org/pdf/News57a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }} IGCP meeting September 2004 reports pp 26f&lt;/ref&gt;

This incurred a shift in the location of bottom-water formation, shifting from low [[latitude]]s, characteristic of greenhouse conditions, to high latitudes, characteristic of icehouse conditions, which was accompanied by increased deep-ocean currents and oxygenation of the bottom-water. An opportunistic fauna briefly thrived there, before [[Anoxic waters|anoxic conditions]] returned. The breakdown in the oceanic circulation patterns brought up nutrients from the abyssal waters. Surviving species were those that coped with the changed conditions and filled the ecological niches left by the extinctions.

=== Gamma-ray burst hypothesis ===
Some scientists have suggested that the initial extinctions could have been caused by a [[gamma-ray burst]] originating from a [[hypernova]] within 6,000 [[light-year]]s of Earth (in a nearby arm of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]). A ten-second burst would have stripped the Earth's atmosphere of half of its [[ozone]] almost immediately, exposing surface-dwelling organisms, including those responsible for planetary [[photosynthesis]], to high levels of [[extreme ultraviolet]] radiation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal

Although the hypothesis is consistent with patterns at the onset of extinction, there is no unambiguous evidence that such a nearby gamma-ray burst ever happened.

=== Volcanism and weathering ===
The late Ordovician glaciation event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (from 7,000 ppm to 4,400 ppm).&lt;ref name="Young 2010"&gt;Seth A. Young, Matthew R. Saltzman, William I.

===Metal poisoning===
[[Metal toxicity|Toxic metals]] on the ocean floor may have dissolved into the water when the oceans' oxygen was depleted.  An increase in available nutrients in the oceans may have been a factor. The toxic metals may have killed life forms in lower trophic levels of the [[food chain]], causing a decline in population, and subsequently resulting in starvation for the dependent higher feeding life forms in the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = New Theory for What Caused Earth's Second-Largest Mass Extinction |url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/15911-metals-extinction-ocean-oxygen-ordovician-silurian/ |website = National Geographic News |accessdate = 2015-09-12 |first = Cheryl |last = Katz | date= 2015-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Metal-induced malformations in early Palaeozoic plankton are harbingers of mass extinction |url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150825/ncomms8966/full/ncomms8966.html |journal = Nature Communications |date = 2015-08-25 |volume = 6 |doi = 10.1038/ncomms8966 |language = en |first = Thijs R.

== End of the event ==
The end of the second event occurred when melting glaciers caused the sea level to rise and stabilize once more. The rebound of life's diversity with the sustained re-flooding of continental shelves at the onset of the [[Silurian]] saw increased biodiversity within the surviving [[Order (biology)|orders]].

Following such a major loss of diversity, Silurian communities were initially less complex and broader niched. Highly endemic faunas, which characterized the Late Ordovician, were replaced by faunas that were amongst the most cosmopolitan in the Phanerozoic, biogeographic patterns that persisted throughout most of the Silurian.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

These end Ordovician–Silurian events had nothing like the long-term impact of the [[Permian–Triassic_extinction_event|Permian–Triassic ]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event|Cretaceous-Paleogene]] extinction events. Nevertheless, a large number of taxa disappeared from the Earth over a short time interval,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; eliminating and changing diversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">The '''Rossiter–McLaughlin effect''' is a [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] phenomenon observed when either an [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binary's]] secondary star or an [[extrasolar planet]] is seen to [[astronomical transit|transit]] across the face of the primary or parent star. As the main star rotates on its axis, one quadrant of its [[photosphere]] will be seen to be coming towards the viewer, and the other visible quadrant to be moving away. These motions produce [[blueshift]]s and [[redshift]]s, respectively, in the star's [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], usually observed as a broadening of the [[spectral line]]s. When the secondary star or planet transits the primary, it blocks part of the latter's disc, preventing some of the shifted light from reaching the observer. This causes the observed mean redshift of the primary star as a whole to vary from its normal value. As the transiting object moves across to the other side of the star's disc, the redshift anomaly will switch from being negative to being positive, or vice versa.  This effect has been used to show that as many as 25% of [[hot jupiter|hot Jupiters]] are orbiting in a retrograde direction with respect to their parent stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triaud |first=A.

[[Image:Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.svg|frame|center|Illustration showing the effect. The viewer is situated at the bottom. Light from the anticlockwise-rotating star is blue-shifted on the approaching side, and red-shifted on the receding side. As the planet passes in front of the star it sequentially blocks blue- and red-shifted light, causing the star's apparent radial velocity to change when it in fact does not.]]

== History ==
J. R. Holt in 1893 proposed a method to measure the [[stellar rotation]] of stars using [[radial velocity]] measurements, he predicted that when one star of an eclipsing binary eclipsed the other it would first cover the advancing blueshifted half and then the receding redshifted half. This motion would create a [[redshift]] of the eclipsed star’s spectrum followed by a [[blueshift]], thus appearing as a change in the radial velocity in addition to that caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsed star.&lt;ref name="Triaud2013"/&gt;

The effect is named after [[Richard Alfred Rossiter]] and [[Dean Benjamin McLaughlin]].

A '''sand forest''' is a type of rare [[subtropical forest]] region, distinctive due to its unique combination of plant (often [[rare plant]]) and animal species, and their restriction to ancient coastal dunes. The sand forests are [[endemic]] to [[Maputaland]] in South Africa, and found in parts of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] ([[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eiten|first1=George|title=Delimitation of the cerrado concept|journal=Vegetation|date=March 1978|volume=36|pages=169–178|doi=10.1007/bf02342599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are typically composed of clay soils and nutrient poor white sands. These forests are commonly referred to as "sand forests" in the South African regions. However, in Mozambique, they are known as the "Lucauati forests". In the Amazon, they are colloquially known as ''[[campinarana]]s'' and ''[[Campina (biome)|campinas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ter Steege|first1=Hans|last2=Sabatier|first2=Daniel|last3=Castellanos|first3=Hernan|last4=Van Andel|first4=Tinde|last5=Duivenvoorden|first5=Joost|last6=Adalardo de Oliveira|first6=Alexandre|last7=Ek|first7=Renske|last8=Lilwah|first8=Ramesh|last9=Maas|first9=PAul|last10=Mori|first10=Scott|title=An analysis of the floristic composition and diversity of Amazonian forests including those of the Guiana Shield|journal=Journal of Tropical Ecology|date=2000|volume=16|pages=801–828|doi=10.1017/s0266467400001735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few studies have been carried out on the sand forests. Those studies that have been conducted, the majority of the research has been on the plant diversity within these forests.

== Origins ==
There have been no comprehensive studies undertaken in the white sand forests. A full understanding of the process in which they have emerged is lacking. However, it is thought that the sand forests are the fragments of coastal dunes which were separated from the ocean over millions of years as the shoreline and water level slowly shifted. Researchers have speculated that these forest systems have been related to the [[Late Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] dry periods.

[[Podsolization]] is a process in which the upper layer of soil becomes acidic due to the leaching of nutrients. This process combined with the lack of nutrients in the upper horizon results in only white sand being left behind.&lt;ref name = franco&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franco|first1=Wilfredo|last2=Dezzeo|first2=Nelda|title=Soils and soil-water regime in the terra-firme-caatinga forest complex near San Carlos de Rio Negro, state of Amazonas, Venezuela|journal=Interciencia|date=1994|issue=19|pages=305–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sandy soils can result from a number of different processes ([[Leaching (agriculture)|nutrient leaching]], [[Tectonics|tectonic activity]], river dynamics, etc.), the sand forests are unique and, oftentimes, different from sand forests found elsewhere.&lt;ref name=franco /&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Biodiversity ===
Sand forests are well known for their unique biodiversity and high levels of [[endemism]].&lt;ref name=damasco /&gt; To date there have been more than 2,500 species of vascular plants and of those, 230 species are endemic within the Maputaland region. Distinct [[sclerophyll]]y, or vegetation with thickened, hardened foliage that slows moisture loss, is a characteristic of a vast number of the plants found in this region.&lt;ref name=damasco /&gt; Due to nutrient and water restrictions, the vegetation that grows in the sand forests is very specialized. Many of the trees and shrubs have evolved [[Plant defense against herbivory|anti-herbivorous defenses]].&lt;ref name=damasco /&gt; Herbivores seemed to favor vegetation of plants in clay soils over the white sandy soils. In no presence of herbivores however, the clay soil vegetation survived just as well as white sand specialists, but grew much taller and produced more leaf area.&lt;ref name = damasco&gt;{{cite web|last1=Damasco|first1=Gabriel|title=Understanding the origin and the landscape dynamics of white-sand vegetation in Amazonia|url=http://clas.berkeley.edu/research/understanding-origin-and-landscape-dynamics-white-sand-vegetation-amazonia|website=Center for Latin American Studies|publisher=University of Berkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decomposition ===
Sand forests have a thick [[humus]] layer due to the extremely low decomposition rates.&lt;ref name = fine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Paul|last2=Garcia-Villacorta|first2=Roosevelt|last3=Pitman|first3=Nigel|last4=Mesones|first4=Italo|last5=Kembel|first5=Steven|title=A Floristic Study of the White-Sand Forests of Peru|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|date=2010|volume=97|issue=3|pages=283–305|doi=10.3417/2008068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sandy forests have even been recorded to have more than a meter of leaf litter on top of the white sand. Multiple reasons exist as to why there is such a large accumulation of organic matter including high acidity of the soil, high content of toxic compounds in the litter, and low nutrient quality of the litter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janzen|first1=Daniel|title=Tropical blackwater rivers, animals and mast fruiting by the Dipterocarpaceae|journal=Biotropica|date=July 1974|volume=6|issue=2|pages=69–103|doi=10.2307/2989823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vegetation ===
It is very common to find [[epiphytes]], such as the wiry orchid (''[[Microcoelia]] exilis''), and other lichens growing on the trees. They derive their moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris that has accumulated over time.&lt;ref name=Prance&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prance|first1=Ghillean|last2=Schubart|first2=Herbert|title=Notes on the vegetation of Amazonia I. A preliminary note on the origin of the open white sand campinas of the lower Rio Negro|journal=Brittonia|date=1978|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60–63|doi=10.2307/2806458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[tropical rainforests]], campinas are "reduced in biomass and have relatively high light penetration."&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = A | year = 1981 | title = White-Sand Vegetation of Brazilian Amazonia | url = | journal = Biotropica | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 199–210 | doi=10.2307/2388125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to nutrient deficiencies in campina soils, "shrubs and small trees typically have a dwarfed and rachitic aspect with reduced quantities of foliage" with many of the species being [[Perennial plant|perennials]] and [[evergreen]]s&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;

=== Hydrology ===
Sand forests have vegetation [[gradient]]s that closely coincide with saturation gradients.&lt;ref name=adeney /&gt; These saturation gradients are affected by rainfall and [[topography]] and, therefore, the vegetation is also affected by these same factors.&lt;ref name=adeney /&gt; Vegetation lower to the ground tends to congregate in areas that have been saturated for the longest period of time.&lt;ref name=adeney /&gt;

[[Blackwater river]]s (e.g. the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]) commonly begin in these sand forests due to their accumulation of humic matter that is easily washed downstream, particularly after heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name=adeney /&gt;

=== Birds ===
The majority of bird species found in sand forests is known to prefer sand forest habitat and are found rarely, if at all, in other types of habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alonso|first1=Jose|last2=Whitney|first2=Bret|title=A New Zimmerius Tyrannulet (Aves: Tyrannidae) From White Sand Forests of Northern Amazonian Peru|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|date=March 2001|volume=113|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1676/0043-5643(2001)113[0001:anztat]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no studies, however, evaluating the habitat specialization of sand forest birds to determine whether these habitats have unique bird fauna.

The majority of these birds are small ground dwellers. They often forage in the underbrush to find food because of the thick organic layers found in the sand forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alonso|first1=Jose Alvarez|last2=Whitney|first2=Bret|title=New distributional records of birds from white-sand forests of the northern Peruvian Amazon, with implications for biogeography of northern South America|journal=The Condor|date=2003|volume=105|pages=552–566|doi=10.1650/7159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their sharp beaks allow them to break through the thick coating of fruits and obtain the seeds inside.&lt;ref name=Fine2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Paul|last2=Mesones|first2=Italo|last3=Coley|first3=Phyllis|title=Herbivores Promote Habitat Specialization by Trees in Amazonian Forests|journal=Science|date=2004|volume=305|pages=663–665|doi=10.1126/science.1098982|pmid=15286371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alonso|first1=Jose Alvarez|last2=Metz|first2=Margaret|last3=Fine|first3=Paul|title=Habitat specialization by birds in western Amazonian white-sand forests|journal=Biotropica|date=2013|volume=45|issue=3|pages=365–372|doi=10.1111/btp.12020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of fire ==
The exact role of fires in sand forests is not known and most studies disagree on the matter.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt; However, evidence has shown that fires can help increase species diversity, particularly those that are specialized for such areas.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt; For example, [[Fire ecology|fire tolerant species]] may be more likely to colonize here.

Historically speaking, some sand forests may have been the result of anthropogenic burning done by indigenous people.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt; They would burn [[wikt:swath|swath]]s of sand forest to obtain better hunting and farming grounds.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt;

Fires of any kind can have both positive and negative effects on the ecosystem. In some instances, a fire can cause one or just a few species to predominate when the forest begins to regenerate.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt; However, fire can also promote more diversity within the regenerated forest.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt;

== Threats ==
Because sand forests are isolated in small patches, they have been mostly protected from the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|destruction of the Amazon rainforest]]. However, they are still at risk of disturbance. Sand forests are extremely sensitive to destruction due to the harsh growth and survival conditions.&lt;ref name = adeney&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adeney|first1=Jennifer|last2=Christensen|first2=Norman|last3=Cohn-Haft|first3=Mario|title=What is a Campina? Variation in 'White Sand' Ecosystems in Amazonia|journal=Unpublished Manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the conditions are so tough to thrive in once an ecosystem declines, it may take hundreds of years for it to develop again.

Some sand forests overlap with protected areas and indigenous lands, but most do not. Although they are not immediately threatened, sand forests are still in danger from ever-increasing [[deforestation]], [[Hydroelectric|hydroelectric projects]], and [[Mining|mineral extractions]].&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt;

== Conservation ==
Peru has actively incorporated sand forests in three protected areas. Authors who have done research in campinas have also made recommendations for conservation in their work.&lt;ref name= adeney/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}

'''Scrutiny''' (French: ''scrutin''; Late Latin: ''scrutinium''; from ''scrutari'', meaning "those who search through piles of rubbish in the hope of finding something of" and originally from the Latin "scruta," meaning "broken things, rags, or rubbish.").  In Roman times, the "scrutari" of cities and towns were those who laboriously searched for valuables amidst the waste and cast-offs of others.  The modern English "scrutiny" is derived from this root, indicating a careful examination or inquiry (often implying the search for a hidden mistake, misstatement, or incongruity).

The word is specifically applied in the early Roman Catholic Church to the examination of the [[catechumen]]s or those under instruction in the faith. They were taught the [[creed]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]], examined therein, and [[exorcism|exorcized]] prior to [[baptism]].  The days of scrutiny varied at different periods from three to seven.  From about the beginning of the 12th century, when it became usual to baptize infants soon after their birth instead of at stated times ([[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]), the ceremony of scrutiny was incorporated with that of the actual baptism.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Scrutiny |volume=24 |page=487 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are three moments for the scrutinies to occur: the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Sundays of [[Lent]].  These are done in public in front of the entire congregation, and the candidates are dismissed before the [[General Intercessions|Prayer of the Faithful]].  Only under grave circumstances can the scrutinies be dispensed, and only then by the [[Local_ordinary#Ordinaries_and_local_ordinaries|local ordinary]] (who can dispense only two at most).  The scrutinies are fully intended for the catechumens (i.e., those who are to receive Baptism, Communion, and Confirmation).&lt;ref&gt;Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrutiny is also a term applied to a method of [[Papal election|electing a pope]] in the [[Catholic Church]], in contradistinction to two other methods, [[acclamation]] and accession.  In the law of elections, scrutiny is the careful examination of votes cast after the unsuccessful candidate has lodged a petition claiming the seat, and alleging that he has the majority of legal votes.  Each vote is dealt with separately, notice being given beforehand by one party to the other of the votes objected to and the grounds of objection.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''Seven generation stewardship''' is a concept that urges the current generation of [[human]]s to live and work for the benefit of the seventh generation into the future.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
It originated{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} with the [[Iroquois]] – Great Law of the Iroquois – which holds appropriate to think seven generations ahead (about 140 years into the future) and decide whether the decisions they make today would benefit their children seven generations into the future.  It is frequently associated with the modern, popular concept of environmental stewardship or 'sustainability' but it is much broader in context (see the quotation below relative to "in ALL of your deliberations ...".

"In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation...
even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a pine." This is an often repeated saying, and most who use it claim that it comes from [http://www.indigenouspeople.net/iroqcon.htm "The Constitution of the Iroquois Nations: The Great Binding Law."]

In fact, the original language is as follows: "In all of your deliberations in the Confederate Council, in your efforts at law making, in all your official acts, self-interest shall be cast into oblivion.  Cast not over your shoulder behind you the warnings of the nephews and nieces should they chide you for any error or wrong you may do, but return to the way of the Great Law which is just and right.  Look and listen for the welfare of the whole people and have always in view not only the past and present but also the coming generations, even those whose faces are yet beneath the surface of the ground – the unborn of the future Nation."

[[Oren Lyons]], Chief of the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] Nation, writes: "We are looking ahead, as is one of the first mandates given us as chiefs, to make sure and to make every decision that we make relate to the welfare and well-being of the seventh generation to come. ... What about the seventh generation? Where are you taking them? What will they have?"&lt;ref&gt;An Iroquois Perspective.

[[File:Vesuvius from Naples at sunset.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|[[Mount Vesuvius]], near the city of Naples in Italy, [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|violently erupted in 79 AD]]. The last eruption of this stratovolcano occurred in March 1944.]]

A '''stratovolcano''', also known as a '''composite volcano''',&lt;ref&gt;{{USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/types.html|article=Principal Types of Volcanoes|accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Volcanic cone|conical]] [[volcano]] built up by many layers (strata) of hardened [[lava]], [[tephra]], [[pumice]] and [[volcanic ash|ash]]. Unlike [[shield volcano]]es, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of [[explosive eruption]]s and [[effusive eruption]]s, although some have collapsed summit craters called [[caldera]]s. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often [[felsic]], having high-to-intermediate levels of [[silica]] (as in [[rhyolite]], [[dacite]], or [[andesite]]), with lesser amounts of less-viscous [[Igneous rock#Mineralogical classification|mafic]] magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as {{Convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_garibaldi_e.php |title=Garibaldi volcanic belt: Garibaldi Lake volcanic field |work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes |publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]] |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626082839/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_garibaldi_e.php |archivedate=June 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called "composite volcanoes" because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials. They are among the most common types of volcanoes, in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes. Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are [[Krakatoa]], best known for its [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|catastrophic eruption in 1883]] and [[Vesuvius]], famous for its [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 AD]]. Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives. In modern times, [[Mount Saint Helens]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]] have erupted catastrophically, with lesser losses of lives.

Existence of stratovolcanoes has not been proved on other terrestrial bodies of the [[solar system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barlow|first1=Nadine|title=Mars : an introduction to its interior, surface and atmosphere|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521852265}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one exception. Their existence was suggested for some isolated massifs on Mars, e.g., [[Zephyria Tholus]].&lt;ref name=mars&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Emily M.|last2=Head|first2=James W.|title=Ancient Martian volcanoes in the Aeolis region: New evidence from MOLA data|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1 August 2001|volume=106|issue=E8|pages=17505|doi=10.1029/2000JE001322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
[[File:Subduction-en.svg|left|thumb|Cross-section of subduction zone and associated stratovolcanoes.]]
{{see also|Igneous rock}}

Stratovolcanoes are common at [[subduction zone]]s, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where [[oceanic crust]] is drawn under [[continental crust]] (continental arc volcanism, e.g. [[Cascade Range]], central [[Andes]], [[Campanian volcanic arc|Campania]]) or another oceanic plate ([[island arc]] volcanism, e.g. [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Aleutian Islands]]). The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous [[basalt]] rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] rock of the [[asthenosphere]] above the sinking oceanic slab. The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths. The water freed from the rock lowers the [[melting point]] of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the [[lithosphere]]. The magma then rises through the [[crust (geology)|crust]], incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final [[intermediate composition]]. When the magma nears the top surface, it pools in a [[magma chamber]] within the crust below the stratovolcano.

There, the relatively low pressure allows water and other [[volatility (physics)|volatiles]] (mainly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) dissolved in the magma to escape from solution, as occurs when a bottle of [[carbonated water]] is opened, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates, the plug (solidified blockage) of the [[volcanic vent]] is broken, leading to a sudden [[explosive eruption]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}{{clear}}

In recorded history, explosive eruptions at subduction zone (convergent-boundary) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations.&lt;ref name="dynearth"&gt;{{USGS|source={{cite web|title=Plate tectonics and people|last1=Kious|first1=W. Jacquelyne|last2=Tilling|first2=Robert I.|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/tectonics.html}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subduction-zone stratovolcanoes, such as [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Etna]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]], typically erupt with explosive force: the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases. As a consequence, the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain and intermingle in the pasty magma.  Following the breaching of the vent and the opening of the crater, the magma degasses explosively. The magma and gases blast out with high speed and full force.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt;

Since 1600 CE, nearly 300,000 people have been killed by volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; Most deaths were caused by [[pyroclastic flow]]s and [[lahar]]s, deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes. Pyroclastic flows are swift, avalanche-like, ground-sweeping, incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris, fine ash, fragmented lava and superheated gases that can travel at speeds in excess of {{convert|160|km/h|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. Around 30,000 people were killed by pyroclastic flows during the 1902 eruption of [[Mont Pelée]] on the island of [[Martinique]] in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; In March to April 1982, three explosive eruptions of [[El Chichón Volcano]] in the State of [[Chiapas]] in southeastern [[Mexico]], caused the worst volcanic disaster in that country's history. Villages within {{convert|8|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} of the volcano were destroyed by pyroclastic flows, killing more than 2,000 people.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt;

Two [[Decade Volcano]]es that erupted in 1991 provide examples of stratovolcano hazards. On June 15, Mount Pinatubo spewed an ash cloud {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} into the air and produced huge pyroclastic surges and [[lahar]] floods that devastated a large area around the volcano. Pinatubo, located in [[Central Luzon]] just {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} west-northwest from [[Manila]], had been dormant for 6 centuries before the 1991 eruption, which ranks as one of the largest eruptions in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; Also in 1991, Japan's [[Unzen Volcano]], located on the island of Kyushu about {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} east of Nagasaki, awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new [[lava dome]] at its summit. Beginning in June, repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain's slopes at speeds as high as {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}. Unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in Japan; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 people—the worst volcanic disaster in the nation's history.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt;

The AD 79 [[Vesuvian eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]], a stratovolcano situated within [[Campania]], completely smothered the nearby ancient cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] with thick deposits of [[pyroclastic surge]]s and [[lava flow]]s. Although death toll is estimated between 13,000 to 26,000 remains, the exact number still remains unknown. Vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous volcanoes, due to its capacity for powerful explosive eruptions combined with the high population density of the surrounding [[Metropolitan City of Naples|Metropolitan Naples]] area (totaling about 3.6 million inhabitants).{{clear}}

===Ash===
[[File:Ashfall from Pinatubo, 1991.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Snow-like blanket of [[Mount Pinatubo]]'s ashfall deposits of June 15, 1991.]]
{{main article|Volcanic ash}}

Apart from possibly affecting the climate, volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a serious hazard to aviation safety.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; For example, during the 1982 eruption of [[Galunggung]] in [[Java]], [[British Airways Flight 9]] flew into the ash cloud, suffering temporary engine failure and structural damage. During the past two decades, more than 60 airplanes, mostly commercial airliners, have been damaged by in-flight encounters with volcanic ash. Some of these encounters have resulted in the power loss of all engines, necessitating emergency landings. Luckily, to date no crashes have happened because of jet aircraft flying into volcanic ash.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; [[Volcanic ash|Ashfall]]s are a threat to health when inhaled and is also a threat to property with enough accumulation. An accumulation of {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} is sufficient to cause most buildings to collapse.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Dense clouds of hot volcanic ash, caused by the collapse of an [[Eruption column|eruptive column]] or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions, can generated devastating pyroclastic flows or surges, which can sweep off everything in their paths.

===Lava===
[[File:Mayon 0052.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mayon|Mayon Volcano]] extruding lava flows during its eruption on December 29, 2009.]]
{{main article|Lava}}

Lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to humans and animals because the highly [[viscosity|viscous]] lava moves slowly enough for everyone to flee out of the path of flow. The lava flows are more of a threat to property. However, not all stratovolcanoes erupt viscous and sticky lava. [[Mount Nyiragongo]] is very dangerous because its [[magma]] has an unusually low silica content, making it quite fluid. Fluid lavas are typically associated with the formation of broad shield volcanoes such as those of Hawaii, but Nyiragongo has very steep slopes down which lava can flow at up to {{convert|100|km/h|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. Lava flows could melt down ice and glaciers that accumulated on the volcano's crater and upper slopes, generating massive [[lahar]] flows. Rarely, generally fluid lava could also generate a massive lava fountain, while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent, creating a [[volcanic plug|block]] which can result in highly explosive eruptions.

===Volcanic bombs===
{{main article|Volcanic bomb}}

Volcanic bombs are extrusive [[igneous]] rocks ranging from the size of books to small cars, that are explosively ejected from stratovolcanoes during their climactic eruptive phases. These "bombs" can travel over {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the volcano, and present a risk to buildings and living beings while shooting at very high speeds (hundreds of kilometers/miles per hour) through the air. Most bombs do not themselves explode on impact, but rather carry enough force so as to have destructive effects as if they exploded.

===Lahar===
{{main article|Lahar}}

Lahars (from a [[Javanese language|Javanese term]] for volcanic mudflows) are mixtures of volcanic debris and water. Lahars usually come from two sources: rainfall or the melting of snow and ice by hot volcanic elements, such as lava. Depending on the proportion and temperature of water to volcanic material, lahars can range from thick, gooey flows that have the consistency of wet concrete to fast-flowing, soupy floods.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; As lahars flow down the steep sides of stratovolcanoes, they have the strength and speed to flatten or drown everything in their paths. Hot ashes, lava flows and pyroclastic surges ejected during [[Armero tragedy|1985 eruption]] of [[Nevado del Ruiz]] in [[Colombia]] melted snow and ice atop the {{convert|5,321|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Andean volcano. The ensuing lahar flooded the city of [[Armero]] and nearby settlements, killing 25,000 people.&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt;

==Effects on climate and atmosphere==
[[File:Paluweh2013labeled.jpg|thumb|[[Paluweh]] eruption as seen from space]]

As per the above examples, while the Unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past, the impact of the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was global. Slightly cooler-than-usual temperatures were recorded worldwide, with brilliant sunsets and intense sunrises attributed to the [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]]; this eruption lofted particles high into the [[stratosphere]]. The [[aerosol]]s that formed from the [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and other gases dispersed around the world. The SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass in this cloud—about 22 million tons—combined with water (both of volcanic and atmospheric origin) formed droplets of sulfuric acid, blocking a portion of the sunlight from reaching the [[troposphere]] and ground.  The cooling in some regions is thought to have been as much as 0.5 °C (0.9 °F).&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; An eruption the size of Mount Pinatubo tends to affect the weather for a few years; the material injected into the stratosphere gradually drops into the [[troposphere]], where it is washed away by rain and cloud precipitation.

A similar, but extraordinarily more powerful phenomenon occurred in the cataclysmic April 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] on [[Sumbawa Island]] in [[Indonesia]]. The Mount Tambora eruption is recognized as the most powerful eruption in recorded history. Its eruption cloud lowered global temperatures by as much as 3.5 °C (6.3 °F).&lt;ref name="dynearth"/&gt; In the year following the eruption, most of the Northern Hemisphere experienced sharply cooler temperatures during the summer. In parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, 1816 was known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", which caused considerable agricultural crisis and a brief but bitter famine, which generated a series of distresses across much of the affected continents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37697">A '''supercritical fluid''' ('''SCF'''&lt;ref name=padrela/&gt;) is any substance at a [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] above its [[critical point (chemistry)|critical point]], where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. It can [[Effusion|effuse]] through solids like a gas, and [[Solvation|dissolve]] materials like a liquid. In addition, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in [[density]], allowing many properties of a supercritical fluid to be "fine-tuned". Supercritical fluids are suitable as a substitute for [[organic compound|organic]] [[solvents]] in a range of industrial and laboratory processes. [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|Carbon dioxide]] and water are the most commonly used supercritical fluids, being used for [[decaffeination]] and [[Supercritical water reactor|power generation]], respectively.

In addition, there is no [[surface tension]] in a supercritical fluid, as there is no liquid/gas phase boundary. By changing the pressure and temperature of the fluid, the properties can be "tuned" to be more liquid-like or more gas-like. One of the most important properties is the solubility of material in the fluid. Solubility in a supercritical fluid tends to increase with density of the fluid (at constant temperature). Since density increases with pressure, solubility tends to increase with pressure. The relationship with temperature is a little more complicated. At constant density, solubility will increase with temperature. However, close to the critical point, the density can drop sharply with a slight increase in temperature. Therefore, close to the critical temperature, solubility often drops with increasing temperature, then rises again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.ege.edu.tr/~otles/SupercriticalFluidsScienceAndTechnology/Wc488d76f2c655.htm|title= Supercritical Fluid Extraction, Density Considerations|accessdate=2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All supercritical fluids are completely [[Miscibility|miscible]] with each other so for a mixture a single phase can be guaranteed if the critical point of the mixture is exceeded. The critical point of a binary mixture can be estimated as the [[arithmetic mean]] of the critical temperatures and pressures of the two components,
:''T''&lt;sub&gt;c(mix)&lt;/sub&gt; = (mole fraction ''A'') × ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' + (mole fraction ''B'') × ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''B''.
For greater accuracy, the critical point can be calculated using [[equations of state]], such as the Peng Robinson, or [[group contribution]] methods. Other properties, such as density, can also be calculated using equations of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.criticalprocesses.com/Calculation%20of%20density,%20enthalpy%20and%20entropy%20of%20carbon%20dioxide.htm | title = Calculation of Thermodynamic Properties of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using Peng–Robinson equation of state | accessdate = 2007-11-20 | author = A.

==Phase diagram==
[[File:Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram-en.svg|right|thumb|290px|'''Figure 1.''' Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram]]
[[File:Carbon dioxide density-pressure phase diagram.jpg|frame|thumb|290px|'''Figure 2.''' Carbon dioxide density-pressure phase diagram]]
Figures 1 and 2 show two-dimensional projections of a [[phase diagram]]. In the pressure-temperature phase diagram (Fig. 1) the [[boiling point|boiling]] separates the [[gas]] and liquid region and ends in the critical point, where the liquid and gas phases disappear to become a single supercritical phase. 

The appearance of a single phase can also be observed in the density-pressure phase diagram for carbon dioxide (Fig. 2). At well below the critical temperature, e.g., 280&amp;nbsp;K, as the pressure increases, the gas compresses and eventually (at just over 40 [[bar (unit)|bar]]) condenses into a much denser liquid, resulting in the discontinuity in the line (vertical dotted line). The system consists of 2 phases in [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], a dense liquid and a low density gas. As the critical temperature is approached (300&amp;nbsp;K), the density of the gas at equilibrium becomes higher, and that of the liquid lower.  At the critical point, (304.1 K and 7.38 MPa (73.8 bar)), there is no difference in density, and the 2 phases become one fluid phase. Thus, above the critical temperature a gas cannot be liquefied by pressure. At slightly above the critical temperature (310&amp;nbsp;K), in the vicinity of the critical pressure, the line is almost vertical. A small increase in pressure causes a large increase in the density of the supercritical phase.   Many other physical properties also show large gradients with pressure near the critical point, e.g. [[viscosity]], the [[relative permittivity]] and the solvent strength, which are all closely related to the density. At higher temperatures, the fluid starts to behave like a gas, as can be seen in Figure 2. For carbon dioxide at 400 K, the density increases almost linearly with pressure.

Many pressurized gases are actually supercritical fluids. For example, nitrogen has a critical point of 126.2&amp;nbsp;K (−147&amp;nbsp;°C) and 3.4 MPa  (34 bar). Therefore, nitrogen (or compressed air) in a gas cylinder above this pressure is actually a supercritical fluid. These are more often known as permanent gases. At room temperature, they are well above their critical temperature, and therefore behave as a gas, similar to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 400&amp;nbsp;K above. However, they cannot be liquified by pressure unless cooled below their critical temperature.

==Thermodynamics==
In recent years, a significant effort has been devoted to investigation of various properties of supercritical fluids. This has been an exciting field with a long history since 1822 when Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour discovered supercritical fluids while conducting experiments involving the discontinuities of the sound in a sealed cannon barrel filled with various fluids at high temperature. More recently, supercritical fluids have found application in a variety of fields, ranging from the extraction of floral fragrance from flowers to applications in food science such as creating decaffeinated coffee, functional food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, polymers, powders, bio- and functional materials, nano-systems, natural products, biotechnology, fossil and bio-fuels, microelectronics, energy and environment. Much of the excitement and interest of the past decade is due to the enormous progress made in increasing the power of relevant experimental tools. The development of new experimental methods and improvement of existing ones continues to play an important role in this field, with recent research focusing on dynamic properties of fluids.

[[Dima Bolmatov]], V. V. Brazhkin and K. Trachenko discovered that [[specific heat]] shows a crossover between two different dynamic regimes of the low-temperature rigid-liquid and high temperature non-rigid gas-like fluid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms3331 |title=Thermodynamic behaviour of supercritical matter|date=2013|last1=Bolmatov|first1=D.|last2=Brazhkin|first2=V. V.|last3=Trachenko|first3=K.|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|issue=2013|arxiv = 1303.3153 |bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2331B|pmid=23949085|page=2331|year=2013&lt;!--Deny Citation Bot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid liquids are rigid like a solid on short time scales, but flow like a liquid on long time scales;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep00421 | pmid=22639729 | pmc=3359528 | laysummary=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/jun/13/phonon-theory-sheds-light-on-liquid-thermodynamics |laysource= [[Physics World]]|title=The phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics|date=2012|last1=Bolmatov|first1=D.|last2=Brazhkin|first2=V.

The crossover challenges the currently held belief that no difference can be made between a gas and a liquid above the critical point and that the supercritical state is homogeneous in terms of physical properties. Bolmatov and colleagues formulated a theory of system thermodynamics and heat capacity above the crossover. In that theory, energy and heat capacity are governed by the minimal length of the longitudinal mode in the system only, and do not depend on system-specific structure and interactions. Bolmatov and colleagues predicted the relationship between supercritical exponents of heat capacity and viscosity and derived a [[power law]] for the supercritical state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Fisher-Widom line]] allows to distinguish liquid-like and gas-like states within the supercritical fluid.

==Natural occurrence==

===Hydrothermal circulation===
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|right|A [[black smoker]], a type of hydrothermal vent]]
{{see also|Hydrothermal circulation}}
Hydrothermal circulation occurs within the Earth's crust wherever fluid becomes heated and begins to convect. These fluids are thought to reach supercritical conditions under a number of different settings, such as in the formation of porphyry copper deposits or high temperature circulation of seawater in the sea floor. At mid-ocean ridges, this circulation is most evident by the appearance of hydrothermal vents known as "black smokers". These are large (metres high) chimneys of sulfide and sulfate minerals which vent fluids up to 400&amp;nbsp;°C. The fluids appear like great black billowing clouds of smoke due to the precipitation of dissolved metals in the fluid. It is likely that at depth many of these vent sites reach supercritical conditions, but most cool sufficiently by the time they reach the sea floor to be subcritical. One particular vent site, Turtle Pits, has displayed a brief period of supercriticality at the vent site. A further site, [[Beebe Hydrothermal Vent Field|Beebe]], in the Cayman Trough, is thought to display sustained supercriticality at the vent orifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Webber|first1=A.P.|last2=Murton|first2=B.|last3=Roberts|first3=S.|last4=Hodgkinson|first4=M.|title=Supercritical Venting and VMS Formation at the Beebe Hydrothermal Field, Cayman Spreading Centre|url=http://goldschmidt.info/2014/abstracts/abstractView?abstractId=2504|website=Goldschmidt Conference Abstracts 2014|publisher=Geochemical Society|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary atmospheres===
The atmosphere of [[Venus]] is 96.5% carbon dioxide and 3.5% nitrogen. The surface pressure is 9.3 MPa (93 bar) and the surface temperature is 735 K, above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid.

The interior atmospheres of the solar system's [[gas giant]] planets are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium at temperatures well above their critical points. The gaseous outer atmospheres of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] transition smoothly into the dense liquid interior, while the nature of the transition zones of [[Neptune]] and [[Uranus]] is unknown. Theoretical models of [[extrasolar planet]]s [[55 Cancri e]] and [[Gliese 876 d]] have posited an ocean of pressurized, supercritical fluid water with a sheet of solid high pressure water ice at the bottom.

==Applications==

===Supercritical fluid extraction===
The advantages of [[supercritical fluid extraction]] (compared with liquid extraction) are that it is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with supercritical fluids. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling the density of the medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply depressurizing, allowing the supercritical fluid to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the [[decaffeination]] of green coffee beans, the extraction of [[hops]] for beer production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/interviews/interview/805/|title= The Naked Scientist Interviews|accessdate=2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production of [[essential oils]] and pharmaceutical products from plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Ormazabal|first2=Markel|last3=Vallejo|first3=Asier|last4=Olivares|first4=Maitane|last5=Navarro|first5=Patricia|last6=Etxebarria|first6=Nestor|last7=Usobiaga|first7=Aresatz|date=2015-01-01|title=Optimization of Supercritical Fluid Consecutive Extractions of Fatty Acids and Polyphenols from Vitis Vinifera Grape Wastes|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=E101–E107|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.12715|pmid=25471637|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[laboratory]] [[test method]]s include the use of [[supercritical fluid extraction]] as an extraction method instead of using traditional [[solvent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;U.S.EPA Method 3560 Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Total Recoverable Hydrocarbons. https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/3560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S.EPA Method 3561 Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons. https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/3561.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories.

===Supercritical fluid decomposition===
Supercritical water can be used to decompose biomass via supercritical water gasification of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/renewable/biomass/cs/supercriticalwater.htm |title=Supercritical water gasification of biomas |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323194951/http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/biomass/cs/supercriticalwater.htm |archivedate=2009-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of biomass gasification can be used to produce hydrocarbon fuels for use in an efficient combustion device or to produce hydrogen for use in a fuel cell. In the latter case, hydrogen yield can be much higher than the hydrogen content of the biomass due to steam reforming where water is a hydrogen-providing participant in the overall reaction.

===Dry-cleaning===
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCD) can be used instead of PERC ([[perchloroethylene]]) or other undesirable solvents for [[dry-cleaning]]. Supercritical carbon dioxide sometimes [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalates]] into buttons, and, when the SCD is depressurized, the buttons pop, or break apart. Detergents that are soluble in carbon dioxide improve the solvating power of the solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc97/8_16_97/bob1.htm |title= Science News Online|accessdate=2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercritical fluid chromatography===
[[Supercritical fluid chromatography]] (SFC) can be used on an analytical scale, where it combines many of the advantages of [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) and [[gas chromatography]] (GC). It can be used with non-volatile and thermally labile analytes (unlike GC) and can be used with the universal [[flame ionization detector]] (unlike HPLC), as well as producing narrower peaks due to rapid diffusion. In practice, the advantages offered by SFC have not been sufficient to displace the widely used HPLC and GC, except in a few cases such as [[chiral]] separations and analysis of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Chemical reactions===
Changing the conditions of the reaction solvent can allow separation of phases for product removal, or single phase for reaction. Rapid diffusion accelerates diffusion controlled reactions. Temperature and pressure can tune the reaction down preferred pathways, e.g., to improve yield of a particular [[chiral]] [[isomer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R.

===Impregnation and dyeing===
Impregnation is, in essence, the converse of extraction. A substance is dissolved in the supercritical fluid, the solution flowed past a solid substrate, and is deposited on or dissolves in the substrate. Dyeing, which is readily carried out on polymer fibres such as polyester using disperse (non-ionic) [[dye]]s, is a special case of this. Carbon dioxide also dissolves in many polymers, considerably swelling and plasticising them and further accelerating the diffusion process.

===Nano and micro particle formation===
{{See also | micronization}}
The formation of small particles of a substance with a narrow size distribution is an important process in the pharmaceutical and other industries. Supercritical fluids provide a number of ways of achieving this by rapidly exceeding the [[saturation point (chemistry)|saturation point]] of a solute by dilution, depressurization or a combination of these. These processes occur faster in supercritical fluids than in liquids, promoting [[nucleation]] or [[spinodal decomposition]] over [[crystal growth]] and yielding very small and regularly sized particles. Recent supercritical fluids have shown the capability to reduce particles up to a range of 5-2000&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[The Journal of Supercritical Fluids]] | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | date = 2005 | pages = 287–308 | title = Formation of polymer particles with supercritical fluids: A review | author = Sang-Do Yeo | author2 = Erdogan Kiran | last-author-amp = yes | doi = 10.1016/j.supflu.2004.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation of pharmaceutical cocrystals===
Supercritical fluids act as a new media for the generation of novel crystalline forms of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) named as pharmaceutical cocrystals. Supercritical fluid technology offers a new platform that allows a single-step generation of particles that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional techniques. The generation of pure and dried new cocrystals (crystalline molecular complexes comprising the API and one or more conformers in the crystal lattice) can be achieved due to unique properties of SCFs by using different supercritical fluid properties: supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solvent power, anti-solvent effect and its atomization enhancement.&lt;ref name=padrela&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Padrela | first1 = L. | last2 = Rodrigues | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Velaga | first3 = S.P. | last4 = Matos | first4 = H.A. | last5 = Azevedo | first5 = E.G. | year = 2009 | title = Formation of indomethacin–saccharin cocrystals using supercritical fluid technology | url = | journal = European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 9–17 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejps.2009.05.010 | pmid = 19477273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.

===Supercritical drying===
{{See also | Critical point drying}}
[[Supercritical drying]] is a method of removing solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension drags on small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under supercritical conditions there is no surface tension, and the supercritical fluid can be removed without distortion. Supercritical drying is used for manufacture of [[aerogel]]s and drying of delicate materials such as archeological samples and biological samples for [[electron microscopy]]. Carbon dioxide is used as a supercritical solvent in some dry cleaning processes.

===Supercritical water oxidation===
[[Supercritical water oxidation]] uses supercritical water as a medium in which to oxidize hazardous waste, eliminating production of toxic combustion products that burning can produce.

The waste product to be oxidised is dissolved in the supercritical water along with molecular oxygen (or an oxidising agent that gives up oxygen upon decomposition, e.g. [[hydrogen peroxide]]) at which point the oxidation reaction occurs.

===Supercritical water hydrolysis===
[[Supercritical hydrolysis]] is a method of converting all biomass polysaccharides as well the associated lignin into low molecular compounds by contacting with water alone under supercritical conditions. The supercritical water, acts as a solvent, a supplier of bond-breaking thermal energy, a heat transfer agent and as a source of hydrogen atoms. All polysaccharides are converted into simple sugars in near-quantitative yield in a second or less. The aliphatic inter-ring linkages of lignin are also readily cleaved into free radicals that are stabilized by hydrogen originating from the water. The aromatic rings of the lignin are unaffected under short reaction times so that the lignin-derived products are low molecular weight mixed phenols. To take advantage of the very short reaction times needed for cleavage a continuous reaction system must be devised. The amount of water heated to a supercritical state is thereby minimized.

===Supercritical water gasification===
[[Supercritical water gasification]] is a process of exploiting the beneficial effect of supercritical water to convert aqueous biomass streams into clean water and gases like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reforming in supercritical water |url= http://www.btgworld.com/en/rtd/technologies/supercritical-water-reforming|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercritical fluid in power generation===
The [[Thermal efficiency|efficiency]] of a [[heat engine]] is ultimately dependent on the temperature difference between heat source and sink ([[Carnot cycle]]). To improve efficiency of [[fossil fuel power plant|power stations]] the [[operating temperature]] must be raised. Using water as the working fluid, this takes it into supercritical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malhotra, Ashok]] and Satyakam,R, 2000,Influence of climatic parameters on optimal design of supercritical power plants,IECEC, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=870911&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications Energy Conversion Engineering Conference], pp. 1053–1058,&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiencies can be raised from about 39% for subcritical operation to about 45% using current technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file18320.pdf |title=Supercritical steam cycles for power generation applications |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217144727/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file18320.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supercritical water reactor]]s (SCWRs) are promising advanced nuclear systems that offer similar thermal efficiency gains.

===Biodiesel production===
Conversion of vegetable oil to [[Biodiesel production|biodiesel]] is via a [[transesterification]] reaction, where the [[triglyceride]] is converted to the methyl ester plus [[glycerol]]. This is usually done using [[methanol]] and [[Causticity|caustic]] or acid catalysts, but can be achieved using supercritical methanol without a catalyst. The method of using supercritical methanol for biodiesel production was first studied by Saka and his coworkers. This has the advantage of allowing a greater range and water content of feedstocks (in particular, used cooking oil), the product does not need to be washed to remove catalyst, and is easier to design as a continuous process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kunchana Bunyakiat | author2 = Sukunya Makmee | author3 = Ruengwit Sawangkeaw | author4 = Somkiat Ngamprasertsith | last-author-amp = yes |date=2006 |title= Continuous Production of Biodiesel via Transesterification from Vegetable Oils in Supercritical Methanol |journal= [[Energy and Fuels]] |volume= 20|issue= 2|pages=812–817 | doi = 10.1021/ef050329b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage===
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to [[Enhanced oil recovery|enhance oil]] recovery in mature oil fields. At the same time, there is the possibility of using "[[clean coal technology]]" to combine enhanced recovery methods with [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon sequestration]]. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is separated from other [[flue gases]], compressed to the supercritical state, and injected into geological storage, possibly into existing oil fields to improve yields.

At present, only schemes isolating fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from natural gas actually use carbon storage, (e.g., [[Sleipner gas field]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Saline Aquifer CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Storage |url = http://www.iku.sintef.no/projects/IK23430000/| accessdate = 2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but there are many plans for future CCS schemes involving pre- or post- combustion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10922&amp;page=84 "The Hydrogen Economy: Opportunities, Costs, Barriers, and R&amp;D Needs", p. 84 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology.stm FutureGen Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101033603/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology.stm |date=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zero.no/transport/bio/fischer-tropsch-reactor-fed-by-syngas Øyvind Vessia: "Fischer- Tropsch reactor fed by syngas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929003817/http://www.zero.no/transport/bio/fischer-tropsch-reactor-fed-by-syngas |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/activity/srccs/index.htm Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the possibility to reduce the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere by using [[biomass]] to generate power and sequestering the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced.

===Enhanced geothermal system===
{{main|Enhanced geothermal system#CO2 EGS}}
The use of supercritical carbon dioxide, instead of water, has been examined as a geothermal working fluid.

===Refrigeration===
{{Expand section|1=an explanation what physical properties of SCF make it a good refrigerant, and the connection to the stated reduction in carbon footprint|small=no|date=July 2018}}
Supercritical carbon dioxide is also an important emerging [[Refrigeration|refrigerant]], being used in new, low-carbon solutions for domestic heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/knowledge/faq_a.php FAQs – Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in heat pumps and other applications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006101017/http://www.r744.com/knowledge/faq_a.php |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are undergoing continuous development with supercritical carbon dioxide heat pumps already being successfully marketed in Asia. The [[EcoCute]] systems from Japan, developed by consortium of companies including Mitsubishi, develop high-temperature domestic water with small inputs of electric power by moving heat into the system from their surroundings. Their success makes a future use in other world regions possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shecco.com/tech/heating.php Eco Cute hot water heat pumps in Japan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306003249/http://www.shecco.com/tech/heating.php |date=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercritical fluid deposition===
Supercritical fluids can be used to deposit functional nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in [[chemical vapour deposition]] allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform interfacial growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi = 10.1002/adma.200390077}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under [[chemical vapour deposition]] would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as [[dendrites]]. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than [[atomic layer deposition]], the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SFD compared to CVD |url=http://www.navolta.com/supercritical-fluid-deposition-vs-cvd/ |website=navolta.com |publisher=Navolta |accessdate=3 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005145913/http://www.navolta.com/supercritical-fluid-deposition-vs-cvd/ |archivedate=5 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1822, Baron [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]] discovered the critical point of a substance in his famous [[cannon]] barrel experiments. Listening to discontinuities in the sound of a rolling [[flint]] ball in a sealed cannon filled with fluids at various temperatures, he observed the critical temperature. Above this temperature, the densities of the liquid and gas [[phase (matter)|phases]] become equal and the distinction between them disappears, resulting in a single supercritical fluid phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Berche |first1=Bertrand |last2=Henkel |first2=Malte |last3=Kenna |first3=Ralph |date=2009 |title=Critical phenomena: 150 years since Cagniard de la Tour |journal=Journal of Physical Studies |volume=13 |pages=3001–1–3001–4 |arxiv=0905.1886 |issue=3|bibcode = 2009arXiv0905.1886B |doi=10.1590/S1806-11172009000200015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Terai-[[Dooars|Duar]] savanna and grasslands''' is a narrow lowland [[ecoregion]] at the base of the [[Himalayas]], about {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, and a continuation of the [[Gangetic Plain]]. It is colloquially called ''[[Terai]]'' in the [[Ganges Basin]] east to [[Nepal]], then ''[[Dooars]]'' in [[West Bengal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Assam]] east to the [[Brahmaputra River]]. The world's tallest [[grassland]]s are found in this ecoregion, which are the most threatened and rare worldwide.&lt;ref name=im0701&gt;Dinerstein, E., Loucks, C. (2001). {{WWF ecoregion|name=Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands|id=im0701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
This [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]] stretches from western [[Bhutan]] to southern [[Nepal]]'s [[Terai]], westward to [[Banke National Park|Banke]], covering the [[Inner_Terai_Valleys_of_Nepal#Dang_and_Deukhuri_Valleys|Dang and Deukhuri Valleys]] along the [[West Rapti River|Rapti River]] to [[India]]'s [[Bhabar]] and [[Doon Valley]]s. Each end crosses the border into India's states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name=im0701/&gt; The eastern and central areas are wetter than the western end.

In Nepal, the wetlands of [[Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve]], [[Beeshazar Tal]] in the bufferzone of [[Chitwan National Park]], [[Jagdishpur Reservoir]] and [[Ghodaghodi Tal]] are designated [[Ramsar site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandari, B.B. (2009) ''Wise use of Wetlands in Nepal'' Banko Janakari, Special Issue February 2009: 10-17 [http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/BANKO/article/view/2206 pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve]] is Nepal's largest patch of continuous grassland.&lt;ref&gt;Baral, H.S., Inskipp, C. (2009) ''The Birds of Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, Nepal.'' Our Nature (2009) 7: 56-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands are a mosaic of tall riverside grasslands, savannas and [[Evergreen forest|evergreen]] and deciduous forests, depending on soil quality and the amount of rain each area receives. The grasslands of the [[Terai]] in Nepal are among the tallest in the world, and are maintained by silt deposited by the yearly [[monsoon]] floods. Important grasses include [[Saccharum bengalense|baruwa]] and [[Saccharum spontaneum|kans grass]] (''Saccharum spontaneum''), which quickly establishes itself after the retreat of the monsoon waters. In the hillier areas the dominant tree is [[Shorea robusta|sal]] (''Shorea robusta''), which can grow to a height of {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The belt also contains riverside tropical [[deciduous forest]] comprising ''[[Mallotus philippensis]]'', [[jamun]], [[Bombax ceiba|cotton tree]], ''[[Trewia]] nudiflora'', and ''[[Garuga pinnata]]''.&lt;ref name=im0701 /&gt;

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is habitat for a huge number of [[Mammalian Species|mammalian]] and [[bird]] species.&lt;ref name = "Atlas"&gt;{{cite book |author = Hoekstra, J. M., Molnar, J. L., Jennings, M., Revenga, C., Spalding, M. D., Boucher, T. M., Robertson, J. C., Heibel, T. J., Ellison, K. |title = The Atlas of Global Conservation: Changes, Challenges, and Opportunities to Make a Difference |publisher = [[University of California Press]] |editor = Molnar, J. L. |year = 2010 |isbn = 978-0-520-26256-0 |url=http://www.nature.org/multimedia/maps/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable are the large numbers of the endangered [[greater one-horned rhinoceros]] and [[Bengal tiger]]s as well as [[Asian elephant]]s, [[sloth bear]]s, [[Indian leopard]]s.

In Nepal's [[Chitwan National Park]], more than 400 rhinos were sighted in 2008, and 125 adult tigers were recorded during a survey conducted from December 2009 to March 2010, which covered an area of {{convert|1261|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Basu P. (2008). ''Rare One-Horned Rhino Bouncing Back in Nepal.''

Chitwan along with the adjoining [[Parsa National Park]] is of major importance, especially for tigers and [[clouded leopard]]. Grazing animals of the grasslands include five species of deer, [[barasingha]], [[sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[chital]], [[hog deer]] and [[muntjac]] along with four large grazing animals, Asian elephant, rhinoceros, [[gaur]] and [[nilgai]]. Endangered mammals found here include the [[wild water buffalo]] and the near-endemic [[hispid hare]] (''Caprolagus hispidus'').

The grasslands are also home to a number of reptiles including the [[gharial]], [[mugger crocodile]] and [[Trionychidae|soft-shelled turtles]].

The grasslands partly cover two [[BirdLife International]] [[Endemic Bird Area]]s, the [[Central Himalayas EBA]] in western Nepal and the western end of the [[Assam Plains EBA]] south of Bhutan. There are three near-endemic bird species including the vulnerable [[Manipur bush quail]] (''Perdicula manipurensis''). The 44 threatened and declining bird species of the grasslands include the [[Bengal florican]] (''Houbaropsis bengalensis''), [[lesser florican]] (''Sypheotides indica''), [[sarus crane]] (''Grus antigone'') and [[Chinese grassbird|rufous-rumped grassbird]] (''Graminicola bengalensis'').

==Threats and conservation==
Although the population density has been low it is now growing, especially in the southern Terai belt and much of the ecoregion has been converted to farmland since the forest was cut down for timber, although [[Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve]], [[Chitwan National Park|Chitwan]], [[Bardia National Park|Bardia]] and [[Dudhwa National Park]]s, some of which were once royal hunting grounds, preserve significant sections of habitat, and are home to some of the greatest concentrations of [[Indian rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] and [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] remaining in [[South Asia]]. The areas of tall grasslands, which in particular have been much reduced for farmland, are of special conservation importance. The remaining forest meanwhile is mostly found in the drier bhabar belt, with some forest patches in Chitwan National Park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">In [[soil science]], the '''thaw depth''' or '''thaw line''' is the instantaneous level down to which the soil has warmed to zero degrees celcius. The active layer thickness is the maximum thaw depth over a period of two years.

The layer of soil over the thaw depth is called the [[active layer]], while the soil below is called '''permafrost'''. 

The term '''frost front''' refers to the varying position of the thaw line during the periods of freezing/thawing.

The knowledge of the thaw depth is important for the two major reasons: its influence on the [[ecology]] and on [[construction]] ([[buildings]], [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[road]]s, etc.). These influences are mediated by the effects of the dynamics [[biology|biological]], [[Pedology (soil study)|pedologic]], [[geomorphology|geomorphologic]], [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]], and [[hydrology|hydrologic]] processes in  permafrost.

In ecology,  [[root]]s of [[plant]]s cannot penetrate beyond the active layer, which places restrictions on which plants can grow in permafrost.

In construction, the thaw depth is a major factor in ensuring the structural integrity of the objects in question.

The primary factor that determines the thaw depth is the maximal air temperature. The [[soil type]] is another important factor: coarser [[soil texture|texture]]s of the [[parent material]] have higher [[thermal conductivity]], and, e.g.,  [[sand|sandy]] soils  have much deeper thaw line than [[clay]]s.  Yet another factors are the [[vegetation]] and the percentage of the [[soil organic matter]], which influence the bulk density of the soil, and hence thermal conductivity.&lt;ref&gt; Oelke, C., T. Zhang, M. Serreze, and R. Armstrong, 2003:  Regional-scale modeling of soil freeze/thaw over the Arctic drainage basin. J. Geophys. Res., 108 (D10): Art.No. 4314 May 29 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds - their distribution and abundance''''' ({{ISBN|0-85661-091-7}}) is an [[ornithological atlas]] published for the '''[[European Bird Census Council]]''' by [[T &amp; A D Poyser]] in 1997. Its editors were [[Ward J. M. Hagemeijer]] and [[Michael J. Blair]]. The atlas was the first to present [[grid-square distribution maps]] for all breeding birds at a [[Europe]]-wide level. The bulk of the book is in [[English language|English]], although it also contains introductions in thirteen other European languages. The atlas presents the results of the European Bird Census Council's European Ornithological Atlas project, the fieldwork for which was carried out between 1985 and 1988.

== The book ==
The book has cxli + 903 pages. Its Foreword (by [[Karel H Voous]]) and Preface (by [[Goetz Rheinwald]] and [[Jeremy Greenwood]]) are followed by an English introduction and shorter introductions in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; indexes of bird names, in the same languages, are also included, at the end of the book. The introductions are followed by sections detailing the history of the European Ornithological Atlas project and the Evolution and History of the European Bird Fauna, and a section listing national and major regional published bird atlases.

The bulk of the book (772 pages) consists of species accounts. All birds with established breeding populations within Europe are covered in a single-page or two-page account which includes a map of breeding distribution, histograms showing those countries with the largest breeding populations, and a species text. Seventeen further species for which some breeding behaviour has been observed within the region are covered more briefly. Some species distributions are shown on maps of the whole survey area, but for those with more restricted distributions, base maps showing only a relevant subdivision are shown.

The book concludes with sections on the Conservation Status of Europe's Birds, a list of species with threat statuses, a set of derived maps depicting overall species richness and richness of threatened species, and a 65-page references section.

The book's [[dustjacket]] is illustrated by [[bird artist]] [[David Nurney]] - the front cover shows a [[common kingfisher]] (with a map of its distribution), while a [[European bee-eater]] is depicted on the [[spine (book)|spine]].

== The European Ornithological Atlas project ==
The European Ornithological Atlas project was initiated in 1971. Its fieldwork took the form of surveys during the breeding season, in each of the countries within the region, between 1985 and 1988.

The survey area covered by the project extends to include [[Madeira]], [[The Azores]], [[Iceland]], [[Svalbard]], [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Franz Josef Land]] and [[Transcaucasia]], as well as [[European Russia]] east to the [[Ural Mountain|Urals]]. However, [[Turkey]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are excluded.

== The EOA maps online ==

The maps from the atlas are available online at the SOVON website here: [http://www.sovon.nl/ebcc/eoa/ The EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds]

==A climatic atlas of European breeding birds==

In 2007, a follow-up publication, "A climatic atlas of European breeding birds" was published by [[Lynx Edicions]]. This consisted of maps of projected species distributions based on the predictions of the Hadley centre HadCM3 climate change model.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, Brian, Rhys E Green, Yvonne C Collingham and Stephen G Willis (2007) ''A climatic atlas of European breeding birds'' {{ISBN|978-84-96553-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrnBld ArcticCurrents.svg|thumb|360px|'''Transpolar Drift''' and [[Beaufort Gyre]] are major [[ocean current]]s within the [[Arctic Ocean]].]]
--&gt;
[[File:Transpolar Drift.ogv|thumb|400px|The transpolar drift (purple arrows) is a dominant circulation feature in the Arctic Ocean that carries freshwater runoff (red arrows) from rivers in Russia across the North Pole and south towards Greenland. Under changing atmospheric conditions, emergent circulation patterns (blue arrows) drive freshwater runoff east towards Canada, resulting in freshening of Arctic water in the Canada Basin.]]

The '''Transpolar Drift Stream''' is a major [[ocean current]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]], transporting [[sea ice]] from the [[Laptev Sea]] and the [[East Siberian Sea]] towards [[Fram Strait]]. Drift experiments with ships like [[Fram]] or [[Tara expedition|Tara]] showed that the drift takes between two and four years.

In 1937, [[Pyotr Shirshov]] at the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] drift ice station [[North Pole-1]] described this drift. The stream conveys water in roughly two major routes to the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] at a rate of about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} per day.  Primarily wind-driven, it flows roughly from the northern coast of Russia and Alaska, sometimes curving toward the Beaufort Sea before exiting to the Atlantic Ocean. It has been cited as a major factor in the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] and [[Arctic oscillation]] atmospheric changes.  The drift typically takes one of two paths before exiting into the northern Atlantic Ocean.

On decadal and longer timescales, the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] (NAO) and the [[Arctic Oscillation]] (AO) indices affect the flow pattern of the transpolar drift stream.  During times of positive NAO (NAO+) and positive AO (AO+), there is a weak Arctic high and the associated surface winds produce a cyclonic (anti-clockwise) ice drift motion in eastern Arctic Ocean.  In this case, the drift flows from the Laptev Sea towards the Beaufort Sea before exiting the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait.  Conversely, during periods of NAO- and AO-, there is a strong Arctic high and ice motion flows in an anticyclonic (clockwise) motion in the Eurasian Basin.  In this phase, the drift flows directly from the Laptev Sea through the Fram Strait.

'''Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests''' are a [[tropical forest]] [[biome]]. They are located in regions of humid climate at [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] latitudes. Most tropical and subtropical coniferous forest [[ecoregion]]s are found in the [[Nearctic]] and [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]s, from the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] to [[Nicaragua]] and on the [[Greater Antilles]], [[Bahamas]], and [[Bermuda]]. Other tropical and subtropical [[Conifer|coniferous forest]]s ecoregions occur in [[Asia]].

Outside the [[Americas]] and the [[Greater Ranges]] of Asia they are rare and predominate on islands.

'''Vacuum grease''' is a [[lubricant]] with low volatility and is used for applications in low pressure environments.  Lubricants with higher volatility would evaporate, causing two problems:
* They would not be present to provide lubrication.
* They would make lowering the pressure below their vapor pressure difficult.

As well as a lubricant, vacuum grease is also used as a sealant for joints in [[vacuum system]]s. This is usually limited to soft vacuums, as [[ultra high vacuum]] or high temperatures may give problems with the grease [[outgassing]]. Grease is most commonly used with glass vacuum systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All metal systems usually use knife-edge seals in soft metals instead. Where [[O ring]] seals are used, these should ''not'' be greased (in static seals at least) as it can cause the O rings to become permanently distorted when compressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Bunn|1967}}, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;/ref&gt;

In electronics manufacturing processes, vacuum grease is often used to prevent corrosion.

One of the early vacuum greases is the [[Ramsay grease]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1937">The '''Volcano Number''' (also '''Volcano Reference File Number''', '''Volcano Numbering System''', or '''VNUM''') is a hierarchical geographical system to uniquely identify and tag volcanoes and volcanic features on Earth. The numbers consist of four numerals, a hyphen, then two or three more numerals. The first two numerals identify the region, the next two the subregion, and the last two or three the individual volcano.&lt;ref name=summdata&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.volcano.si.edu/data_criteria.cfm |title=Volcano Data Criteria |work= |publisher=Global Volcanism Program |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VNUM was developed by the ''Catalogue of the Active Volcanoes of the World'' project of the International Association of Volcanology, now the [[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior]] (IAVCEI), in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=summdata/&gt; It is currently administered by the [[Global Volcanism Program]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (USA), in cooperation with the IAVCEI, and the World Organization of Volcano Observatories (WOVO), a commission of IAVCEI.

The number system was used in both editions of the book [[Volcanoes of the World]] in 1981 and 1994. 

In September 2013, the Global Volcanism Program announced a new format for Volcano Number.&lt;ref name="NewFormat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://volcano.si.edu/gvp_vnums.cfm | title=Smithsonian / IAVCEI Volcano Numbers | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | work=[[Global Volcanism Program]] | date=30 September 2013 | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new format is a 6-digit number, and no longer includes non-numeric characters.

'''World Wetlands Day''' occurs annually on February 2nd, marking the date of the adoption of the [[Ramsar Convention|Convention on Wetlands]] on February 2, 1971.

Established to raise awareness about the value of wetlands for humanity and the planet, WWD was celebrated for the first time in 1997 and has grown remarkably since then. Each year, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and groups of citizens at all levels of the community, have taken advantage of the opportunity to undertake actions aimed at raising public awareness of wetland values and benefits. Some of these benefits include: biologically diverse ecosystems that provide habitat for many species, serve as buffers on the coast against storms and flooding, and naturally filter water by breaking down or transforming harmful pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/intro/value/
|title=The value of wetlands
|access-date=2017-05-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnership ==
Since 1998 the Ramsar Secretariat, with financial support from the [[Danone|Danone Group]] Evian Fund for Water, a variety of outreach materials which include logos, posters, factsheets, handouts  and  guide documents to support country activities organized to celebrate WWD, have been produced. These materials are available for free download on the World Wetlands Day website in the three languages of the Convention: English, French, and Spanish ([http://www.worldwetlandsday.org/ www.worldwetlandsday.org]). All the materials are also available in their design files for event organizers to customize and adapt them to their local languages and contexts. A few print copies are available to countries upon request to the Secretariat.

== World Wetlands Day Youth Photo Contest ==
[[File:World Wetlands Day Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|World Wetlands Day celebrations in Sri Lanka]]
Starting in 2015, a month-long Wetlands Youth Photo Contest that starts on 2 February, was introduced as a part of a new approach to target young people and get them involved in WWD. Thanks to [[Star Alliance]] Biosphere Connections, the prize awarded to the winner of the photo contest is a chance to visit a wetland of their choice from the over 2200 Ramsar Sites all over the world.

Since 1997 the Ramsar website has posted reports from about 100 countries of their WWD activities. In 2016 a map of events was introduced to help countries promote their activities and to facilitate reporting after WWD [http://www.ramsar.org/activity/world-wetlands-day www.ramsar.org/activity/world-wetlands-day].

== World Wetlands Day Themes ==
Each year a theme is selected to focus attention and help raise public awareness about the value of wetlands. Countries organize a variety of events to raise awareness such as ; lectures, seminars, nature walks, children’s art contests, sampan races, community clean-up days, radio and television interviews,  letters to newspapers, to the launch of new wetland policies, new Ramsar Sites and new programmes at the national level.

A '''xerophyte''' (from [[Ancient Greek languag e|Greek]]  ξηρός ''xeros'' dry, φυτόν ''phuton'' plant) is a species of [[plant]] that has [[adaptation]]s to survive in an environment with little liquid water, such as a [[desert]] or an ice- or snow-covered region in the [[Alps]] or the [[Arctic]]. Popular examples of xerophytes are [[cactus|cacti]] and [[pineapple]] plants.

The structural features ([[morphology (biology)|morphology]]) and fundamental chemical processes ([[physiology]]) of xerophytes are variously adapted to conserve water, also common to store large quantities of water, during dry periods. Other species are able to survive long periods of extreme dryness or [[desiccation]] of their [[Tissue_(biology)#Plant_tissues|tissues]], during which their [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] may effectively shut down. Plants with such morphological and physiological adaptations are {{strong|xeromorphic}}.&lt;ref name=CIGBT&gt;” Xeromorphic”, The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms, Michael Hickey, Clive King, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Xerophytes such as cacti are capable of withstanding extended periods of dry conditions as they have deep-spreading roots and capacity to store water. the leaves are waxy and thorny that prevents loss of water and moisture. Even their fleshy stems can store water.

Plants absorb water from the soil, which then evaporates from their shoots and leaves; this process is known as [[transpiration]]. In dry environments, a typical [[mesophytic]] plant would evaporate water faster than the rate of water uptake from the soil, leading to [[wilting]] and even death.

Xerophytic plants exhibit a diversity of specialized adaptations to survive in such water-limiting conditions.  They may use water from their own storage, allocate water specifically to sites of new [[Tissue_(biology)#Plant_tissues|tissue]] growth, or lose less water to the atmosphere and so channel a greater proportion of water from the soil to [[photosynthesis]] and growth. Different plant species possess different qualities and mechanisms to manage water supply, enabling them to survive.

[[Cactus|Cacti]] and other [[succulent plant|succulents]] are commonly found in deserts, where there is little rainfall. Other xerophytes, such as certain [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], can survive through both extremely wet and extremely dry periods and can be found in seasonally-moist habitats such as tropical forests, exploiting niches where water supplies are too intermittent for mesophytic plants to survive.  Likewise, [[chaparral]] plants are adapted to [[Mediterranean climate]]s, which have wet winters and dry summers.   

Plants that live under [[Arctic|arctic conditions]] also have a need for xerophytic adaptations, since water is unavailable for uptake when the ground is frozen, such as the European [[resurrection plant]]s ''[[Haberlea|Haberlea rhodopensis]]'' and ''[[Ramonda serbica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-11-01|title=Natural products from resurrection plants: Potential for medical applications|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073497501400041X|journal=Biotechnology Advances|language=en|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1091–1101|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.03.005|pmid=24681091|issn=0734-9750|last1=Gechev|first1=Tsanko S.|last2=Hille|first2=Jacques|last3=Woerdenbag|first3=Herman J.|last4=Benina|first4=Maria|last5=Mehterov|first5=Nikolay|last6=Toneva|first6=Valentina|last7=Fernie|first7=Alisdair R.|last8=Mueller-Roeber|first8=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an environment with very high salinity such as [[mangrove swamp]]s and semi-deserts, water uptake by plants is a challenge due to the high salt ion levels. Besides that, such environments may cause an excess of ions to accumulate in the cells, which is very damaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Wang|first2=Qiuqing|last3=Yu|first3=Mengmeng|last4=Zhang|first4=Yanyan|last5=Wu|first5=Yingbao|last6=Zhang|first6=Hongxia|title=Transgenic salt-tolerant sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) constitutively expressing an Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar Na/H antiporter gene, AtNHX3, accumulates more soluble sugar but less salt in storage roots|journal=Plant, Cell &amp; Environment|date=2008|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1325–1334|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01838.x|pmid=18518917|issn=1365-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halophyte]]s and xerophytes evolved to survive in such environments. Some xerophytes may also be considered halophytes, however, halophytes are not necessarily xerophytes. The succulent xerophyte ''Zygophyllum xanthoxylum'', for example, have specialised protein transporters in their cells which allow storage of excess ions in their vacuole to maintain normal [[cytosol|cytosolic]] pH and ionic composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Guo-Qiang|last2=Wang|first2=Qian|last3=Bao|first3=Ai-Ke|last4=Wang|first4=Suo-Min|title=Amiloride Reduces Sodium Transport and Accumulation in the Succulent Xerophyte Zygophyllum xanthoxylum Under Salt Conditions|journal=Biological Trace Element Research|date=1 March 2011|volume=139|issue=3|pages=356–367|doi=10.1007/s12011-010-8662-9|pmid=20352373|language=English|issn=0163-4984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNair|first=J.B.|date=|title=Hydrophytes, xerophytes and halophytes and the production of alkaloids, cyanogenetic and organic sulphur compounds|url=|journal=Journal of Natural Products|volume=6|pages=1–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many factors which affect water availability, which is the major limiting factor of seed germination, seedling survival, and plant growth. These factors include infrequent raining, intense sunlight and very warm weather leading to faster water evaporation. An extreme environmental pH and high salt content of water also disrupt plants' water uptake.

==Types==
[[File:Cistus albidus in Sainte Lucie Island.jpg|thumb|left|''Cistus albidus'' is a xerophyte which grows in European countries such as  France, and Italy and North African countris like Morocco.]]
[[Succulent plant]]s store water in their stems or leaves. These include plants from the [[Cactaceae]] family, which have round stems and can store a lot of water. The leaves are often [[Vestigiality|vestigial]], as in the case of cacti, wherein the leaves are reduced to spines, or they do not have leaves at all. These include the C4 perennial woody plant, ''[[Haloxylon ammodendron]]'' which is a native of northwest China. 

Non-succulent perennials successfully endure long and continuous shortage of water in the soil. These are hence called 'true xerophytes' or euxerophytes. Water deficiency usually reaches 60–70% of their fresh weight, as a result of which the growth process of the whole plant is hindered during cell elongation. The plants which survive drought are, understandably, small and weak.

[[Ephemeral plant|Ephemerals]] are the 'drought escaping' kind, and not true xerophytes. They do not really endure drought, only escape it. With the onset of rainfall, the plant seeds germinate, quickly grow to maturity, flower, and set seed, i.e., the entire life cycle is completed before the soil dries out again. Most of these plants are small, roundish, dense shrubs represented by species of [[Faboideae|Papilionaceae]], some inconspicuous [[Asteraceae|Compositae]], a few [[Zygophyllaceae]] and some grasses. Water is stored in the [[bulb]]s of some plants, or at below ground level. They may be dormant during drought conditions and are, therefore, known as drought evaders.

Shrubs which grow in arid and semi-arid regions are also xeromorphic. For example, ''[[Caragana]] korshinskii, Artemisia sphaerocephala,'' and ''[[Hedysarum]] scoparium'' are shrubs potent in the semi-arid regions of the northwest China desert. These [[psammophile]] shrubs are not only edible to grazing animals in the area, they also play a vital role in the stabilisation of desert sand dunes. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeng|first1=Yan Jun|last2=Wang|first2=Yan Rong|last3=Zhang|first3=Ju Ming|title=Is reduced seed germination due to water limitation a special survival strategy used by xerophytes in arid dunes?|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=April 2010|volume=74|issue=4|pages=508–511|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bushes, also called semi-shrubs often occur in sandy desert region, mostly in deep sandy soils at the edges of the dunes. One example is the ''Reaumuria soongorica'', a perennial resurrection semi-shrub. Compared to other dominant arid xerophytes, an adult ''R. soongorica'', bush has a strong resistance to water scarcity, hence, it is considered a super-xerophytes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Importance of water conservation ==

If the [[water potential]] (or strictly, water vapour potential) inside a leaf is higher than outside, the water vapour will [[diffusion|diffuse]] out of the leaf down this gradient. This loss of water vapour from the leaves is called [[transpiration]], and the water vapour diffuses through the open [[stomata]]. Transpiration is natural and inevitable for plants; a significant amount of water is lost through this process. However, it is vital that plants living in dry conditions are adapted so as to decrease the size of the open stomata, lower the rate of transpiration, and consequently reduce water loss to the environment. Without sufficient water, plant cells lose [[turgor]].  This is known as [[plasmolysis]]. If the plant loses too much water, it will pass its [[permanent wilting point]], and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plantsinaction.science.uq.edu.au/content/314-turgor-loss-cytorrhysis-and-plasmolysis|title=3.1.4 - Turgor loss, cytorrhysis, and plasmolysis {{!}} Plants in Action|website=plantsinaction.science.uq.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, the rate of transpiration is governed by the number of [[stomata]], stomatal aperture i.e. the size of the stoma opening, leaf area (allowing for more stomata), temperature differential, the relative humidity, the presence of wind or air movement, the light intensity, and  the presence of a waxy cuticle. It is important to note, that whilst it is vital to keep stomata closed, they have to be opened for gaseous exchange in respiration and photosynthesis.

== Morphological adaptations ==

  }}
Xerophytic plants may have similar shapes, forms, and structures and look very similar, even if the plants are not very closely related, through a process called [[convergent evolution]].  For example, some species of cacti (members of the family [[Cactaceae]]), which evolved only in the Americas, may appear similar to [[Euphorbia]]s, which are distributed worldwide. An unrelated species of [[caudiciform]]s plants with swollen bases that are used to store water, may also display some similarities. 

Under conditions of water scarcity, the seeds of different xerophytic plants behave differently, which means that they have different rates of germination since water availability is a major limiting factor. These dissimilarities are due to [[natural selection]] and eco-adaptation as the seeds and plants of each species evolve to suit their surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibañez|first1=A.N.|last2=Passera|first2=C.B.|title=Factors affecting the germination of albaida (Anthyllis cytisoidesL.), a forage legume of the Mediterranean coast|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=February 1997|volume=35|issue=2|pages=225–231|doi=10.1006/jare.1995.0142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduction of surface area ===

Xerophytic plants can have less overall [[surface area]] than other plants, so reducing the area that is exposed to the air and reducing water loss by transpiration and evaporation. They can also have smaller leaves or fewer branches than other plants. An example of leaf surface reduction are the [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] of a cactus, while the effects of compaction and reduction of branching can be seen in the [[barrel cactus|barrel cacti]].  Other xerophytes may have their leaves compacted at the base, as in a [[basal rosette]], which may be smaller than the plant's flower.  This adaptation is exhibited by some ''[[Agave]]'' and ''[[Eriogonum]]'' species, which can be found growing near [[Death Valley]].

=== Forming water vapour-rich environment ===

Some xerophytes have tiny hairs on their surfaces to provide a wind break and reduce air flow, thereby reducing the rate of evaporation.  When a plant surface is covered with tiny hairs, it is called tomentose. Stomata are located in these hairs or in pits to reduce their exposure to wind. This enables them to maintain a humid environment around them. 

In a still, windless environment, the areas under the leaves or spines where transpiration takes place form a small localised environment that is more saturated with water vapour than normal. If this concentration of water vapour is maintained, the external water vapour potential gradient near the stomata is reduced, thus, reducing transpiration. In a windier situation, this localisation is blown away and so the external water vapour gradient remains low, which makes the loss of water vapour from plant stomata easier. Spines and hairs trap a layer of moisture and slows air movement over tissues.

=== Reflective features ===
[[File:Dudleya Brittonii.jpg|thumb|right|The succulent leaves of ''[[Dudleya brittonii]]'' are visibly coated with a 'powdery' white which is the epicuticular wax.]]
The color of a plant, or of the waxes or hairs on its surface, may serve to reflect sunlight and reduce transpiration. An example is the white chalky [[epicuticular wax]] coating of ''[[Dudleya brittonii]]'', which has the highest [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) [[reflectivity]] of any known naturally-occurring biological substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulroy|first=Thomas W.|title=Spectral properties of heavily glaucous and non-glaucous leaves of a succulent rosette-plant|journal=Oecologia|date=1979|volume=38|issue=3|pages=349–357|doi=10.1007/BF00345193|pmid=28309493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuticles ===

Many xerophytic species have thick [[plant cuticle|cuticles]]. Just like human skin, a plant's cuticles are the first line of defense for its aerial parts. As mentioned above, the cuticle contains wax for protection against [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic component|abiotic]] factors. The [[ultrastructure]] of the cuticles varies in different species. Some examples are ''[[Antizoma miersiana]]'', ''[https://www.ispotnature.org/communities/southern-africa/species-dictionary/26483/hermannia-disermifolia Hermannia disermifolia]'' and ''[[Galenia|Galenia africana]]'' which are xerophytes from the same region in [[Namaqualand]], but have different cuticle ultrastructures. 

''A. miersiana'' has thick cuticle as expected to be found on xerophytes, but ''H. disermifolia'' and ''G. africana'' have thin cuticles. Since resources are scarce in arid regions, there is selection for plants having thin and efficient cuticles to limit the nutritional and energy costs for the cuticle construction.

In periods of severe water stress and stomata closure, the cuticle's low water permeability is considered as one of the most vital factor in ensuring the survival of the plant. The rate of transpiration of the cuticles of xerophytes is 25 times lower than that of stomatal transpiration. To give an idea of how low this is, the rate of transpiration of the cuticles of mesophytes is only 2 to 5 times lower than stomatal transpiration.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordaan|first1=A.|last2=Kruger|first2=H.|title=Notes on the cuticular ultrastructure of six xerophytes from southern Africa|journal=South African Journal of Botany|date=February 1998|volume=64|issue=1|pages=82–85|doi=10.1016/S0254-6299(15)30829-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological  adaptations ==

There are many changes that happen on the molecular level when a plant experiences stress. When in heat shock, for example, their [[protein|protein molecule]] structures become unstable, unfold, or reconfigure to become less efficient. Membrane stability will decrease in [[plastid]]s, which is why photosynthesis is the first process to be affected by heat stress.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Turnbull, C. (2017) ''LS1-OB.34 - Plant stress''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the many stresses, xerophytes have the ability to survive and thrive in drought conditions due to their physiological and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] specialties.

[[File:Dudleya pulverulenta 1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dudleya pulverulenta]]'' is called 'chalk lettuce' for its obvious structures. This xerophyte has fleshy succulent leaves and is coated with chalky wax.]]
=== Water storage ===

Some plants can store water in their root structures, trunk structures, stems, and leaves. Water storage in swollen parts of the plant is known as succulence.  A swollen trunk or root at the ground level of a plant is called a [[caudex]] and plants with swollen bases are called [[caudiciform]]s.

=== Production of protective molecules ===

Plants may secrete [[resins]] and [[wax]]es ([[epicuticular wax]]) on their surfaces, which reduce transpiration. Examples are the heavily-scented and flammable resins ([[volatile organic compounds]]) of some [[chaparral]] plants, such as ''[[Malosma laurina]]'', or the chalky wax of ''[[Dudleya pulverulenta]]''. 

In regions continuously exposed to sunlight, UV rays can cause biochemical damage to plants, and eventually lead to [[mutation|DNA mutations]] and damages in the long run. When one of the main molecules involved in photosynthesis, [[photosystem II|photosystem II (PSII)]] is damaged by UV rays, it induces responses in the plant, leading to the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of protectant molecules such as [[flavonoid]]s and more wax. Flavonoids are UV-absorbing and act like sunscreen for the plant. 

[[Heat shock protein|Heat shock proteins (HSPs)]] are a major class of proteins in plants and animals which are synthesised in cells as a response to heat stress. They help prevent protein unfolding and help re-fold denatured proteins. As temperature increases, the HSP protein expression also increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Evaporative cooling ===

Evaporative cooling via transpiration can delay the effects of heat stress on the plant. However, transpiration is very expensive if there is water scarcity, so generally this is not a good strategy for the plants to employ.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Diffrences in Stomata Opening Throughout the Day for C3 plants and CAM plants (1).svg|thumb|Line 1 represents typical mesophytic plants and line 2 represents xerophytes. The stomata of xerophytes are nocturnal and have inverted stomatal rhythm.]]
=== Stomata closure ===

Most plants have the ability to close their stomata at the start of water stress, at least partially, to restrict rates of transpiration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They use signals or [[Plant hormone|hormones]] sent up from the roots and through the transpiration stream. Since roots are the parts responsible for water searching and uptake, they can detect the condition of dry soil. The signals sent are an early warning system - before the water stress gets too severe, the plant will go into water-economy mode.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As compared to other plants, xerophytes have an inverted stomatal rhythm. During the day and especially during mid-day when the sun is at its peak, most stomata of xerophytes are close. Not only do more stomata open at night in the presence of mist or dew, the size of stomatal opening or aperture is larger at night compared to during the day. This phenomenon was observed in xeromorphic species of [[Cactus|Cactaceae]], [[Crassulaceae]], and [[Liliaceae]].

As the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of the plant is covered with water barriers such as [[lignin]] and waxy cuticles, the night opening of the stomata is the main channel for water movement for xerophytes in arid conditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GINDEL|first1=I.|title=THE NOCTURNAL BEHAVIOUR OF XEROPHYTES GROWN UNDER ARID CONDITIONS|journal=New Phytologist|date=April 1970|volume=69|issue=2|pages=399–404|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1970.tb02438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when water is not scarce, the xerophytes ''A. Americana'' and [[pineapple]] plant are found to utilise water more efficiently than mesophytes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Phospholipid saturation ===

The [[cell membrane|plasma membrane of cells]] are made up of lipid molecules called [[phospholipid]]s. These lipids become more fluid when temperature increases. Saturated lipids are more rigid than unsaturated ones i.e. unsaturated lipids becomes fluid more easily than saturated lipids. Plant cells undergo biochemical changes to change their plasma membrane composition to have more saturated lipids to sustain membrane integrity for longer in hot weather.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
 
If the membrane integrity is compromised, there will be no effective barrier between the internal cell environment and the outside. Not only does this mean the plant cells are susceptible to disease-causing bacteria and mechanical attacks by herbivores, the cell could not perform its normal processes to continue living - the cells and thus the whole plant will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeil|first1=Paul L.|last2=Steinhardt|first2=Richard A.|title=Loss, Restoration, and Maintenance of Plasma Membrane Integrity|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=7 April 1997|volume=137|issue=1|pages=1–4|issn=0021-9525|pmid=9105031|pmc=2139853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xanthopyll cycle ===

Light stress can be tolerated by dissipating excess energy as heat through the [[xanthophyll#Xanthophyll_cycle|xanthophyll cycle]]. Violaxanthin and zeaxanthin are [[carotenoid]] molecules within the [[chloroplast]]s called xanthophylls. Under normal conditions, violaxanthin channels light to photosynthesis. However, high light levels promote the reversible conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. These two molecules are photo-protective molecules. 

Under high light, it is unfavourable to channel extra light into photosynthesis because excessive light may cause damage to the plant proteins. Zeaxanthin dissociates light-channelling from the photosynthesis reaction - light energy in the form of [[photon]]s will not be transmitted into the photosynthetic pathway anymore.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== CAM mechanism ===

}}

Stomata closure not only restricts the movement of water out of the plant, another consequence of the phenomenon is that [[carbon dioxide]] influx or intake into the plant is also reduced. As photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide as a substrate to produce sugar for growth, it is vital that the plant has a very efficient [[photosynthesis]] system which maximises the utilisation of the little carbon dioxide the plant gets. 

Many succulent xerophytes employ the [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] or better known as CAM photosynthesis. It is also dubbed the "dark" carboxylation mechanism because plants in arid regions collect carbon dioxide at night when the stomata open, and store the gases to be used for photosynthesis in the presence of light during the day. Although most xerophytes are quite small, this mechanism allows a positive carbon balance in the plants to sustain life and growth. Prime examples of plants employing the CAM mechanism are the [[pineapple]], ''[[Agave Americana]]'', and ''[[Aeonium haworthii]]''. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Although some xerophytes perform photosynthesis using this mechanism, the majority of plants in arid regions still employ the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis pathways. A small proportion of desert plants even use a collaborated C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CAM pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atia|first1=Abdallah|last2=Rabhi|first2=Mokded|last3=Debez|first3=Ahmed|last4=Abdelly|first4=Chedly|last5=Gouia|first5=Houda|last6=Haouari|first6=ChirazChaffei|last7=Smaoui|first7=Abderrazak|title=Ecophysiological aspects in 105 plants species of saline and arid environments in Tunisia|journal=Journal of Arid Land|date=1 December 2014|volume=6|issue=6|pages=762–770|doi=10.1007/s40333-014-0028-2|language=English|issn=1674-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delayed germination and growth ===

The surrounding humidity and moisture right before and during seed germination play an important role in the germination regulation in arid conditions.
An evolutionary strategy employed by desert xerophytes is to reduce the rate of seed germination. By slowing the shoot growth, less water is consumed for growth and transpiration. Thus, the seed and plant can utilise the water available from short-lived rainfall for a much longer time compared to mesophytic plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resurrection plants and seeds ===

[[File:Unechte Rose von Jericho.ogv|thumb|upright=0.8|left|A ''[[Anastatica|Rose of Jericho]]'' plant in dormancy re-flourishes when its roots are placed in a bowl of water.]]
[[File:Arbolchañar.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|right|A ''Geoffroea decorticans'' tree is both a winter and drought deciduous tree.]]

During dry times, resurrection plants look dead, but are actually alive. Some xerophytic plants may stop growing and go dormant, or change the allocation of the products of photosynthesis from growing new leaves to the roots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_112/Summaries/Plant_Adaptations.html|title=Plant Adaptations|publisher=University of New Mexico|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104014524/http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_112/Summaries/Plant_Adaptations.html|archivedate=January 4, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plants evolved to be able to coordinately switch off their photosynthetic mechanism without destroying the molecules involved in photosynthesis.

Seeds may be modified to require an excessive amount of water before germinating, so as to ensure a sufficient water supply for the seedling's survival.  An example of this is the [[California poppy]], whose seeds lie dormant during drought and then germinate, grow, flower, and form seeds within four weeks of rainfall.

=== Leaf wilting and abscission ===

If the water supply is not enough despite the employment of other water-saving strategies, the leaves will start to collapse and wilt due to water evaporation still exceeding water supply. Leaf loss ([[abscission]]) will be activated in more severe stress conditions. [[drought deciduous|Drought deciduous plants]] may drop their leaves in times of dryness. 

The wilting of leaves is a reversible process, however, abscission is irreversible. Shedding leaves is not favourable to plants because when water is available again, they would have to spend resources to produces new leaves which are needed for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Modification of environment ==

The [[leaf litter]] on the ground around a plant can provide an evaporative barrier to prevent water loss.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  A plant’s root mass itself may also hold organic material that retains water, as in the case of the arrowweed (''[[Pluchea sericea]]'').

[[File:Agave americana 3zz.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Agave Americana]]'' is a versatile xerophyte. All parts of the plant can be used either for aesthetics, for consumption, or in traditional medicine.]]

[[Land degradation]] is a major threat to many countries such as China and Uzbekistan. The major impacts include the loss of soil productivity and stability, as well as the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] due to reduced [[vegetation]] consumed by animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Combating Desertification in Asia, Africa and the Middle East|last=Toderich|first=K.

Xerophytic plants are used widely to prevent [[desertification]] and for fixation of sand dunes. In fact, in northwest China, the seeds of three shrub species namely ''[[Caragana]] korshinskii, Artemisia sphaerocephala, and'' ''[[Hedysarum]] scoparium'' are dispersed across the region. These shrubs have the additional property of being palatable to grazing animals such as sheep and camels. ''H. scoparium'' is under protection in China due to it being a major endangered species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Haloxylon ammodendron]]'' and ''[[Zygophyllum]] xanthoxylum'' are  also plants that form fixed dunes.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J., Duan, J., Wang, S., Zhao, M., &amp; Yang, Z. (2013). Na compound fertilizer promotes growth and enhances drought resistance of the succulent xerophyte ''Haloxylon ammodendron''. ''Soil Science And Plant Nutrition'', ''59''(2), 289-299. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2012.763183&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

A more well-known xerophyte is the succulent plant ''[[Agave americana]]''. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant popular across the globe. Agave nectar is garnered from the plant and is consumed as a substitute for sugar or honey. In Mexico, the plant's sap is usually fermented to produce an alcoholic beverage.

Many xerophytic plants produce colourful vibrant flowers and are used for decoration and ornamental purposes in gardens and in homes. Although they have adaptations to live in stressful weather and conditions, these plants thrive when well-watered and in tropical temperatures. ''[[Phlox]] sibirica''  is rarely seen in cultivation and does not flourish in areas without long exposure to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belaeva|first=Tatiana Nikolaevna|last2=Butenkova|first2=Alina Nikolaevna|last3=Astafurova|first3=Tatiana Petrovna|title=Phlox sibirica L. in South Siberia|url=http://www.biotech-asia.org/absdoic.php?snoid=1488|journal=Biosciences Biotechnology Research Asia|volume=11|issue=Spl Edition Nov. 14|pages=371–376|doi=10.13005/bbra/1488|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study has shown that xerophytic plants which employ the [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM mechanism]] can solve micro-climate problems in buildings of humid countries. The CAM photosynthetic pathway absorbs the humidity in small spaces, effectively making the plant such as ''[[Sansevieria trifasciatas]]'' a natural indoor humidity absorber. Not only will this help with cross-ventilation, but lowering the surrounding humidity increases the thermal comfort of people in the room. This is especially important in East Asian countries where both humidity and temperature are high. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303211074|title=Sansevieria trifasciatas, xerophyte as indoor humidity absorber of small type residences 1|journal=Ecology, Environment and Conservation|last=Prijambada|first=Erlina|last2=Sudikno|first2=Antariksa|last3=Murti Nugroho|first3=Agung|last4=Leksono|first4=Amin|date=2016-03-01|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{multiple image

Herbal extracts from plants of the [[Craterostigma]] genus are traditionally used by Kenyan natives as remedies to reduce inflammation and to relieve pain relating to the muscle and joints. However, scientific research on this practice revealed that these herbal extracts could cause [[hyperglasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Mwonjoria|last2=Aliyu|first2=Umar|last3=Kevin|first3=Juma|last4=Titus|first4=Kahiga|last5=Piero|first5=Ngugi|last6=David|first6=Mburu|last7=Alphonse|first7=Wanyonyi|last8=Charles|first8=Githinji|last9=Joseph|first9=Ngeranwa|title=Anti-inflammatory activity of craterostigma pumilum (hochst) is associated with hyperalgesia|journal=International Journal of Pharmacology and Toxicology|date=25 August 2016|volume=4|issue=2|pages=169|doi=10.14419/ijpt.v4i2.6497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years has seen interests in resurrection plants other than their ability to withstand extreme dryness. The metabolites, sugar alcohols, and sugar acids present in these plants may be applied as natural products for medicinal purposes and in biotechnology. During desiccation, the levels of the sugars sucrose, raffinose, and galactinol increase; they may have a crucial role in protecting the cells against damage caused by [[reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen species (ROS)]] and oxidative stress. Besides having anti-oxidant properties, other compounds extracted from some resurrection plants showed [[antifungal|anti-fungal]] and [[antibiotics|anti-bacterial]] properties. A [[glycoside]] found in ''[[Haberlea rhodopensis]]'' called myconoside is extracted and used in cosmetic creams as a source of anti-oxidant as well as to increase elasticity of the human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dell’Acqua|first1=G.|last2=Schweikert|first2=K.|title=Skin benefits of a myconoside-rich extract from resurrection plant Haberlea rhodopensis|journal=International Journal of Cosmetic Science|date=April 2012|volume=34|issue=2|pages=132–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2494.2011.00692.x|pmid=22023081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are other molecules in these plants that may be of benefit, it is still much less studied than the [[primary metabolite]]s mentioned above. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural products from resurrection plants: Potential for medical applications|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=1 November 2014|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1091–1101|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.03.005|pmid=24681091|language=en|issn=0734-9750|last1=Gechev|first1=Tsanko S.|last2=Hille|first2=Jacques|last3=Woerdenbag|first3=Herman J.|last4=Benina|first4=Maria|last5=Mehterov|first5=Nikolay|last6=Toneva|first6=Valentina|last7=Fernie|first7=Alisdair R.|last8=Mueller-Roeber|first8=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yerköprü Waterfall''' ({{lang-tr|Yerköprü Şelalesi}}) is a waterfall in [[Mersin Province]], southern Turkey. It is a registered [[natural monument]].

==Location and access==
The waterfall is located to the north of [[Kuskan]] village of [[Gülnar]] [[ilçe]] (district) in Mersin Province,&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt; But it is accessible from Mut, Mersin|Mut ilçe. It is situated to the southeast of [[Gezende Dam]]. Its distance to Mut is {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt;

In early March 2013, the road leading to the waterfall was blocked by rocks due to a landslide.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h"/&gt; After almost two years, construction works began for access to the waterfall on the other bank of the creek. It can be reached by a wooden staircase down from a bridge over the creek.&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

The site is a popular tourist attraction . Admission is collected for visitors and vehicles.&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;

==Waterfall==
The waterfall is on the Ermenek Creek, a tributary of the [[Göksu River]].&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt; It was formed in a deep canyon by a narrow spring emerged in [[fault (geology)|fault]]s of [[Cretaceous]]-period [[limestone]] formation rocks, which are about 110 million years old.&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt; It is fed by an underground water tunnel of about {{convert|200|-|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} length,&lt;ref name="mu"/&gt; and {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} width, a cave with [[stalactite]]s and a rich vegetation. Waters from the Gezende Dam join the spring water in the cave.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;

In 2001, the waterfall, covering an area of {{convert|1115.72|da|sqft|abbr=on}}, was registered as a natural monument by the Nature Reserve and Nature Parks Administration of the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]].&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The '''Zirconian''' is  the second [[Era (geology)|Era]] within the [[Hadean]] [[Eon (geology)|Eon]] in a proposed revision of the [[Precambrian]] time scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gradstein | first=Felix M. | last2=Ogg | first2=James G. | last3=Hilgen | first3=Frits J. | title=On The Geologic Time Scale | journal=Newsletters on Stratigraphy | publisher=Schweizerbart | volume=45 | issue=2 | date=1 March 2012 | issn=0078-0421 | doi=10.1127/0078-0421/2012/0020 | pages=171–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted 373 million years from the end of the [[Chaotian (geology)|Chaotian]] Era {{Ma|4404}} to the beginning of [[Eoarchean]] Era {{Ma|4031}}. The Zirconian follows the Chaotian Era and its beginning is chronometrically set at 4.404 ± 0.008 [[Gya]]. This corresponds to the age of the first occurrence of [[Hadean zircon]]s in the [[Jack Hills]] in [[Western Australia]] ([[Yilgarn craton]]). The end of the Zirconian Era and the transition to the [[Acastan]] Period (the earliest period of the [[Archean]] Eon and [[Eoarchean]] Era) occurred with the appearance of the [[Acasta Gneiss|oldest rock]] at 4.031 ± 0.003 [[Gya]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Zircon microscope.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Zircon]] crystal with magmatic Anwachssäumen under the light microscope]]
The term ''Zirconian'' is derived from the mineral [[zircon]], since it is the only substance that is preserved from this early period. An alternative proposal for the name of this era is "'''Jack Hillsian Era'''".

== Meaning ==
The first 196 million years after the formation of [[Age of Earth|Earth]], left no solid trace, except for the formation of the [[Moon]]. This time is termed the [[Chaotian (geology)|Chaotian]] Era. The first datable solid Earth minerals, zircons, mark the start of the Zirconian Era. The oldest known crystal could be dated to 4,404 ± 8 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilde |first=SA | year = 2001 | title = Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gya ago | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6817 | pages = 175-178 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in [[metasedimentary]] rock on [[Erawandoo Hills]] in the Jack Hills of [[Narryer Gneiss Terrane]] in Western Australia. The 4.4 [[Gya]] is the limiting age, and zircons this old are very rare. But from 4.2 to 4.1 Gya they are already common. The bulk of the zircons in Narryer Gneiss Terrane date much later, from 3.75 to 3.5 Gya.

== Occurrence ==
The [[zircon]]s are limited only to Archean [[craton]]s. In the Yilgarn craton [[quartzite]]s of [[Southern Cross Terrane]] also contains zircons with an age of 4.35-3.13 [[Gya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wyche | first=S. | last2=Nelson | first2=D. R. | last3=Riganti | first3=A. | title=4350-3130 Ma detrital zircons in the Southern Cross Granite-Greenstone Terrane, Western Australia: implications for the early evolution of the Yilgarn Craton | journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences | publisher=Wiley | volume=51 | issue=1 | year=2004 | issn=0812-0099 | doi=10.1046/j.1400-0952.2003.01042.x | pages=31–45 |display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the [[Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt]] of the [[Superior Craton]] is of Zirconian age, its proposed age of 4.28 [[Gya]] is however still controversial. The end of the Zirconian Era is at 4.031 [[Gya]], marked by the [[Acasta Gneiss]] of [[Slave craton]] and it is likely that its [[protolith]] is older. In 2006, a single zircon crystal in Acasta Gneiss was dated to 4.2 [[Gya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Iizuka | first=Tsuyoshi | last2=Horie | first2=Kenji | last3=Komiya | first3=Tsuyoshi | last4=Maruyama | first4=Shigenori | last5=Hirata | first5=Takafumi | last6=Hidaka | first6=Hiroshi | last7=Windley | first7=Brian F. | title=4.2 Ga zircon xenocryst in an Acasta gneiss from northwestern Canada: Evidence for early continental crust | journal=Geology | publisher=Geological Society of America | volume=34 | issue=4 | year=2006 | issn=0091-7613 | doi=10.1130/g22124.1 | page=245 |display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
