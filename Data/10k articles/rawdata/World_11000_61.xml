'''Aquatopia''' was a popular educational attraction in central [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. It used to feature a set of aquariums, along with recreations of other marine habitats, including swamps, rain forests, river deltas, and coral reefs. Aquatopia also included a number of special exhibits covering sharks, nautilus, and mysteries of the deep. The multi-story attraction was located on Koningin Astridplein, opposite [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station]]. It had {{Convert|1000000|l}} of water.

Although the entrance to [[Antwerp Zoo]] is also located very close by, facing the same square (Astridplein), the zoo was not affiliated with Aquatopia. 

Aquatopia closed on January 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquatopia.be/en/news/closing-8th-january&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cherry Ripe''' is the nickname of a discontinued [[shortwave]] [[numbers station]] that used several bars from the English [[folk song]] "[[Cherry Ripe (song)|Cherry Ripe]]" as an [[interval signal]]. The station was believed to be operated by the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and to have emanated from Australia. It was thought to have previously broadcast from [[Guam]]. It consisted of an electronically synthesised English-accented female voice reading groups of five numbers, e.g. "3-5-7-6-1". The final number in each group was spoken at a higher pitch. It is likely that the station was used to communicate messages to undercover agents operating in other countries, to be decoded using a [[one-time pad]].

Cherry Ripe had a more famous and much more active Middle-Eastern cousin, the [[Lincolnshire Poacher (numbers station)|Lincolnshire Poacher]], which also used several bars from the English folk song of the same name as its interval signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spynumbers.com/profiles/index.html?ENIGMA=E3 |title=Spy Number Station Profile |website=Spynumbers.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincolnshire Poacher had long been suspected as being operated by Britain and had been detected as emanating from [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[RAF Akrotiri|Akrotiri]] on [[Cyprus]]. Apart from the interval signal, the format and voice of the two stations was identical, though as of July 2008 the Lincolnshire Poacher appears to no longer be active. In September 2009, Cherry Ripe moved their transmitter to [[Humpty Doo]], Australia.

'''DR P1''' ‚Äì in Denmark normally referred to as simply '''P1''' ‚Äì  is a Danish [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] operated by the [[DR (broadcaster)|Danish Broadcasting Corporation]]. P1 has evolved into a pure voice channel with a focus on news, documentaries, political debates, education, general cultural, scientific and social programming.

Since 1 November 2011 P1 has had to share its nationwide FM channel frequencies with [[DR P2|P2]] since DR lost the rights to continue the use of the fourth nationwide FM channel which P2 had been using.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=P2 flytter ind hos P1 p√• FM|url=https://www.dr.dk/presse/p2-flytter-ind-hos-p1-paa-fm|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; P1 broadcats on the FM channel during daytime. Both channels continued as two separate channels digitally on [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] and [[Internet radio|online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=P1 og P2 forts√¶tter som digital radio|url=http://www.dr.dk/Temaer/digitalradio/artikler/20120305204950.htm|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The station was established in 1925 with the start of operations of '''Statsradiofonien'''. In 1959 Statsradiofonien changed its name to '''Danmarks Radio''', and to '''DR''' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIDSLINJE: Fra Statsradiofonien til DR|url=http://www.billedbladet.dk/kendte/danmark/tv/dr/tidslinje-fra-statsradiofonien-til-dr|website=Billedbladet.dk|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1931 the station has had its own identifying pause signal and chime called ''Dr√∏mte mig en dr√∏m i nat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DRs pausesignal har v√¶ret i √¶teren i 80 √•r|url=https://www.dr.dk/presse/drs-pausesignal-har-vaeret-i-aeteren-i-80-aar|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been modernized several times since, most recently by [[Thomas Blachman]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blachman st√•r bag P1's nye lyd|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/medier/art4845179/Blachman-st%C3%A5r-bag-P1s-nye-lyd|accessdate=6 April 2017|publisher=Politiken|date=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004 P1 started 24-hour broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Karsten|title=Taleradio 24 timer i d√∏gnet med ny P1 Nat|url=http://www.radionytarkiv.dk/artikel/default.asp?id=8895|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=12 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas earlier it rebroadcast [[DR P3]] programming from midnight until 6 a.m.

On 1 October 2017 P1 became available on [[Digital_audio_broadcasting#DAB.2B_2|DAB+]] radio when a nationwide switch-over took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Overgangen til DAB+ udsat til 1. oktober 2017|url=http://danskemedier.dk/nyhed/overgangen-til-dab-udsat-til-1-oktober-2017/|accessdate=8 April 2017|agency=Danske Medier|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Drexciya''''' is a [[Ghana]]ian 2010 short documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
'''''Drexciya''''' is a Ghanaian 2010 short documentary film, produced by Obibini Pictures and directed by [[Akosua Adoma Owusu]]. ''Drexciya'' portrays an abandoned public swimming facility located in Accra, Ghana set on the Riviera. The Riviera at one time was an upscale development, consisting of luxury high-rises and five star hotels. Since the 1970s, the Riviera has fallen into a disheveled state.

This short documentary was inspired by afro-futurist myths propagated by the underground Detroit-based band [[Drexciya]]. They suggest that Drexciya is a mythical underwater subcontinent populated by the unborn children of African women thrown overboard during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. These children have adapted and evolved to breathe underwater.

== Awards ==
* T√°nger 2011
* Menci√≥n Especial FCAT 2011
* Guanajuato International Film Festival 2011

'''''Fish Above Sea Level''''' is an upcoming drama film directed and written by [[Hazim Bitar]]. Leading Jordanian film critic Adnan Madanat called the film "The best Jordanian feature film."

== Synopsis ==
Fish Above Sea Level is about Talal (Rabee Zureikat) a young Ammani professional, who discovers upon his father's death that he is penniless. His late father, in an attempt to shore up his failing investments, mortgaged the family house. Talal has few days to save the family house in [[Amman]] from foreclosure. His only way out is to sell a farm house once owned by his late father in a village by the [[Dead Sea]] with a dark past. At the village he meets Dawoud (Abdallah Dghemaat) a young farmer who lives in the farm house. Before Talal can do anything with the farm house, Dawoud's approval is essential.

The '''Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative''' ''(GRLI)'' is a [[non-profit]] community of [[business]]es as well as [[business school]]s and [[learning institution|educational institution]]s. Based in [[Belgium]], [[Brussels]], its purpose is to catalyse the development of globally responsible leadership and practice in organisations and society worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/about/vision-mission/|title=Vision &amp; Mission|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GRLI was founded in 2004 and counts numerous&lt;!--769 according to LinkedIn, but not verifiable elsewhere so far--&gt; organisations that are its partners and members.&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/globally-responsible-leadership-initiative-grli-|title=Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative (GRLI)|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its strategic partners are the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] (EFMD) and the [[United Nations Global Compact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/network/strategic-partners/|title=Strategic Partners|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and Role ==
The mission of GRLI "to catalyze the development of globally responsible leadership and practice worldwide" is in line with the view promoted by GRLI that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/resources/grli-brief/|title=GRLI In Brief|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The management challenge for the 21st Century is to create resilient societies, [[Sustainability|sustainable]] economies and a healthy environment in which all human beings can flourish and prosper. This calls for individual and collective [[leadership]] that strives not to be the best in the world but the best for the world."

The GRLI aims at building a world where leaders contribute to the creation of economic and societal progress in a globally responsible and sustainable way. A starting point for global leadership includes, according to GRLI, fairness, freedom, honesty, humanity, tolerance, transparency, responsibility and solidarity, and sustainability.&lt;ref name="RascheKell2010-p177"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andreas Rasche|author2=Georg Kell|title=The United Nations Global Compact: Achievements, Trends and Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jxlPRKnh3AC&amp;pg=PA177|date=16 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14553-4|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a resource for [[business education]] for cultivating leadership [[integrity]],&lt;ref name="Chandler2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C.

It also cooperates with institutions of [[higher education]] to further develop their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/programs/globally-responsible-leadership-initiative|title=Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative|publisher=Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace &amp; World Affairs|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative has catalysed the creation of two new academic journals: the ''Journal of Global Responsibility'' and the ''Sustainability, Accounting, Management and Policy Journal''.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/affiliates.htm?id=jgr|title=Journal of Global Responsibility|publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing]]|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/affiliates.htm?id=sampj|title=Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GRLI, in partnership with ''Principles for Responsible Management Education'' (PRME) and other networks, has given rise to several projects including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/2016/10/04/sp-agreement/|title=Leading global networks initiate Collaboratory for responsible management education|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Sulitest ‚Äì an online sustainability literacy test developed and promoted by [[KEDGE Business School]] in France,
* the AIM2Flourish global learning initiative ‚Äì a global initiative steering future business leaders towards achieving the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aim2flourish.com/pages/about|title=Share Your AIM2Flourish Nominations Ideas|publisher=AIM2Flourish|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an online platform for sharing positive stories on business as an agent for world benefit, championed by the [[Weatherhead School of Management]] at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, USA;
* the 50+20 Agenda ‚Äì a vision and global movement focused on "transforming management education in order to serve people, the planet and profit".

== History ==
The GRLI was founded in 2004 by the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] and the [[United Nations Global Compact]].&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt; The initiative's 2005 founding report identified a need for deep systemic change in business, recognizing that this change "needed to take place at the personal, organizational and systemic levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grli.org/resources/globally-responsible-leadership-call-engagement/|title=Globally Responsible Leadership ‚Äì A call for engagement|publisher=GRLI|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded with the  purpose of developing a next generation of globally responsible leaders through the development and support of projects and initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grli.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GRLI-Call-for-Action-English-2009-ISBN-978-1-871992-53-3.pdf The Globally Responsible Leader.

'''Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV''' ('''HbbTV''') is both an industry standard ([[ETSI]] TS 102 796&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.com/2011/09/28/wtf_is_hbbtv/page2.html|title=WTF is... HbbTV?|work=reghardware.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and promotional initiative for hybrid digital TV to harmonise the [[broadcast]], [[IPTV]], and [[Internet access|broadband]] delivery of entertainment to the end consumer through connected TVs ([[smart TV]]s) and [[set-top box]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbbtv.org HbbTV website introduction] accessed August 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The HbbTV Association, comprising [[digital broadcasting]] and [[Internet]] industry companies, has established a standard for the delivery of broadcast TV and broadband TV to the home, through a single [[user interface]], creating an open platform as an alternative to proprietary technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.hbbtv.org/news-events/hbbtv-association-publishes-specification-for-operator-applications/ |title=HbbTV Association Publishes Specification for Operator Applications |publisher=HbbTV Association |date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products and services using the HbbTV standard can operate over different broadcasting technologies, such as [[satellite television|satellite]], [[cable television|cable]], or [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] networks.

HbbTV can show [[digital television]] content from a number of different sources including traditional [[Broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], Internet, and connected devices in the home. To watch hybrid digital TV, consumers will need a hybrid IPTV [[set-top box]] with a range of input connectors, including [[Ethernet]] as well as at least one [[Antenna tuner|tuner]] for receiving broadcast TV signals. The tuner in a hybrid set-top box can be [[digital terrestrial television]] ([[DVB-T]], [[DVB-T2]]), [[digital cable]] ([[DVB-C]], [[DVB-C|DVB-C2]]) and digital satellite ([[DVB-S]], [[DVB-S2]]).

==History==
The HbbTV Consortium (later HbbTV Association) was born in February 2009 from the French '''H4TV''' project and the '''German HTML profil''' project. HbbTV was first demonstrated in 2009, in France by [[France T√©l√©visions]] and two developers of Set Top Box technologies, Inverto Digital Labs of Luxembourg, and Pleyo of France, for the Roland Garros tennis sport event on a DTT transmission and an IP connection and in Germany using the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellite at [[Astra 19.2¬∞E|19.2¬∞ east]] during the [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|IFA]] and [[International Broadcasting Convention|IBC]] exhibitions.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=August 27, 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, in an email sent on behalf of the HbbTV Consortium steering group, supporters of the consortium were invited to become full members. The transitional arrangements towards the opening of membership would involve withdrawal of a number of privileges, including participation in meetings and contribution to further versions of the specification, from supporters that did not sign up. The cost of membership was around ‚Ç¨7,000 for the first year.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Clover.

In June 2014, the HbbTV Association merged with the [[Open IPTV Forum]], a similar industry organisation for end-to-end Internet Protocol television ([[IPTV]]) services formed in 2007, which worked closely with the HbbTV initiative on browser and media specifications for network-connected televisions and set-top boxes. The two initiatives were combined under the HbbTV Association‚Äôs banner because the markets for IPTV, [[Over-the-top content|OTT]] and hybrid broadcast and broadband TV are converging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/open-iptv-forum-and-hbbtv-association-merge-their-activities-263418211.html ''Open IPTV Forum and HbbTV Association Merge their Activities''], PR Newswire, June 17, 2014. Retrieved February 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 it was announced that the Smart TV Alliance, founded in 2012 by [[LG Electronics]], [[Panasonic]], [[Toshiba]] and [[TP Vision]], was to merge with HbbTV, extending the scope of the HbbTV specification to address [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top]] services and to streamline standards. The merger is expected to be finalised within a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2016/09/01/hbbtv-association-joins-forces-with-smart-tv-alliance/ ''HbbTV Association joins forces with Smart TV Alliance''] Broadband TV News, September 1, 2016. Retrieved October 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and consumer products==
Services delivered through HbbTV include enhanced [[teletext]], [[Catch-up tv|catch-up services]], [[video-on-demand]], [[EPG]], interactive advertising, personalisation, voting, games, [[social networking]], and other multimedia applications.

At the May 2010 Broadcast and Beyond Conference in London, Thomas Wrede, VP Product Management Media at SES, said that he expected HbbTV devices to be launched commercially from June 2010 with a consumer market introduction at the IFA consumer electronics trade fair in Berlin in September 2010. Wrede also noted that Humax and Videoweb both had conformant products and that at the recent ANGA Cable trade fair in Cologne, 12 manufacturers exhibited HbbTV devices, with another six working on product introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Mann. [http://www.advanced-television.com/2010/may17_may21.htm#f2 ''HbbTV set for commercial launch''], Advanced-television.com, May 21, 2010. Retrieved May 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
HbbTV devices enables consumers to view all of these advanced services on their TV, via a single device. In addition to a broader range of content from TV providers ‚Äì ranging from traditional broadcast TV, video on-demand and catch-up TV services, like [[BBC iPlayer]] ‚Äì hybrid digital TV also provides consumers with access to [[user-generated content]] either stored on an external [[hard drive]], or [[cloud storage]], and to a range of advanced interactive services and [[Internet]] applications.

Hybrid set-top boxes are increasingly commonplace amongst [[pay-TV]] operators, as they look to meet the changing media consumption trends for more video content, advanced interactivity and internet applications, like [[social networking]]. Operators like [[n]], a division of ITI Neovision in [[Poland]], and [[Telekom Austria]] are two of the leaders in the deployment of hybrid set-top boxes. The 2010 IPTV World Forum Awards recognized a hybrid solution as the best  interactive TV service/application: the solution, developed by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]], is the first [[three-way hybrid]] platform that enables content delivered via [[Satellite]], [[Terrestrial television|Terrestrial]] and [[Ethernet]] networks to be viewed on a television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvover.net/2010/03/26/IPTV+World+Series+Awards+2010+Winners+Announced.aspx|title=IPTV World Series Awards 2010 Winners Announced - TVover.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard ==

As well as helping consumers/viewers, the introduction of the HbbTV standard is of benefit to both equipment manufacturers and content providers who at the moment have to produce hardware or content specific to each country to meet the de facto standard in that country. The establishment of a unified European HbbTV standard means "content owners and application developers can write once and deploy to many countries".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Baker. [http://www.antplc.blogspot.com ''European initiative merges television with the power of the internet'']. ANT Software video blog August 27, 2009. Retrieved September 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The HbbTV specification was developed by industry members of the consortium and is based on elements of existing standards and web technologies including the [[Open IPTV Forum]],&lt;ref name="advanced"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advanced-television.com/2012/12/05/oipf-commissions-digital-tv-labs-test-suite/|accessdate=14 January 2013|title=OIPF commissions Digital TV Labs test suite|publisher=Advanced-Television.com|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consumer Electronics Association|CEA]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], and [[W3C]].&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] General Assembly has given its support to the HbbTV initiative and described the technology as "one of the most exciting developments in the media today".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/12/07/ebu-general-assembly-backs-hbb/''EBU General Assembly backs HBB'']. ''Broadband TV News'' December 7, 2009. Retrieved January 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard specification has been submitted by the end of November 2009 to [[ETSI]], who published it under reference ETSI TS 102 796 in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/102796/01.01.01_60/ts_102796v010101p.pdf TS 102 796 : "Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV"], on the [[ETSI]] website&lt;/ref&gt; There is an accompanying Test Suite that provides a set of test material to test HbbTV device implementations, suitable for manufacturers of devices, including software and hardware components that implement the HbbTV specification (ETSI TS 102 796 v1.1.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbbtv.org/pages/about_hbbtv/hbbtv_test_suite.php|title=HbbTV Test Suite|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012 [http://www.eurofins-digitaltesting.com/test-solutions/consumer-device-testing/hbbtv/ Eurofins Digital Testing (then Digital TV Labs)] became the first Registered Test Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins-digitaltesting.com/test-solutions/consumer-device-testing/hbbtv/|title=Digital TV Labs - Digital TV Labs Is The First Official HbbTV Test Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applications for HbbTV are HTML-based, making use of [[HTML5]] and the [[CE-HTML]] user interface language,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Briel.

In September 2017 the HbbTV Association announced the publication of its IPTV specification by ETSI as TS 103 555. This specification builds on HbbTV 2.0 and defines how audio-visual content delivered by an IPTV service can be presented on HbbTV terminals (such as set-top boxes and televisions) - both hybrid terminals with an IP connection and an RF-based broadcast connection, and pure IPTV terminals with only an IP connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Association|date=September 26, 2017 |url=https://www.hbbtv.org/news-events/hbbtv-association-announces-publication-of-iptv-specification|title=HbbTV Association Announces Publication of IPTV Specification|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, FOX TV and Kanal7 launched its HbbTV EPG app (Fox'da ne var?, Kanal7 yayƒ±n akisi) in 2016 and 2017 provided by Turkish HBBTV company Admongrel. Service was deployed with help of Castoola HbbTV platform.

In 2017 first interactive preroll advertisement campaign (Bosch advertisement) was launched by Admongrel, Adform and Kanal7.

In December 2017, the BBC launched a UK nationwide HbbTV broadcast service. The service provides users the opportunity to launch connected TV applications from broadcast as well as offering broadcast TV applications for radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2017-12-bbc-hbbtv-interactive-tv|title=The BBC Launches the First HbbTV Service in the UK|date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
Freeview New Zealand launched its HbbTV platform in New Zealand in July 2015, under the registered trade mark name "FreeviewPlus", with their DVB-T service (Freeview|HD); followed by an extension to the DVB-S service (Freeview Satellite) in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Smarter Way To Watch TV with FreeviewPlus|url=http://www.freeviewnz.tv/news/smarter-way-to-watch-tv-with-freeviewplus.aspx|work=Freeview|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western Asia and Middle East ===

Saudi Arabia had launched HbbTV services by October 2014.&lt;ref name="broadbandtvnews.com"/&gt;
In early 2015, several broadcasters in Turkey have reportedly begun using the HbbTV platform and services provided by Admongrel &lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/01/13/hbbtv-breakthrough-in-turkey/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Locations ===

HbbTV is being reviewed and tested, with interest from US, Argentina, Japan, China (which is conducting a trial), Malaysian Broadcasters (where DVB-T2 broadcasting will soon start) and Singapore (where Mediacorp is introducing its service through Toggle).

== HbbTV set-top boxes ==
Since the beginning of 2010 a new generation of advanced HbbTV [[IPTV]] set-top box has emerged in the UK with the advent of [[DVB-T2]] services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeview.co.uk/blog/?p=293&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVB-T2]] [[Antenna tuner|tuner]]s enable the reception of [[free-to-air]] terrestrial [[high-definition video|high-definition]] programmes to be received in around twelve areas of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a182608/bbc-arqiva-outline-dtt-hd-upgrade-plans.html|title=BBC, Arqiva outline DTT HD upgrade plans|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High definition digital terrestrial services have encouraged a range of device manufacturers to launch new hybrid set-top boxes for the UK consumer retail market. Some of these companies have launched devices that, in addition to allowing traditional broadcast and IP-delivered services to be received, have an integrated [[smart-card]] slot that allows consumers to receive encrypted [[Premium television]] services including sports and movies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techradar.com/news/home-cinema/high-definition/freeview-hd-the-definitive-list-of-boxes-680661&lt;/ref&gt;

Such boxes enable the aggregation of traditional linear TV broadcasts with video delivered via both managed (cable) and unmanaged [[IP network]]s (the internet). This allows viewers to view broadcast television and internet video on their flat screen TVs, alongside advanced interactive services, such as [[video on demand]], [[internet]] browsing, and [[time shifting|time-shifted TV]].

A hybrid IPTV platform helps operators increase [[average revenue per user]] (ARPU), whilst eliminating expensive duplication in network infrastructure investment. IPTV [[customer-premises equipment]] (CPE) allows pay TV operators to deploy home entertainment, with video telephony, surveillance, gaming, shopping, e-government, and interactive services amongst the service mix that can be offered.

== Security and privacy concerns ==
[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/about-90-percent-of-smart-tvs-vulnerable-to-remote-hacking-via-rogue-tv-signals/ About 90% of Smart TVs Vulnerable to Remote Hacking via Rogue TV Signals] Rafael Scheel of Oneconsult AG developed a Radio Frequency based remote exploit using HbbTV that provides root access. He provides counter measures in his Feb 22, 2017 presentation to the European Broadcasting Union Media Cybersecurity Seminar.

Academic research by Columbia University has revealed possible security flaws in HbbTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27761756|title=BBC News - Smart TVs subverted by radio attack|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://iss.oy.ne.ro/Aether.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the blog of Martin Herfurt (referenced in the Columbia paper), the HbbTV standard allows an attacker to inject [[malware]] into an HbbTV-enabled smart television that can cause it to do various things like modifying the content being displayed, mining [[Bitcoin]]s, or attacking other devices connected to the network that the television is connected to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mherfurt.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/security-concerns-with-hbbtv/|title=Security concerns with HbbTV|work=Martin Herfurt's Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HbbTV Association has responded to the reports with a statement "HbbTV welcomes and appreciates the academic research on security threats in set-top boxes and TVs based on our specifications. The HbbTV Association continuously reviews such situations and has determined that there is limited potential for a security breach based on this research. Nevertheless, as ever, our upcoming HbbTV specification will include further appropriate security solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hbbtv.org/pages/news_events/pdf/Communication%20Statement%20Options%20final.pdf |title=HbbTV Statement Regarding Possible Security Concerns |publisher=HbbTV Association |date=June 26, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929182653/http://www.hbbtv.org/pages/news_events/pdf/Communication%20Statement%20Options%20final.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 researchers from [[TU Darmstadt]] found widespread non-consensual use of [[web analytics]] technologies, such as [[third-party cookie]]s, in HbbTV content to track viewing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Veranstaltungen/ITSiKongress/2013/Marco_Ghiglieri_15052013.pdf |title=BSI:   Marco Ghiglieri: HbbTV ‚Äì I Know What You Are Watching! |date=28 May 2013 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219090724/https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Veranstaltungen/ITSiKongress/2013/Marco_Ghiglieri_15052013.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sit.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_SIT/Publications/05_Ghiglieri_Oswald_Tews_HbbTV-I_Know_What_Your_Are_Watching.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelsat 511''', previously named '''Intelsat VA F-11''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1985, it was the eleventh of fifteen [[Intelsat V]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by [[Ford Aerospace]], based on the [[SSL 1300|Intelsat-V]] [[satellite bus]].

Intelsat VA F-11 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater telecommunications capacity for [[Intelsat]]'s global network.  The satellite was deactivated on August, 2003.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on June 30, 1985, at 00:44 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 2,013&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="TBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_511.html|title=INTELSAT 511|publisher=TSE|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intelsat VA F-11 was equipped with 6 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 26 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 15,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

The company has experienced remarkable growth over the years and currently ranks twelfth among the top European ports and is the third largest transhipment and logistics centre in the Mediterranean region.  Over 95% of the [[Free trade zone|Freeport]]'s container traffic is transhipment business with demand growth triggering successive rounds of funding and ownership changes.

The '''Nakuru Agreement''', signed on June 21, 1975, in [[Nakuru]], [[Kenya]], was an attempt to salvage the [[Alvor Agreement]], which granted [[Angola]] independence from [[Portugal]] and established a transitional government. While the Nakuru Agreement did produce a truce between the three nationalist movements‚Äîthe [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA), and [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA)‚Äîit was a fragile truce that dissolved on July 9, 1975.&lt;ref name="hopkins"&gt;McDannald, Alexander Hopkins. ''The Americana Annual: An Encyclopedia of Current Events'', 1976. Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiation==
The three principal separatist leaders, MPLA's [[Agostinho Neto]], UNITA's [[Jonas Savimbi]], and the FNLA's [[Holden Roberto]] met in Nakuru from June 15-21. [[Kenyan President]] [[Jomo Kenyatta]] moderated the negotiations. The leaders "denounce[d] the use of force as a means of solving problems" and again agreed to put down their arms and disarm civilians.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy Towards Angola Since 1945|date=1997|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9780745310299|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Destruction_of_a_Nation.html?id=cINUCik7OeUC|pages=60‚Äì61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps is a para-military agency of the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that is commissioned to provide measures against threat and any form of attack or disaster against the nation and its citizenry. The corps is statutorily empowered by lay Act No. 2 of 2003 and amended by Act 6 of 4th June 2007.

The Corps is empowered to institute legal proceedings by or in then and of the Attorney General of the Federation in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria against any person or persons suspected to have committed an offence, maintain an armed squad in order to bear fire arms among others to strengthen the corps in the discharge of its statutory duties

The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps was first introduced in May 1967 during the Nigerian Civil War within the then Federal Capital Territory of Lagos for the purpose of sensitization and protection of the civil populace. It was then known as Lagos Civil Defence Committee.

It later metamorphosed into the present day Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in 1970. On inception, the Corps had the objective of carrying out some educational and enlightenment campaigns in and around the Federal Capital of Lagos to sensitize members of the civil populace on enemy attacks and how to save themselves from danger as most Nigerians living in and around Lagos territory then had little or no knowledge about war and its implications. Members of the Committee deemed it important to educate through electronic and print media on how to guide themselves during air raids, bomb attacks, identify bombs and how to dive into trenches during bomb blast.

In 1984, the Corps was transformed into a National security outfit and in 1988, there was a major re-structuring of the Corps that led to the establishment of Commands throughout the Federation, including Abuja, and the addition of special functions by the Federal Government.
On 28th June 2003, an Act to give statutory backing to the NSCDC passed by the National Assembly was signed into law by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, GCFR, the former president and Commander in chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria.

==Statutory duties==
The primary function of the NSCDC is to protect lives and properties in conjunction with [[Nigeria Police Force|Nigeria police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/06/civil-defence-wants-synergy-on-counter-terrorism/|title=Civil Defence wants synergy on counter-terrorism|work=Vanguard News|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the crucial function of the corp is to protect pipelines from vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newtelegraphonline.com/police-nscdc-battle-over-oil-pipelines/|title=New Telegraph   ‚Äì Police, NSCDC battle over oil pipelines|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924041038/http://newtelegraphonline.com/police-nscdc-battle-over-oil-pipelines/|archivedate=24 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also involves in crisis resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prnigeria.com/2014/08/nscdc-hosts-peace-dialogue-in-north-east/|title=NSCDC Hosts Peace Dialogue in North-East|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818165041/http://prnigeria.com/2014/08/nscdc-hosts-peace-dialogue-in-north-east/|archivedate=18 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the country

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Jordan:

'''[[Jordan]]''' &amp;ndash; country located in [[Southwest Asia]], bordering [[Syria]] to the north, [[Iraq]] to the north-east, [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] to the west, and [[Saudi Arabia]] to the east and south. It shares the coastlines of the [[Dead Sea]] with Israel and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] with Israel, Saudi Arabia and [[Egypt]]. Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with representative government. The reigning monarch is the head of state, the chief executive and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The king exercises his executive authority through the prime ministers and the Council of Ministers, or cabinet. The cabinet, meanwhile, is responsible before the elected House of Deputies which, along with the House of Notables (Senate), constitutes the legislative branch of the government. The judicial branch is an independent branch of the government.

== Increasing Urbanization ==

Jordan‚Äôs population became significantly urbanized during the sixties, reaching a rate of urbanization of over 80% in 2011. This is due to  Rural to urban migration,  the arrival of refugees from Palestinian and Syria, and displaced persons who mostly settled in camps and services of UNRWA.&lt;ref name="Atlas_of_jordan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.openedition.org/ifpo/5021?lang=fr#tocfrom2n1|title=Altas_of_jordan|last=|first=|date=|website=Open Edition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">'''SMATV''' is Single Master Antenna Television (or Satellite Master Antenna Television),&lt;ref name="ETSI"/&gt;
The purpose of SMATV is for supplying and controlling the number and type of channels to multiple televisions.&lt;ref name="VIS"/&gt; Not only TV channels but FM channels as well. It provides Reception of [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] TV/FM channels for hotels, motels, dormitories, schools, hospitals and commercial properties with multiple tenants. Using a master antenna system video signals, audio signals and decoder signals can also be distributed.

It consists of single outdoor unit or antenna feeding to number of indoor units.&lt;ref name="SCDR"/&gt; The channels accessible are independent of other users. For maintaining a good [[Signal-to-noise_ratio|signal to noise ratio]] at all the indoor units served, a larger antenna is required, typically 2-3m in diameter.

A SMATV headend is used to receive and rebroadcast [[satellite TV]] channels throughout a property from a single satellite feed.&lt;ref name="BaylinBerkoff1992"/&gt;

The system consists of a master antenna and a matching transformer to match the balanced antenna with unbalanced cable and amplifiers.&lt;ref name="TEDR"/&gt; Most antennas have an impedance of around 300&amp;nbsp;Œ©. To convert it to 75&amp;nbsp;Œ©, a matching transformer (or [[balun]]) is used. For trunk line isolation, a resistive inductive device known as a [[Power_dividers_and_directional_couplers|splitter]] is used. The amplifier output is fed to the splitter through coaxial trunk lines.&lt;ref name="EED"/&gt;

There are several methods of distribution that are often used in a SMATV headend. These include:
* [[IPTV]] ([[Internet Protocol]]) TV Systems&lt;ref name="BroeckPierson2008"/&gt;
* COM1000 Pro:Idiom Encrypted HD Headend
* [[L-Band]] Satellite TV Distribution&lt;ref name="Long1999"/&gt;
There are two main approaches for distribution of digital TV signals in SMATV installations:
* Transmodulation from satellite quaternary phase shift keying [[QPSK]] to quadrature amplitude modulation [[QAM]]
* Direct distribution of [[QPSK]]&lt;ref name="ETSI2"/&gt;

In the United States, the satellite carriers providing the satellite TV signal for SMATV headend systems are:
*[[DirecTV]]
*[[Dish Network]] [http://www.onrip.com/smatv/ Smatv]

"'''Salvem el m√≥n'''" ("Let's save the world") was the [[Andorra]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], performed in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and English by [[Anonymous (band)|Anonymous]]. This was the first Andorran entry not to feature monolingual Catalan lyrics and not to be performed by a female soloist, with all the members of the band being male.
[[Image:ESC 2007 Andorra - Anonymous - Salvem el mon.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Anonymous (band)|Anonymous]] performing "Salvem el m√≥n" for [[Andorra]].]]
The song is a [[pop punk]] number, the first such song ever to be performed at the Contest. Lead singer "N!ki" sings about his disbelief at the state of the world, remarking that "The world is in danger and you don't do anything". He sings that this is because everyone is only interested in their own lives, and is unwilling to do anything for the greater good. Thus, he proposes that everyone unite and think about things they can do to improve the world. The chorus is delivered in English, with the band singing that humanity as a whole has treated the world badly, having "turned [it] upside down". The theme of a call to action was made more explicit in the performance, with N!ki calling out "Thank you! We can still save the world!" after the song was finished.

As Andorra had not previously qualified for the final, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed twenty-first (following [[Malta]]'s [[Olivia Lewis]] with "[[Vertigo (Eurovision song)|Vertigo]]" and preceding [[Hungary]]'s [[Magdi R√∫zsa]] with "[[Unsubstantial Blues]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 80 points, placing 12th in the 28-strong field and thus missing out on qualifying for the final by two places. This was, however, Andorra's best result - with their entry in 2006 coming last in the semi-final, for example.

Following the Contest, the song charted at number 3 in the [[Spain|Spanish]] chart.

[[File:The Earthbound.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Earthbound, 2008.]]
'''The Earthbound''' is a [[Greece|Greek]] band.

The band was formed in [[Athens]] in 1998 by six members and former members of [[The Last Drive]], [[Honeydive]], [[Rockin' Bones]] and [[Engine-V]], which includes  Alexis Kalofolias and Thanos Amorginos.&lt;ref name="mic-gr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Earthbound la guerra final |url=http://www.mic.gr/record-review/earthbound-la-guerra-final |website=Mic.gr |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing locally for about a year, including a slot in Rockwave festival in 1999, the Earthbound recorded its debut 7" single "The Valley/Riverside Song/Tercera Cancion", released with ''Fractal Press'' magazine. 

The Earthbound signed to [[Trade Records]] and recorded their self-titled debut album produced by their sound-engineer, Jim Spliff. It was released in 2000 and featured 13 songs, including three covers of songs by [[Kyuss]], [[Woody Guthrie]] and Guillermo Portaballes that showcased the band's diverse influences. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 2001, they recorded the soundtrack for the film ''Stakaman'' by Antonis Kafetzopoulos, which was released by M Records. At the same period, Alex K and Thanos A worked on the soundtrack for the film SOSE ME (directed by Stratos Tzitzis), released a few months later by Universal (Greece). The Earthbound spent the next eighteen months touring. They also took part in two benefit concerts for the campaign Escuelas para Chiapas (A School for Chiapas) and in June 2003 they played at the demonstration against the EU summit in Thessaloniki. In September 2003 Louis (former member of the historical Athenian punk band ''Stress'') joined on trumpet and percussion. 

In 2004, they signed to Sirius (the record label formed by Manos Hadjidakis) and started working on their third album, ''Brotherhood of the Dog'', this time produced by Jim Spliff and the band itself. The album was released later the same year and featured 11 songs (including an Ennio Morricone cover). 

In early 2005, they played two gigs in Cyprus and recruited a second trumpet player, Johnny Mato (also member of Dr. Vodkatini and Da Traces).The eight-piece band contributed a track to the [[Spinalonga records]] compilation In The Junkyard vol. II and continued touring and writing songs for their next album. 

It was finally released in spring of 2008 at the band's own label, LAB Records, under the title ''La Guerra Final''   . Including 11 original songs, it is considered by many their best studio effort. 

The Earthbound suspended action in summer of 2009.

'''''The Yacoubian Building''''' ({{lang-ar|ÿπŸÖÿßÿ±ÿ© ŸäÿπŸÇŸàÿ®ŸäÿßŸÜ}} '' øImƒÅrat Ya øq≈´bƒ´ƒÅn'')  is a 2007 [[Egyptian television series]] based on the scenario of Atef Beshai and directed by Ahmad Saqr. The series featured major roles by [[Salah Al-Saadni]], [[Ezzat Abu Ouf]], [[Lobna Abdel Aziz]], Rania Youssef and [[Aser Yasin]].

The television series is based on the 2002 [[novel]] ''[[The Yacoubian Building]]'' by Egyptian author [[Alaa Al Aswany|Alaa el-Aswany]] and the 2006 film ''[[The Yacoubian Building (film)|The Yacoubian Building]]'' by [[Marwan Hamed]], with the mentioning of the character of the [[homosexuality|homosexual]] in the film original being excised from the TV series adaptation of the novel because of its controversial nature in the Arabic culture.

[[File:WWVH antenna field.jpg|thumb|right|300px|WWVH antenna field]]
'''WWVH''' is the callsign of the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s [[shortwave]] [[radio]] [[time signal]] station in [[Kekaha, Hawaii|Kekaha]], on the island of [[Kauai]] in the state of [[Hawaii]].  {{Coord|21|59|16|N|159|45|47|W|type:landmark_region:US-HI|display=title}}

WWVH is the Pacific sister station to [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]], and has a similar broadcast format.  Like WWV, WWVH's main function is the dissemination of official U.S. Government time, through exactly the same methods as found on WWV's signal.

To minimize interference with the WWV broadcasts on the same frequencies, WWVH's broadcasts on 5, 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz are directional, pointed primarily west.  Despite this strategy, in certain places, particularly on the west coast of North America; and at certain times, due to [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] conditions, the listener can actually hear both WWV and WWVH on the same frequency at the same time.  The information modulated on the carrier is modified to reduce confusion if both are received simultaneously.  In particular, voice announcements on one correspond to silent periods on the other. WWVH uses a female voice to distinguish itself from WWV, which uses a male voice. WWVH time signals can also be accessed by telephone.

&lt;/div&gt;

WWVH broadcasts its signal on four transmitters, one for each frequency.  The 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz transmitter puts out an [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] of 5&amp;nbsp;kW, while the other transmitters use 10&amp;nbsp;kW of ERP.  The 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz antenna is one half-[[wavelength]] tall, and radiates in an omnidirectional pattern.  The remaining antennas each consist of two elements one half-wavelength tall and horizontally separated by one quarter-wavelength.  The signal radiating from one element is in [[quadrature phase]] with respect to the signal from the other.  This results in a [[cardioid]] radiation pattern with a maximum gain directed west.

[[File:WWVH recording - 20150316.ogg|thumb|Recording of WWVH from 4:58:43 to 5:03:08 UTC on March 16, 2015.]]
[[File:WWV-WWVH time code format.svg|750px|center]]
The WWVH signal is extremely similar to the WWV signal, but some changes have been made to reduce confusion if both are heard at once:&lt;ref name="NIST25067"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Glenn|author2=Michael Lombardi|author3=Dean Okayama|title=NIST Special Publication 250-67: NIST Time and Frequency Stations: WWV, WWVH and WWVB|publisher=NIST|year=2005|url=http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1969.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125154929/http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1969.pdf|archivedate=January 25, 2017|df=mdy-all|access-date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 5&amp;nbsp;ms second ticks are 6 cycles of [[Media:1200&amp;nbsp;Hz.ogg|1,200&amp;nbsp;Hz]] rather than 5 cycles of 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The 800&amp;nbsp;ms minute beep is also 1,200&amp;nbsp;Hz.  (Like WWV, this is omitted during minutes 29 and 59, and changed to 1,500&amp;nbsp;Hz at the top of each hour.)
* The voice announcements use a female voice (that of [[Jane Barbe]]) and last 7.5 seconds starting 15 seconds before the minute.  (WWV broadcasts in a male voice during the last 7.5 seconds of each minute.)
* The audio tones sent during the first 45 seconds of most minutes are swapped: [[Media:600&amp;nbsp;Hz.ogg|600&amp;nbsp;Hz]] is played during even minutes, and [[Media:500&amp;nbsp;Hz.ogg|500&amp;nbsp;Hz]] is played during odd minutes.  (Receiving both simultaneously gives the listener a sound similar to a continuously-ringing chime.)
* The [[A440 (Concert A)|A440]] tone marking the hour is sent during minute 1 (as opposed to minute 2 for WWV).  Like WWV, it is omitted during the first hour of each UTC day.
* The audio tones are suppressed while WWV is transmitting voice announcements: minutes 00, 08‚Äì10, 14‚Äì19, and 30.
* The voice announcements are rescheduled relative to WWV:
** Station identification is made during minutes 29 and 59 (vs. 00 and 30)
** [[Notice Advisory to NAVSTAR Users|GPS satellite health reports]] are transmitted during minutes 43 and 44 (vs. 14 and 15)
** [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] space weather geoalerts are transmitted during minute 45 (vs. 18)
** [[National Weather Service]] storm warnings for all sections of the Pacific Ocean are broadcast during minutes 48‚Äì51, overflowing to minute 52 when necessary (vs. Atlantic and northeast Pacific information during 08‚Äì10 and 11).
** Minutes 03 and 47 are used for NIST special announcements when necessary (vs. 04 and 16). Like WWV, prior to the [[Omega (navigation system)|OMEGA]] Navigation System shutdown in 1997, the OMEGA status report was broadcast at :47 past the hour.

== Half-hourly station identification announcement ==
WWVH identifies itself twice each hour, at 29 and 59 minutes past the hour.  The text of the identification is as follows:
{{cquote|National Institute of Standards and Technology Time. This is radio station WWVH, Kauai, Hawaii, broadcasting on internationally allocated standard carrier frequencies of 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 megahertz, providing time of day, standard time interval, and other related information. Inquiries regarding these transmissions may be directed to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Radio Station WWVH, [[Post Office Box]] 417, [[Kekaha, Hawaii]] 96752. [[Aloha]].}}

Reception reports sent to that address will on request be answered with a [[QSL card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.nist.gov/stations/qsl.htm QSL Gallery for NIST Radio Stations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911050255/http://tf.nist.gov/stations/qsl.htm |date=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
