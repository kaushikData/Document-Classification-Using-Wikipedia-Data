A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Central African Republic]] on 28 December 1994. The new constitution would make the country a [[presidential system|presidential]] republic with a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] National Assembly and a [[List of heads of government of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|Prime Minister]] accountable to both the President and the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 82.7% of voters with a 45% turnout.

'''Alabama HB 56''' (AL Act 2011-535), titled the '''Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act''' is an anti-[[illegal immigration]] bill, signed into law in the U.S. state of [[Alabama]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name="lat-enacts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fausset|first=Richard|title=Alabama enacts anti-illegal-immigration law described as nation's strictest|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/10/nation/la-na-alabama-immigration-20110610|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=August 27, 2011|date=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law, written in large part by [[Secretary of State of Kansas|Kansas Secretary of State]] [[Kris Kobach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julia |last=Preston |date=June 3, 2011 |title=In Alabama, a Harsh Bill for Residents Here Illegally |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/04immig.html |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Kris Kobach, the Kansas lawyer behind Alabama's immigration law | first=George | last=Talbot | url=http://blog.al.com/live/2011/10/kris_kobach_the_kansas_lawyer_1.html | newspaper=[[Mobile Press-Register]] | date=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cosponsored by [[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama Representative]] [[Micky Hammon]] and [[Alabama Senate|Alabama State Senator]] [[Scott Beason]],&lt;ref name="sesun"/&gt; was passed by the [[Alabama House of Representatives]] and [[Alabama Senate]] with widespread legislative support.&lt;ref name="reut-signed"/&gt;  It was then signed into law on June 9, 2011, by Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]].&lt;ref name="reut-signed"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/09/us-immigration-alabama-idUSTRE7584C920110609 | title=Alabama sets nation's toughest immigration law | author=Gargis, Peggy | agency=[[Reuters]] | date=June 9, 2011 | accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The Alabama law requires that if police have "reasonable suspicion" that a person is an immigrant unlawfully present in the United States, in the midst of any legal stop, detention or arrest,  to make a similarly reasonable attempt to determine that person's legal status. An exemption is provided if such action would hinder an official investigation of some kind.&lt;ref name="lat-enacts"/&gt;

The law prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving any public benefits at either the state or local level. It bars illegal immigrants from attending publicly owned colleges or universities (currently blocked&lt;ref name="trib-blocks"/&gt;). At the high, middle, and elementary public school levels, the law requires that school officials ascertain whether students are illegal immigrants. Attendance is not prohibited for such students; school districts are mandated to submit annual tallies on the suspected number of illegal immigrants when making report to state education officials.&lt;ref name="lat-enacts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap-blocks"/&gt;

The law prohibits the transporting or harboring of illegal immigrants (currently blocked&lt;ref name="trib-blocks"/&gt;). It prohibits landlords from renting property to illegal immigrants. It forbids employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants for any job within Alabama. Moreover, it considers as a discriminatory practice any action to refuse to employ or remove a legal resident of the state when an illegal one is already employed (currently blocked&lt;ref name="trib-blocks"/&gt;). The law requires large and small businesses to validate the immigration status of employees using the US [[E-Verify]] program. The law prohibits illegal immigrants from applying for work. (currently blocked&lt;ref name="trib-blocks"/&gt;)&lt;ref name="lat-enacts"/&gt;

The production of false identification documents is considered a crime. Contracts formed in which one party is an illegal immigrant and the other has direct knowledge of that are deemed null and void. The law also requires voters to provide proof of citizenship when registering.&lt;ref name="lat-enacts"/&gt;

==Legal challenges to the law==
{{update|section|date=February 2015}}
The law was originally scheduled to take effect on September 1, 2011, but legal actions were taken against it by the [[Obama administration]], some religious groups, student groups (Spanish and Latino Student Alliance), and some immigrant-rights groups, all making claims that the law was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="ap-blocks"/&gt;

On August 29, 2011, U.S. Judge [[Sharon Lovelace Blackburn]], sitting for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]], temporarily blocked enforcement of the law, saying she needed more time to study the case.&lt;ref name="ap-blocks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Judge Blocks Alabama Illegal Immigration Law – For Now|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=Fox News |agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/29/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-illegal-immigration-law-for-now/#ixzz1ZNFvtIgo|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 2011, Judge Blackburn gave the green light to key parts of the law.&lt;ref name="trib-blocks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge lets key parts of Alabama immigration law stand|first=Peggy|last=Gargis|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=September 28, 2011|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-immigration-alabamatre78s04a-20110928,0,1135972.story|accessdate=September 29, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001141502/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-immigration-alabamatre78s04a-20110928,0,1135972.story|archive-date=October 1, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a month after the bill was signed into law, the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama (HICA) filed the case ''Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama v. Bentley'' challenging HB 56 on the grounds that various provisions of the act, and the entire law as a whole, are preempted by federal law, and are therefore illegal.&lt;ref name="ago.state.al.us"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama Immigration Law: Act No. 2011-535.|url=http://www.ago.state.al.us/Page-Immigration-Litigation-Federal|publisher=Attorney General Luther Strange: State of Alabama. (|accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HICA was only the first to file such a claim, followed by the United States Department of Justice with the suit ''United States v. Alabama'' and a group of Alabama Church Leaders with ''Parsley v. Bentley''.&lt;ref name="ago.state.al.us"/&gt; After the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and a coalition of groups including the [[ACLU]] appealed that ruling, the [[11th Circuit Court of Appeals]] on October 14, 2011, again put several key provisions on hold until the issues of [[U.S. Constitution|constitutionality]] could be addressed, including the requirement on schools to collect information on enrolling students' immigration status. Other provisions, such as those making contracts with undocumented aliens null and void, were left to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Lyman |title=Federal appeals court blocks parts of immigration law |newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]] |date=October 14, 2011 |url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20111014/NEWS/111014019/Federal-appeals-court-blocks-parts-immigration-law |accessdate=October 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016062330/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20111014/NEWS/111014019/Federal-appeals-court-blocks-parts-immigration-law |archivedate=October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belczyk|first=Jaclyn|title=Federal appeals court blocks Alabama immigration law|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php|accessdate=November 10, 2011|newspaper=[[JURIST]]|date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Judge [[Myron Herbert Thompson]], sitting for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]], blocked an additional portion of the law on November 23, 2011, that prevented undocumented immigrants from obtaining certain mobile home registrations.&lt;ref name="sesun"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Immigration law faces new challenge|first=Melissa|last=Braun|accessdate=February 24, 2012|date=November 30, 2011| newspaper=[[The Southeast Sun]]|url=http://www.southeastsun.com/news/article_3fc73bf0-1a0c-11e1-86f7-0019bb30f31a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a further December 12, 2011, ruling, Thompson attacked the history behind the law, describing the legislative debate as having been "laced with derogatory comments about Hispanics." He said it was likely that the entire law was "discriminatorily based" and that lawmakers employed ethnic stereotypes and used the terms "Hispanic" and "illegal immigrant" interchangeably. He accused State Representative Hammon of having misused a news article to justify a claim that Alabama was home to the second fastest growing population of undocumented immigrants in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary |last=Bauer |title=Court Cites Discriminatory Intent Behind Alabama's Anti-Immigrant Law |newspaper=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=December 14, 2011 |url=http://splcenter.org/get-informed/news/court-cites-discriminatory-intent-behind-alabamas-anti-immigrant-law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311123931/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/court-cites-discriminatory-intent-behind-alabamas-anti-immigrant-law |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Immigration law faces new challenge|accessdate=February 24, 2012|date=November 30, 2011|newspaper=[[The Southeast Sun]]|url=http://www.southeastsun.com/news/article_3fc73bf0-1a0c-11e1-86f7-0019bb30f31a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Once the federal ruling of September 29, 2011 upholding most of the law went into effect, several Alabama school districts reported a significant drop in the number of Hispanic children attending public schools.  State and local officials urged immigrants to keep their children in the schools, saying the law does not bar them from attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alabama: Many Immigrants Pull Children From Schools|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 30, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/us/alabama-many-immigrants-pull-children-from-schools.html|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industries dependent on migrant labor have been strongly impacted. Farmers have found that Americans are not willing to work under such harsh working conditions for low pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Few Americans take immigrants' jobs in Alabama |last=Caldwell |first=Alicia A. |last2=Reeves |first2=Jay |date=October 20, 2011 |publisher=MSNBC |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44981872/ns/us_news-life/ |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses in other industries have lost workers, including legal workers, as a result of the new immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;Roy L. Williams (October 12, 2011).

''[[The Birmingham News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2011, a German [[Mercedes-Benz]] executive was arrested for not having proper documentation on him while on business in Alabama, having left his passport at the hotel where he was staying and carrying only his [[German identity card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mercedes-Benz manager from Germany arrested under Alabama's strict new immigration law|date=November 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/mercedes-benz-manager-from-germany-arrested-under-alabamas-strict-new-immigration-law/2011/11/18/gIQADDmYZN_story.html|accessdate=November 23, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2011, a Japanese [[Honda]] executive was stopped in [[Leeds, Alabama]], at a checkpoint set up by police to catch unlicensed drivers. He was ticketed on the spot, despite the fact that he showed an [[International Driving Permit]], a valid [[passport]] and a [[Employment Authorization Document|U.S. work permit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/02/alabama-car-boss-immigration-law|location=London|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ed|last=Pilkington|title=Alabama red-faced as second foreign car boss held under immigration law|date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2011, it was reported that Alabama's unemployment rate had fallen from 9.2 percent to 8.7 percent. Supporters credited the immigration law for the decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/12/18/alabama-jobless-rate-falls-amid-immigration-reform/|title=Alabama jobless rate falls amid immigration reform|author=Neil Munro|date=December 18, 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Caller]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmad Ijaz, Director of Economic Forecasting at the [[University of Alabama]], found that the majority of job growth in 2011 was in the automotive sector – an area of the economy where undocumented workers were uncommon. Ijaz attributed a rise in employment to the retail growth during holiday sales. Contrary to expectation, there was no job growth in sectors where Latinos typically work – construction, agriculture, and poultry processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/456/reap-what-you-sow|title=Reap What You Sow|author=Jack Hitt|date=January 27, 2012|publisher=[[WBEZ]]|work=[[This American Life]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study by Dr. Samuel Addy of the [[University of Alabama]] estimated that HB56 could shrink the state's annual GDP by $11 billion or almost 6%, a result of lost sales and income taxes and fall in demand from lost consumers.&lt;ref&gt;http://cber.cba.ua.edu/New%20AL%20Immigration%20Law%20-%20Costs%20and%20Benefits.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that "Alabama HB 56 contributed to an increase in violent crime rates,{{Why|date=June 2017}} while there was no significant change in property crime rates after the act."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Effects of the Alabama HB 56 Immigration Law on Crime: A Synthetic Control Approach|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/229780|website=ageconsearch.umn.edu|access-date=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for revisions==
On December 5, 2011,  [[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Luther Strange]] recommended repealing several parts of the law:  the provision requiring collection of the immigration status of public school students, the provision requiring immigrants to always carry alien registration cards, and the allowance of lawsuits by state citizens who do not believe public officials are enforcing the law.&lt;ref name="huffpo120611"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/alabama-attorney-general-recommends-repealing-parts-of-immigration-law_n_1132378.html|title=Alabama AG Luther Strange Recommends Repealing Parts Of State Immigration Law|first=Elise|last=Foley|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Arnold v Teno''''', [1978] 2 S.C.R. 287 is a leading [[tort]] case from the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. This decision was part of a trilogy of [[personal injury]] cases including ''[[Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd.]]'' (1978) and ''[[Thornton v. Prince George School Board]]'' (1978).

On July 1, 1969, four-year-old Diane Teno and her six-year-old brother were crossing the street to get some ice cream from the [[ice cream truck]] parked on the other side when she was struck by a car driven by Brian Arnold. Teno was rendered severely [[brain damage]]d and sued Arnold for damages. At trial Teno was successful and was awarded damages. Arnold appealed the amount awarded.

The issue before the Court was whether the amount of award for damages was correct. The Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the original damage award.

Justice Spence, writing for the majority, observed that the purpose of the award in these circumstances is to ensure that Teno is properly cared for the rest of her life. The sum of $7,500 per year was a "equitable" amount proposed by the Court.

Spence further qualified his decision by acknowledging the fear of overly generous awards for tortious acts stating that "the very real and serious social burden of these exorbitant awards has been illustrated graphically in the United States in cases concerning medical malpractice."

An '''autonomous building''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, [[gas grid]], municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and in some cases, [[public road]]s.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced [[environmental impact]]s, increased security, and lower [[costs of ownership]]. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)

Most of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.

British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] have said that, as of 2002, &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a "house with no bills" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vale |first= Brenda and Robert |authorlink= Brenda and Robert Vale |title= The New Autonomous House|year= 2000|publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|location= London |isbn=0-500-34176-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of "[[bioshelter]]" projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the "New Alchemy Institute".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html "New Alchemy Institute"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818015757/http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html |date=2006-08-18 }} (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.

[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an [[Earthship]], featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]

The 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berm]]s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].

1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.

==Advantages==

As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.

Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.

Autonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.

An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.

==Disadvantages==

First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.

Living within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.

An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.

[[Brenda and Robert Vale|The Vales]], among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice&amp;mdash;under certain conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Systems==
This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.

===Water===
[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic [[rainwater harvesting]] system]]
[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]

There are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.

[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.

The classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.

However drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.

In regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use [[rainwater harvesting]], with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/ WHO | Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.

In many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155419/http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a "roof cleaner" tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[water chlorination|chlorinated]], though [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.

In the classic Roman house ("Domus"), household water was provided from a cistern (the "impluvium"), that was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward facing roof-opening (the "compluvium"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jefferey|title=The Roman House (Domus)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/roman-domestic-architecture-domus|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vitruvius|translator-last1=Morgan|translator-first1=Morris Hickey|title=The Ten Books of Architecture|date=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=6.3|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Vitruvius__the_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.

Reducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.

It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.

[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).

New technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.

===Sewage===
{{see also|Anaerobic digestion}}
====Resource====

[[Image:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]
[[Composting toilet]]s use bacteria to decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste.  Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of "[[humanure]]" for growing food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is microbial and viral contamination.  In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months.  To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[composting toilet]] for references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free [[reclaimed water]] can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].

Electric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.

[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission.

A big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.

Another method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.

====Waste====

Sewage handling is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.

The standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.

Septic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|vacuum truck]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.

However, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.

Composting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.

Incinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.

Traditional methods of sewage handling include [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.

===Storm drains===

Drainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.

Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.

Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:

If a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.&lt;ref&gt;Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], "Natural Capitalism," ch. 5, pp83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett&lt;/ref&gt; One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.

A [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.

===Electricity===
[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof in Manchester, UK]]
[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]

{{Further|Zero emissions|Zero-energy building}}Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. [[LED light]]s, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sunfrost rates {{convert|15|cuft|L|abbr=on}}. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic brand (formerly Servel brand) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.

Using a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.

However, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, [[wind turbine|wind generator]]s can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.

The main advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.&lt;ref name="Gipe"&gt;Paul Gipe, "Wind Power for Home and Business"&lt;/ref&gt;

During times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).&lt;ref name="Gipe"/&gt;

A grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single-wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).

In areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a "[[regenerative fuel cell]]", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.

[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.

[[Microbial fuel cell]]s and [[thermoelectric generator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biolite Portable Stoves|url=https://www.bioliteenergy.com/collections/stoves|website=bioliteenergy.com|publisher=Biolite|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firebee:Charge your USB Device!|url=http://firebeecharger.com/|website=firebeecharger.com|publisher=Firebee|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.

===Heating===
[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]

Most autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].

[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.

The basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.

A recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system "[[Annualized geo solar]] heating" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;Stephens, Don. September 2005. [http://www.greenershelter.com/TokyoPaper.pdf "'Annualized Geo-Solar Heating' as a Sustainable Residential-scale Solution for Temperate Climates iwht Less than Ideal Daily Heating Season Solar Availability."] ("Requested Paper for the Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, Tokyo, Japan"). Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.

In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.

A more modest "daily solar" design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.

In all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.

[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt; in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.

Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.

An increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813123637/http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf |date=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.

Electric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.

===Water heating===

{{Further|Solar hot water}}

[[Hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water.  They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.

Current practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a [[water heater#Tankless heaters|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.

[[Solar water heater]]s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.

The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.

[[Cogeneration]] systems produce hot water from [[waste heat]].  They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.

Heat recycling, [[cogeneration]] and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.
Some authorities advocate replacing [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] with [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.

===Cooling===

Annualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.

Less dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.

Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a [[whole-house fan]] and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.

If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the "dome effect."  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 °C}} ({{nowrap|15 °F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.

Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an "[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.

Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].

A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's [[diesel exhaust]] was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.

A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50&amp;nbsp;°F (28&amp;nbsp;°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.

If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].

The '''BC Energy Step Code''' is a provincial regulation that local governments in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], may use, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new [[construction]] that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. It is an example of a "stretch code," or "reach code," in that it is an appendix to a mandatory minimum energy code that allows communities to voluntarily adopt a uniform approach to achieving more ambitious levels of energy efficiency in new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stretch and Reach Codes|url=https://bcapcodes.org/beyond-code-portal/stretch-and-reach-codes/|website=Building Codes Assistance Project|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BC Energy Step Code consists of a series of specific measurable efficiency targets, and groups them into "steps" that represent increasing levels of energy-efficiency performance. By gradually adopting one or more steps, a local government can increase the building performance requirements in its community. The regulation is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a [[net zero]] energy ready level of performance by 2032.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The BC Energy Step Code|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/energy-efficiency/energy-step-code|website=Building and Safety Standards Branch|publisher=Province of British Columbia|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of British Columbia]] enacted the BC Energy Step Code as regulation on April 6, 2017. It entered into legal force on December 15, 2017.

== How it works ==

The BC Energy Step Code establishes a series of measurable energy-efficiency requirements that builders must meet in communities that reference it in their building and development bylaws. The regulation groups these performance targets into a series of "steps" of increasing energy efficiency. Step 1 simply requires confirmation that new buildings meet the existing energy-efficiency requirements of the existing ''BC Building Code''. Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the scale, Step 5 for homes represents a home that is [[net-zero]] energy ready. A Step 5 home is effectively the most energy-efficient home that can be built today, roughly equivalent to the rigorous [[Passive house]] standard.

The ''BC Building Code'' separates all buildings into two basic categories – Part 9 and Part 3, as follows:

* '''Part 9''' buildings refer to houses and small buildings three storeys or less, that have a building area or "footprint" no more than 600 square metres. This category includes single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes, small apartment buildings, and small stores, offices, and industrial shops. 
* '''Part 3''' buildings are larger and more complex. They are four storeys and taller, and have a footprint greater than 600 square metres. This category includes larger apartment buildings, condos, shopping malls, office buildings, hospitals, care facilities, schools, churches, theatres, and restaurants.

For Part 9 buildings, there are five steps of the BC Energy Step Code; Part 3 buildings have four steps, while commercial buildings have three. Each step represents a more stringent set of energy-efficiency requirements. As communities climb the steps, they gradually increase the level of energy efficiency in their new buildings. The BC Energy Step Code applies to new construction only.

For small buildings, Steps 1 to 3 (collectively, the "Lower Steps") can be achieved using construction techniques and products readily understood and available in today's market; homes built to Steps 4 and 5 (the "Upper Steps") are more ambitious and may require more training and incentives to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the BC Energy Step Code Works|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/energy-efficiency/energy-step-code/how-it-works|website=Building and Safety Standards Branch|publisher=Province of British Columbia|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation is performance-based, not prescriptive, in that it does not specify the specific materials and strategies a builder must use. Instead, it sets measurable performance targets that the proposed building must meet.

To ensure that builders have the skills and capacity they need to cost-effectively produce higher performance buildings, until 2020, governments that wish to use the BC Energy Step Code may incentivize all steps, but may only require Lower Steps.

== What it measures ==
The BC Energy Step Code measures a building's energy performance via a variety of metrics. The Building Envelope Metrics and the Equipment and Systems Metrics are demonstrated through a whole-[[building performance simulation]], while the Airtightness Metric is demonstrated through an on-site [[blower door]] test of the building before occupancy.

=== Building envelope metrics ===

* '''Thermal Energy Demand Intensity''' (TEDI): The amount of annual heating energy needed to maintain a stable interior temperature, taking into account heat loss through the envelope and passive gains (i.e., the amount of heat gained from solar energy passing through the envelope, or from activities in the home such as cooking and lighting, and that provided by body heat). It is calculated per unit of area of the conditioned space over the course of a year, and expressed in kWh/(m2·year).
* '''Peak Thermal Load (PTL)''': The maximum amount of energy needed to heat a building on the coldest day of the year, expressed in W/m2 of conditioned space. Energy modellers also refer to this as "Design Heat Loss."

=== Equipment and systems metrics ===

* '''Percent Lower than EnerGuide Reference House''': An [[EnerGuide]] reference house establishes how much energy a home would use if it was built to base building code standards. This metric identifies how much less energy, stated as a percentage, the new home will require compared to the reference house.
* '''Mechanical Energy Use Intensity''': The modelled amount of energy used by space heating and cooling, ventilation, and domestic hot water systems, per unit of area, over the course of a year, expressed in kWh/(m2·year).
* '''Total Energy Use Intensity''': The modelled amount of total energy used by a building, per unit of area, over the course of a year, expressed in kWh/(m2·year).

=== Airtightness metrics ===

* '''Air Changes per Hour''' at a 50 Pa Pressure differential, as measured by a [[blower door]] test.
* '''Air Leakage Rate''': A measure of the rate that air leaks through the building envelope per unit area of the building envelope, as recorded in L/(sm2) at a 75 Pa pressure differential.

== Requirements ==

To meet the requirements of the BC Energy Step Code, builders will work with an energy advisor to check that their plans will meet the energy-performance requirements of a given step. An energy advisor uses software to analyze construction plans and determine the energy efficiency of a building. The builder then begins construction, paying special attention to the [[building envelope]]—the walls, windows, doors, and insulation. The energy advisor also tests a building once it is built to see how well it performs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the BC Energy Step Code Works|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/energy-efficiency/energy-step-code/how-it-works|website=Building and Safety Standards Branch|publisher=Province of British Columbia|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve the Lower Steps, building and design professionals and trades can rely on conventional building designs with careful air-sealing practices, and incrementally incorporate some key elements in the design, building envelope, and equipment and systems. Builders and designers will collaborate with the energy advisor to select the most cost effective way to meet the standard's requirements. These Lower Steps give builders new flexibility in how to achieve modest gains in efficiency through improved envelopes and/or upgraded systems.

To achieve the Upper Steps, builders and designers will need to adopt an [[integrated design]] approach to building design and may need to incorporate more substantial changes in building design, layout, framing techniques, system selection, and materials. These techniques and materials will be more costly and challenging without additional training and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC Energy Step Code: A Best Practices Guide for Local Governments|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/construction-industry/building-codes-and-standards/guides/bcenergystepcode_guide_v1.pdf|website=Buildings and Safety Standards Branch, Office of Housing and Construction Standards|publisher=The Energy Step Code Council and the Building and Safety Standards Branch|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

In September 2015, the province's Building Safety and Standards branch established an Energy Efficiency Working Group (EEWG) to review policies and regulations that apply to energy efficiency in BC, to seek stakeholder input and offer guidance on how to best implement an Energy Step Code to achieve consistent building energy performance beyond the BC Building Code. The consultations engaged with the building and development sectors, and the trades and professions that support them, as well as local governments, utilities, and other stakeholders, to identify a consistent approach to increasing energy-efficiency standards.

In August 2016, the group renamed itself the Stretch Code Implementation Working Group and published its final report and recommendations, including adoption of a Step Code into a voluntary provincial regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Step Code Implementation Recommendations Final Report|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/construction-industry/building-codes-and-standards/reports/step_code_sciwg_report_final.pdf|website=Office of Housing and Construction Standards|publisher=Province of British Columbia, Building and Safety Standards Branch|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Energy Step Code Council ==

In mid 2017, the province renamed the group the Energy Step Code Council, and mandated it "to support local governments and industry towards smooth uptake of the BC Energy Step Code and help guide market transformation towards higher-performance buildings within B.C."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provincial Policy: Local Government Implementation of the BC Energy Step Code Section C2 of the Building Act Guide|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/construction-industry/building-codes-and-standards/guides/baguide_c2_sc_april2017.pdf|website=Office of Housing and Construction Standards|publisher=Province of British Columbia|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Step Code Council meets quarterly to support training and capacity building opportunities for local governments, industry, and other stakeholder, communicate what the BC Energy Step Code is and how it may be  implemented across the province, and provide advice and clarification on technical aspects of the standard.

== Cost implications of adoption ==

In September 2017, BC Housing, the province's housing authority, and the Energy Step Code Council published the ''BC Energy Step Code 2017 Metrics Research Study'' as a comprehensive exploration of the standard's energy, emissions and economic impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC Energy Step Code Metrics Research Report - a comprehensive exploration of the energy, emissions and economic impacts of the BC Energy Step Code Summary report.|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/construction-industry/building-codes-and-standards/reports/bc_energy_step_code_metrics_research_report_summary.pdf|website=Building Safety and Standards Branch|publisher=BC Housing and the Energy Step Code Council|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research is based on data generated by builders from all across British Columbia, and bills itself as "one of the most extensive energy analyses of buildings in Canada."

The researchers conclude that meeting the requirements of the Lower Steps of the BC Energy Step Code involve only very modest construction premiums. In most situations, builders can achieve the Lower Steps for less than a 2% construction cost premium above that of a home built to the requirements of the ''BC Building Code''. The construction cost premiums associated with meeting the requirements of Step 1 amounts to just a small fraction of a percent, the report states. In exchange, owners, occupants, and others would enjoy the benefits detailed in the "Benefits of adoption" section below.

In an effort to illustrate how the BC Energy Step Code would impact construction costs in the "real world," the study's authors produced a series of hypothetical scenarios for various building types in various cities.

=== For an apartment in a six-storey building ===

The Metrics Research report offers an example of the anticipated capital construction cost premium for a hypothetical 730 square foot unit in a six-storey apartment building in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], British Columbia. Units in this hypothetical new building would sell for between CAD$270,000 and CAD$730,000.

For this building, the report says meeting the requirements of Step 1 would involve a construction cost premium of CAD$100 per unit above the cost of building to the standard modelling requirements of the ''BC Building Code''. Meeting the requirements of Step 2 would incur A 0.5 percent construction cost premium, about CAD$790 per unit. Meeting the requirements of Step 3 adds about CAD$970 to the per-unit build cost. Finally, the researchers found that building to the very high-performance levels of Step 4 may entail a per-unit construction cost premium of CAD$4,215.

=== For a home in a six-unit row house ===
The Metrics Research report also models an example of the anticipated capital construction cost premium for a hypothetical 1,720 square feet unit built into a six-unit row house project in Surrey, B.C. Units in this hypothetical new building would sell for between CAD$550,000 and CAD$800,000.

For this building, the researchers conclude that meeting the requirements of Step 1 would involve a construction cost premium of $560 per unit above the cost of building to the ''BC Building Code''. Meeting the requirements of Step 2 would incur a 0.4% construction cost premium, about CAD$1,250 per unit. Meeting the requirements of Step 3 adds about CAD$2,950 to the per-unit build cost. Finally, the report states that building to the highest performance levels may require non-conventional building practices; this would increase construction costs between $5,500 (Step 4) and $9,400 (Step 5) per unit, the study suggests.

== Benefits of adoption ==

Buildings built to higher energy efficiency standard have been shown to provide multiple co-benefits – to home and building owners and occupants, to industry, to the environment, and to the community.

=== For building owners and occupants ===

Owners and tenants often prefer [[Low-energy house|high-performance buildings]] as they require less energy, reducing utility bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC Energy Step Code: A Best Practices Guide for Local Governments|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/construction-industry/building-codes-and-standards/guides/bcenergystepcode_guide_v1.pdf|website=Buildings and Safety Standards Branch, Office of Housing and Construction Standards|publisher=The Energy Step Code Council and the Building and Safety Standards Branch|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupants also prefer them because they better manage:

* Temperature, improving comfort.
* Fresh air throughout the building, improving health.
* Soundproofing, reducing exterior noise.

=== For industry ===

The BC Energy Step Code provides industry with a clear sense of where the province is heading on energy efficiency, while giving builders a welcome level of consistency via standardized performance metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's What's Inside that Counts|url=https://view.imirus.com/1166/document/12762/page/32|website=ELEMENTS Magazine|publisher=BC Building Envelope Council|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For climate change mitigation ===

If a given community's new homes are likely to be heated with natural gas, the BC Energy Step Code will reduce the amount of that fuel they need to burn to stay comfortable. A well-insulated and well-sealed Step 3 home heated with natural gas will consume much less of the fuel when compared with one built to the minimum code requirements. This will result in fewer carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Adopt It?|url=http://www.threeforall.ca/|publisher=Three For All BC|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For economic development ===

The global green-building market doubles every three years and the value of the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Green Building Trends 2016, February 2016|url=http://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/World%20Green%20Building%20Trends%202016%20SmartMarket%20Report%20FINAL-2.pdf|website=World Green Building Council|publisher=Dodge Data and Analytics|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Building Materials Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2013 - 2019 (January 2014)|url=https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/green-building-materials.html|publisher=Transparency Markets Research|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Columbia is already a [[green building]] design and construction leader, boasting some of highest-performing buildings in North America. Almost 12,000 people work in [[green architecture]] and related construction services in BC, while close to 9,000 work in clean energy services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Coast Clean Economy: 2010-2014 Jobs Update (December 2015)|url=http://delphi.ca/new-delphi-report-shows-strong-link-between-west-coast-climate-action-and-economic-growth/|publisher=Delphi Group|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BC Energy Step Code could open up new local [[economic development]] opportunities, and helps unlock a significant export opportunity. At a November 2017 conference, an assistant deputy minister with the Province of British Columbia's Office of Housing and Construction Standards called the BC Energy Step Code "a driver of the [[clean economy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC's New Clean Commerce Engine|url=https://medium.com/@energystepcode/b-c-s-new-clean-commerce-engine-ea57e02ce393|website=Medium|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic availability ==

The BC Energy Step Code is available to communities to all climate zones across the province for Part 9 buildings, and only to Climate Zone 4 ([[Lower Mainland]] and South [[Vancouver Island]]) for Part 3 buildings. Future iterations of the standard will increase coverage to all types and all areas.

All British Columbia local governments except the [[City of Vancouver]] may reference and enforce the BC Energy Step Code in their policies and bylaws. The City of Vancouver has its own [[Vancouver Building Bylaw|building code]], and its own high-performance buildings strategy, the Zero Emissions Building Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Emissions Buildings|url=http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/zero-emissions-buildings.aspx|website=City of Vancouver|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== B.C. local governments referencing the standard ==

On October 2, 2017, the [[City of North Vancouver]] became the first local government to reference the BC Energy Step Code in its building bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shepherd|first1=Jeremy|title=City raises building standards to combat greenhouse gas emissions|url=http://www.nsnews.com/news/city-raises-building-standards-to-combat-greenhouse-gas-emissions-1.23063400|publisher=North Shore News|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a subsequent meeting, city council unanimously agreed to write a letter to the provincial governments requesting BC Energy Step Code standards for government buildings, hospitals, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shepherd|first1=Jeremy|title="City of North Vancouver aims to take Step Code one step further"|url=http://www.nsnews.com/news/city-of-north-vancouver-aims-to-take-step-code-one-step-further-1.23070163|publisher=North Shore News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District of West Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver have since followed the City of North Vancouver and aligned their approach. As of July 1, 2018, Metro Vancouver's three North Shore governments will mandate that all new homes must meet the requirements of Step 3.

The City of Victoria will require Step 1 community-wide for both Part 9 and Part 3 buildings as of November 2018. Following a 14-month capacity-building and industry adjustment period, in January 2020 the city will move to Step 3 for homes, other simple buildings, and mid rise residential Part 3 buildings.

As of May 2018, more than 23 of British Columbia's local governments, representing 65 percent of new housing starts, have either adopted the BC Energy Step Code in bylaws, or indicated that they intend to begin consulting with industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Government Notification Form|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/construction-industry/building-codes-standards/energy-efficiency/energy-step-code/notification-form|website=Building and Safety Standards Branch|publisher=Province of British Columbia|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related Canadian Policies ==

In August 2017, British Columbia joined Canada's federal government, represented by [[Natural Resources Canada]], and other provinces and territories in endorsing the ''Build Smart: Canada's Buildings Strategy.'' The strategy commits signatories to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a "net-zero energy ready" model building code by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Build Smart: Canada's Buildings Strategy - A Key Driver of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change|url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/Building_Smart_en.pdf|website=Energy And Mines Ministers' Conference|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In British Columbia, the BC Energy Step Code serves as a technical policy pathway for British Columbia to deliver on that goal.

As of mid-2018, the only other tiered building standard in Canada's is the Toronto Green Standard, which establishes sustainable design requirements for new private and public developments in that city. The Toronto Green Standard consists of stepped levels of performance measures with supporting guidelines that promote sustainable site and building design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Green Standard: Overview|url=https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/toronto-green-standard/toronto-green-standard-overview/|publisher=City of Toronto|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three for All campaign ==
[http://www.threeforall.ca/ Three for All] is a campaign to encourage local governments to consider adopting at least Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code. The campaign was created by an informal coalition of companies and non-profit organizations including The Open Green Building Society, [[Canada Green Building Council|The Canada Green Building Council]], Integral Group, Passive House Canada, [[Pembina Institute|The Pembina Institute]], and Recollective Consulting. The campaign´s primary purpose is to facilitate the sharing of accurate information about BC Energy Step Code adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.threeforall.ca/|title=Three For All – Inspiring Step Code Leadership|website=www.threeforall.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar regulations ==

The New Buildings Institute, a U.S. nonprofit organization advocating for improved energy performance in commercial buildings, describes a stretch code as "a locally mandated or incentivized code or alternative compliance path that is more ambitious than the base code, resulting in buildings that achieve higher energy savings." The institute says the codes provide an opportunity to train building and development communities in advanced practices before the underlying energy code is improved. They help accelerate market acceptance and adoption of more stringent energy efficiency codes in the future. Stretch codes can work in tandem with utility incentive programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stretch Codes|url=https://newbuildings.org/code_policy/utility-programs-stretch-codes/stretch-codes/|website=Codes and Policy|publisher=New Buildings Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the New Buildings Institute released a set of model stretch building code strategies that target 20% better efficiency than current U.S. national building energy codes. The new 20% Stretch Code Provisions address design aspects such as envelope, mechanical, water heating, lighting and plug loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Stretch Code Helps Cities and States Fast Track Building Energy Savings|url=https://newbuildings.org/news/new-stretch-code-helps-cities-states/|publisher=New Buildings Institute|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stretch codes are in place in the United States, in Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13591">The '''Certified Public Manager₢''' (CPM) is a [[United States]] [[Professional certification|professional designation]] established in 1979 for the purpose of improving performance and advancing [[best practice]] standards for [[public sector]] managers. The CPM is a comprehensive [[management]] development program based upon a selected set of [https://web.archive.org/web/20121002043339/http://www.aspaonline.org/scpm/competencies.html competencies]. The CPM is awarded upon completion of a CPM program accredited by the National Certified Public Manager Consortium. CPM graduates come from public, private, and non-profit career fields.
The words "certified public manager" are registered service marks by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Patent and Trademark Office]].

== Requirements ==

Requirements for the CPM vary by program, but all require at least 300&amp;nbsp;hours of training, including classes, application projects, structured readings, and examinations. Each CPM candidate is required to pass a series of courses centering on various management principles. The courses are designed around a set of core competencies and each CPM program requires an evaluation of all major [[curriculum|curricular]] competencies.

=== Curriculum competencies ===

The following competencies are present in all CPM curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPM Curriculum)|url=http://www.cpmconsortium.org/Curriculum|publisher=National CPM Consortium|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of CPM competencies arise from a [[holistic]] approach to management. Communication, organizational management, and ethical principles are emphasized as well as financial responsibility and effective [[change management]]. [[System thinking]] is introduced within the CPM program to emphasize the importance of broad open system management within organization. The program also places importance on personal development and change leadership.

== History ==

The idea for the CPM began in the early 1970s at the [[University Of Georgia|University of Georgia]] with the realization that the state was experiencing explosive growth in information and knowledge, significant new social legislation, and rapidly altering social values. During this time the [[Carl Vinson Institute of Government]] and the Georgia [[Merit system|Merit System]] were offering management training to public employees. It was recognized that these two organizations were offering duplications of training in some areas of management and were failing to meet the needs of other management areas. In 1974 University of Georgia’s Institute of Government, the Georgia Center for Continuing Education, and the Georgia State Merit System for Personnel Administration convened to discuss ways to broaden and refine Georgia state management training programs to meet the challenges of rapid change in the state and society. A consensus was reached that management in the state government needed to become more professional.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Thomas H.|title=The History of the Certified Public Manager|date=8 April 2003|publisher=American Academy of Certified Public Managers|pages=1–38|url=http://www.cpmacademy.org/publications/AACPM_History_20030329.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Henning is considered the father of the CPM. He observed that most state training programs consisted of separate courses in which content was varied and lacked consistent focus. Henning felt that an integrated program would achieve a more organized approach to competencies needed by management. The CPM&amp;nbsp;program was modeled after the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA&amp;nbsp;program]], consisting of the creation of a coordinated program addressing specific and various training needs relevant to management as well as with content involving study and preparation, practice and application of learning, examination, and prestigious recognition. The CPM would also involve the eventual creation of the American Academy of Certified Public Managers similar to the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] as a central capstone organization.

Planners believed that awarding certificates of attendance were insufficient in the creation of a program based on quality. Early planners for the CPM determined that an innovative and rigorous program of study, application of knowledge, examination, and certification should be developed.  University courses and the Georgia Merit System collaborated to reduce training duplication, and maximize efforts. Initially a program was developed in which six courses would be taught, three by the Georgia Merit System and three by the University of Georgia.  
After a series of meetings, two long-term goals for the CPM were created:

* To achieve and subsequently to maintain a level of national recognition for the CPM&amp;nbsp;designation similar to that accorded the Certified Public Accountant&amp;nbsp;(CPA) designation; and
* To foster and encourage the highest possible levels of competence and ethical practice by managers in state and other levels of government through a national body of professionally trained and oriented Certified Public Managers.

After gathering strong support for the CPM program from the governor, legislative leadership, top management of state agencies, [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia], regional intergovernmental personnel assistance (IPA) offices of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Civil Service Commission]], the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/ University of Georgia’s Institute for Government and Center for Continuing Education] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708103007/http://gms.georgia.gov/00/article/0%2C2086%2C683909_6170_11788934%2C00.html Georgia State Merit System of Personnel Administration] co-authored a detailed proposal.

February&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;1976 the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] passed Resolution Act No.&amp;nbsp;97 in response to [[George Busbee|Governor Busbee]]’s request authorizing and directing the State Personnel Board and the State Merit System of Personnel Administration to implement the Certified Public Manager Program in the State Government of Georgia. On February&amp;nbsp;19,&amp;nbsp;1976 the Senate adopted the resolution and the legislature unanimously passed the resolution on February&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;1976. On March&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1976 the CPM was formally established.

In 1977 the Georgia Society of Public Managers was created affiliated with a national organization to be known as the American Academy of Certified Public Managers. In 1980 the National CPM Consortium was developed with the completion of its constitution. The National CPM Consortium included [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Vermont]]. The role of the CPM Consortium is to direct the general nature in which each program should operate, but it is not designed to dictate curriculum or administrative specifics for each program. Since then, the CPM program has expanded across the United States.

== National Certified Public Manager® Consortium ==

On October 6, 1980 the Certified Public Manager Board ratified the constitution of the [http://cpmconsoritum.org National Certified Public Manager® Consortium]. The Consortium is designed to monitor [[accreditation]] standards and facilitate program development of CPM programs around the nation.

== Program linkages ==

The CPM is linked with several professional organizations, including the [http://www.cpmacademy.org/ American Academy of Certified Public Managers], an organization for individuals with CPM accreditation and the [[American Society for Public Administration|American Society for Public Administration&amp;nbsp;(ASPA)]], which provides free membership for CPM graduates. Annually, the [[Texas]] CPM and ASPA host a CPM/ASPA conference. In 2007 a new ASPA section called the Section on Certified Public Management was created to promote professional development and training regarding ethical values and technical competencies associated with outstanding public service. In addition, the SCPM holds conferences, forums, seminars, and discussion events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The William P.

The contract for the CPM program at the Swedish National Defense College was signed along with the [[William&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Hobby]] Center for Public Service which is affiliated with [[Texas State University - San Marcos]] and the National CPM Consortium. The program in Sweden is viewed as the first step toward more international expansion of the CPM.

In 2015, [http://professionallearning.nl/en Leiden University Centre for Professional Learning] in the Netherlands was the first international program to become a member of the National Certified Public Manager Consortium and be granted Associate status. Associate status grants authorization to develop an Accredited Certified Public Manager®&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 National CPM Consortium Annual Meeting|url=http://cpmconsortium.org/Consortium-News|website=cpmconsortium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program.

[[Image:Swiss Made Heuer Carrera.jpg|thumb|"Swiss Made" label on a [[TAG Heuer]] chronograph.]]
[[File:Made in china.jpg|thumb|Country of origin label for a product designed in the United States, but manufactured in China.]] 
'''Country of origin''' ('''COO'''), is the [[sovereign state|country]] of [[manufacture]], production, or growth where an [[merchandise|article]] or product comes from.  There are differing [[rules of origin]] under various national laws and international treaties. Country of origin labelling is also known as ''place-based branding'', the ''made-in image'' or the "nationality bias." In some regions or industries, country of origin labelling may adopt unique local terms such as [[terroir]] used to describe wine appellations based on the specific region where grapes are grown and wine manufactured.

Place-based branding has a very ancient history. Archaeological evidence points to packaging specifying the place of manufacture dating back to some 4,000 years ago. Over time, informal labels evolved into formal, often regulated labels providing consumers with information about product quality, manufacturer name and place of origin.

==Definition==

Country of origin of a product can have several possible definitions. It can refer to:&lt;ref&gt;Field, A.J., Clark, G. and Sundstrom, W.A.,''Research in Economic History,'' Emerald Group Publishing, 2008, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
: (a) "the place from which the merchandise was directly received; that is the last border crossed or port entered before reaching its final destination;
: (b) the country of consignment (i.e. from where the goods were sold); or,
: (c) the country of original growth or extraction."

==History of country-of-origin labelling==
[[File:Relitto di Sant'Andrea B (Elba).jpg|thumb|The distinctive shape and markings on amphorae provided consumers with information about the manufacturer and the place of origin for goods]]
The inclusion of place of origin on manufactured goods has an ancient history. In antiquity, informal branding which included details such as the name of manufacturer and place of origin were used by consumers as important clues as to product quality. David Wengrow has found archaeological evidence of brands, which often included origin of manufacture, dating to around 4,000 years ago. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus providing information about the product and its quality. For instance, an object found in a royal burial tomb in Abydos (southern Egypt) and dating to around 3,000 B.C.E., carries brand elements that would be very familiar to modern consumers. Inscriptions on the  surface denote a specific place of manufacture, "finest oil of Tjehenu," a region in modern-day Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wengrow |first1=David |title=Prehistories of Commodity Branding |journal=Current Anthropology |date=February 2008 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=7–34 |doi=10.1086/523676 |jstor=523676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, place-names appear to have developed independently during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-AD 200); brand names and place names were relatively commonplace on goods. Eckhardt and Bengtsson have argued that in the absence of a capitalist system, branding was connected to social systems and cultural contexts; that brand development was a consumer-initiated activity rather than the manufacturer-push normally associated with Western brand management practices.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eckhardt |first1=Giana M. |last2=Bengtsson |first2=Anders |title=A Brief History of Branding in China |journal=Journal of Macromarketing |date=10 November 2009 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1177/0276146709352219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for purchasers during exchange. Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings functioned as a brand, conveying information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to function as signs of product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twede |first1=Diana |title=Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal=Journal of Macromarketing |date=26 July 2016 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=98–108 |doi=10.1177/027467022001009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places, such as oysters from [[Londinium]] and cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Paquet-Byrne, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, 2003, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius;" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, "Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii c. 35 C.E., was branding his amphora which travelled across the entire Mediterranean. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of [[amphora]] bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J. R. in Dobbins, J. J. and Foss, P. W., ''The World of Pompeii,'' Oxford, Routledge, 2008, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curtis |first1=Robert I. |title=A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |date=October 1984 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=557 |doi=10.2307/504744 |jstor=504744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apothecarybottles.jpg|thumb|left|By the 19th century, formal labels featuring manufacturer name and place of manufacture had become relatively common. Picture Apothecary bottles, c. 1860]]
During the Medieval period in Europe, numerous [[market town]]s sprang up and competition between them intensified. In response to competitive pressures, towns began investing in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors. By the thirteenth century, English counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's [[Blackwell Hall]] became a centre for cloth, [[Bristol]] became associated with a particular type of cloth known as ''Bristol red'', [[Stroud]] was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of [[Worsted]] became synonymous with a type of yarn; [[Banbury]] and [[Essex]] were strongly associated with cheeses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casson |first1=Mark |last2=Lee |first2=John S. |title=The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective |journal=The Business History Review |date=2011 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=9–37 |jstor=41301368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casson and Lee have argued that the chartered markets of England and Europe in medieval times were using the regional market's reputation as a sign of produce quality and that this acted as an early form of branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casson |first1=Mark |last2=Lee |first2=John S. |title=The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective |journal=Business History Review |date=11 May 2011 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=9–37 |doi=10.1017/S0007680511000018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the European age of expansion, goods were imported from afar. Marco Polo, for example, wrote about silk from China and spices from India. Consumers began to associate specific countries with merchandise - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum  and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, European countries began introducing country of origin labelling legislation. In the 20th century, as markets became more global and trade barriers removed, consumers had access to a broader range of goods from almost anywhere in the world. Country of origin is an important consideration in purchase decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Maheswaran, D. and Chi, C.Y., "Nation Equity: Country of Origin Effects and Globalisation," in ''The SAGE Handbook of International Marketing,'' Masaaki Kotabe, Kristiaan Helsen (eds), Sage, 2009, pp 93-93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on consumers==

{{Redirect|Country of origin labeling|the former U.S. regulation commonly known by this name|Country of Origin Labeling}}
The requirements for Country of Origin markings are complicated by the various designations which may be required such as "Made in X", "Product of X", "Manufactured in X" etc. They also vary by country of import and export. For example:

* For imports to the [[United Kingdom]], there is a voluntary code for Food. Other products are not subject to labelling requirements,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file8134.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Guidance Notes for Traders, retrieved 9 Oct. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but misleading labelling can result in prosecution under the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]].
* Food exported to the [[United Arab Emirates]] must include Country of Origin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&amp;_policies/United_Arab_Emirates_Requirements/index.asp {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925154006/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Regulations_%26_Policies/United_Arab_Emirates_Requirements/index.asp |date=2012-09-25 }} US "Export Requirements for United Arab Emirates", retrieved 9 Oct. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Ford Hubcap Made in USA.jpg|thumb|Ford automobile hubcap]]
Section 304 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930]] as amended ({{usc|19|1304}}) requires most imports,{{which|date=January 2013}} including many food items, to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of their country of origin. Meats, produce, and several other raw agricultural products generally were exempt. The [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10816), however, contains a requirement that many retail establishments provide, starting on September 30, 2004, country-of-origin information on fresh fruits and vegetables, red meats, seafood, and peanuts. However, the consolidated FY2004 appropriation (P.L. 108-199) signed January 23, 2004, delayed this requirement for two years except for seafood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Textile Fiber Products Identification Act]] and [[Wool Products Labeling Act]] require a [[Made in USA]] label on clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing.

On a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck, either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product.

Catalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported, or both.

The [[Fur Products Labeling Act]] requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising.

The [[American Automobile Labeling Act]] requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission’s policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission’s standard.

The [[Buy American Act]] requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes. For more information, review the Buy American Act at 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a-10c, the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 C.F.R. Part 25, and the Trade Agreements Act at 19 U.S.C. §§ 2501-2582.

The [[Lanham Act]] gives any person (such as a competitor) who is damaged by a false designation of origin the right to sue the party making the false claim.

===COO marketing===
Companies may indicate the origin of their products with a number of different marketing strategies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aichner |first1=Thomas |title=Country-of-origin marketing: A list of typical strategies with examples |journal=Journal of Brand Management |date=15 November 2013 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.1057/bm.2013.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use of the phrase "Made in..."
* Use of quality and origin labels
* COO embedded in the company name
* Typical COO words embedded in the company name
* Use of the COO language
* Use of famous or stereotypical people from the COO
* Use of COO flags and symbols
* Use of typical landscapes or famous buildings from the COO

==International trade==
{{further|Rules of origin}}
When shipping products from one country to another, the products may have to be marked with country of origin, and the country of origin will generally be required to be indicated in the export/import documents and governmental submissions. Country of origin will affect its admissibility, the rate of duty, its entitlement to special duty or [[trade preference]] programs, [[antidumping]], and [[government procurement]].

Today, many products are an outcome of a large number of parts and pieces that come from many different countries, and that may then be assembled together in a third country. In these cases, it's hard to know exactly what is the country of origin, and different rules apply as to how to determine their "correct" country of origin. Generally, articles only change their country of origin if the work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation, or, the article changes its name, tariff code, character or use (for instance from wheel to car). Value added in the second country may also be an issue.

In principle, the ''substantial transformation'' of a product is intended as a change in the [[harmonized system]] coding. For example, a rough commodity sold from country ''A'' to country ''B'', than subjected of a transformation in country ''B'', which sells the final processed commodity to a country ''C'' is considered a sufficient step to label the end product ''made in B''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.to.camcom.it/f/EIC/15/15408_CCIAATO_23102012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042637/http://images.to.camcom.it/f/EIC/15/15408_CCIAATO_23102012.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television production==
The International Federation of Film Archives defines the country of origin as the "country of the principal offices of the production company or individual by whom the moving image work was made".&lt;ref name="def"&gt;{{cite web

'''Creative Commons''' ('''CC''') is an American [[non-profit organization]] devoted to expanding the range of [[creativity|creative]] works available for others to build upon legally and to share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Creative Commons |date=4 August 2016|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has released several [[copyright]]-[[license]]s known as [[Creative Commons license]]s free of charge to the public. These licenses allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve, and which rights they [[waive]] for the benefit of recipients or other creators. An easy-to-understand one-page explanation of rights, with associated visual symbols, explains the specifics of each Creative Commons license. Creative Commons licenses do not replace copyright, but are based upon it. They replace individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owner (licensor) and [[licensee]], which are necessary under an "all rights reserved" copyright management, with a "some rights reserved" management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no commercial compensation is sought by the copyright owner. The result is an agile, low-overhead and low-cost copyright-management regime, benefiting both copyright owners and licensees.

The organization was founded in 2001 by [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[Hal Abelson]], and [[Eric Eldred]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/history|title=Creative Commons: History|accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of [[Center for the Public Domain]]. The first article in a general interest publication about Creative Commons, written by [[Hal Plotkin]], was published in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2002/02/11/creatcom.DTL|title=All Hail Creative Commons / Stanford professor and author Lawrence Lessig plans a legal insurrection|last=Plotkin|first=Hal|work=|publisher=SFGate.com|accessdate=2011-03-08|date=11 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of copyright licenses was released in December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/history/|title=History of Creative Commons|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding management team that developed the licenses and built the Creative Commons infrastructure as we know it today included [[Molly Shaffer Van Houweling]], Glenn Otis Brown, Neeru Paharia, and Ben Adida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3483|title=Creative Commons Announces New Management Team|last=Haughey|first=Matt|date=2002-09-18|publisher=creativecommons.org|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the [[Open Content Project]], a 1998 precursor project by [[David A. Wiley]], announced the Creative Commons as successor project and Wiley joined as CC director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=2003-08-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/|url=http://opencontent.org/|title=OpenContent is officially closed.

As of May 2018 there were an estimated 1.4 billion works licensed under the various Creative Commons licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stateof.creativecommons.org/|title=State of the Commons – Creative Commons 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=stateof.creativecommons.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wikipedia]] uses one of these licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use |title=Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2018, [[Flickr]] alone hosts over 415 million Creative Commons licensed photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/|title=Flickr: Creative Commons|website=www.flickr.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stateof.creativecommons.org|title=State of the Commons 2017|website=State of the Commons 2017|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Commons is governed by a board of directors. Their licenses have been embraced by many as a way for creators to take control of how they choose to share their copyrighted works.

Creative Commons has been described as being at the forefront of the [[copyleft]] movement, which seeks to support the building of a richer [[public domain]] by providing an alternative to the automatic "all rights reserved" [[copyright]], and has been dubbed "some rights reserved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Sharee L. | last= Broussard| title= The copyleft movement: creative commons licensing | publisher= Communication Research Trends | url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v26/v26_n3.pdf  | date=September 2007 | accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Berry and Giles Moss have credited Creative Commons with generating interest in the issue of [[intellectual property]] and contributing to the re-thinking of the role of the "[[commons]]" in the "[[information age]]". Beyond that, Creative Commons has provided "institutional, practical and legal support for individuals and groups wishing to experiment and communicate with culture more freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry |first=David |url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/commons_without_commonality/ |title=On the "Creative Commons": a critique of the commons without commonalty |publisher=Free Software Magazine |date=15 July 2005 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Commons attempts to counter what [[Lawrence Lessig]], founder of Creative Commons, considers to be a dominant and increasingly restrictive [[permission culture]]. Lessig describes this as "a culture in which creators get to create only with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Lawrence | last=Lessig |url=http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf |year=2004 | title=Free Culture | publisher=Penguin Press | location=New York | page=8 |format=PDF| isbn=978-1-59420-006-9| accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig maintains that modern culture is dominated by traditional content distributors in order to maintain and strengthen their monopolies on cultural products such as popular music and popular cinema, and that Creative Commons can provide alternatives to these restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Ermert, Monika | title=Germany debuts Creative Commons | work=The Register | date=2004-06-15| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/german_creative_commons/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Lessig, Lawrence| year=2006| title=Lawrence Lessig on Creative Commons and the Remix Culture | format=mp3 | work=Talking with Talis | url=http://talk.talis.com/archives/2006/01/lawrence_lessig.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205034639/http://talk.talis.com/archives/2006/01/lawrence_lessig.html | archivedate=2008-02-05 | accessdate=2006-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative Commons Network==
Until April 2018 Creative Commons had over 100 affiliates working in over 75 jurisdictions to support and promote CC activities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network |title=CC Affiliate Network |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate= 15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 this affiliate network has been restructured into a network organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/global-affiliate-network/network-strategy/|title=Network Strategy - Creative Commons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network no longer relies on affiliate organisation but on individual membership organised in Chapter.

===South Korea===
'''Creative Commons Korea''' ('''CC Korea''') is the affiliated network of Creative Commons in South Korea. In March 2005, CC Korea was initiated by Jongsoo Yoon (in Korean: 윤종수), a Presiding Judge of Incheon District Court, as a project of Korea Association for Infomedia Law (KAFIL). The major Korean portal sites, including Daum and Naver, have been participating in the use of Creative Commons licences. In January 2009, the Creative Commons Korea Association was consequently founded as a non-profit incorporated association. Since then, CC Korea has been actively promoting the liberal and open culture of creation as well as leading the diffusion of Creative Common in the country.

Critics also worried that the lack of rewards for content producers will dissuade artists from publishing their work, and questioned whether Creative Commons is the [[commons]] that it purports to be.&lt;ref name="Niva Elkin-Koren, Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit"&gt;{{cite web| first= Niva| last= Elkin-Koren| title= Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit | publisher= The Future of the Public Domain (P.

Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig countered that copyright laws have not always offered the strong and seemingly indefinite protection that today's law provides. Rather, the duration of copyright used to be limited to much shorter terms of years, and some works never gained protection because they did not follow the now-abandoned compulsory format.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Lessig, The Creative Commons"&gt;{{cite web| first= Lawrence| last= Lessig| title= The Creative Commons | publisher= 65 Mont.

Kent Anderson, writing for ''The Scholarly Kitchen'', a blog of the [[Society for Scholarly Publishing]], criticizes CC as being dependent on copyright and not really departing from it, and as being more complex and complicating than the latter – thus the public does not scrutinize CC, reflexively accepting it as one would a [[EULA|software license]] – while at the same time weakening the rights provided by copyright. Anderson ends up concluding that this is the point, and that "Creative Commons receives significant funding from large information companies like [[Google]], [[Nature Publishing Group]], and [[RedHat]]", and that Google money is especially linked to CC's history; for him, CC is "an organization designed to promulgate the interests of technology companies and Silicon Valley generally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/04/02/does-creative-commons-make-sense/ |title=Does Creative Commons Make Sense? |last=Anderson |first=Kent |date=April 2, 2014 |website=The Scholarly Kitchen |publisher=[[Society for Scholarly Publishing]] |access-date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===License proliferation and incompatibility===
[[Mako Hill]] asserted that Creative Commons fails to establish a "base level of freedom" that all Creative Commons licenses must meet, and with which all licensors and users must comply. "By failing to take any firm ethical position and draw any line in the sand, CC is a missed opportunity. ... CC has replaced what could have been a call for a world where 'essential rights are unreservable' with the relatively hollow call for 'some rights reserved.{{' "}} He also argued that Creative Commons worsens [[license proliferation]], by providing multiple licenses that are [[license compatibility|incompatible]].&lt;ref name="Mako Hill, Towards a Standard of Freedom"&gt;{{cite web

The Creative Commons website states, "Since each of the six CC licenses functions differently, resources placed under different licenses may not necessarily be combined with one another without violating the license terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Richard Stallman]] of the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] stated in 2005 that he couldn't support Creative Commons as an activity because "it adopted some additional licenses which do not give everyone that minimum freedom", that freedom being "the freedom to share, noncommercially, any published work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===License misuse===

Creative Commons is only a service provider for standardized license text, not a party in any agreement. Abusive users can brand the copyrighted works of legitimate copyright holders with Creative Commons licenses and re-upload these works to the internet.{{who|date=November 2018}} No central database of Creative Commons works is controlling all licensed works and the responsibility of the Creative Commons system rests entirely with those using the licences.&lt;ref name="Andrew Orlowski, Tragedy of the Creative Commons" &gt;{{cite web| first= Andrew | last= Orlowski| title= The Tragedy of the Creative Commons| publisher= | url=http://andreworlowski.com/2009/07/16/the-tragedy-of-the-creative-commons/ |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is, however, not specific to Creative Commons. All copyright owners must individually defend their rights and no central database of copyrighted works or existing license agreements exists. The [[United States Copyright Office]] does keep a database of all works registered with it, but absence of registration does not imply absence of copyright.

Although Creative Commons offers multiple licenses for different uses, some critics suggested that the licenses still do not address the differences among the media or among the various concerns that different authors have.&lt;ref name="Niva Elkin-Koren, Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit" /&gt;

Lessig wrote that the point of Creative Commons is to provide a middle ground between two extreme views of copyright protection – one demanding that all rights be controlled, and the other arguing that none should be controlled. Creative Commons provides a third option that allows authors to pick and choose which rights they want to control and which they want to grant to others. The multitude of licenses reflects the multitude of rights that can be passed on to subsequent creators.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Lessig, The Creative Commons" /&gt;

===Criticism of the non-commercial license===
[[Erik Möller]] raised concerns about the use of Creative Commons' non-commercial license. Works distributed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license are not compatible with many open-content sites, including Wikipedia, which explicitly allow and encourage some commercial uses. Möller explained that "the people who are likely to be hurt by an -NC license are not large corporations, but small publications like weblogs, advertising-funded radio stations, or local newspapers."&lt;ref name="Erik Moller, The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License"&gt;{{cite web

  |title=The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License
  |author=Moeller, Erik 
  |publisher=Open Source Jahrbuch
  |year=2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig responded that the current copyright regime also harms compatibility and that authors can lessen this incompatibility by choosing the least restrictive license.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Lessig, CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on Important Freedoms"&gt;{{cite web| first= Lawrence| last= Lessig| authorlink=Lawrence Lessig| title= CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on Important Freedoms | publisher= Creative Commons| url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5719 | year=2005 | accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the non-commercial license is useful for preventing someone else from capitalizing on an author's work when the author still plans to do so in the future.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Lessig, CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on Important Freedoms" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hmdmhdfmhdjmzdtjmzdtzktdkztdjz/commons|title=On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code|publisher=[[Chaos Communication Congress|23C3 ''Who can you trust?'']]|year=2006|type=video|id=google video docid=7661663613180520595|accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-commercial licenses have also been criticized for being too vague about which uses count as "commercial" and "non-commercial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Great Minds, a non-profit educational publisher that released works under an -NC license, sued [[FedEx]] for violating the license because a school had used its services to mass-produce photocopies of the work, thus commercially exploiting the works. A U.S. judge dismissed the case in February 2017, ruling that FedEx was an intermediary, and that the provision of the license "does not limit a licensee's ability to use third parties in exercising the rights granted [by the licensor]."&lt;ref name="ars-greatminds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Odd lawsuit fails to ding FedEx for allowing copies of CC-licensed material|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/odd-lawsuit-fails-to-ding-fedex-for-allowing-copies-of-cc-licensed-material/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Minds appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Cavanagh |date=July 20, 2017 |title=Open Ed.

One of circuit judges [[Susan L. Carney]] argued in the court statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold that, in view of the absence of any clear license language to the contrary, licensees may use third‐party agents such as commercial reproduction services in furtherance of their own permitted noncommercial uses. Because FedEx acted as the mere agent of licensee school districts when it reproduced Great Minds' materials, and because there is no dispute that the school districts themselves sought to use Great Minds' materials for permissible purposes, we conclude that FedEx's activities did not breach the license or violate Great Minds' copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Klasfeld |date=March 21, 2018 |url=https://www.courthousenews.com/second-circuit-clears-fedex-in-education-copyright-case/ |title=Second Circuit Clears FedEx in Education Copyright Case |website=Courthouse News Service |accessdate=March 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Great Minds v.

===Personality rights===
In 2007, [[Virgin Mobile Australia]] launched a bus stop advertising campaign which promoted its mobile phone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to the photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] using a [[Creative Commons Attribution 2.5|Creative Commons by Attribution]] license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation being required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL, leading to the photographer's Flickr page, on each of their ads. However, one picture depicted 15-year-old Alison Chang posing for a photo at her church's fund-raising carwash, with the superimposed, mocking slogan "Dump Your Pen Friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8494 |title=Lawsuit over Virgin Mobile's use of Flickr girl blames Creative Commons |work=Out-law.com |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="permission"&gt;{{cite news|first=Noam|last=Cohen|title=Use My Photo?

{{quote|The case hinges on privacy, the right of people not to have their likeness used in an ad without permission. So, while Mr. Wong may have given away his rights as a photographer, he did not, and could not, give away Alison's [[Personality rights|rights]].

On 27 November 2007, Chang filed for a voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit against Creative Commons, focusing their lawsuit against Virgin Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Grant|title=Lawsuit Against Creative Commons Dropped|work=[[PC World]]|date=2007-12-01|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/140189/lawsuit_against_creative_commons_dropped.html|accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was thrown out of court due to lack of jurisdiction and subsequently Virgin Mobile did not incur any damages towards the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LaVine|first=Lindsay|title=Use Photos in Advertisements?

'''Cynthia Payne''' (24 December 1932{{spaced ndash}}15 November 2015) was an English brothel keeper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brothel keeper Cynthia Payne dies|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34828890|newspaper = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-16|date = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and party hostess who made headlines in the 1970s and 1980s, when she was acquitted of running a [[brothel]] at 32 Ambleside Avenue, in [[Streatham]], a southwestern suburb of [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;

Payne first came to national attention in 1978 when police raided her home and found a sex party was in progress. Men paid with [[luncheon voucher]]s to dress up in lingerie and be spanked by young women.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Hugh Davies [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1478955/Paynes-sex-party-souvenirs-for-sale.html "Payne's sex party souvenirs for sale"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 14 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Police found 53 men at her residence, in varying levels of undress, which included "a [[Peerage|peer of the realm]], an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], a number of solicitors and company directors and several vicars". A cartoon in the press at the time, according to [[Sarah Baxter]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', "showed a vicar in bed with a prostitute, confronted by a policeman. 'I demand to see my solicitor,' said the vicar, 'who is in the next bedroom.'"&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Sarah|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/SarahBaxter/article1636348.ece|title=So long, Madam Cyn, a spanking, ethical example to us all|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|date=22 November 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the case came to trial in 1980, Payne was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, reduced to a fine and six months on appeal.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/11/newsid_2539000/2539565.stm "1987: Mrs Payne is no brothel Madam"], BBC On This Day, 11 February&lt;/ref&gt; She served four months in [[Holloway prison]].&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

In 1986, the police raided Payne’s home again, this time during a "special party" she was hosting after shooting of the film of her life had been completed. Although she was acquitted on this occasion,&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; the resulting court case in 1987 made headlines for several weeks with lurid tales, some details of which she aired on ''[[The Dame Edna Experience]]'' in 1987, with co-guests Sir [[John Mills]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]], on which she also launched her book, ''Entertaining at Home''. The court case ended Payne’s career as a party giver.

On the programme, Payne expressed an interest in becoming a [[Member of Parliament]] in order to change Britain's sex laws, which she followed through by standing for Parliament as a candidate for the Payne and Pleasure Party in the [[Kensington by-election, 1988|Kensington by-election in July 1988]], followed by her standing in her own area of [[Streatham (UK Parliament constituency)|Streatham]] for the [[Rainbow Dream Ticket]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 UK General Election]]. She did not gain a parliamentary seat.

There are two films that are loosely based on her life, both released in 1987: ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 movie)|Wish You Were Here]]'', about her adolescence, with [[Emily Lloyd]] in the lead role, and ''[[Personal Services]]'', about her adult life, starring [[Julie Walters]]. Both were written (and ''Wish You Were Here'' was directed) by [[David Leland]]. 

Payne made appearances as an [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]] and launched a range of "adult" services and products in 2006.

Payne died on 15 November 2015, aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/notorious-brothel-owner-cynthia-payne-dies-10339425 |title=Notorious Brothel Owner Cynthia Payne Dies |publisher=[[Sky News]] |work=news.sky.com |date=15 November 2015 |accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family celebrated her life a month later with a colourful [[secular humanist|humanist]] funeral, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.bt.com/news/uk-news/monty-pythons-terry-jones-leads-tributes-at-funeral-of-cynthia-payne-11364027966802|title=Monty Python's Terry Jones leads tributes at funeral of Cynthia Payne|date=9 December 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=BT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Thailand}}
The '''Election Commission''' ({{lang-th|คณะกรรมการการเลือกตั้ง}}, {{RTGS|''Khana Kammakan Kan Lueaktang''}}) is an [[Independent Government Agencies of Thailand|independent government agency]] and the sole [[election management body]] of [[Thailand]]. It oversees government elections (parliamentary elections and local elections) as well as [[referendum]]s throughout the [[Thailand|Kingdom of Thailand]]. Established by the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]], the Election Commission (EC) has extensive powers to manage, oversee, and regulate the electoral process. The EC has reacted to irregularities in the [[Thai Senate election, 2000|2000 Senate elections]], the [[Thai general election, April 2006|2006 House elections]], and the [[Thai general election, 2007|2007 House elections]], forcing re-elections and disqualifying many candidates.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The primary role of the commission is to ensure that [[Elections in Thailand|elections]] carried out in the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] are lawful and compatible with the [[constitution]]. It is also in charge of enforcing national election laws covering: [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand|Senate]], [[Administrative divisions of Thailand|Districts]], [[Thai constitutional referendum, 2007|Referendums]], [[Bangkok#Administration|Bangkok gubernatorial]] elections and [[List of political parties in Thailand|political parties]]. Its constitutional duty includes the publication of all election returns, therefore formalizing them. The commissioners also have the right to disqualify a candidate, or call for a re-count for a particular seat.

The EC's responsibilities include the organization, management, and counting of all elections and voting in the kingdom. It advises the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] on future policies concerning elections and suffrage. The commission has legal powers as a [[law enforcement agency]] to investigate and indict those who compromise election laws through bribery, corruption, vote buying, or blackmail. The commission has the power to investigate the finances and donor lists of all political parties. It informs the public of elections and their importance.

==Budget==
In [[fiscal year|FY2019]] the EC is allocated 8,247 million [[Thai baht|baht]], more than tripling from the FY2018 budget of 2,265 million baht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thailand's Budget in Brief; Fiscal Year 2019 |date=2018 |publisher=Bureau of the Budget |location=Bangkok |page=94 |url=http://www.bb.go.th/en/topic-detail.php?id=8322&amp;mid=456&amp;catID=0 |accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The '''Election Commission of Thailand''' is composed of a committee of five members, one [[chairman]] ({{lang-th|ประธานกรรมการการเลือกตั้ง}}) and four  election commissioners ({{lang-th|กรรมการการเลือกตั้ง}}). The administrative side of the commission is run by the secretary-general ({{lang-th|เลขาธิการคณะกรรมการการเลือกตั้ง}}). As well as being regular members of the commission, the five members are also given various responsibilities. All commissioners are appointed by the [[King of Thailand|king]], with the advice of the [[Senate of Thailand]]; for a term of seven years. The current commission is the fourth team of election commissioners, appointed 13 December 2013.

==History==
Prior to 1992, the responsibility of overseeing elections fell on the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]] or [[Mahatthai Ministry]]. Under the premiership of [[Anand Panyarachun]] after the [[Thai general election, 1992|Thai general election of 1992]], the prime minister realised the need to create a central and independent body, whose sole purpose was to regulate and manage elections. As a result, on 22 March 1992 the "Committee to Administer and Investigate Elections to the House of Representatives" ({{lang-th|"คณะกรรมการติดตามและสอดส่องดูแลการเลือกตั้งสมาชิกสภาผู้แทนราษฎร"}}) was created, a precursor of the commission. The commission in its current form was created by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand]].

===2006 House election===
{{main| Thai general election, April 2006}}

The [[Thai general election, April 2006|Thai general election of 2006]], was held on 9 April for the House of Representatives and 19 April for the Senate. The main opposition parties, composed of the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]], the [[Chart Thai Party]], and the [[Great People's Party|Mahachon Party]], boycotted the election on the grounds that [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s government had unfairly called an election to divert public attention form the [[Shin Corp]] scandal. Despite this, the election went ahead.

On 3 April 2006, the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) petitioned the Administrative Court to suspend the results of the election and accused the Election Commission of violating voter privacy. It accused the commission of placing voting booths so that voters' backs were to the public, when in all previous elections, voters faced the public, with a barrier one-half meter tall at the front of the booth separating the voter from the public. The commission claimed the new arrangement was designed to prevent various forms of polling fraud including the use of cameras by voters to take photographs of their ballots. After the [[Thai general election, 2005|2005 election]], cameras and [[camera phone]]s were banned from voting stations due to fears that canvassers would demand ballot photographs in return for money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/2005/02/006999.htm picturephoning.com: Thai voters banned from using mobile phone cameras at polling booths&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122102933/http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/2005/02/006999.htm |date=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Peter|title=Thailand bans cameraphone pics in voting booths|url=https://www.engadget.com/2005/02/07/thailand-bans-cameraphone-pics-in-voting-booths/|website=Engadget|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the PAD claimed that this allowed onlookers to peek over voters' shoulders and see who they voted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000863.php |title=Administrative Court urged to suspend poll results |work=The Nation |date=7 February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821183221/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000863.php |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bangkokpost.net/News/03Apr2006_news02.php{{DL|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elections were eventually declared invalid by Thailand's [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], which found the positioning of voting booths violated voter privacy. The Constitutional Court forced the Election Commission to resign over its management of the April elections. The court failed to persuade the EC president to resign. It did, however, prevent the Senate from appointing a replacement for commissioner [[Jaral Buranapansri]], who had died.{{CN|date=February 2017}} This prevented the commission from achieving a quorum.{{CN|date=February 2017}} It later found the remaining commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them for one night. An entirely new commission was appointed.

===2007 House election===
{{main|Thai general election, 2007}}
[[Image:Thai general election 2007 18.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Polling Station during the [[Thai general election, 2007|2007 election]]]]

A number of [[members of parliament|MP]]s (mainly those elected for the PPP) were given "[[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]s" for alleged vote buying, meaning they would not be able to contest the resulting by-elections. Other MPs were issued "[[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]s" and not banned from contesting the by-elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3 elected candidates of winning party 'yellow-carded'|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6327256.html|date=26 December 2007|work=People's Daily Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 January 2008, the Election Commission had endorsed 397 MPs and was still investigating 83 MPs for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6332029.html |title=Thai election agency endorses 397 candidates winning general election |work=People's Daily Online |date=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By-elections were held on 13 January, 17 January, 20 January (the day before the first session of the newly elected parliament) and 27 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6347241.html |title=Thai election agency completes filling House seats |work=People's Daily Online |date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electoral Commission was still looking into allegations of fraud by PPP deputy leader Yongyuth Tiyaphairat. If given a red card, the PPP faced dissolution.

===2011 General election===
{{main|Thai general election, 2011}}

On 19 July, both [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] and [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] were acknowledged as members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House]]. On 27 July, the acknowledgement extended to further ninety four elected candidates. Now and eventually, the number acknowledged sufficed to constitute the House. This, however, did not include [[Jatuporn Prompan]] whom the Election Commission declared to have lost the [[suffrage]] due to failure to vote in both the previous and the present elections. The [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|Constitution]] requires that a member of the House must possess the suffrage, and also prescribes that a person failing to vote in an election loses the suffrage but regains it once voting in the next election.&lt;ref name="Thairath-28July"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/today/view/189693 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730210016/http://www.thairath.co.th/today/view/189693 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2011 |title=Jatuporn excluded due to failure to vote; further 94 candidates becoming new MPs |date=28 July 2011 |work=Thairath |accessdate=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The Environmental Integrity Project’s objectives are to “1) To provide objective analysis of how the failure to enforce or implement environmental laws increases pollution and affects the public's health; 2) To hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for failing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; 3) To help local communities in key states obtain the protection of environmental laws.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The EO was designed to strengthen and expand [[Executive Order 11905]], which was originally signed by [[Gerald R. Ford]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="eorea"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Foreign Intelligence Activities - Executive Order 12036|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-12036.htm|date=January 24, 1978|accessdate=November 27, 2016|website=''Federation of American Scientists''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|title=For the President's Eyes Only: Secret Intelligence and the American Presidency from Washington to Bush|date=Feb 1995|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0060170370|page=434|edition=1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Presidents-Eyes-Only-Intelligence-Presidency/dp/0060170379/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background &amp; history==

Upon taking office in 1977, President [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter's administration]] with input from [[United States Congress|Congress]] immediately began to revise EO 11905 that was signed late in the previous year. Pressure and the need for reform of the U.S. Intelligence Community still existed from the [[Church Committee|Church]] and [[Pike Committee]]s. EO 12036 would be signed barely a year after Carter took office on January 24, 1978.&lt;ref name="eorea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt; The EO was hailed by Senator [[Walter D. Huddleston]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] as having the most input from the President and Congress amongst EOs up until that day. Carter also intended the EO to be temporary until new intelligence reform legislation could be put into law.&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt; EO 12036 would be superseded by new legislation in the future.

==Intelligence reform==

Executive Order 12036 created new oversight committees and offered many new restrictions on the U.S. Intelligence Community. The EO set-up the duties and requirements of two [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]-level committees that had been previously created by Carter in 1977. The Policy Review Committee was given the responsibility of defining priorities for intelligence collection and analysis. The Policy Review committee which was chaired by the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) and also included the [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]], [[U.S. National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]], [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] would also prioritize intelligence community budget allocations.&lt;ref name="eorea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt;

The EO replaced Gerald Ford's (EO 11905) [[Oversight of United States covert operations#Operations Advisory Group|Operations Advisory Group]] and replaced it with the [[Oversight of United States covert operations#NSC Special Coordination Committee|Special Coordination Committee]] which was much like the Policy Review Committee. The EO also imposed a lengthy list of restrictions on the U.S. Intelligence Community to ensure "full compliance with the laws of the United States." One of the main restrictions was that no intelligence operation would be undertaken against a U.S. citizen "unless the President has authorized the type of activity involved and the Attorney General has both approved the particular activity and determined that there is probable cause to believe that the United States person is an agent of a foreign power." This included banning any [[Central Intelligence Agency]] electronic surveillance in the U.S. and leaving the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] as the only intelligence community member allowed to conduct physical searches within the U.S.&lt;ref name="eorea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt;

The EO also created the [[National Foreign Intelligence Board]] (NFIB) in order to assist the DCI with "Production, review, and coordination of national foreign intelligence." The NFIB was chaired by the DCI and included representatives from every agency in the intelligence community. The DCI and agency heads were also expected to keep various congressional committees up to date with intelligence community activity.&lt;ref name="eorea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt;

The EO also expanded the U.S. ban on assassination by closing "loop-holes" and stating "No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination."&lt;ref name="eorea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capeo"/&gt; This ban on assassination would be restated in [[Executive Order 12333]].&lt;ref&gt;CRS Report for Congress Assassination Ban and E.O. 12333: A Brief Summary January 4th, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2347">{{about|the quasi-legal concept||Finders Keepers (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''Finders, keepers''' is an English adage with the premise that when something is unowned or abandoned, whoever finds it first can claim it. This idiom relates to an ancient Roman law of similar meaning and has been expressed in various ways over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/finders,+keepers |title=Finders, keepers &amp;#124; Define Finders, keepers at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular difficulty is how best to define when exactly something is unowned or abandoned, which can lead to legal or ethical disputes.

==Application==
*One of the most common uses of "Finders, Keepers" involves [[shipwreck]]s. Under international [[maritime law]], for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a [[Marine salvage|salvage]] operation.
*Philosophies that advocate a right to own land and other natural resources often appeal to the doctrine of finders keepers in the case of claiming ownership of what was previously unowned (see [[Terra nullius]]).
*In the United States, the [[Homestead Act]] allowed people to claim land as their own as long as it was originally unowned and the property was then developed by the claimant.
* In the field of [[social simulation]], [[Rosaria Conte]] and [[Cristiano Castelfranchi]] have used "finders, keepers" as a case study for simulating the evolution of [[norm (social)|norms]] in simple societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/1/2.html Nicole J. Saam and Andreas Harrer: Simulating Norms, Social Inequality, and Functional Change in Artificial Societies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's usage==
The children's rhyme upon discovering a lost object is "Finders, keepers; Losers, weepers".

The '''Flour War''' refers to a wave of riots from April to May 1775, in the northern, eastern, and western parts of the [[Kingdom of France]]. It followed an increase in grain prices, and subsequently bread prices; bread was an important source of food among the populace. Contributing factors to the riots include poor weather and harvests, and the withholding by police of public grain supplies from the royal stores in 1773-74. This large-scale revolt subsided following wheat price controls imposed by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], [[Louis XVI]]'s [[Controller-General of Finances]] (before the supply recovered), and the deploying of military troops. 

The Flour War was part of a broader social and political crisis during the [[Ancien Régime]]. Recent analyses tend to treat this event not only as a revolt caused by hunger, but also as a prelude to the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourguinat|first=Nicolas|title=L'État et les violences frumentaires en France sous la Restauration et la Monarchie de Juillet|url=http://ruralia.revues.org/2|work=Ruralia|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Causes==
In [[Ancien Régime France]], bread was the main source of food for poor peasants and the king was required to ensure the food supply of his subjects, being affectionately nicknamed ''le premier boulanger du royaume'' ("prime baker of the kingdom").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=Hms7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22premier+boulanger+du+royaume%22&amp;dq=%22premier+boulanger+du+royaume%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIp5bt6O3SxwIVQ7MUCh1iEQZH "Labyrinthe, Numéros 20 à 22", 2005, p. 58]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the role of the royal police involved far more  than simply upholding the law. [[Police]] held responsibility over many systems in society, even street sweeping, they also exercised a strict control over the food supply.&lt;ref&gt;[Andress, David. French Society in Revolution, 1789–1799. France: Manchester University Press, 1999, pp. 16–18]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain [[social order]], the grain market was subject to harsh rules to ensure the quality of the bread and its availability at all times and for the entire population. Grain merchants were viewed with suspicion, they were called "the most cruel enemies of the people" because they were suspected of mixing flour with other products (such as [[chalk]] or crushed [[bone]]s) or of hoarding grain to raise artificially the price of this vital commodity. The Ancien Régime favoured a "[[moral economy]]" where cupidity was moderated by strict regulations. The police controlled the purity of the flour and made sure that no one would hide grain to drive up prices. Food scarcity was common in the 18th century, but the grain police would forbid exports from regions facing bad harvests and would import grain from regions enjoying overproduction. It could also force a merchant to [[Dumping (pricing policy)|drop the price]] of his flour (he was later compensated for his loss in times of abundance).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kaplan,Jean-Philippe de Tonnac, "La France et son pain: Histoire d'une passion" [https://books.google.fr/books?id=UHA7fvHVBFkC&amp;pg=PT94&amp;dq=police+des+farines+ancien+r%C3%A9gime&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7kCVc-kLsrpUvuxgKAF&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=police%20des%20farines%20ancien%20r%C3%A9gime&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[Physiocracy|physiocrat]] [[Schools of economic thought|school of economy]] emerged. The physiocrats, or ''économistes'' as they called themselves, had a great impact on Turgot, who was to become Controller-General of Finances preceding the riots. Their opinion on what government economic policy should be was summarized in the term [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay|Vincent de Gournay]] laid claim to: "laissez faire, laissez passer", meaning leave it alone and let it pass, also known as the "[[invisible hand]]" notion. Turgot passionately defended Gournay's belief in "[[laissez-faire]]" economic principles in his writing "Éloge de Gournay".&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, David M. (2008). [http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/TurgotBio.html "Life and Works of Anne Robert Jacques Turgot"]. ''Concise Encyclopedia of Economics''. [[Liberty Fund]]&lt;!-- NOTE: This biography is an original work available only on this website. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Turgot abolished police regulations and established free trade in grain on 13 September 1774.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralia.revues.org/2 Nicolas Bourguinat, "L'État et les violences frumentaires en France sous la Restauration et la Monarchie de Juillet", Ruralia, ]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period before the spring harvest of 1775, the cereal reserves were exhausted while new crops had not yet arrived. In spring 1775, famine arose: before Turgot's edict, every region faced its own shortages, so that some would have suffered a genuine famine while others would have been totally spared and supplied through stable prices; a royal intervention would have been requested, and without a doubt obtained, to assure the supply of the regions most affected. With liberalization, owners of grain started to speculate by [[Hoarding (economics)|storing grain]]. They also tend to buy en masse in areas of good harvests to sell in areas of bad harvests where profits could be greater, causing significant price increases and shortages all over and affecting more people more quickly. Changes to grain and bread supply had serious implications, and was met with disorder. This conflict was known as the "Flour War of 1775". Reports from those that controlled the flow of grain stated there were problems with the grain harvest which caused shortages and less grain availability. The price of grain also increased, and became hard for some to afford. News of a grain shortage was met with skepticism and frustration rose from higher prices.&lt;ref name="Andress"&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt; Those in opposition of the reform rioted, and seized grain that came in on shipments. They offered what they felt was the "[[just price]]" for it. This demonstrated a way in which the people took some power back into their own hands. This practice was known as "taxation populaire", or popular taxation.&lt;ref name="Andress"&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were documented efforts to deal with the grain shortage problems, such as increasing shipments from foreign countries, beliefs that the famine was intentionally orchestrated by [[Louis XVI]], through the "[[Pacte de Famine]]", emerged.&lt;ref name="Andress"&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt; Turgot repressed the riots and restored controls over the grain market. The idea of free trade of grain was discredited and the economic experiment distanced the masses from the government in Versailles. The Flour War can be seen as a prelude to the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourguinat|first=Nicolas|title=L'État et les violences frumentaires en France sous la Restauration et la Monarchie de Juillet|url=http://ruralia.revues.org/2|work=Ruralia|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These events can be interpreted as a reaction against the edict from Turgot, which liberalized grain commerce on September 13, 1774; indeed, this liberalization appeared contrary to a "moral economy", as some people were [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] flour in order to drive up prices. This shortage of flour broke the principle that required the king to ensure the security of his subjects and their food supply. Said Flour War was in line with previous wheat fluctuations, and ushered in the wheat riots of [[French Republican Calendar|Year II]].

== Events ==

=== Wheat riots ===

==== Causes and stages of frumentary violence ====

During the period before the spring harvest of 1775, the cereal reserves were exhausted while the new harvest had not yet arrived. In spring 1775, famine arose in this new context: before Turgot's edict, every region faced its own shortages, so that some would have suffered a genuine famine while others would have been totally spared and supplied through stable prices; a royal intervention would have been requested, and without a doubt obtained, to assure the supply of the regions most affected. With liberalization, grains could leave spared regions to go the worst affected areas, causing significant price increases and shortages all over affecting more people more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;food prices were very unstable, collapsing very quickly in the case of abundance and vice versa&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of grain and of bread rose suddenly, and became a desperate burden on the poorest populations. There ensued major popular unrest at markets and other flour distribution locations. Rumors spread against the "power-grabbers" and "monopolizers". This type of popular reaction against the merchants was a constant in times of famine, but it took on an unusual depth.

For a long time, the theory of a political plot woven against Turgot by various coteries of the Court has been advanced as an explanatory factor, a thesis historian [[George Rudé]] has dashed.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==== Main stages of an Ancien Régime riot, from obstruction to looting ====

Over 17 days, 180 conflicts would be listed from the [[Paris Basin]]; Jean Nicolas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolas|first=Jean|title=La Rébellion Française, Mouvements populaires et conscience sociale (1661-1789)|year=2008|publisher=Folio|location=France|isbn=978-2070359714|pages=253–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  notes 123 distinct riots. Cynthia Bouton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bouton|first=Cynthia|title=The Flour War: Gender, Class, and Community in Late Ancient Regime French Society|year=1993|publisher=Penn State University Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0271010557}}&lt;/ref&gt;  turns up 313 occurrences, sometimes interpreted as "anarchic movements", sometimes as the anticipation of rural revolts. These demonstrations of the moral economy took three distinct forms:
* in exporting regions, one notices spontaneous working-class taxation, and more or less organized looting. The rioters denounce speculation, forcing large farmers and land-owners to sell their stocks on the market at a "fair price", eventually looting bakeries and warehouses, while claiming to restore the principles of economic morality.
* in the cities, warehouse and bakery attacks are organized in a similar fashion.
* finally, erect obstacles to channels of communication, on rivers and roads, in areas of large cultivation. More by basic survival instinct than by malicious intent, the rioters hinder transport of a particular agricultural province's wheat to other provinces with higher purchasing power.

Victims were usually merchants or farmers, but more common, as shown by Cynthia Bouton, they were the direct representatives of power. The riots were often directed against the profiteer millers or against counselors of parliament, as they were that day, April 18, in [[Dijon]]. On April 27, the movement hit the great cultivated plains, initially West [[Burgundy]] then, gradually, [[Beauvaisis]], and finally [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] and [[Brie (region)|Brie]]. The rebels were in front of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on May 2 and 3; the mob plundered the bakeries of Paris. [[Louis XVI]] appeared anxious, because some slogans and lampoons implicated his court. The destruction was in reality very limited, the main targets were the boats carrying the wheat, which were sunk.

==== Return to order ====

Order was reestablished by a pair of government actions:
* Repression, by the intervention of 25,000 soldiers, 162 arrests, and the hanging of two rioters (a 28-year-old wigmaker and his 16-year-old companion who were executed as examples in [[Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville - Esplanade de la Libération#The Place de Grève|Place de Grève]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Bernard|title=Louis XVI|year=2006|publisher=Gallimard Folio Biographies|location=France|isbn=9782070307494|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assistance to the population by the organization of food supplies to provinces in need as well as obligations placed on supply owners to sell their product at a fixed price. The king sent an increased number of messages to the peasant masses, in particular through the preaching of the clergy.

Five months were needed to put a definitive end to the trouble, but most of the problems were over by May 11, 1775.

=== Political and social critique ===
{{Essay|date=July 2016}}
* The fear of famine became an ever-present dread for the lower strata of the [[Third Estate]], and rumors of the "[[Pacte de Famine]]" to starve the poor were still rampant and readily believed.&lt;ref name=Doyle121&gt;Doyle, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere rumors of food shortage led to the [[Réveillon riots]] in April 1789. Rumors of a plot aiming to destroy wheat crops in order to starve the population provoked the [[Great Fear]] in the summer of 1789. The hunger and despair of the Parisian women was also the original impetus for the [[Women's March on Versailles]] in October 1789, they wanted not just one meal but the assurance that bread would once again be plentiful and cheap.&lt;ref name=Soboul155&gt;Soboul, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the realm of politics, the outcome provoked fundamental modifications to the government and a change in royal policies. Turgot calls for and obtains, on behalf of Louis XVI, the resignation of the Lieutenant General of Police, [[Jean-Charles-Pierre Lenoir]].
* A few libelous statements, very localized in origin, blamed the king himself: one would find attacks against "the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] blood", but these writings were the doing of a cultivated population and of learned pens
{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}. For Kaplan, the event marked the growing disenchantment of the people toward the king, a step toward the rupture of the sacred bond between the king and his subjects.
* However, the rioters showed a paradoxical nature, evincing the characteristics of economic morality brought to light by the historians E.P. Thompson and Charles Tilly: on the one hand, a request to return to royal paternalism, and at the same time, a critique of governmental policy. Two opposing logics: one that obeys the laws of property, and one that obeys morality. The rioters challenged public authority and requested the restoration of fair pricing. Lacking a response, set up a practice of rules of internal order: regulatory power.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* Finally, these rioters were a sign of a desire for food justice and redistribution, based upon a strong demand for regulation and supervision. The bread rioters could further be compared to jacqueries, in the sense where they were not trained against political authority, they were not doing it to usurp power, but they were obeying a communal discipline. Grain access and fair pricing of bread emerged as universal rights.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* On the social level, sources witnessed an increase in social tensions and social polarization: a small group of elite rich farmers were opposed to the masses of increasingly poor farmers. The peasants, described by certain sources as Insurgents, were accompanied by village officials (who were sometimes forced) and by parish priests, like in Normandy.

The rioters' targets were therefore those individuals who were free of communal discipline: farmers and owners of large farms in the Paris Basin, and, to a lesser extent, the bourgeoisie of the cities. Occasionally, noble landholders or clerics, farmers who had status in the feudal system, for example Jacques-Pierre de Hericourt, farmer of [[Cagny, Somme|Cagny]], in Brie, lord of Chesany.
* The issues around wheat and the social issues demonstrated the structural weakness of the kingdom's economy, but they also heralded the emergence of a new anti-establishment rhetoric.

'''Frank Hoover Easterbrook''' (born September 3, 1948) is a [[United States federal judge|United States Circuit Judge]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]. He was Chief Judge from November 2006 to October 2013, and has been a judge on the court since 1985.

==Early life and education==

Easterbrook was born in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on September 3, 1948, the son of Vimy and George Easterbrook. He is the older brother of author [[Gregg Easterbrook]] and of Neil, an English professor at [[Texas Christian University]]. Easterbrook attended [[Kenmore West High School]] in [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda]] New York, where he was the classmate of [[Wolf Blitzer]]. The two were good friends and were the leads of the KWHS rendition of ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]''. Easterbrook's future wife was property mistress of the production. He attended [[Swarthmore College]], where he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree with high honors. He received his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Chicago Law School]] (where he was an editor of the [[University of Chicago Law Review|law review]] with [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]] and a member of the [[Order of the Coif]]) in 1973, and then clerked for Judge [[Levin Hicks Campbell]] on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]].&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/easterbrook-frank-hoover|title=Easterbrook, Frank Hoover - Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

In 1974, along with [[Danny Julian Boggs|Danny Boggs]], he joined the [[United States Solicitor General]]'s office as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, and was promoted in 1978 to Deputy Solicitor General. The solicitor general at the time was [[Robert Bork]], and Easterbrook has reminisced that when he joined the Solicitor General's office, "''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that around the same time the SG's Office had hired three lawyers either fresh from clerkships or lacking the customary appellate experience. None of us had clerked on the Supreme Court. The ''Post'' concluded that good lawyers were no longer willing to work for the Solicitor General and attributed this to Bork's role in [[Saturday Night Massacre|firing]] [[Archibald Cox]] as [[Watergate]] special prosecutor. The paper thought that dark days lay ahead for the Office with a second-rate staff.

Easterbrook joined the faculty of the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1978 (and is still a senior lecturer there today), and was a principal at [[Lexecon]] from 1980 until his judicial appointment. Easterbrook argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court while in the Solicitor General's office and in private practice, including several landmark [[antitrust]] cases.

==Nomination and judicial career==

Easterbrook was nominated to the court by [[Ronald Reagan]] on August 1, 1984 to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333, 346; the [[United States Senate]] did not act on his nomination that year, and he was renominated in Reagan's second term on February 25, 1985.&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt;

He was confirmed by the Senate on April 3, 1985, and received his commission the next day.&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt; The [[American Bar Association]] gave Easterbrook a low "qualified/not qualified" rating, presumably due to his youth and relative inexperience. In 2001 this rating was claimed by the [[George W. Bush administration]] as evidence of [[liberal bias]] in the ABA in its announcement that it would no longer confer with the ABA in selecting judicial nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NR&amp;d_origin=transcripts&amp;z=NR&amp;p_theme=nr&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F56F93633B2E53E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=ANALYSIS: BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO END THE PRACTICE OF CONSULTING THE ABA ABOUT POTENTIAL NOMINEES FOR FEDERAL JUDGESHIPS BEFORE MAKING THEIR NAMES PUBLIC|date=March 23, 2001|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/us/31bar.html?em|title=Legal Group’s Neutrality Is Challenged|last=[[Adam Liptak|Liptak, Adam]]|date=March 30, 2009|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Judge Easterbrook's most prominent opinions are:
* ''[[American Booksellers v. Hudnut]]'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/hudnut.html|title=American Booksellers Association v. Hudnut (7th Cir. 1985)|website=www.bc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young judge in one of his early opinions, ''Kirchoff v. Flynn'', 786 F.2d 320 (CA7 1986), a lawsuit over an arrest for feeding pigeons in a park, Easterbrook used such language as "trundled to the squadrol" to describe an arrest; and states of the pigeon-feeder that she "will never be confused with the 30th [[Earl of Mar]], whose hobby was kicking pigeons". He described a controversy over whether a police officer, or the plaintiff's own bird, had attacked the plaintiff as: "[Plaintiff] says that he was clobbered by a pair of handcuffs; [the officer] maintains that the [plaintiffs]' red macaw drew the blood when it landed on [plaintiff]'s head during the fracas and started pecking". In a footnote, he added "Predatory birds rarely attack large animals whose eyes they can see, 11 Harv.Med. School Health Letter 8 (Feb.1986), and perhaps William's eyes got distracted, to his macaw's glee." This serves as an example of Easterbrook's sophisticated deftness with language and breadth of knowledge. This deftness sometimes, however, results in passages from his opinions that require dictionaries in order for a layman to understand, such as in ''Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation'', 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987), where he wrote, "The absence of ineluctable answers does not imply the privilege to indulge an unexamined gestalt."

[[University of Chicago Law School]] Dean [[Saul Levmore]] stated that "Easterbrook is an important influence on legal education through his judicial opinions. Course after law school course has changed for the better as Judge Easterbrook’s opinions have made their way into the curriculum. So long as he decides cases, and decides them in a way that cuts to the heart of an issue with such skill and pressure, no area of law can be dull".&lt;ref name=Portrait/&gt;

Easterbrook had a reputation for being "hard-nosed and demanding" during oral argument.&lt;ref name=Portrait/&gt; In ''Schlessinger v. Salimes'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=7th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=961730|title=FindLaw's United States Seventh Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, he characterized the lawsuit as "goofy" and the appellant's arguments as "nutty" before issuing an order to show cause why the appellant and lawyer should not be sanctioned for a frivolous appeal. His demeanor has won him enemies in the bar. In 1994 the Chicago Council of Lawyers published an "evaluation" of the Seventh Circuit that evaluated all the judges and the court's procedures in general, but notably focused extensively on only two: Easterbrook and then-chief judge [[Richard Posner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagocouncil.org/ccl/projects/fd_evaluations/7th_district/iintrodu.htm|title=''Evaluation of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit'' – Chicago Council of Lawyers|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of Easterbrook contained an unusual number of grievances; and the Council did not specify authorship, so the criticism is anonymous. In a section devoted to Easterbrook's judicial demeanor, the report claims he "has consistently displayed a temperament that is improper for a Circuit Judge. While Judge Easterbrook has many good qualities, there is a widespread belief that he is arrogant and intolerant with those who do not match his own intellectual level. This problem seriously interferes with the performance of his duties". The report continued to state Easterbrook "has been resoundingly and repeatedly criticized as being extremely rude to attorneys at oral argument" and that "some attorneys" said that due to the judge's demeanor they and their clients did not feel they got a fair hearing. The Council pointed to another opinion, ''Kale v. Obuchowski'', which derided a lawyer's argument as "pettifoggery" and concluded that the appeal was "frivolous, doomed and sanctionable".&lt;ref&gt;''Kale v. Obuchowski'', 985 F.2d 360 (7th Cir. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The Council argued that even if the lawyer's conduct was sanctionable, "the language chosen does not enhance the administration of justice".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, this review by the Council was never repeated, lending partial support to the defenders of Easterbrook and Posner that the report was an opportunity for anonymous venting by lawyers who were unhappy with the results of Seventh Circuit decisions, in no small part thanks to the decisions of Reagan appointees Easterbrook and Posner. Posner has recently commented about the report, "You have here some anonymous people who are talking to the Chicago Council of Lawyers. How much credence should we put on these people? They can be sore losers. They can be crybabies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/posner-cjr.html ''Judging Richard''], law.uchicago.edu; accessed April 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Easterbrook served as Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit from 2006 to 2013. He is a member of the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]] and head of the [[Judicial council (United States federal courts)|Judicial Council]] for the Seventh Circuit.&lt;ref name=Portrait/&gt;

==Influences==

Easterbrook called [[Learned Hand]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] his "judicial heroes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/7038-1 Life and Career of Frank Easterbrook], c-spanvideo.org; accessed April 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
In December 2017, Easterbrook supported the 4-3 en banc decision to reverse an earlier federal magistrate judgement that a confession had been unlawfully coerced from 16 year old [[Brendan Dassey]]. The dissenting opinion described this decision as 'a travesty of justice'.

==Academic work==

Easterbrook's academic work focuses on [[corporate law]], particularly the 1991 book ''The Economic Structure of Corporate Law'', which he coauthored with [[Daniel Fischel]]. Easterbrook's article, "The Proper Role of a Target's Management in Responding to a Tender Offer", 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1161 (1981) (also coauthored with Fischel) is the most heavily cited corporate law article in legal scholarship.  Easterbrook has also written articles on antitrust law and [[judicial interpretation]], including ''Abstraction and Authority'', 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 349 (1992); ''Statutes' Domains'', 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533 (1983); and ''Textualism and the Dead Hand'', 66 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1119 (1998).

'''''Granholm v. Heald''''', 544 U.S. 460 (2005), was a court case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in a 5–4 decision that ruled that laws in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michigan]] that permitted in-state [[winery|wineries]] to ship [[wine]] directly to consumers, but prohibited out-of-state wineries from doing the same, were unconstitutional. The case was unusual because the arguments centered on the rarely invoked [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], ratified in 1933, which ended [[Prohibition]] in the United States.

==Background==
''Granholm v. Heald'' was the conclusion of an eight-year fight by small wineries against these laws. Although direct shipments to consumers constituted only about 2% of wine sales in the United States (whose total sales were $21.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in 2003), direct sales were thought to be an opportunity for growth.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Three-tier system (alcohol distribution)|Laws varied from state to state]], but typically a winery could distribute wine only by selling it to a [[wholesaler]] in the state. Retailers were then required to purchase from the wholesalers. This made the large wholesalers very powerful in the wine industry; if wholesalers in New York decided not to purchase wine from a particular winery, then that winery would be completely shut out of the New York market.

==Arguments==
The court case, which was a consolidation of two separate lawsuits, pitted the [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] doctrine, inferred from the Constitution's [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], against Section Two of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]]. 
Section Two of the 21st Amendment reads:
:''The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.''
The [[Commerce Clause]] of Article One of the Constitution grants Congress the power:
:''To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.''

In turn, the [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] (or "DCC") has been inferred from the Commerce Clause.  The DCC is a doctrine, evolved over many decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], that the states do not have the power to enact anticompetitive laws that discriminate against sellers in other states without the permission of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Eleanor Heald, a wine collector, and eleven other plaintiffs, argued that Michigan's Liquor Control Code violated the DCC by making it a misdemeanor for an out-of-state winery to ship wine directly to a Michigan resident while not prohibiting direct shipping by in-state wineries.  The same argument was made in a separate case against the government of the state of New York by Juanita Swedenburg and other owners of out-of-state wineries.

In these two cases, the state governments of Michigan and New York had argued that Section 2 of the 21st Amendment granted them ''carte blanche'' to regulate liquor.  One of their justifications for the laws was that by regulating out-of-state wineries in this way, they might be able to hinder the shipment of alcohol to underage minors; this would serve a valid state purpose.

The government of New York had won in the federal [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court]], and the government of Michigan had lost in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit]]. The cases were consolidated and heard together by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court decided the states' laws were unconstitutional.  The context of the 21st Amendment, they wrote, was to return to the ''status quo'' that existed before Prohibition, making it clear that the states had the power to regulate alcohol however they wished, including banning alcoholic beverages entirely within the state if desired. Before Prohibition, the states did not have the power to violate the Dormant Commerce Clause, and the 21st Amendment was not intended to grant them this power.

==Consequences==
Michigan's liquor control board announced it would recommend to the state government that it ban ''all'' direct wine sales to consumers, joining the 15 other states currently banning all such sales.

New York governor [[George Pataki]] unveiled a bill that would limit each winery's direct sales to consumers to two cases per month per consumer.  As a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial noted,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} two cases per month is a relatively large amount of wine for a consumer, but the measure was intended to reduce competition for New York alcohol distributors.  New York State enacted a bill in 2006 that allows direct shipment of wine to consumers on a reciprocal basis; New York residents can purchase wine shipped from a state that grant New York wineries the same rights.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |first=William |last=Glunz |url=http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1281&amp;context=lawreview |title=Granholm v. Heald:  The Twenty-First Amendment Takes Another Hit - Where Do States Go From Here? |volume=40 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2007 |publisher=The John Marshall Law Review  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ruling, many more states have allowed direct shipping from wineries.  According to the Wine Institute (a public policy advocacy association of California wineries) 37 states permit at least some form of direct shipping from wineries to consumers (as of July 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wi.shipcompliant.com/Home.aspx?SaleTypeID=1|title=Direct Shipping Map |publisher=The Wine Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different states have enacted different regulations. An editorial article on the commercial wine selling web site ''Appelation America'' says that many of the conditions in these regulations are either so complex or so expensive as to discourage wineries from complying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wine.appellationamerica.com/wine-review/378/Wine-Direct-Shipping-Review.html|title=Wine Direct Shipping Review |publisher=Appellation America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, a bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would explicitly allow states to regulate alcohol products from outside of the state differently from those produced within the state.&lt;ref name=WhiteRobbery&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/opinion/04white.html |title=Wholesale Robbery in Liquor Sales |first=David|last=White |date=3 April 2011|publisher=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[https://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com Harbour Litigation Funding]''' or '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''Harbour'''' is one of the UK's first litigation funders (see [[Litigation Funding (UK)]]) and one of the largest litigation funders in the world, measured by the size of its investment funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Litigation funders become big business|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/25/litigation-funders-booming-market-uk|accessdate=14 June 2013|author=The Guardian|archivedate=25 May 2012|location=London|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates hubs in London and Asia Pacific and has funded litigation in 13 jurisdictions and arbitration under 4 arbitral rules.

Litigation funders pay all or part of the costs of a dispute. If the case is won and monies received, they take a pre-agreed share of the proceeds. If the case is lost, the loss is the funder's - not the claimant's (see [[Litigation Funding (UK)]].

== History ==
Harbour authorised and regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]], was founded in 2007 by Susan Dunn and Martin Tonnby and is one of the UK’s first litigation funders. The origins of the business date back to 2002.

The Civil Justice Council established a regulatory body responsible for litigation funding and ensuring compliance with the Code. That body is called the Association of Litigation Funders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Litigation Funders|url=http://associationoflitigationfunders.com/|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbour is a founding member of the Association of Litigation Funders and has both adopted the Code and undertaken to comply with it at all times.

'''Herbert Wechsler''' (December 4, 1909 – April 26, 2000) was a legal scholar and former director of the [[American Law Institute]] (ALI).  He is most widely known for his [[constitutional law]] scholarship and for the creation of the [[Model Penal Code]]. ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' has identified Wechsler as one of the most cited legal scholars of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Fred R. |year=2000 |title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars |journal=Journal of Legal Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=409–426 |doi=10.1086/468080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wechsler entered [[City College of New York]] at 16 and graduated in 1928, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Herbert Wechsler, Legal Giant, Is Dead at 90 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E0DB1F30F93BA15757C0A9669C8B63 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2000-04-28 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at [[Columbia Law School]], served as editor-in-chief of the [[Columbia Law Review]] at 20, and graduated in 1931. After graduation, he joined the faculty and took a one-year leave to clerk for  Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]] of the [[US Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="C250"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/your_columbians/herbert_wechsler.html|title=C250 Celebrates Your Columbians: Herbert Wechsler|publisher=Columbia University|author=Rudy Carmenaty|year=2004|accessdate=2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ali.org/ali/R2204_Wechsler.htm |title=Herbert Wechsler |publisher=ALI Reporter |date=Summer 2000 |accessdate=2007-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109175918/http://www.ali.org/ali/R2204_Wechsler.htm |archivedate=2007-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawyer==
In 1940, Wechsler went to [[Washington, DC]], to work for the [[US Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. He argued five cases in front of the US Supreme Court during that period.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

During [[World War II]], Wechsler served as assistant attorney general in charge of the War Division. 

In 1945 and 1946, he was a principal assistant to US Judge [[Francis Biddle]] and US Alternate Judge [[John J. Parker]] at the [[Nuremberg trial]], the trial of the principal Nazi war criminals. He then returned to [[Columbia Law School]], where he remained an active professor until 1978, when he took [[emeritus]] status.&lt;ref name="C250"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;

In 1959, Wechsler delivered his Holmes lecture at [[Harvard Law School]], "Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law." It was also around this time that Wechsler authored a number of [[casebook]]s that changed ideas about criminal law and the federal courts. In 1963, Wechsler's proposed official draft of the [[Model Penal Code]] was approved, bringing to a close a decade-long project at the [[American Law Institute]]. His wife, Doris Wechsler, noted that he considered the Model Code to be his greatest achievement. Shortly after the approval of the Model Code, Wechsler was named director of the Institute, a position which he held until 1984.&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;

In 1964, Wechsler argued the seminal case ''[[New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in that case unanimously held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] barred awards of damages to a public official for defamation relating to his or her official conduct unless the public official proves "actual malice."&lt;ref name="C250"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speaking"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrams|first=Floyd|title=Speaking Freely|publisher=Viking Press|year=2005|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
During Wechsler's tenure as director, the American Law Institute completed the second restatement of the [[Conflict of laws|Conflict of Laws]], [[Contract]]s, [[Judgment]]s, and [[Torts]] as well as the original restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States and large parts of the Second Restatement of [[Property law|Property]]. The Institute also conducted various studies in federal taxation and completed the Federal [[Securities regulation in the United States|Securities]] Code, the Model [[Land development|Land Development]] Code, the Model Code of [[Arraignment|Pre-Arraignment]] Procedure, the Study of the Division of [[Jurisdiction]] Between State and Federal Courts, and made major revisions to the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. The ALI's Principles of [[Corporate governance|Corporate Governance]] and the current Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States were also conceived, initiated, and developed under his direction.&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;

Following his retirement as director of the ALI in 1984, Wechsler remained active in the Institute's activities as a member of the council until his death in 2000.&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1993, Wechsler became the third recipient of the American Law Institute's [[Henry J. Friendly]] Medal for "outstanding achievement in promoting reform and clarification of the law" and for the way that his "outstanding intelligence, integrity, and devotion to the law... enriched the subjects of Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, and Federal Jurisdiction, as well as legal thinking generally."&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;

Wechsler also received the Association Medal of the [[New York City Bar Association]] for exceptional contributions to the honor and standing of the bar in the community.

There have been numerous attempts to '''impeach federal judges''' in the United States; a few have been successful in either forcing resignation or removing the judge. {{As of|November 2003}} there have been sixty-one [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] or Supreme Court Justices investigated for impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Warren S. Grimes, "Hundred-Ton Gun Control: "Preserving Impeachment as the Exclusive Removal Mechanism for Federal Judges." UCLA Law Review, Vol. 38, No. 5, June 1991; n 21, p. 1213, citing J. Borkin, ''The Corrupt Judge'' 219–58 (1962). See also Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, ''Impeachment: An Overview of Constitutional Provisions, "Procedure, and Practice'' Elizabeth B. Bazan, Legislative Attorney, American Law Division, February 14, 1995 (Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
===George Turner===
On May 10, 1796, the House received a report from the Attorney General on the conduct of [[George Turner (judge)|George Turner]] a judge in the [[Northwest Territory]], which included demands for bribes, and the wanton levy of fines without trial. The report was referred to a select committee for further action.&lt;ref&gt;5 Annals of Cong. 1338 (1796).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 1797, Judge Turner requested that a hearing on any potential charges be conducted while he was in town. His request was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;6 Annals of Cong. 2166 (1797).&lt;/ref&gt; Then on February 27, Representative [[Theophilus Bradbury]] of Massachusetts submitted the select committee report and a resolution recommending a hearing be held in the Northwest Territory. This resolution was tabled by the House.&lt;ref&gt;6 Annals of Cong. 2320.&lt;/ref&gt;  However Judge Turner resigned just a few months later.

==Jefferson administration==

===John Pickering===
On February 4, 1803, the House received a report from President Jefferson regarding the conduct of [[John Pickering (judge)|Judge John Pickering]] of the District of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;12 Annals of Cong. 460 (1803).&lt;/ref&gt; A select committee was appointed to investigate the matter and submitted its report to the House on February 18.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 544.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, the House passed a resolution impeaching Judge Pickering.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 641.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, the House appointed a select committee to draft articles of impeachment. 13 Annals of Cong. 380 (1803). The select committee submitted four articles of impeachment to the House on December 27,&lt;ref&gt;13 Annals of Cong. 790&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 30, articles were formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;13 Annals of Cong. 795.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate began the impeachment trial against Judge Pickering on January 4, 1804.&lt;ref&gt;12 Annals of Cong.319&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 1804, the Senate convicted Judge Pickering on all four articles and removed him from office.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 367–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samuel Chase===
On January 5, 1804, a resolution was introduced appointing a select committee to investigate Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;13 Annals of Cong. 806 (1804).&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was approved on January 7, 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 874–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The select committee recommended impeachment in a report submitted to the House on March 6, 1804. Id. at 1093. On March 13, 1804, the report was approved and a select committee was appointed to draft the impeachment articles.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The House adopted the select committee's eight articles on March 26, 1804,&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1237.&lt;/ref&gt; one of which involved Chase's handling of the trial of [[John Fries]]. Two more focused on his conduct in the [[political libel]] trial of [[James T. Callender|James Callender]]. Four articles focused on procedural errors made during Chase's adjudication of various matters, and an eighth was directed to his "intemperate and inflammatory … peculiarly indecent and unbecoming … highly unwarrantable … highly indecent" remarks while "charging" or authorizing a Baltimore grand jury.  The [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]-controlled [[United States Senate]] began the impeachment trial of Chase in early 1805, with Vice President [[Aaron Burr]] presiding.

All the counts involved Chase's work as a trial judge in lower circuit courts. (In that era, Supreme Court justices had the added duty of serving as individuals on circuit courts, a practice that was ended in the late 19th century.) The heart of the allegations was that political bias had led Chase to treat defendants and their counsel in a blatantly unfair manner. Chase's defense lawyers called the prosecution a political effort by his Democratic-Republican enemies. In answer to the articles of impeachment, Chase argued that all of his actions had been motivated by adherence to precedent, judicial duty to restrain advocates from improper statements of law, and considerations of judicial efficiency.

The Senate voted to acquit Chase of all charges on March 1, 1805, and he returned to his duties on the court. He is the only U.S. Supreme Court justice to have been impeached.&lt;ref&gt;4 Annals of Cong. 669 (1805).&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquittal of Chase&amp;nbsp;— by lopsided margins on several of the counts&amp;nbsp;— is believed to have helped ensure that an independent federal [[judiciary]] would survive partisan challenge. As Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] noted in his book, ''Grand Inquests'', some people expressed opinions at the time of Chase's trial that the Senate had absolute latitude in convicting a jurist it found unfit, but the acquittal set an unofficial precedent that judges would not be impeached based on their performance on the bench. All judges impeached since Chase have been accused of outright criminality.

===Richard Peters===
On January 6, 1804, [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Judge Peters]] of the District of Pennsylvania was added, by amendment, to a resolution calling for the investigation of Justice Chase.&lt;ref&gt;13 Annals of Cong. 824 (1804).&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was adopted on January 7, 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 876.&lt;/ref&gt;

The select committee appointed to conduct the investigation submitted its report to the House on March 6, 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1093.&lt;/ref&gt;  The select committee report, exonerating Judge Peters of any wrongdoing, was adopted by the House on March 12.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1171, 1181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Innis===
On March 21, 1808, a resolution to investigate [[Harry Innes|Judge Innis]] of the District of Kentucky was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The resolution was tabled.&lt;ref&gt;18 Annals of Cong. 1858, 1860 (1808).&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 1808, they tried again and it was adopted by the House.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

A select committee was appointed to conduct the investigation, and it submitted a report, absolving the Judge of all wrongdoing, to the House on April 19, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2197–98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Bruin===
On April 9, 1808, At the request of the territorial legislature, Mississippi delegate [[George Poindexter]] introduced a  resolution calling for the appointment of a special committee to prepare articles of impeachment against Presiding Judge [[Peter Bruin]] of the Mississippi Territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=hinds_prec_vol_ii&amp;docid=f:hinds_xliii.wais Hinds Precedents&amp;nbsp;— Volume II], from the U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was tabled.&lt;ref&gt;18 Annals of Cong. 2068-70 (1808).&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, the resolution was reconsidered and a special committee, chaired by Poindexter, was appointed to investigate the Judge.,&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2189.&lt;/ref&gt; who was charged with "neglect of duty and drunkenness on the bench." Bruin had either resigned or died during the investigation, which was terminated.

==The rest of the 19th century==
===Harry Toulmin===
On December 19, 1811, as a result of an accusatory letter from Judge [[Harry Toulmin (Unitarian minister)|Harry Toulmin]]'s district (the Washington District of the Mississippi Territory), a resolution was introduced to investigate the judge's conduct. The resolution was tabled.&lt;ref&gt;23 Annals of Cong. 559 (1811).&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 1811, the resolution was withdrawn, and the original accusatory letter of December 16, 1811, was referred to a select committee for further inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 1812, an attempt to disband the investigating select committee was voted down.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 764–65&lt;/ref&gt; The select committee submitted a report absolving Judge Toulmin on May 22, 1812. The report was adopted by the House.&lt;ref&gt;24 Annals of Cong. 1436 (1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on January 2, 1817, another letter was read before the House outlining charges of misconduct against Judge Toulmin. The letter was referred to the Judiciary Committee for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;30 Annals of Cong. 409 (1817).&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, 1817, the Judiciary Committee issued a report finding no evidence to support impeachment. The report was adopted by the House, and the Judiciary Committee was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1038-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Ness and Tallmadge===
On April 10, 1818, a resolution was introduced requesting that a special committee be appointed to investigate Judges [[William P. Van Ness]] and [[Matthias B. Tallmadge]] of the Southern District of New York. The resolution was adopted by the House.&lt;ref&gt;32 Annals of Cong. 1715 (1818).&lt;/ref&gt; Both had been charged with not doing any work. Talmage, claimed that he had so much paperwork left over by his predecessor that he had no time to do anything else, and that his health was so delicate that he needed a long vacation. On February 17, 1819, the special committee submitted a report to the House recommending no action be taken against either Judge.&lt;ref&gt;34 Annals of Cong. 1217-18 (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Stephens===
On April 10, 1818, a special committee was appointed to investigate [[William Stephens (judge)|William Stephens]] of the District of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;32 Annals of Cong. 1716 (1818).&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Stevens resigned during the House investigation, and on November 24, the special committee was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;33 Annals of Cong. 313 (1818).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Tait – Judge, Circuit Court, Alabama===
On March 6, 1822, a complaint against [[Charles Tait]] of the District of Alabama was received by the House and referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;38 Annals of Cong. 1213 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; A second complaint was presented on December 27.&lt;ref&gt;40 Annals of Cong. 463–64 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Moore then proposed a resolution referring the complaint to the Judiciary Committee for further action. Id. at 465. The resolution was adopted. Id. at 468. On January 28, 1823, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report exonerating Judge Tait.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 715.&lt;/ref&gt; No action was taken before the end of the Congressional Session.

On January 26, 1824, the House received another complaint against Judge Tait. This complaint was tabled.&lt;ref&gt;41 Annals of Cong. 1202 (1824).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph L. Smith – Supreme Court, Territory of Florida===
On February 3, 1825, [[Richard K. Call]], Delegate from Florida introduced a resolution calling for the Judiciary Committee to investigate Judge Joseph L. Smith of the Florida Territory's Supreme Court on the charge that he took bribes and kickbacks. The resolution was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Reg. of Debates, 18th Cong., 2nd Sess. 438–40 (1825).&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation went on for years, with the last reference to it being in 1830.

===Buckner Thruston – Circuit Court, DC===
Circuit Court Judge John Ness sent a memorial to Congress complaining of D.C. Circuit Court Judge Buckner Thruston's official conduct. The memorial was referred to the Judiciary Committee for investigation. On February 28, 1825, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report to the House. The report recommended no action be taken against the Judge.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 18–85 (1825).&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1837, William Brent and Richard Coxe sent a memorial to Congress requesting an investigation of Judge Thruston, who was reputed to be a nasty individual and bad judge. The memorial was referred to the Judiciary Committee. On March 3, 1837, the Judiciary Committee submitted its final report to the House. The report contained witness testimony, but no recommendation for or against impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 24-327 (1837)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 1830, the Senate began the impeachment trial.&lt;ref&gt;Reg. of Debates, 21st Cong., 2nd Sess. 3-4 (1839).&lt;/ref&gt; The trial continued through January 31, 1831, when the Senate voted to acquit Judge Peck.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Johnson – Arkansas Territory Superior Court===
William Cummins sent a memorial to Congress requesting an investigation of [[Benjamin Johnson (judge)|Judge Johnson]]. The memorial was referred to the Judiciary Committee for further action. On February 8, 1833, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report to the House: The report found no evidence to support impeachment. The Judiciary Committee also concluded that a territorial judge was not a civil officer subject to impeachment. The Judiciary Committee then recommended no further action be taken against Judge Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 22–88 (1833)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philip K. Lawrence – Eastern District of Louisiana===
On January 8, 1839, the House received a petition from Duncan Hennan requesting an investigation of [[Philip Kissick Lawrence|Judge Lawrence]].

===John McLean and Robert C. Grier===
Justices [[John McLean]] and [[Robert Cooper Grier|Robert C. Grier]] of the U.S. Supreme Court voted against the Dredd Scott decision, and some Southern congressmen prompted an investigation because of it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===John C. Watrous – District of Texas===
On Feb. 13, 1851, a memorial requesting an investigation of [[John Charles Watrous|Judge Watrous]] was presented to Congress. The memorial, which accused the judge of appearing before himself in court among other things, was referred to the Judiciary Committee. On March 3, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report to the House, which recommended the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration because insufficient time remained in the Congressional Session to complete the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 31-70, at 1 (1851).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second memorial containing charges against Judge Watrous was sent to the House and referred to the Judiciary Committee. On February 28, 1853, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report to the House. The report recommended against impeaching the Judge,&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 32-7, at 687 (1853).&lt;/ref&gt; but it didn't happen.

Another investigation of Judge Watrous was conducted in the 34th Congress. On February 9, 1857, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report recommending Judge Watrous be impeached.&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3rd Sess. 627 (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; However, no further action was taken until January 15, 1858, when a resolution was introduced allowing the Judiciary Committee to further investigate the matter by calling witnesses. The resolution was adopted by the House.&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 35th Cong., 1st Sess. 304 (1858).&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 1858, the Judiciary Committee submitted two reports to the House. The majority report recommended Judge Watrous be impeached. The minority, however, found insufficient evidence to warrant impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 35th Cong., 2nd Sess. 12 (1858).&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 1858, by a vote off 111 to 97 refused to impeach, finding insufficient evidence to justify the action.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 102.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the very few times that the Full House has refused to impeach a Judge after the House Judiciary Committee has recommended a trial in the Senate.

They tried again in 1860, and again the House Judiciary Committee voted out articles of impeachment. However, Texas had seceded from the Union by this time and the House never got around to it by the time it expired on March 4, 1861.

===Thomas Irwin – Western District of Pennsylvania===
During the 35th Congress, 2nd Session, the Judiciary Committee conducted an investigation of [[Thomas Irwin|Judge Irwin]]. On January 13, 1859, a resolution authorizing witnesses to be called was adopted by the House.&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 35th Cong., 2nd Sess. 360 (1859).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, the Judiciary Committee informed the House that Judge Irwin had resigned, and the House voted to discharge the Judiciary Committee from further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 656.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West H. Humphreys – Eastern, Middle and Western Districts of Tennessee===

This time the House adopted the committee report and impeached the Judge.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1862, the House appointed a select committee to draft the articles of impeachment, and on May 19 the articles were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2134, 2205.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate began the impeachment trial on June 26, 1862, and later that day voted to convict and remove Judge Humphreys from office.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2942–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark W. Delahay – District of Kansas===
On February 28, 1873, [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts introduced a resolution to impeach [[Mark W. Delahay|Judge Delahay]], citing his "improper personal habits."

Potter attempted to persuade the House to consider an impeachment resolution instead of the committee report, but his attempt failed.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Busteed – District of Alabama===
On December 15, 1873, Mr. E. R. Hoar introduced a resolution to investigate Judge Busteed's conduct. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee. 1&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Rec. 209 (1873).&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 1873, the House passed a resolution granting subpoena power to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 266.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 1874, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report and resolutions for impeachment to the House.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 5316.&lt;/ref&gt; No action was taken before the end of the congressional session.

On April 1, 1890, Rep. [[William C. Oates]] of Alabama introduced a resolution to impeach [[Alexander Boarman|Judge Boarman]] was sent to the Judiciary Committee. No primary record of this resolution could be found. However, on February 17, 1891, the Judiciary Committee referred to this initial resolution when it introduced an impeachment resolution against the Judge. The House printed and recommitted the resolution to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;22 Cong. Rec. 2797 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, the Judiciary Committee reintroduced a resolution to impeach Judge Boarman. The House agreed to consider the resolution on February 20 at 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2937.&lt;/ref&gt; No such action was taken. So, on the 28th, the resolution was again called up for consideration. The vote on the resolution was postponed until the evening session of the House.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 3597.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the intended action did not occur.

==The early 20th century==
===Charles H. Swayne – Northern District of Florida===
On December 10, 1903, Mr. Lamar presented a memorial from the Florida legislature requesting an investigation of [[Charles Swayne|Judge Swayne]].&lt;ref&gt;38 Cong. Rec. 95 (1903&lt;/ref&gt;). The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swayne was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 13, 1904. He was accused of filing false travel vouchers, improper use of private railroad cars, unlawfully imprisoning two attorneys for contempt, and living outside of his district. Swayne's trial consumed two-and-a-half months before it ended on February 27, 1905, when the Senate voted acquittal on each of the twelve articles. There was little doubt that Swayne was guilty of some of the offenses charged against him. Indeed, his counsel admitted as much, though calling the lapses "inadvertent." The Senate, however, refused to convict Swayne because its members did not believe his peccadilloes amounted to "high crimes and misdemeanors". Swayne thereafter continued serving on the court until his death, in 1907.

It was during the long Swayne trial that the suggestion first surfaced that a Senate committee, rather than the Senate as a whole, should receive impeachment evidence. Senator [[George Frisbie Hoar|George F. Hoar]] of Massachusetts proposed that the presiding officer should appoint such a committee. While Hoar's proposal would eventually be embodied in Rule XI of the Senate's impeachment rules, in 1905 the resolution was referred to the Rules Committee, which took no action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm#3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uplUoEZt?url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |date=2010-12-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebbeus R. Wilfley – U.S. Court for China===
In 1906, the U.S. Congress established a special court for the "[[United States Court for China|district of China]]", based in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] which had vice-regal powers of arrest and imprisonment. With only one judge, the former Attorney General of the Philippines, and no obligation to follow the strictures of the constitution or local law, there were many complaints by American expatriates, especially one by [[Lorrin A. Thurston]], former Attorney General of the [[Territory of Hawaii]], who charged that Judge [[Lebbeus R. Wilfley|Wilfley]] had voided a will by a person leaving some of his money to the Catholic Church because of his prejudice against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/10/106767004.pdf | work=The New York Times | format=PDF | title=SEEKS TO IMPEACH OUR JUDGE IN CHINA; Lawyer from Shanghai Brings a Petition Charging Judge Wilfley with Improper Conduct.

Wilfley|Wilfley]] and the resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;42 Cong. Rec. 2269 (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the court in chaos, Wilfley traveled halfway around the world to attend the hearings in [[Washington, D.C.]]

On May 8, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report, H.R. Rep. No. 60-1626, to the House recommending against impeachment,&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 5965&lt;/ref&gt; but by the time Wilfley got back to Shanghai, the situation was so poisoned, he resigned and returned to the U.S. for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/01/11/106115223.pdf | work=The New York Times | format=PDF | title=NEW YORK WILFLEY'S HOME.; Ex-Judge at Shanghai Says Rogues Will Still Be Punished | date=January 11, 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Wodrow Archbald – Third Circuit, Commerce Court===
On 13 July 1912, [[Robert Wodrow Archbald|Judge Archibald]] was impeached by the House of Representatives on 13 Articles by a vote of 223 to 1. Articles I, II, III and VI alleged that Archbald had entered into agreements with litigants at a substantial benefit to himself. Article IV alleged a wrongful communication with litigants. Articles V, VII, VIII, IX and X alleged that he had improperly solicited and accepted gifts from litigants. Article XI alleged he had improperly solicited and accepted gifts from attorneys. Article XII alleged he allowed corrupt practices during jury selection. Article XIII alleged a general charge of bringing the Judiciary into disrepute. The offences alleged in Articles I through XI were connected with holidays in Europe and other gifts received from coal mine workers and railroad officials.

On 16 July, the [[United States Senate]] began Archbald's trial.  The Senate convicted him of five of the thirteen Articles on 13 January 1913. The Senate then voted to remove him from office and disqualify him from further office by a vote of 39 to 35.

On August 26, 1913, Rep. Clayton offered a resolution, H.R. Res. 234, to investigate Judge Speer.&lt;ref&gt;50 Cong. Rec. 3777 (1913).&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee.

A Select Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee conducted the investigation. On October 2, 1914, after reviewing the Subcommittee's findings, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report,&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Rep. No. 63-1176,&lt;/ref&gt; to the House.

On February 10, 1925, Mr. Graham introduced a joint resolution, H.R.J. Res. 347, calling for an investigation of Judge English. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 3472.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was signed by the President on March 4, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 5531.&lt;/ref&gt; A special committee, consisting of members of the House Judiciary Committee, was then appointed to conduct the investigation. On December 19, 1925, the special committee submitted its report. The report was subsequently referred to the Judiciary Committee, which continued the investigation. Judge English testified before the Judiciary Committee on January 12, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;See H.R. Rep. No. 69-653 at 67 Cong. Rec. 6652 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 1926, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report, H.R. Rep. No. 69-653, and articles of impeachment against Judge English.&lt;ref&gt;67 Cong. Rec. 6280–81 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; The next day a minority report was printed in the record.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 6363–68.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30, 1926, the House began debate on the articles of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 6585&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1926, the articles were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 6736.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate considered the articles of impeachment on April 23, 1926, and the impeachment trial began with Judge English's answer to the articles on May 3, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 8026, 8578.&lt;/ref&gt; House managers then requested time to prepare a response to Judge English. On March 5, 1926, the Senate set November 10 as the date for the trial to resume.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 8686, 8733.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 1926, the House took note of Judge English's resignation and requested the Senate drop the impeachment proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;68 Cong. Rec. 302 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate accepted the House recommendation and ended the proceedings on December 13, 1926&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 347–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John T. Rogers (journalist)|John T. Rogers]] of ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' won the [[1927 Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for Reporting|Reporting]] with his coverage of the inquiry leading to English's impeachment.

===Frank Cooper – Northern District of New York===
On January 28, 1927, Congressman [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] brought impeachment charges against [[Frank Cooper (judge)|Judge Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;68 Cong. Rec. 2487 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were referred to the Judiciary Committee for investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2493&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 1927, the Judiciary Committee submitted its report, H.R. Rep. No. 69-2299, recommending no impeachment action be taken against the Judge. This report was referred to the [[House Calendar]], and the next day a resolution, H.R. Res. 450, adopting the committee report, was passed by the House.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 5463, 5619.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grover Moscowitz – U.S. District Judge, Eastern District of New York===
On March 4, 1929, a joint resolution, H.R.J. Res. 431, calling for the investigation of Judge Moscowitz was signed by the President. 70 Cong. Rec. 5227 (1929). The resolution created a Select Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee to conduct the investigation. Id. at 4839. Following this investigation, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report, H.R. Rep. No. 70-1106, to the House criticizing Judge Moscowitz, but refused to recommend impeachment. No action was taken before the end of the congressional session.

===Francis A. Winslow – Southern District of New York===
On April 15, 1929, Congressman Fiorello H. La Guardia introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 12, to investigate Judge Winslow. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;71 Cong. Rec. 33 (1929).&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 1929, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report, H.R. Rep. No. 71–84, recommending the investigation cease due to Judge Winslow's resignation. A resolution, H.R. Res. 110, adopting the committee's report was passed by the House.&lt;ref&gt;72 Cong. Rec. 1025–26 (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Anderson – Western District of Tennessee===
On March 12, 1930, La Guardia introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 184, requesting that the Attorney General send the Judiciary Committee any available information on Judge Anderson's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;72 Cong. Rec. 5105-06 (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was sent to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 5141.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 1930, a resolution from the Judiciary Committee, H.R. Res. 191, was introduced. The resolution called for a special committee, consisting of five members of the House Judiciary Committee, to be appointed to inquire into Judge Anderson's conduct. The resolution was referred to the "Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union" and agreed to by the House on June 13, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 9919, 10,649.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 1931, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report, H.R. Rep. No. 71-2714, of their findings, and introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 362, stating insufficient grounds existed for impeachment. The resolution was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;74 Cong. Rec. 5312-13 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harold Louderback – Northern District of California===
On May 26, 1932, Congressman Fiorello H. La Guardia introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 239, requesting a special committee be appointed to investigate Judge Louderback. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee for further action.&lt;ref&gt;75 Cong. Rec. 11,358 (1932).&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 1932, the Judiciary Committee reported the resolution back to the House without amendment. Id. at 11,700. The resolution was adopted on June 9, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 12,470.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special committee was appointed to conduct the investigation and report its findings to the Judiciary Committee. On February 17, 1933, the Judiciary Committee submitted a report, H.R. Rep. No. 72-2065, and a resolution, H.R. Res. 387, requesting the report be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;76 Cong. Rec. 4375-76 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; The report found insufficient evidence to warrant impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 4913-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 1933, when the Judiciary Committee report came up for consideration, Mr. LaGuardia introduced the minority report which recommended Judge Louderback be impeached and included five articles of impeachment. With two conflicting reports to consider, a debate arose in the House between those supporting the majority report?s recommendation not to impeach, and those supporting the five articles of impeachment presented in the minority report. When the debate was over, the House agreed to adopt the minority report and its articles of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 4913-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate began its impeachment proceedings with Judge Louderback's answer on April 11, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;77 Cong. Rec. 1462 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; The actual impeachment trial started on May 15, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 3394&lt;/ref&gt; On May 24, 1933, the Senate acquitted Judge Louderback on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 4088.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Lowell – District of Massachusetts===
On April 26, 1933, Mr. Smith introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 120, authorizing the Judiciary Committee to investigate Judge Lowell. The resolution was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;77 Cong. Rec. 2415, 2421 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 1933, during the investigation, Judge Lowell died.

===Judge Lindley, James Wilkerson, and Judge Woodward – Northern District of Illinois===
On June 12, 1933, Mr. Cellers introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 145, to investigate the "matter of appointments, conduct, proceedings, and acts of receivers, trustees, and referees in bankruptcy." The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee for further action.&lt;ref&gt;77 Cong. Rec. 3502 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; Some judges were implicated in the investigation, and their impeachment discussed, but were later exonerated.

===Joseph Molyneaux – District of Minnesota===
On January 22, 1934, Mr. Shoemaker introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 233, authorizing the Judiciary Committee to investigate [[Joseph W. Molyneaux|Judge Molyneaux]]. The resolution was adopted and referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;78 Cong. Rec. 1099 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

When no action was taken, Mr. Shoemaker introduced another resolution on April 20, 1934. This resolution contained impeachment charges against Judge Molyneaux, and was also referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 7060–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, they died in committee.

===Samuel Alschuler – Seventh Circuit===
On May 7, 1935, Rep. [[Everett Dirksen]] offered a resolution, H.R. Res. 214, to investigate impeachment charges against  [[Samuel Alschuler|Judge Alschuler]]. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;79 Cong. Rec. 7081–89 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; A week later,  the House adopted a resolution, H.R. Res. 220, granting the Judiciary Committee authority to hold hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 7393.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, it died in committee.

===Halsted L. Ritter – Southern District of Florida===
On May 29, 1933, Congressman [[J. Mark Wilcox]] of [[Florida]] introduced [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] (H. Res. 163) authorizing the House Judiciary Committee to investigate Ritter's conduct to "determine whether in the opinion of the committee he had been guilty of any [[High crimes and misdemeanours|high crime or misdemeanor]]." The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.

On March 2, 1936, the House of Representatives voted to impeach [[Halsted L. Ritter|Judge Ritter]] by 181 votes to 146 on seven [[articles of impeachment]]. The proceedings were only the 13th impeachment case in the 147 years of [[United States Congress|Congress]], although it took place just a month after the impeachment of [[Harold Louderback]] (who was acquitted in the Senate). The seven articles were:

*Ordering the payment of "exorbitant" legal fees with intent to [[Embezzlement|embezzle]]. Specifically, the House managers said Ritter engaged in [[Champerty and maintenance|champerty]] ("a proceeding whereby a person having no legitimate interest in a [[lawsuit]] abets it with money or services in the hope of profit") by "corruptly and unlawfully" receiving $4,500 from a former law partner, Albert L. Rankin.  The House charged that Ritter had planned with Rankin and others to put [[Flagler Museum|Whitehall]] (the former [[Henry Flagler|Henry Morrison Flagler]] [[mansion]] and then a [[hotel]], and now a [[museum]]) into [[receivership]], and had given Rankin an "exorbitant fee" of $75,000, keeping $4,500 of it.
*Showing [[Ingroups and outgroups|favoritism]] in [[bankruptcy]] cases
*Two charges of practicing law while a judge
*Two charges of [[Tax noncompliance|tax evasion]] (by filed false [[Tax return (United States)|income tax returns]] in 1929 and 1930)
*Bringing the judiciary into disrepute (accepting free meals and lodging at Whitehall during receivership proceedings)

Ritter's chief [[Attorneys in the United States|defense attorney]] was [[Frank P. Walsh]]. Three House managers [[Prosecutor|prosecuted]] the case, with [[Sam Hobbs]] of [[Alabama]] leading.

On April 6, 1936, the U.S. Senate began its trial.  Eleven days after the trial began, the Senate voted to acquit him of all but the last article (bringing the judiciary into disrepute), which he was convicted of 56–28, exactly the two-thirds necessary for conviction under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and Ritter was removed from office on April 17, 1936. A [[Motion in United States law|motion]] to disqualify Ritter from all further federal office was defeated unanimously by the Senate.

Ritter challenged the conviction in the federal [[United States Court of Claims|Court of Claims]] on the grounds that the Senate could not convict him on a general charge of bringing the judiciary into disrepute if it was not able to convict him of a specific offense. The Court of Claims dismissed the case and held it did not have [[jurisdiction]] because the Senate was given the "sole power" to try impeachments under Clause 6, Section 3 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the United States Constitution]].

===Albert Johnson – Middle District of Pennsylvania===
On February 15, 1945, a resolution, H.R. Res. 138, authorizing the Judiciary Committee to investigate impeachment charges against Judge Johnson (and Judge Watson, see below) was adopted by the House.&lt;ref&gt;91 Cong. Rec. 1171 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation of Judge Johnson was conducted at both the committee and subcommittee level. (Referenced in a speech by Richard Russell) .&lt;ref&gt;92 Cong. Rec. 2382 (1945.&lt;/ref&gt;). On July 3, 1945, during the Judiciary Committee investigation, Judge Johnson resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 2376.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, he was called to testify before the Judiciary Committee. Following a poor performance by the Judge during cross examination, the Judge relinquished his retirement salary and withdrew as a witness, thereby mooting the entire process. The report of the House Judiciary Committee the following year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A16FF395D177A93C4AB1789D85F428485F9&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=albert%20johnson%20judge%20impeachment&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=JOHNSON HELD GUILTY; House Judiciary Committee Files Report Against Former Judge | date=February 26, 1946 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that had Johnson not resigned, he would have definitely been impeached.

===Albert L. Watson – Middle District of Pennsylvania===
The House Judiciary Committee voted to end the impeachment investigation against [[Albert Leisenring Watson|Judge Watson]] on September 20, 1945, and he went on to serve until his death in the 1950s.

===William O. Douglas – United States Supreme Court===
{{Main|William O. Douglas#Impeachment attempts}}

There were two attempts to remove Douglas from office; both of them failed.

====The 1953 attempt====
On June 17, 1953, infuriated by Douglas' brief stay of execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] Rep. Wheeler introduced a resolution, H.R. Res. 290, impeaching Justice Douglas. It was referred to the Judiciary Committee to investigate the charges.&lt;ref&gt;99 Cong. Rec. 6760 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Judiciary Committee appointed a Special Subcommittee to conduct the investigation. There was a hearing, and on July 7, the committee voted to end the investigation. and no further action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Quarterly Guide to US Supreme. Court, at 661 (Elder Witt ed., Congressional Quarterly, Inc. 2ed. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1970 attempt====
Justice Douglas was fully committed to his causes.  But because of difficult financial circumstances, he was also forced to maintain a busy speaking and publishing schedule to supplement his income.  Never a wealthy man, Douglas became severely burdened financially due to a bitter divorce and settlement with his first wife.  He only sank deeper into financial difficulties as settlements with his second and third wives essentially consumed his entire salary as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

Douglas's steps to supplement his income as a result of his financial situation also included the unusual move of becoming president of the Parvin Foundation.  While his efforts on behalf of the Parvin Foundation were legitimate, his ties with the foundation (which was financed by the sale of the infamous [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]] by casino financier and foundation founder [[Albert Parvin]]), became a prime target for then-House Minority Leader [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]].  Besides being personally disgusted by Douglas's allegedly illicit lifestyle, Representative Ford was also mindful that Douglas protégé [[Abe Fortas]] was forced to resign because of ties to a foundation similar to Parvin.&lt;ref name="abe fortas"&gt;{{cite book

Those who support this contention note Ford's well-known disappointment with the Senate over the failed nominations of [[Clement Haynsworth]] and [[G. Harrold Carswell]] to succeed Fortas. Thus, in April 1970, Congressman Ford moved to impeach Douglas in an attempt to hit back at the Senate.

On April 15, 1970, at the instigation of Rep. [[Gerald Ford]], Rep.  Jacobs began a second attempt to impeach Justice Douglas. His resolution to impeach the Justice, H.R. Res. 920, was referred to the Judiciary Committee for investigation.&lt;ref&gt;116 Cong. Rec. 11,942 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; The next day seven resolutions, H.R. Res. 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, and 928, requesting an investigation of Justice Douglas were introduced on the floor of the House. All of the resolutions sought the creation of a select committee to conduct the investigation, and all were referred to the Rules Committee for further action.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 12, 130–31.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1970, Mr. Wyman introduced resolution, H.R. Res. 936, to investigate Justice Douglas. This resolution was referred to the Rules Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id at 12,464.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 1970, Mr. Gooding introduced resolution to investigate Justice Douglas. This resolution was also sent to the Rules Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 13,326.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 1970, a Special Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee was appointed to conduct an investigation under House Resolution 920. It issued a progress report on June 20, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;See August 5, 1970, press release by the Special Subcommittee at 116 Cong. Rec. 27,673 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite careful maneuvering by House Judiciary Chairman [[Emanuel Celler]], and an apparent lack of proof of any criminal conduct on the part of Douglas (efforts by Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] and the Nixon administration to gather evidence to the contrary notwithstanding),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/700415a.htm Gerald Ford's Remarks on the Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, April 15, 1970&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926115720/http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/700415a.htm |date=September 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman Ford moved forward in the first major attempt to impeach a Supreme Court Justice in the modern era.

The hearings began in late April 1970.  Congressman Ford was the main witness, and attacked Douglas's "liberal opinions", his "defense of the 'filthy' film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', and his ties with the aforementioned Parvin. Additionally, Douglas was criticized for accepting $350 for an article he wrote on folk music in the magazine ''[[Avant Garde (magazine)|Avant Garde]]''. The magazine's publisher had served a prison sentence for the distribution of another magazine in 1966 that had been deemed [[Pornography|pornographic]]. Describing Douglas' article, Ford stated, "The article itself is not pornographic, although it praises the lusty, lurid, and risqué along with the social protest of left-wing folk singers". Ford also attacked Douglas for his article in ''Evergreen'' Magazine, which was infamous for its proclivity for pictures of naked women.  The Republican congressmen, however, refused to give the majority Democrats copies of the magazines, prompting Congressman [[Wayne Hays]] to remark "Has anybody read the article&amp;nbsp;— or is everybody over there who has a magazine just looking at the pictures?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissidentvoice.org/May05/Gerard0507.htm (DV) Gerard: Conservatives, Judicial Impeachment, and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas]&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became clear that the impeachment proceedings would be unsuccessful, they were brought to a close, and no public vote on the matter was taken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vKIpFE9oPSMC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=attempted+Impeachment+of+William+O.+Douglas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q_xZir1oSr&amp;sig=22gM6sj0jFIB3ZpeZ9QNmITxEv8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DpEdStWLFpmWMYHDzO4F&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Gerhardt, Michael J. ''The Federal Impeachment Process''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report of the Special Subcommittee found no cause for impeachment and recommended no further action be taken. Mr. Wyman criticized this report on December 17, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 42,240&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 1970, Mr. Dennis, a member of the Judiciary Committee, criticized his Committee for refusing to even bring the Subcommittee report to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 43, 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort to impeach Douglas and the struggles over the Fortas, Haynesworth, and Carswell nominations marked the beginning of a more partisan climate during the confirmation process of Supreme Court nominees.

===Alfred Murrah, Stephen Chandler, and Luther Bohanon===
[[Luther L. Bohanon|Luther Bohanon]] of the Eastern, Northern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma; [[Stephen Sanders Chandler Jr.|Stephen Chandler]] of the Western District of Oklahoma; and [[Alfred P. Murrah]] of the 10th Circuit (which sits in Oklahoma) had been feuding so much that it was becoming a national scandal, and thus, many people in Oklahoma demanded their impeachment to put a halt to it.

Thus, on February 21, 1966, Congressman [[H. R. Gross|Harold R. Gross]] requested an investigation of these three Oklahoma judges.&lt;ref&gt;112 Cong. Rec. 3489–90 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution to investigate, H.R. Res. 739, was adopted the next day and sent to the House Judiciary Committee which formed an "Ad Hoc Special Subcommittee on Judicial Behavior" for further action.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 3653.&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation, which lasted until 1968, found that the so-called Chandler Mess&lt;ref&gt;http://www.10thcircuithistory.org/pdf_files/Chandler_Article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was reprehensible, but not criminal.

===Abe Fortas – United States Supreme Court===
Fortas had accepted a $20,000 retainer from the family foundation of [[Wall Street]] financier [[Louis Wolfson]], a friend and former client, in January 1966.&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/War-Protests/12303189849225-3/#title "Supreme Court: 1969 Year in Review, UPI.com"&lt;/ref&gt; Fortas signed a contract with Wolfson's foundation; in return for unspecified advice, it was to pay Fortas $20,000 a year for the rest of Fortas's life (and then pay his [[widow]] for the rest of her life). Wolfson was under investigation for securities violations at the time and it is alleged that he expected that his arrangement with Fortas would help him stave off criminal charges or help him secure a presidential [[pardon]]; he did ask Fortas to help him secure a pardon from LBJ, which Fortas claimed that he did not do.&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt; Fortas recused himself from Wolfson's case when it came before the Court and had returned the retainer, but not until Wolfson had been indicted twice.&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt;  Although Fortas denied that he ever helped Wolfson, there is good reason to doubt that claim. In 1970, after Fortas had resigned from the Court, Louis Wolfson surreptitiously taped a private telephone call with Fortas. The transcript of this call was (ostensibly) inadvertently disclosed by Wolfson's lawyer, Bud Fensterwald, to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in 1977. The Washington Post subsequently published several excerpts from the transcript, including language suggesting that Fortas might have indeed spoken with LBJ about a pardon for Wolfson, but there is no evidence that this intervention was a quid pro quo rather than a voluntary intervention for a friend. Wolfson was convicted of violating federal securities laws later that year and spent time in [[prison]].

The new [[Richard Nixon]] administration became aware of the Wolfson deal when a ''Life'' reporter began investigating the story; FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] also mentioned a "tax dodge" Fortas had entered into with other judges, and Nixon concluded Fortas should be "off of there."&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt; When Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] was informed of the incident by the new Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], he persuaded Fortas to resign to protect the reputation of the Court and avoid lengthy [[impeachment]] proceedings, which were in their preliminary stages;&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt; Fortas' judicial reputation was also affected by the previous Johnson consultation and American University scandals.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news

[[H. R. Gross]] (R-Iowa), Fortas decided resignation would be best for him and for his wife's legal career, and told his colleagues. He resigned from the Court on May 15, 1969. [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] later said, "We were just stunned."&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt; Fortas later said he "resigned to save [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]]," another justice who was being investigated for a similar scandal at the same time.&lt;ref name="abe fortas"/&gt;

===Otto Kerner – Seventh Circuit===
[[Otto Kerner, Jr.|Kerner]] had been convicted of bribery, and with all his appeals exhausted, he resigned in July 1974 after being told that the House Judiciary committee would vote to impeach him immediately after they were done with proceedings against President [[Richard Nixon]].

===Frank J. Battisti – Northern District of Ohio===
On January 24, 1978, Rep. [[John M. Ashbrook]] introduced an impeachment resolution, H.R. Res. 966, against [[Frank J. Battisti|Judge Battisti]]. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.,&lt;ref&gt;124 Cong. Rec. 545 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; where given the judge's sterling record, it died in committee. However, he tried again on January 5, 1981 with H.RES.12, where it met the same result.

===Nauman Scott – Western District of Louisiana===
On Feb 19, 1981, Rep. [[Larry McDonald|Lawrence P. McDonald]] introduced an impeachment resolution, H.R. Res. 61. against [[Nauman Scott|Judge Scott]], over the issue of court mandated bussing. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary committee, where it died.

===William Wayne Justice – Eastern District of Texas===
On June 24, 1981, Rep. [[Ron Paul]] introduced an impeachment resolution, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d097:168:./list/bss/d097HE.lst:: H.R. Res. 168], against [[William Wayne Justice|Judge Justice]].

===140 federal judges===
Atkins v. U.S., 214 Ct. Cl. 186, 556 F.2d 1028 (Ct. Cl. 1977), was an unsuccessful attempt to force the Government to address the destructive effect of inflation on the judiciary during the period 1969–1975, when the value of the dollar, measured by the Consumer Price Index, decreased by 34%, and Congress failed to provide increases to protect judges' purchasing power.

On March 2, 1976, Rep. [[Andrew Jacobs, Jr.]] introduced an impeachment resolution against Atkins and 139 other federal judges involved in the above-mentioned dispute. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;122 Cong. Rec. 5029 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; and nothing was done. Mr. Jacobs introduced a second impeachment resolution against the same judges in a little more than a month The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee,&lt;ref&gt;122 Cong. Rec. 9987 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; where it too, died.

==Judicial Conference of the United States==
The [[Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|96|458|94|2035|1980|10|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; empowered the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]] to investigate and police the judiciary and, if need be, request that the House of Representatives impeach federal judges. [[Judicial council (United States federal courts)|Judicial councils]] are established in each [[United States courts of appeals|circuit]] and investigate complaints and may certify the disability of judges or refer complaints to the Judicial Conference. Most judicial impeachments since then have been based on these requests.

===Harry E. Claiborne – District of Nevada===
[[Harry E. Claiborne|Claiborne]] was indicted by a federal grand jury for bribery, fraud, and tax evasion in December 1983. In April 1984, however, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared. He was tried again in July on only the evasion charges and was found guilty the next month, making him the first federal judge ever convicted of crimes while on the bench. Claiborne was sentenced to two years in prison in October, and was in prison from May 1986 to October 1987.

This was an unacceptable state of affairs, and on  June 3, 1986, Rep. [[Peter W. Rodino]] (D-NJ) offered an impeachment resolution, H.R. Res. 461, against him. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;132 Cong. Rec. 12,129 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] introduced a second one H.R. Res. 487, against Judge Claiborne on June 24, which was also sent to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 15,287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judiciary Committee appointed its Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice to assist with the investigation, and after a quick hearing, the Judiciary Committee reported its findings to the House on July 16 and on the 22nd,  the committee report was debated in the House. The report included four articles of impeachment against Judge Claiborne. On July 22, Claiborne was formally impeached by the House, becoming the first person to be granted that "honor" in over 30 years.

The trial in the senate was held before a special committee, except for the closing arguments, which were held before the full Senate.

On October 9, 1986, the Senate concluded its trial and  Judge Claiborne was convicted on all articles except Article III.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 29, 870–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact division on each Article is as follows:

===Alcee L. Hastings – Southern District of Florida===
In 1981, [[Alcee Hastings|Judge Hastings]] was charged with accepting a $150,000 bribe in exchange for a lenient sentence and a return of seized assets for 21 counts of [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] by Frank and Thomas Romano, and of perjury in his testimony about the case. He was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, William Borders, refused to testify in court (resulting in a jail sentence for Borders).

On March 23, 1987, Rep [[Jim Sensenbrenner]]  introduced an impeachment resolution, H.R. Res. 128, against Judge Hastings. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;133 Cong. Rec. 6514, 6522 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 1987, the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice met in executive session to discuss Judge Hastings' impeachment inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at D215&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1988, the full House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and [[perjury]] by a vote of 413–3. He was then convicted in 1989 by the [[United States Senate]], becoming the sixth federal judge in the history of the United States to be [[Impeachment in the United States|removed from office]] by the Senate. The vote on the first article was 69 for and 26 opposed, providing five votes more than the two-thirds of those present that were needed to convict. The first article accused the judge of conspiracy. Conviction on any single article was enough to remove the judge from office. The Senate vote cut across party lines, with [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Patrick Leahy]], Democrat of Vermont, voting to convict his fellow party member, and U.S. Senator [[Arlen Specter]] voting to acquit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3DD163BF932A15753C1A96F948260 "Hastings Ousted As Senate Vote Convicts Judge"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 21, 1989. Accessed April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate had the option to forbid Hastings from ever seeking federal office again, but did not do so. Alleged co-conspirator, attorney William Borders went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings, but was later given a full pardon by President [[Bill Clinton]] on his last day in office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1066080426784 Law.com&amp;nbsp;— The Power of the Pardon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hastings filed suit in federal court claiming that his impeachment trial was invalid because he was tried by a Senate committee, not in front of the full Senate, and that he had been acquitted in a criminal trial. Judge [[Stanley Sporkin]] ruled in favor of Hastings, remanding the case back to the Senate, but stayed his ruling pending the outcome of an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in a similar case regarding Judge [[Walter Nixon]], who had also been impeached and removed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/links/hastings091892.htm Senate Conviction of Hastings Is Reversed by Judge Sporkin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporkin found some "crucial distinctions"&lt;ref&gt;[http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/fedcts/hastings1.html Alcee HASTINGS, Plaintiff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; between Nixon's case and Hastings', specifically, that Nixon had been convicted criminally, and that Hastings was not found guilty by two-thirds of the committee who actually "tried" his impeachment in the Senate. He further added that Hastings had a right to trial by the full Senate.

The Supreme Court, however, ruled in ''[[Nixon v. United States]]'' that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over Senate impeachment matters, so Sporkin's ruling was vacated and Hastings' conviction and removal were upheld.  Four years after his conviction, Hastings was elected to the House of Representatives, in which he has continued to sit until the present.

===Walter L. Nixon, Jr. – Southern District of Mississippi===
{{Main|Nixon v. United States}}
The Case stemmed from [[Walter Nixon|Judge Nixon's]] grand jury testimony and statements to federal officers concerning his intervention in the Mississippi's drug prosecution of Drew Fairchild, the son of Nixon's business partner Wiley Fairchild.  He was convicted of perjury and sentenced to prison. He refused to resign and continued to receive his judicial salary.

On March 17, 1988  Rep. Peter W. Rodino (D-NJ) introduced an impeachment resolution, H.RES.407, against Nixon, and it was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, which held hearings on the matter. With the case still to be voted on when the term of the House expired, it died.

On February 22, 1989, Rep. [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]] (D.-Tex.) introduced another impeachment resolution, H.R. Res. 87, and the Judiciary Committee submitted its report, H.R. Rep. No. 101-36, to the House on April 25, 1989. The report included three articles of impeachment against Judge Nixon. On May 10, 1989, the House impeached Nixon by a vote of 417-0. The Senate concluded its trial on November 3, and Judge Nixon was removed from office after being found guilty of articles I and II by a vote of  89 to 8 and 78 to 19 respectively,

Nixon appealed to a federal district court, which reversed the conviction, this was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found the case non-justicable.

===Robert P. Aguilar – Northern District of California===
On May 19, 1993, Rep. [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] introduced H.RES.177, impeaching  [[Robert Peter Aguilar|Judge Aguilar]], who had been indicted in the late 1980s for racketeering and was convicted in a 1990 retrial. It was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, who left it in limbo while the Judge's appeals played out. In 1994, the conviction was overturned, and the resolution was left to die. The Judge retired in 1996.

===Robert F. Collins – Eastern District of Louisiana===
On May 19, 1993, Rep. [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] introduced H.RES.176, impeaching  [[Robert Frederick Collins|Judge Collins]]. It was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and died there. Later, in June, [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]] tried again with H RES 207. With impeachment hearings looming, Collins resigned two months later.

=== Manuel L. Real – Central District of California===
On July 17, 2006, U.S. Representative [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] (R-WI), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced H.RES.916  calling for an  investigation of [[Manuel Real|Judge Real]] and consider impeaching him. The House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on  Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property subsequently held a hearing on Real's conduct on September 21,  but did not agree to recommend impeachment.

===G. Thomas Porteous Jr. – Eastern District of Louisiana===
{{wikisource|Articles of Impeachment Against United States District Court Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr.}}
[[Thomas Porteous|Judge Porteous]], was not convicted of a crime, but was recommended for removal by the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit for egregious misconduct that included receiving gifts from attorneys who came before him, filing false statements in his personal bankruptcy case, and engaging in fraudulent and deceptive conduct concerning his debts and gambling losses.

On June 18, 2008 the Judicial Conference of the United States transmitted a certificate&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nola.com/news_impact/2008/06/porteous.pdf Judicial Conference certificate and cover letter]&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the United States House of Representatives expressing the Conference's determination that consideration of impeachment of Judge Porteous might be warranted.  The certificate stated that there was substantial evidence that Judge Porteous "repeatedly committed perjury by signing false financial disclosure forms under oath," thus concealing "cash and things of value that he solicited and received from lawyers appearing in litigation before him." In a specific case, "he denied a motion to recuse based on his relationship with lawyers in the case . . and failed to disclose that the lawyers in question had often provided him with cash. Thereafter, while a bench verdict (that is, a verdict by a judge sitting without a jury) was pending, he solicited and received from the lawyers appearing before him illegal gratuities in the form of cash and other things of value," thus depriving "the public of its right to his [[honest services fraud|honest services]]."  The certificate concluded that this conduct "constituted an abuse of his judicial office" in violation of the Canons of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.

The certificate also stated that there was substantial evidence that Judge Porteous had "repeatedly committed perjury by signing false financial disclosure forms under oath" in connection with his bankruptcy, allowing "him to obtain a discharge of his debts while continuing his lifestyle at the expense of his creditors," and that he had "made false representations to gain the extension of a bank loan with the intent to defraud the bank."

On September 18, 2008, the House [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] voted unanimously to proceed with an investigation of the bribery and perjury allegations.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= Pogue |title=House panel moves toward impeaching a judge |url=http://www2.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-7805343,00.html |work=Associated Press |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, 2008 House Judiciary Chair [[John Conyers]] announced that Alan I.

On January 13, 2009, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 15 by voice vote, authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether the House should impeach Judge Porteous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/11/post_63.html&lt;/ref&gt; The judge tried to get a court to stop the hearing in a lawsuit, but failed.

On January 21, 2010, the task force voted unanimously to recommend four articles of impeachment. The Judiciary Committee, later reported the articles to the House, which adopted them on March 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|h.res|1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ad hoc Senate committee heard evidence in September and October 2010, and a vote by the full Senate took place on December 8, 2010. Article 1 was passed unanimously, Articles 2 was passed by a vote of 69–27, Article 3 was passed by a vote of 88–8, and Article 4 was passed by a vote of 90 to 6. A further vote to disqualify the former judge from ever holding office again passed by a vote of 94 to 2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2010/12/senate_votes_to_remove_judge_t.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samuel Kent – Southern District of Texas===
{{wikisource|Articles of Impeachment Against United States District Court Judge Samuel B. Kent|Articles of Impeachment against Judge Kent}}
On May 11, 2009, [[Samuel B. Kent|Judge Kent]] was sentenced to 33 months in prison in a sex abuse case for lying to investigators about sexually abusing two female employees. Dick DeGuerin, Kent's attorney, said the judge was retiring from the bench because of a disability—which would allow him to keep receiving his $169,300-a-year salary. Retired federal judges collect their full salaries for the remainder of their lives; judges who resign get nothing. That did not satisfy the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, Reps. [[John Conyers]] Jr., (D-Mich.) and [[Lamar S. Smith|Lamar Smith]] (R-Tex.), who demanded that Kent resign immediately or face possible impeachment.&lt;ref name=chron20090224&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Effort-to-impeach-Galveston-federal-judge-may-1537279.php|title=Effort to impeach Galveston federal judge may start today|last=Flood|first=Mary|last2=Powell|first2=Stewart|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Kent submitted his resignation on June 2, 2009, with the proviso that it won't take effect for a full year. This angered the membership of the House Judiciary Committee, which voted unanimously on sending four articles of impeachment to the full House of Representatives on June 10, 2009.&lt;ref name="chronhjc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6468424.html |title=Panel votes to recommend Kent impeachment |accessdate=2009-06-10 |work= |publisher=''Houston Chronicle'' |date=2009-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=?url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6468424.html |archivedate=2009-06-11 |df= }} (Archived by WebCite at )&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, the full House passed the articles unanimously, making Judge Kent the 14th judge to be impeached.

As the Senate trial committee was organizing itself, Kent updated his resignation to be effective a year earlier than originally planned. The trial was thus mooted, and proceedings came to an end.&lt;ref name=resignsenatedems&gt;{{cite press release

===Jay Bybee – Ninth Circuit===
Congressman [[Jerrold Nadler]], a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee on [[#C2009April|April 20, 2009]] called for the impeachment of [[Jay Bybee|Judge Bybee]], as Bybee was one of the authors of torture memos written by senior Justice Department lawyers during the Bush administration.&lt;ref name="Impeach"&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/news/43330352.html "Las Vegas Review Journal" New York Congressman calls for the Impeachment of Judge ''Jay Bybee'', April 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; As yet, no resolution has been introduced in Congress to further the call. However, in July of that year, Bybee started a legal defense fund in anticipation of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/declassified/archive/2009/11/19/torture-memo-author-sets-up-defense-fund-to-fight-possible-impeachment.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, after more than a year's delay, the Department of Justice released the Office of Professional Responsibility's report on whether government lawyers who wrote these torture memos violated professional ethics and found what Bybee had done was legal. Chances of impeachment, which were always remote, faded away to nothing.

===Mark Fuller – Middle District of Alabama ===
[[Mark Fuller|Judge Fuller]] was arrested on August 9, 2014 after his wife called police and reported her husband was drunk and hitting her while they were at an Atlanta hotel. He later accepted a plea deal that will allow his record to be expunged if he completes a counseling program. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reassigned all of his cases to other judges for the time being.

The plea deal horrified U.S. Rep. [[Terri Sewell]] (D-AL), who demanded Fuller resign by November 12, 2014. When he didn't, she sent a letter to the chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee to instigate impeachment proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/11/us_rep_ter_sewell_urges_mark_f.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sewell.house.gov/press-releases/congresswoman-sewell-sends-letter-to-house-judiciary-committee-urging-an-investigation-into-the-impeachment-of-us-district-court-judge-mark-fuller/&lt;/ref&gt;

The process was put on hold while the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]] investigated the matter. It announced that he had indeed committed impeachable offenses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/us/mark-e-fuller-former-judge-could-be-impeached.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller said he would resign on August 1, 2015, but then said he might change his mind. The House Judiciary committee stated he would indeed be impeached if he didn't resign by the date he originally announced,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2015/06/02/congress-threatens-fuller-impeachment/28362261/&lt;/ref&gt; which he did.

'''Interlocutory''' is a legal term which can refer to an [[Court order|order]], [[Sentence (law)|sentence]], [[decree]], or [[Judgment (law)|judgment]], given in an intermediate stage between the commencement and termination of a [[cause of action]], used to provide a temporary or provisional decision on an issue. Thus, an interlocutory order is not final and is not subject to immediate appeal.

{{globalise/US|date=December 2014}}
In many U.S. [[legal system]]s, interlocutory orders are not [[appeal]]able, save for in a few extraordinary cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Appeal and Error| encyclopedia = [[Corpus Juris Secundum]]| volume = 4| pages = 129, § 140| publisher = [[Thomson West]]| date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlocutory orders are orders that are issued by a court while a case is still ongoing. These orders are not meant to be final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legaldictionary.net/interlocutory/ |title=Interlocutory - Definition, Examples, Cases, Processes |work=Legal Dictionary |date=31 Oct 2018 |accessdate=31 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the case is concluded, any aspect of an interlocutory order that has not become [[mootness|moot]] may be challenged in an appeal from the final judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Appeal and Error| encyclopedia = [[Corpus Juris Secundum]]| volume = 4| pages = 136, § 146| publisher = [[Thomson West]]| date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in other legal systems, such as in England and Wales, in Hong Kong, and in Canada, interlocutory orders in civil matters can be appealed by leave of the appellate court.  In criminal matters in Canada, the general rule is that there are no interlocutory appeals, except where Parliament has expressly provided.  Australian courts and tribunals generally discourage appeals against interlocutory decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/decisionssigned/html/2014fwcfb3384.htm |title=Fair Work Decision: Button v Sykes Australia Pty Ltd |work=Fair Work Commission |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Katko v. Briney''''', 183 [[North Western Reporter|N.W.2d]] 657 ([[Iowa Supreme Court|Iowa]] 1971), was a court case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Iowa]], in which a homeowner (Edward Briney) was held liable for [[battery (tort)|battery]] for injuries caused to a trespasser (Marvin Katko) who set off a [[spring gun]] set as a [[mantrap (snare)|mantrap]] in an abandoned house on the homeowner's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Katko v. Briney |vol=183 |reporter=N.W.2d |opinion=657 |pinpoint= |court=Iowa |date=1971 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2151117/katko-v-briney/ |accessdate=2018-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual background==
Briney inherited an old farmhouse in [[Mahaska County, Iowa]], which he had left vacant for the last ten years prior to the incident. He had the house boarded up and placed "No Trespassing" signs around the property. The house was in poor condition and was subject to frequent burglaries and break-ins. To defend the house against intruders, Briney mounted a 20-gauge spring-loaded shotgun in the farmhouse and rigged it to fire when the north bedroom door was opened. The gun was aimed downward so as to shoot an intruder's legs, rather than cause a mortal injury. Briney also covered the bedroom window with steel. A month later, on July 16, 1967, Katko entered the farmhouse with the intent of stealing some old bottles and dated fruit jars that Katko considered antiques. He was aware of their presence because he and a friend had broken into the house two weeks earlier. When Katko entered the bedroom, he tripped the trigger mechanism and the shotgun fired into his legs at [[point blank]] range. The [[gunshot wound]]s  were sufficiently severe to require hospitalization, and Katko sued Briney after his release from the hospital.

==Opinion of the Court==
Garold Heslinga of Oskaloosa, Iowa, was the attorney for the appellee (Katko) and Bruce Palmer and H.S. Life. also of Oskaloosa, Iowa, represented the appellants (Brineys).

The Court ruled that using [[deadly force]] on intruders in an unoccupied property was not reasonable or justified. Briney would have been justified in defending himself with the shotgun if he had been home during the intrusion. The plaintiff's status as a trespasser is irrelevant when assessing liability in this case. 

The case stands for the proposition that, although a landowner has no duty to make his property safe for trespassers, he may not set deadly traps against them, holding that "the law has always placed a higher value upon human safety than upon mere rights in property." The court thus ruled for Katko, entering judgment for $20,000 in actual damages and $10,000 in punitive damages.

==Aftermath==
The case had several subsequent results. The Brineys sold 80 of their {{convert|120|acre|km2}} to pay the judgment while proceeding with an appeal. Three of Briney's neighbors bought the property at auction, paying $1 more than the minimum bid of $10,000. After the appeal was denied, they made a [[leaseback]] arrangement with Briney, but eventually one sold his share to his son for a profit. Briney and Katko then joined together in a lawsuit against the neighbor to create a [[constructive trust]] on the profit, but the case was settled before trial in an amount sufficient to close out the judgment against Briney.&lt;ref name="Munneke"&gt;{{cite book

|author= Gary A. Munneke
|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|isbn=9780764113871
|year=2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Katko's injury was misreported by the [[United Press International]] [[wire service]] as having taken place in the Briney residence, several states introduced what were called "Briney Bills" for [[self-defense (theory)|self-defense]], which was not at issue in the case. The [[Nebraska Legislature]] act, stating that "no person&amp;nbsp;... shall be placed in&amp;nbsp;... jeopardy&amp;nbsp;... for protecting, by any means necessary, himself, his family, or his real estate property", was overturned due to improper delegation of sentencing authority in ''State v. Goodseal'' (1971).&lt;ref name="Munneke"/&gt;

Four years after the case was decided, Briney was asked if he would change anything about the situation. Briney replied, "There's one thing I'd do different, though: I'd have aimed that gun a few feet higher."&lt;ref&gt;Van, J., "[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1975/04/25/page/1/article/booby-trap-case-in-iowa-takes-new-turn Booby trap case in Iowa takes new turn]," ''Chicago Tribune'', April 25, 1975, at 1, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laszlo Toth 1972.jpg|thumb|350px|Laszlo Toth is being removed from the ''Pietà'' on 21 May 1972]]
'''Laszlo Toth''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Tóth László''; 1 July 1938 – 11 September 2012) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[Australian]] [[geologist]]. He achieved worldwide notoriety when he vandalised [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' statue on 21 May 1972. Toth was not charged with any [[criminal offence]] after the incident. He was hospitalized in [[Italy]] for two years. On his release, he was immediately [[deportation|deported]] to [[Australia]]. 

==Early life==
Toth was born in [[Pilisvörösvár]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], to a Roman Catholic family. After graduating in geology, in 1965 he moved to Australia. As his English was poor and his geology diploma was not recognized, Toth initially worked at a soap factory. In June 1971 he moved to Rome, Italy, knowing no [[Italian language|Italian]], and aiming to become recognized as [[Christ]]. He sent letters to [[Pope Paul VI]] and unsuccessfully attempted to meet him.&lt;ref name=Gamboni/&gt;

==Vandalism of ''Pietà''==
On 21 May 1972, at 33 years of age ([[Jesus]]'s traditional age at death), on the Feast of [[Pentecost]], Toth, wielding a [[geologist's hammer]] and shouting, "I am Jesus Christ — risen from the dead",&lt;ref name=Gamboni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

With fifteen blows&lt;ref name="saint"/&gt; he removed Mary's arm at the elbow, knocked off a chunk of her nose, and chipped one of her eyelids. Toth was subdued by bystanders, including American sculptor [[Bob Cassilly]], who hit Toth several times before pulling him away from the ''Pietà''.&lt;ref name=stpr&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Schlafly |title=Remembering Bob Cassilly |url=http://www.stlpublicradio.org/programs/commentaries/commentary.php?cid=1310 |work=[[St. Louis Public Radio]] |publisher= |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106095407/http://www.stlpublicradio.org/programs/commentaries/commentary.php?cid=1310 |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of his apparent [[insanity defense|insanity]] Toth was never charged with the crime. On 29 January 1973, he was committed to an Italian [[psychiatric hospital]]. He was released on 9 February 1975, and was immediately deported to Australia, where he had studied prior to the attack; Australian authorities did not detain him.

There are a wide variety of views regarding the '''legal status of the State of Palestine''', both among the states of the international community and among legal scholars.

==Statehood for the purposes of the UN Charter==

[[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) had been recognized as "sole legitimate representative of the [[Palestinian people]]," competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the UN General Assembly in addition to the right of the Palestinian people in Palestine to national independence and sovereignty, and was granted [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Palestine|observer status]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] as a "non-state entity", from 1974.&lt;ref name=GA3237&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/RES/3237(XXIX) |body=A |type=R |session=29 |resolution_number=3237 (XXIX) |title=Observer status for the Palestine Liberation Organization |date=22 November 1974 |meeting=2296th plenary meeting |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-November 2011, the PLO submitted an official application to become a [[Member states of the United Nations|full member of the UN]].&lt;ref name=UNStatehoodBid2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas Makes UN Statehood Bid|date=23 September 2011|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15033357 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A successful application would require approval from the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and a two-thirds majority in the UN General Assembly.

During the Security Council hearings regarding Israel's application for membership in the UN, he said:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[W]e already have, among the members of the United Nations, some political entities which do not possess full sovereign power to form their own international policy, which traditionally has been considered characteristic of a State. We know however, that neither at San Francisco nor subsequently has the United Nations considered that complete freedom to frame and manage one's own foreign policy was an essential requisite of United Nations membership.... ...The reason for which I mention the qualification of this aspect of the traditional definition of a State is to underline the point that the term "State", as used and applied in Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations, may not be wholly identical with the term "State" as it is used and defined in classic textbooks on international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/PV.383 |title=See page 12 of S/PV.383, 2 December 1948 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=9 September 2002 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, Riyad al-Maliki, the [[Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Foreign Minister]] of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], provided proof that Palestine had been extended legal recognition as a state by 67 other countries, and had bilateral agreements with states in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ICC Prosecutor Considers 'Gaza War Crimes' Probe |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=10 March 2009 |url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/newsDetail.action;jsessionid=VMc0TL5LNuKoWnohMmW5bZJc?newsId=169152&amp;columnistId=0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140616040333/http://www.sundayszaman.com/newsDetail.action;jsessionid=VMc0TL5LNuKoWnohMmW5bZJc?newsId=169152&amp;columnistId=0 |archive-date=16 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=8 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration and Act of State Doctrine==

[[International recognition of the State of Palestine|Many states]] have recognized the State of Palestine since 1988. Under the principles of customary international law, when a government is recognized by another government, recognition is retroactive in effect, and validates all the actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;See for example "The Restatement (Third) Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 443 "The Act of State Doctrine", Commentary a., RN 3; or ''Oetjen v. Cent.Leather Co.'', 246 U.S. 297, 303 (1918)[http://supreme.justia.com/us/246/297/case.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Talmon notes that many countries have a formal policy of recognizing states, not their governments. In practice, they usually make no formal declarations regarding recognition. He cites several examples including a memorandum on US recognition policy and practice, dated 25 September 1981, which said that recognition would be implied by the US government's dealings with the new government.&lt;ref&gt;Talmon, 1998, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have expressed their intention to enter into relations with the State of Palestine. The US formally recognized the West Bank and Gaza Strip as "one area for political, economic, legal and other purposes" in 1997 at the request of the Palestinian Authority. At that time, it asked the public to take notice of that fact through announcements it placed in the ''[[Federal Register]]'', the official journal of the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-03-14/pdf/97-6434.pdf |title=See the explanatory note in T.D. 97–16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USAID West Bank/Gaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Portal homepage |url=http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/home.html |title=USAID West Bank/Gaza |publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Development]] |date=n.d. |accessdate=25 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009120535/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/home.html |archivedate= 9 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been tasked with "state-building" projects in the areas of democracy, governance, resources, and infrastructure.

The view of the [[European Union|European states]], which did not extend full recognition was expressed by [[President of France|French President]] [[François Mitterrand]] who stated: "Many European countries are not ready to recognize a Palestine state. Others think that between recognition and non-recognition there are significant degrees; I am among these."&lt;ref name=quigley2009&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[John Quigley (academic)|Quigley, John]] |title=The Palestine Declaration to the International Criminal Court: The Statehood Issue |journal=Rutgers Law Record |volume=35 |year=2009 |url=http://lawrecord.com/files/35_Rutgers_L_Rec_1.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Rutgers School of Law–Newark|Rutgers School of Law]] |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, after the PLO recognized the state of Israel, Mitterrand welcomed the PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, in Paris, in May 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Filiu|Filiu, Jean-Pierre]] (Winter 2009).

==Consequences of the occupation==

[[File:Barrier Gate at Bilin Palestine.jpg|thumb|right|A barrier gate at [[Bil'in]], [[West Bank]], 2006]]
After 1967, a number of legal arguments were advanced which dismissed the right of Palestinians to self-determination and statehood. They generally proposed that Palestine was a land void of a legitimate sovereign and supported Israeli claims to the remaining territory of the Palestine Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Z. Blum, The Missing Reversioner: Reflections on the Status of Judea and Samaria, 3 ISR. L. REV. 279, 289–90 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene V. Rostow, "Palestinian Self-Determination": Possible Futures for the Unallocated Territories of the Palestine Mandate, 5 YALE J. WORLD PUB. ORD. 147 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Historian and journalist, [[Gershom Gorenberg]], says that outside of the pro-settlement community in Israel, these positions are considered quirky. He says that, while the Israeli government has used them for [[Public relations|PR]] purposes abroad, it takes entirely different positions when arguing real legal cases before the Israeli Supreme Court. In 2005 Israel decided to dismantle all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank. Gorenberg notes, the government's decision was challenged in the Supreme Court by settlers, and the government won the case by noting the settlements were in territory whose legal status was that of 'belligerent territory'. The government argued that the settlers should have known the settlements were only temporary.&lt;ref&gt;See Gershom Gorenberg, The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967–1977, Macmillan, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8050-8241-7}}, page 363 and South Jerusalem On Settlement Legality, 24 November 2008 [http://southjerusalem.com/2008/11/on-settlement-legality-with-thanks-to-our-readers/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most UN member states questioned the claim that Israel held better title to the land than the inhabitants, and stressed that statehood was an inalienable right of the Palestinian people.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People [https://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/qpal/committee.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal experts, like David John Ball, concluded that "the Palestinians, based on the principles of self-determination and the power of the U.N., appear to hold better title to the territory."&lt;ref&gt;Ball, David John, 79 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 990 (2004), Toss the Travaux – Application of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Middle East Conflict – A Modern (Re)Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; The International Court of Justice subsequently reaffirmed the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the prohibition under customary and conventional international law against acquisition of territory by war.

The Israeli Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice, cited a case involving the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|disengagement from Gaza]] and said that "The Judea and Samaria areas are held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The long arm of the state in the area is the military commander. He is not the sovereign in the territory held in belligerent occupation. His power is granted him by public international law regarding belligerent occupation. The legal meaning of this view is twofold: first, Israeli law does not apply in these areas. They have not been "annexed" to Israel. Second, the legal regime which applies in these areas is determined by public international law regarding belligerent occupation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Barak|2005|pp=8–9}} (internal citations and emphasis omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

The court said that most Israelis in Gaza did not own the land they built on there. "They acquired their rights from the military commander, or from persons acting on his behalf. Neither the military commander nor those acting on his behalf are owners of the property, and they cannot transfer rights better than those they have. To the extent that the Israelis built their homes and assets on land which is not private ('state land'), that land is not owned by the military commander. His authority is defined in regulation 55 of ''The Hague Regulations''. [...] The State of Israel acts [...] as the administrator of the state property and as [[usufruct]]uary of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Barak|2005|p=17}} (quoting the decision in ''The Gaza Coast Regional Council v. The Knesset et al.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decisions of international and national tribunals==

The U.S. State Department ''Digest of International Law'' says that the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]  provided for the application of the principles of [[state succession]] to the [[League of Nations mandate#Class A mandates|"A" Mandates]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1920 provisionally recognized the former Ottoman communities as independent nations. It also required Germany to recognize the disposition of the former Ottoman territories and to recognize the new states laid down within their boundaries. The Treaty of Lausanne required the newly created states that acquired the territory to pay annuities on the Ottoman public debt, and to assume responsibility for the administration of concessions that had been granted by the Ottomans. A dispute regarding the status of the territories was settled by an Arbitrator appointed by the Council of the [[League of Nations]]. It was decided that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created states according to the terms of the applicable post-war treaties. In its ''Judgment No. 5, The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions'', the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] also decided that Palestine was responsible as the successor state for concessions granted by Ottoman authorities. The Courts of Palestine and Great Britain decided that title to the properties shown on the Ottoman Civil list had been ceded to the government of Palestine as an allied successor state.&lt;ref name=Whiteman&gt;See Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1, U.S. State Department (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp 650–652&lt;/ref&gt;

==State succession==

A legal analysis by the [[International Court of Justice]] noted that the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] had provisionally recognized the communities of Mandate Palestine as independent nations. The mandate simply marked a transitory period, with the aim and object of leading the mandated territory to become an independent self-governing State.&lt;ref name=OrmsbyGore&gt;See the Statement of the Principal Accredited Representative, Hon.

''Defending the Rights of Others''.  [[Cambridge University Press]].  {{ISBN|0-521-02994-5}}. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The guarantees have frequently been referred to as "religious rights" or "minority rights". However, the guarantees included a prohibition against discrimination in civil and political matters. Difference of religion could not be alleged against any person as a ground for exclusion or incapacity in matters relating to the enjoyment of civil or political rights, admission to public employments, functions, and honors, or the exercise of the various professions and industries, "in any locality whatsoever."

The resolution of the San Remo Conference contained a safeguarding clause for all of those rights. The conference accepted the terms of the Mandate with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the process-verbal a legal undertaking by the Mandatory Power that it would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;See Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919, p. 94 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv13&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=94].&lt;/ref&gt; The draft mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, and all of the post-war peace treaties contained clauses for the protection of minorities. The mandates invoked the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the event of any disputes.&lt;ref&gt;See Summary of the work of the League of Nations, January 1920 – March 1922, League of Nations Union, 1922, p. 4 [https://archive.org/details/summaryofworkofl00leagiala].&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 28 of the Mandate required that those rights be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee.&lt;ref name=OrmsbyGore /&gt; The General Assembly's ''Plan for the Future Government of Palestine'' placed those rights under UN protection as part of a [[Minority Treaties|minority protection plan]].&lt;ref&gt;It was cataloged during a review of Minority Rights Treaties conducted in 1950: see UN Document E/CN.4/367, 7 April 1950.

==Opinions of officials and legal scholars==

Jacob Robinson was a legal advisor to the United Nations delegation of the Jewish Agency for Palestine during the special session of the General Assembly in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;See The Life, Times and Work of Jokubas Robinzonas – Jacob Robinson [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/termine/id=8048]; and Palestine and the United Nations: prelude to solution, By Jacob Robinson, [[Greenwood Press]] reprint; New ed of 1947 ed edition (28 September 1971), {{ISBN|0-8371-5986-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He advised the Zionist Executive that the provisional states had come into existence as a result of the resolution of 29 November 1947.&lt;ref name=Kassim&gt;Kassim, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|279}}

L.C. Green explained that "recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Israel Yearbook on Human Rights'', 1989, Yoram Dinstein, Mala Tabory eds., [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]], 1990, {{ISBN|0-7923-0450-0}}, pp. 135-136 {{Google books |id=5okNqth8I9wC |page=135 |title= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Takkenberg writes that while "there is no doubt that the entity 'Palestine' should be considered a state ''[[in statu nascendi]]'' and although it is increasingly likely that the ongoing peace process will eventually culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian state, it is premature to conclude that statehood, as defined by international law, is at present (spring 1997) firmly established."&lt;ref name=Takkenbergp181&gt;Takkenberg, 1998, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the four criteria of statehood, as outlined in the 1933 [[Montevideo Convention]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, a permanent population, a defined territory, government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states&amp;nbsp;– Takkenberg states that the entity known as Palestine does not fully satisfy these criteria.&lt;ref name=Takkenbergp181/&gt;

Conversely John V. Whitbeck, who served as an advisor to the Palestinian negotiation team during negotiations with Israel, writes that "the State of Palestine already exists," and that when, "Judged by these customary criteria [those of the Montevideo Convention], the State of Palestine is on at least as firm a legal footing as the State of Israel." He continues: "The weak link in Palestine's claim to already exist as a state was, until recently, the fourth criterion, "effective control... Yet a Palestinian executive and [[Palestinian Legislative Council|legislature]], democratically elected with the enthusiastic approval of the international community, now exercises 'effective control' over a portion of Palestinian territory in which the great majority of the state's population lives. It can no longer be seriously argued that Palestine's claim to exist falls at the fourth and final hurdle."&lt;ref name=Whitbeck&gt;{{cite journal|volume=3|issue=2|year=1996|title=The Palestinian State Exists|url=http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=544|accessdate=5 August 2009|journal=[[Palestine–Israel Journal|Palestine–Israel Journal of Politics, Economics and Culture]] |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], Palestine's existence as a state predates the 1988 declaration. Tracing Palestine's status as an international entity back to the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] after [[World War I]], he recalls that the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine Mandate]] (1918–48), an arrangement made under Article 22 of the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]], held as its "ultimate objective", the "[[self-determination]] and independence of the people concerned." He says that in explicitly referring to the Covenant, the 1988 declaration was reaffirming an existing Palestinian statehood.&lt;ref&gt;See Silverburg, Sanford R. (2002). ''Palestine and International Law: Essays on Politics and Economics''. Jefferson, North Carolina:  [[McFarland &amp; Company]]. {{ISBN|0-7864-1191-0}}. pp. 37–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that Palestine under the Mandate entered into [[Bilateral treaty|bilateral treaties]], including one with [[Great Britain]], the Mandatory power, he cites this as an example of its "sovereignty" at that time. He also notes the corollary of the [[Stimson Doctrine]] and the customary prohibition on the use of force contained in the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, "[a]n entity does not necessarily cease to be a state even if all of its territory has been occupied by a foreign power".&lt;ref name=quigley2009 /&gt;

Robert Weston Ash says that Quigley's analysis of the declaration that the Palestinian Authority provided to the International Criminal Court failed to explain a number of key issues. He says the "Palestinian people" to whom sovereignty reverted upon the departure of the British would have included both Jews and Arabs. He suggests that establishes a colorable Jewish&amp;nbsp;—as well as Arab&amp;nbsp;— claim to all of Palestine which tends to refute Professor Quigley's contention that there are no other claimants to that territory. Ash says there are segments of Israeli society that continue to view "Judea and Samaria" as areas promised to the Jews by the [[Balfour Declaration]] and says that the Geneva Convention is not applicable to Israel's presence in those territories. He cites [[Yehuda Blum]]'s "Missing Reversioner" and [[Eugene Rostow]]'s related claim that "The right of the Jewish people to settle in Palestine has never been terminated for the West Bank." He also notes that 'the terms of the Interim Agreement prohibit both Israel and the PA from
“initiat[ing] or tak[ing] any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert Weston |last1=Ash |title=Is Palestine a "State"?

Disputes have arisen as a result of the [[Conflict of laws]] between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Judgments originating in Israeli Courts are not directly enforceable in the Courts of the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Karayanni, Michael M. [http://students.law.umich.edu/mjil/article-pdfs/v29n4-karayanni.pdf ''The Quest for Creative Jurisdiction: The Evolution of Personal Jurisdiction Doctrine of Israeli Courts Towards the Palestinian Territories''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001033334/http://students.law.umich.edu/mjil/article-pdfs/v29n4-karayanni.pdf |date=1 October 2010 }} (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court of Israel ruled that the Palestinian Authority satisfied the criteria to be legally treated as a sovereign state&lt;ref&gt;See Elon Moreh College Association v. The State of Israel, 3 April 2006; Mis. Civ. P. (Jer) 1008/06, Elon Moreh College Association v.

The Supreme Court held that the Palestinian Authority can be granted state immunity on an ad hoc basis when it is warranted by the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elyon2.court.gov.il/files/03/600/040/P38/03040600.P38.htm |title=The Israeli Supreme Court Ruling in Hebrew |publisher=Elyon2.court.gov.il |date=9 December 2004 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knesset responded to the willingness of the judges to engage in examination of the notion of 'statehood for the purpose of state immunity' by adopting a measure that makes it possible to grant sovereign immunity to a 'political entity that is not a state' as part of the 2008 Foreign States Immunity Law, Art. 20.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronen, Yael "ICC Jurisdiction Over Acts Committed in the Gaza Strip: Article 12(3) of the ICC Statute and Non-State Entities", ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 2010, p. 24 [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1530529].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefan Talmon notes that "In international law it is true that one generally recognizes the Government which exercises effective control over a territory. But this is not an absolute rule without exceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Talmon, 1998, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; James Crawford notes that despite its prevalence, and inclusion in the statehood criteria found in the Montevideo Convention, effectiveness is not the sole or even the critical criterion for statehood. He cites several examples of annexations and governments that have been recognized despite their lack of a territorial foothold.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 1999, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu recently expressed a willingness to recognize the State of Palestine if it will agree to forgo taking effective control of its airspace, military defense, and not enter into alliances with Israel's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://enduringamerica.com/2009/06/14/transcript-netanyahu-speech-on-israel-palestine-14-june/ |title=See Transcript: Netanyahu Speech on Israel-Palestine (14 June 2009) |publisher=Enduringamerica.com |date=14 June 2009 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Palestinian officials were reported to be preparing the ground for asking for recognition of a Palestinian State from the [[Security Council]]. The state was envisioned to be based on the 1967 [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] as an international border with Israel and East Jerusalem as its capital. The plan was reported to have support from Arab states, Russia and the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Issacharoff, Avi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1128052.html |title=PA Negotiator: We May Seek UN Recognition of Palestinian State&amp;nbsp;– A-Sharq Al-Awsat: U.S. Won't Pressure Israel, Palestinians To Renew Peace Talks Unless Both Sides Are Ready |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary General said "Today, the State of Israel exists, but the State of Palestine does not." "It is vital that a sovereign State of Palestine is achieved". "This should be on the basis of the 1967 lines with agreed land swaps and a just and agreed solution to the refugee issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/6966/2009/12/01/195s532672.htm "A Sovereign State of Palestine, Vital: UN Chief"] (1 December 2009).  [[Xinhua News Agency]] (via [[China Radio International]]).  Retrieved 27 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2010, the representative of Palestine deposited a copy of a letter submitted by Prime Minister Fayyad with the UN Secretary-General. The letter reported on the decree issued by Mahmoud Abbas, "President of the State of Palestine", concerning the formation of an independent commission to follow up on the Goldstone report in compliance with General Assembly resolution 64/10 of 5 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;See Report of the Secretary-General, UN Document A/64/651, 4 February 2010 para 5 and Annex II [https://unispal.un.org/pdfs/A64651.pdf] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul De Waart says that the Quartet, particularly the United States, as well as western states, do not consider Palestine to be a state as yet. In their view the statehood of Palestine will be the result of bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people. He says they have overlooked that under international law it is not anymore a question of creating but of recognizing the State of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;International symposium ICJ and Israel's Wall, The Hague 9 July 2009, Address P.J.I.M. de Waart {{cite web |url=http://www.unitedcivilians.nl/documents/docs/Toespraak_Paul_de_Waart.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306150635/http://www.unitedcivilians.nl/documents/docs/Toespraak_Paul_de_Waart.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df= }} (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli legal expert Ruth Lapidoth said the Palestinians have already unilaterally declared statehood, and they did not need to do it again. "Recognition of statehood is a political act, and every state has the right to decide for itself whether to recognize another state."&lt;ref&gt;Lazaroff, Tovah (14 November 2009).  [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1258027286557&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Lieberman Warns Against '67 Borders"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.  ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.  Retrieved 27 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Abbas said that the State of Palestine was already in existence and that the current battle is to have the state's border recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Waked, Ali |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3803622,00.html |title=Abbas: Palestinian State an Existing Fact&amp;nbsp;– Thousands of Fatah Supporters Gather at Ramallah's Presidential Compound To Mark Fifth Anniversary of Former PA Chairman Arafat's Death, Refer to Abbas as 'His Worthy Successor'&amp;nbsp;– Palestinian President Tells Audience Current Battle Is To Have Future State's Borders Recognized |publisher=[[Ynet]] |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Segal wrote about Salam Fayyad's plan for Palestinian statehood. He said lest anyone believe that the 1988 declaration is ancient history, they should read the new Fayyad plan with more care. It cites the 1988 declaration four times, identifying it as having articulated "the foundations of the Palestinian state."&lt;ref&gt;See The 1988 Declaration of Independence  [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1131101.html] and Ending the Occupation, Establishing the State&amp;nbsp;– Program of the Thirteenth Government [http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=20388&amp;CategoryId=8].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the World Bank released a report which found the Palestinian Authority "well-positioned to establish a state" at any point in the near future. The report highlighted, however, that unless private-sector growth in the Palestinian economy was stimulated, a Palestinian state would remain donor dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=16 September 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/17/idINIndia-51555820100917 |title=Palestinians Able To Establish A State&amp;nbsp;– World Bank |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the UN's co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process issued a report lauding the Palestinian Authority, describing "aspects of its administration as sufficient for an independent state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Palestinian State-Building:  A Decisive Period |format=PDF |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/UN-Report-Palestinian-Building-April2011.pdf |publisher=Office of the [[United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process]] (via ''[[The New York Times]]'') |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KershnerNYT&gt;{{cite news |title=U.N.

The '''Luluabourg Constitution''' ({{lang-fr|Constitution de Luluabourg}}) was the second constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Functional from 1 August 1964 until November 1965, it was meant to replace the provisional ''Loi Fundamental'' that had been enacted when independence was declared in 1960. Unlike its predecessor, the Luluabourg Constitution featured a strong [[Executive (government)|executive]] presidency and carefully delineated [[federalism]] between the central government and the provinces. It also formalized the adoption of the name "Democratic Republic of the Congo", succeeding the name "[[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]".

== Background ==
As was agreed upon by the participants in the [[Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference]] in 1960, a formal constitution was to be agreed upon by the Congolese within three to four years of independence.{{sfn|Mutamba Makombo|2017|p=}}

== Summary ==
The Luluabourg Constitution was mostly a compensation for what its authors perceived to be the shortfalls of the ''Loi Fundamental''. Its principal features were a centralized and strengthened executive and a punctilious separation of responsibilities between the central and provincial governments.{{sfn|Leibholz|1966|p=658}}

=== National flag and state name ===
The constitution formally changed the name of the country from "[[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]" to "Democratic Republic of the Congo" and adopted a new national flag.{{sfn|Kisangani|2016|pp=239–240}}

=== Presidency ===
According to the constitution, the president "determines and directs the policy of the state" and "establishes the framework of government action, supervises its application, and informs Parliament of its development".{{sfn|Leibholz|1966|p=658}} 

The president was to be selected by an [[electoral college]] composed of members of Parliament, members from every provincial assembly, and several delegates from the capital with the number of them being determined by how much representation they would be accorded to in Parliament based on population. The capital delegates and parliamentary delegates would meet in the capital to cast their vote, while the provincial assembly electors would do the same from their respective provincial capitals. All presidential candidates had to be at least 40 years of age. The president was to be chosen by the candidate with a simple majority. If this was not achieved on the first two ballots, then the candidate with a plurality on the third would become president.{{sfn|Leibholz|1966|p=659}}

=== Premiership ===
The office of prime minister was retained, thought its functions and responsibilities were largely reduced. The prime minister and all other cabinet ministers were to be named and revoked either individually or collectively by the president.{{sfn|Leibholz|1966|p=658}}

=== Nationality ===
Article 6 restricted Congolese nationality solely to persons whose ancestors were a part of an ethnic group that had lived in the Congo before 18 October 1908. This rule could be circumvented if a person submitted a formal request to change their nationality within 12 months of the promulgation of the constitution.{{sfn|Kisangani|2016|p=467}}

== Effects and criticisms ==
The Luluabourg Constitution denied citizenship to most Rwandan immigrants in the Congo.{{sfn|Kisangani|2016|p=467}} [[Marcel Bisukiro]], a former government minister, criticised it as discriminatory.{{sfn|The International Journal of African Historical Studies|1997|p=523}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8566">'''Master and Servant Acts''' or '''Masters and Servants Acts''' were [[law]]s designed to regulate relations between [[employer]]s and [[employee]]s during the 18th and 19th centuries. An 1823 [[United Kingdom]] Act described its purpose as "the better regulations of servants, labourers and work people". This particular Act greatly influenced [[industrial relations]] &lt;!--Not labor please, as this is a British English article.--&gt; and [[employment law]] in the [[United States]], [[Australia]] (an 1845 Act), [[Canada]] (1847), [[New Zealand]] (1856) and [[South Africa]] (1856). These Acts are generally regarded as heavily biased towards employers, designed to discipline employees and repress the "combination" of workers in [[trade unions]].&lt;!--Not "labour unions" please, that is American English, albeit with British English spelling--&gt;

The law required the obedience and loyalty from servants to their [[contract]]ed employer, with infringements of the contract punishable before a court of law, often with a jail sentence of hard labour. It was used against workers organising for better conditions from its inception until well after the first [[United Kingdom]] [[Trade Union Act 1871]] was implemented, which secured the legal status of trade unions. Until then, a trade union could be regarded as illegal because of being "in restraint of trade".

During the 1860s, punitive provisions were extended by judicial interpretation, leading to the imprisonment of union officials who led strikes or issued verbal calls challenging an employer's hiring practices such as only using non-union workers. A revised Master and Servant Act was passed in 1867, which supposedly limited imprisonment to "aggravated" breaches of contract (where injury to persons or property was likely to result), but it was clear that only workers were subject to its provisions.  Imprisonment, even for non-aggravated breaches of contract, continued when working people failed to comply with court orders for specific performance or for non-payment of monetary damages and fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lawcourts.org/LPBR/reviews/curthoys105.htm|title=Review of "Governments, Labour, and the Law In Mid-Victorian Britain: the Trade Union Legislation Of the 1870s", by Mark Curthoys|author=Philip Benesch|journal=Law and Politics Book Review|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12-17|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1858 and 1875 on average 10,000 prosecutions a year took place under the Act in Britain.  Ernest Jones, a [[barrister]], estimated that, "[I]n one year alone, 1864, the last return given, under the Master and Servants Act, 10,246 working men were imprisoned at the suit of their masters — not one master at the suit of the men!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk/dop_e_jones_democracy.htm|title=Democracy Vindicated|author=Ernest Jones|date=4 January 1867|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303111036/http://www.gerald-massey.org.uk/dop_e_jones_democracy.htm|archive-date=3 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence, however, that this may not universally have been the case; at least one scholar has shown that local courts enforced causes of action in the early-to-mid-19th century against masters as well, in at least some instances, albeit in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/4176569-Pilarczyk.pdf|title="Too Well Used by His Master": Judicial Enforcement of Servants' Rights in Montreal, 1830-1845|author=Ian C.

As little as one hour's absence by a free servant without permission could precipitate a punishment of prison or the [[Treadwheel|treadmill]]. In 1840, employees in Australia who left their employment without permission were subject to being hunted down under the [[Bushrangers Act]]. In the [[Melbourne]] jurisdiction, between 1835 and 1845, when labour shortages were acute, over 20% of prison inmates had been convicted under the  [[New South Wales Act 1823|New South Wales Act of 1823]] for offences including leaving place of work without permission and being found in hotels.&lt;ref name=LabourHistory16&gt;''Newcastle Miners and The Master and Servant Act, 1830–1862'' by J.W. Turner in ''Labour History'' number 16, May 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1902, the 1823 Act had been modified to include forfeit of wages if the written or unwritten contract for work was unfulfilled. Absence from place of work was punishable by imprisonment of up to three months with or without hard labour. There were also penalties of up to 10 pounds for anyone who harboured, concealed or re-employed a 'servant' (i.e. worker) who had deserted or absconded or absented himself from his duty implied in the 'contract'.&lt;ref name=MasterServant1902&gt;[[wikisource:Masters and Servants Act (1902) N.S.W.|Masters and Servants Act (1902) N.S.W.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1823 Act is not a widely remembered part of Australian political history (although there is a more general association of unacceptable [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] with the Victorian period). In 2006 a group of trade unionists referred to the 1823 Act in their criticism of the "[[WorkChoices]]" industrial relations policies of the [[John Howard|Howard]] government, claiming that "Our rights as workers are back where they were in the early 1800s - the only thing now missing is a Master - Servants Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2006/07/116625.php|title=The Peoples Demands|author=Geelong Trades Hall|date=11 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813153421/http://melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2006/07/116625.php|archive-date=13 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar comparisons have been made by social commentators, unionists and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/06/22/1119321789172.html|title=Howard aims to create his own dystopia|author=Kenneth Davidson|date=23 June 2005|website=[[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|jurisdiction=[[New South Wales]]|title=CASUAL WORKERS|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20051012039|house=[[Legislative Council of New South Wales]]|date=12 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222221837/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20051012039|archivedate=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfmeu-construction-nsw.com.au/pdf/SpeechDC.pdf&amp;e=9797&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2018}}

A '''no-liability company''' in Australia (suffix '''NL''') is a [[company (law)|company]] which, under the [[Corporations Act 2001]] (Cth), must have as its stated objects that it is solely a [[mining]] company and that it is not entitled to calls on the unpaid issue price of shares. It is a company which is restricted to mining activities and is the only sort of corporation which is entitled to this form of liability, given the sometimes financially risky business of mining. Most of the usual rules in the Act apply to no-liability companies, save that a mining company must adopt a [[constitution]] which states their objects as mining.

No-liability companies should not be confused with the concept of [[limited liability]].

No-liability companies are differentiated from other companies as their shareholders are not liable to pay calls on unpaid shares. This differs from traditional company structure where the purchase of shares is a binding contract. Should the shareholder choose not to pay when there is a call, the shareholder forfeits both the unpaid and paid shares.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anz.com/edna/dictionary.asp?action=content&amp;content=no_liability&lt;/ref&gt; This encourages investment in potentially risky mining ventures, as a shareholder with unpaid shares can choose to withdraw from the company with no legal consequences. A successful mining company usually converts to a limited liability company when advantageous.

== Forfeiture ==

Shares upon which calls had not been paid were forfeit and offered for sale by auction after 14 days.  Former owners could redeem their forfeited shares by paying the call and perhaps a fee to cover expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43256971 |title=MINING. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=11 December 1924 |accessdate=12 September 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company names ==

Early on in the life of the No Liability system, such companies were identified as
* ABC Mining (registered) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5864833 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=25 July 1872 |accessdate=19 September 2012 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the "No Liability" tag took over, such as
* ABC Mining (no liability)
* DEF Mining no liability

And finally
* GHI Mining N.L.

The word "mining" does not have to appear in the name of the company.  Oil exploration is a form of mining.
* [[Poseidon bubble|Poseidon NL]]

== Timeline ==
* No Liability companies were introduced at a time when there were six colonies, and therefore six sets of laws.
* 1845 – [[South Australian Mining Association]] was founded as a "no responsibility" (with the same meaning) company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27449887 |title=Non-Responsibility Mining Association |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=9 April 1845 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1869 – no liability companies introduced in Victoria
* 1877 – No-liability Mining Companies Bill introduced in New South Wales &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70599193 |title=No-Liability Mining Companies. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=NSW |date=24 February 1877 |accessdate=12 September 2012 |page=26 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13388665 |title=No-Liability Mining Companies |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 January 1877 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61273220 |title=No-liability Mining Companies Bill. |newspaper=[[Clarence and Richmond Examiner]] |location=Grafton, NSW |date=10 September 1895 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61273220 |title=No-liability Mining Companies Bill. |newspaper=[[Clarence and Richmond Examiner]] |location=Grafton, NSW |date=10 September 1895 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61273220 |title=No-liability Mining Companies Bill. |newspaper=[[Clarence and Richmond Examiner]] |location=Grafton, NSW |date=10 September 1895 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversions ==

Ordinary mining and exploration companies could convert to No Liability status, subject to approval of shareholders and approval of creditors.  This was particularly useful when NL status was first introduced.

No Liability companies which discovered a payable deposit of ore would normally convert to Limited status as this facilitated the financing of that mine.

== Stock exchange ==

Companies in Australia listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]] have a three-character symbol.  NL companies may have more than one class of contributing shares.  A typical set of symbols might be:

* XYZ – fully paid
* XYZCA – contributing shares class A
* XYZCB – contributing shares class B

The code does not distinguish between No Liability companies and ordinary companies,  only the full company name does that.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3327">"'''Policy-based evidence making'''" is a pejorative term which refers to the commissioning of research in order to support a [[policy]] which has already been decided upon. The name has been suggested as the converse of [[Evidence-based policy|evidence-based policy making]]. 

As the name suggests, policy-based evidence making means working back from a predefined policy to produce underpinning evidence. Working from a conclusion to provide only supporting evidence is an approach which contradicts most interpretations of the [[scientific method]]; however, it should be distinguished from research into the effects of a policy where such research may provide either supporting or opposing evidence.

In July 2006, Rebecca Boden and Debbie Epstein published a paper in which they wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This need [for evidence] has been reified in the UK and elsewhere, as routines of "evidence-based policy"-making have been hardwired into the business of Government. Intuitively, basing policies that affect people's lives and the economy on rigorous academic research sounds rational and desirable. However, such approaches are fundamentally flawed by virtue of the fact that Government, in its broadest sense, seeks to capture and control the knowledge producing processes to the point where this type of "research" might best be described as "policy-based evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boden|first=Rebecca|last2=Epstein|first2=Debbie|date=2006|title=Managing the research imagination? Globalisation and research in higher education|journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education|volume=4|issue=2|pages=223–236|doi=10.1080/14767720600752619}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "policy-based evidence making" was later referred to in a report of the [[United Kingdom]] [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Select Committee on Science and Technology into Scientific Advice, Risk and Evidence Based Policy Making issued in October 2006. The committee stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ministers] should certainly not seek selectively to pick pieces of evidence which support an already agreed policy, or even commission research in order to produce a justification for policy: so-called "policy-based evidence making" (see paragraphs 95–6). '''Where there is an absence of evidence, or even when the Government is knowingly contradicting the evidence&amp;mdash;maybe for very good reason&amp;mdash;this should be openly acknowledged.''' [emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/900/900-i.pdf House of Commons Science and Technology Committee: Scientific Advice, Risk and Evidence Based Policy Making], paragraph 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term has also been applied outside the strictly scientific arena, for example in a position paper for the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/images/position_paper_oliver_bennett.pdf Position paper for AHRC by Oliver Bennett] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060852/http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/images/position_paper_oliver_bennett.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policy analysis''' is a technique used in [[public administration]] to enable [[civil servant]]s, [[Activism|activists]], and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of "determining which of various [[Policy|policies]] will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals."&lt;ref&gt;

* Analysis {{em|for}} new policy, which is prescriptive – it is involved with formulating policies and proposals (for example: to improve social welfare)

The areas of interest and the purpose of analysis determine what types of analysis are conducted.

&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis ''for'' policy (and analysis ''of'' policy) is the central approach in [[social science]] and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis ''for'' policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis ''of'' policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and [[think tank]] researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3340&amp;context=etd A Critical Policy Analysis of Internationalization in Postsecondary Education: An Ontario Case Study], ''The University of Western Ontario'', October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.&lt;ref name="Bührs93"/&gt;

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or "analycentric") approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===
The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., [[regulation]], [[legislation]], [[subsidy]]) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process &lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2015).  Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis. In F.M. Hult &amp; D.C Johnson (Eds.), &lt;i&gt;Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 217-231). Malden, MA: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 2010s, ''stakeholders'' is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more "buy in" from a wider group. One way of doing this followed a [[heuristic]] model called the ''[[Policy#Policy cycle|policy cycle]]''. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, [[cost-effectiveness]], value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. Qualitative research includes [[case studies]] and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]] (also called ''data analysis'') and [[model building]]. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful "back-room" analysis of policies by ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' assessment and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluation.

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as "Durability" of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible effective compatible change or results over time with robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effects'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Effectiveness''' || What effects does the policy have on the targeted problem?
|-
| '''Unintended effects'''&lt;ref&gt;Rychetnik et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the [[unintended effects]] of this policy?
|-
| '''Equity'''&lt;ref&gt;Potvin et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the effects of this policy on different population groups?
|}

'''Implementation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Cost''' || What is the financial cost of this policy (some analysts also include [[tax credit]]s in this analysis)?
|-
| '''Feasibility''' || Is the policy technically feasible?
|-
| '''Acceptability'''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || Do the relevant policy stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
|}

The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy's ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the "five-E approach", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bHQcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Empowerment Series |title=Introduction to Social Work &amp; Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives |first=Karen K. |last=Kirst-Ashman |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 1, 2016 |pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;[[Ethics|Ethical]] considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound?  Are there [[unintended consequences]]?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches?  Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are considered as frameworks that can optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jillian Jimenez|author2=Eileen Mayers Pasztor|author3=Ruth M. Chambers |author4=Cheryl Pearlman Fujii |title=Social Policy and Social Change: Toward the Creation of Social and Economic Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU0XBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2415-9|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of [[public policy]]. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)&lt;ref&gt;Kim Bergeron, Florence Morestin et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence supported models are:

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of [[law enforcement]], [[court]] systems, [[imprisonment]] and [[armed forces]]). The [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or [[arm's length]] bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[regulation|regulatory agencies]] and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
{{See also|Policy#Policy cycle|l1=Policy cycle}}

Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called "problem definition") and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if [[homelessness|homeless people]] are using [[illegal drug]]s such as [[heroin]] in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a [[law enforcement]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a [[poverty]] and [[public health]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if [[public health nurse]]s and government [[medical doctor]]s and [[substance abuse]] counsellors were sent to the park to do [[outreach]] with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter "[[detoxification]]" or [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, [[think tank]]s, [[interest group]]s, [[lobby group]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, '''policy legitimation''' is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves [[civil servant]]s putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new [[regulation]] (or [[Deregulation|removing existing regulations]]), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new [[subsidy]] or [[grant (money)|grant]], etc.
* Policy [[evaluation]]. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, [[civil servant]]s or an independent [[consulting firm]] assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions are of [[Herbert A. Simon]], the father of rational models. It is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to characteristics of the model being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational model====
:''See [[Rational planning model]] for a fuller discussion''

The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herbert, Simon |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions, such as: 'The model must be applied in a system that is stable'; 'The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices'; 'The policy problem is unambiguous'; 'There are no limitations of time or cost'.

Furthermore, in the context of the public sector policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3-4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), &amp; incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incremental policy====
{{More|Incrementalism}}
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisfying, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called "muddling through" &amp; represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time, resources, and brains to make totally new policies; as such, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they don't necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===
There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

====Group model====
This policy is formed as a result of forces and pressures from influential groups. Pressure groups are informally co-opted into the policy making process. Regulatory agencies are captured by those they are supposed to regulate. No one group is dominant all the time on all issues. The group is the bridge between the individual and the administration. The executive is thus pressured by interest groups.

The task of the system is to:
* Establish the rules of the game
* Arrange compromises and balance interests
* Enact compromises in policy
* Enforce these compromises.

====Other====
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
There are several other major types of policy analysis, broadly groupable into competing approaches:

*Empirical versus normative policy analyses
*Retrospective versus prospective analyses
*Prescriptive versus descriptive analyses.

===Techniques used in policy analysis===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
*Cost–benefit analysis
*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO)
*Operations research
*Decision-making based on analytics
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]] (PERT)
*[[Critical path method]] (CPM).

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives.  However, [[Correlation does not imply causation|claims of causality]] can only be made with [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social and Behavioral Sciences Team 2016 Annual Report|journal=Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council|date=2016|url=https://sbst.gov/download/2016%20SBST%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Laura|title=Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=United Kingdom Cabinet Office Behavioral Insights Team|date=2012|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/201256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Randomized Control Trials to Evaluate Public Policy|url=https://innovation.govspace.gov.au/using-randomised-control-trials-evaluate-public-policy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A. Saint-Germain, California State University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy.

; Planning:
* Clarify the policy
* Engage stakeholders
* Assess resources and evaluability
* Determine your evaluation questions
* Determine methods and procedures
* Develop evaluation plan

; Implementation:
* Collect data
* Process data and analyze results

; Utilization:
* Interpret and disseminate the results 
* Apply evaluation findings

'''[[Prisoners' rights]] in [[international law]]''' are found in a number of international treaties. For the most part these treaties came into existence following the [[World Wars|two World Wars]] and the body of law continues to be added to and amended.

==History==
The events of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] had a profound effect on international law due to the widespread denial of [[civil rights]] and [[liberties]] on the basis of racial, religious, and political discrimination. The systematic use of violence, including [[murder]] and ultimately [[genocide]], the use of [[slave labor]], abuse and murder of [[prisoners of war]], [[deportations]], and [[confiscation]] of property forced changes to the [[status quo]]. Over the proceeding decades, large scale changes began to occur in all areas of international law, and prisoners’ rights were no exception. 

Now, there are international instruments 
* the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],
* the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]]

Further there are recommondations which lay down codes by which prisoners should be dealt with. Foremost amongst them are 

* the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], 
* the UN [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]],
* the [[Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment]]
* the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* the [[European Prison Rules]].

==Third Geneva Convention==

The [[Third Geneva Convention]] defines humanitarian protections for prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war are defined as: 

{{quotation|
:(1) Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces.

:(2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]], belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[military occupation|territory is occupied]], provided that they fulfill the following conditions:

::(a) that of being [[command responsibility|commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates]]; 

::(b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;

::(c) that of carrying arms openly;

::(d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the [[laws and customs of war]].

:(3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.

:(4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to the annexed model.

:(5) Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict, who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.

:6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy [[Levée en masse|spontaneously]] take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prisoners of war may not renounce rights secured by the Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those rights include the rights to humane treatment which prohibits specifically violence causing death or seriously endangering health, or physical [[mutilation]] or [[Human subject research|scientific or medical experiments]], protection from acts of [[intimidation]], insults and public curiosity, protection from [[reprisals]], exercise, protection from physical or mental [[torture]], adequate physical and psychological treatment, to keep personal items including money, to be evacuated if the territory in which they are held becomes too dangerous, to adequate food, water, shelter and clothing, sanitary living conditions, [[religious freedom]], and to complain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detaining powers have the right to use appropriate force in the event of escape or a riot, to require prisoners to given their name and [[military rank|rank]], and to utilize prisoners for labor as long the work doesn't have to do with the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War]] was adopted in 1929 but was significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/375?OpenDocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council]] is the final international tribunal for all issues relating to the Geneva Conventions. All signatories to the [[UN Charter]], of which there are 193, are bound by the Geneva Conventions.

==International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights==

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force 23 March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that any person deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article imposes a requirement of separation of prisoners in pre-trial detention from those already convicted of crimes, as well as a specific obligation to separate accused juvenile prisoners from adults and bring them before trial speedily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a requirement that the focus of prisons should be reform and rehabilitation, not punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These provisions apply to those in prisons, hospitals (particularly psychiatric hospitals), detention facilities, correction facilities or any other facility in which a person is deprived of their liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/3327552b9511fb98c12563ed004cbe59?Opendocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The article complements article 7 of the Covenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which bans torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, by guaranteeing those deprived of their liberty with the same conditions as that set for free persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/3327552b9511fb98c12563ed004cbe59?Opendocument|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners==

The [[United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] came into force in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/treatmentprisoners.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504124246/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/treatmentprisoners.htm|archivedate=4 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standards set out by the UN are not legally binding but offer guidelines in international and municipal law with respect to any person held in any form of custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They are generally regarded as being good principle and practice for the management of custodial facilities. The document sets out standards for those in custody which covers registration, personal hygiene, clothing and bedding, food, exercise and sport, medical services, discipline and punishment, instruments of restraint, information to and complaints by prisoners, contact with the outside world, books, religion, retentions of prisoners’ property, notification of death, illness, transfer, removal of prisoners, institutional personnel and inspection of facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It also sets out guidelines for prisoners under sentence which further includes treatment, classification and individualisation, privileges, work, educations and recreations, and social relations and after-care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    There are also special provisions for insane and mentally abnormal prisoners, prisoners under arrest or awaiting trial, civil prisoners and persons arrested or detained without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Refugee Agency|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment==

The [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] entered into force on 1 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Convention establishes the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punt|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Committee is permitted to visit all places of detention, defined by the convention as "any place within its jurisdiction where persons are deprived of their liberty by a public authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Once a state government is notified of the intention of the Committee to carry out a visit it is required to allow access to the territory with the right to free travel without restriction, full information of the facility in question, unlimited access to the facility and free movement within it, the right to interview any person being held within the facility, communicate freely with any person whom it believes can supply relevant information and access to any other information which the Committee feels is necessary to carry out its task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   All information gathered is confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In exceptional circumstances a state may make representations based on grounds of national defence, public safety, serious disorder in custodial facilities against a visit to a certain place or at a certain time.  After each visit a report is drawn up with any possible suggestions to the state in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities==

The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] entered into force on 30 March 2007 and has 154 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=150|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention’s purpose is to "promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Persons with disabilities are defined as those "who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Article 13 of the Convention relates to access to justice for persons with disability.

==Breaches of  prisoners' rights in international law==

===United States of America===

'''Guantanamo Bay'''

The American government has been accused of many breaches of prisoners’ rights in international law. The most publicized case is the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|detention facility]] it maintains in [[Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. The American government claimed that the facility was not covered by the Geneva Conventions protecting prisoners of war as the detainees were ‘[[enemy combatants]]’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4879942.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the status accorded to detainees, international law still prohibits torture. It is now clear that the [[CIA]] allowed [[water boarding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7850789.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not only a breach of international law but also the American Army Field Manual which prohibits cruel, humiliating or degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7850789.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afghanistan'''

In Afghanistan, US soldiers are accused of abusing prisoners in a secret prison in [[Bagram Air Base]]. The prisoners held there were exposed to extreme temperatures, not given adequate food, bedding, or natural light and religious duties were interfered with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/10/2010101514217930443.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also claims of abuse in Shebarghan prison in northern Afghanistan for which America is jointly responsible with the Afghan government. Shebarghan prison is claimed to be overcrowded with inadequate bathing and ablution facilities, as well as lack of food and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/02/opinion/forgotten-prisoners-of-war.html#|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iraq'''

In 2003, accusations started to emerge of prisoner abuse in [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. US soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison serving there were accused of beating prisoners, forcing prisoners to strip, forcing prisoners to masturbate, threatening prisoners with dogs, smearing prisoners with faeces, making prisoners simulate sex and form naked piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3701941.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was also accusations that prisoners were raped, sodomised and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3701941.stm|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8419">A '''recall of Parliament''' is a [[parliamentary procedure]] involving an extraordinary sitting of a parliament, occurring outside the time when that parliament would usually meet, such as over a weekend, or when the parliament would normally be in [[recess (parliamentary procedure)|recess]]. A parliament is generally recalled as a result of events of major national importance, thus allowing members to hold an emergency debate on issues relating to those events. 

In the United Kingdom, decisions as to whether the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] or [[House of Lords (United Kingdom)|House of Lords]] should be recalled are the responsibility of the [[Speaker (parliament)|Speaker]]s of those individual bodies, and are usually taken following a request from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/recallparliament/ |title=Recall of Parliament - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a 2001 recommendation from the [[Hansard Society Commission on Parliamentary Scrutiny]] that "the Speaker of the Commons should have the ability to recall Parliament at times of emergency".&lt;ref name="MailTimeline"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williamson |first=David |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/heres-parliament-been-recalled-should-11123176 |title=Here's when Parliament has been recalled - should MPs be back to debate steel? |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=The Western Mail |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">A '''return merchandise authorization''' ('''RMA'''), '''return authorization''' ('''RA''') or '''return goods authorization''' ('''RGA''') is a part of the process of returning a product to receive a refund, replacement, or repair during the product's [[warranty]] period. The purchaser of the product must contact the [[manufacturer]] (or [[distributor]] or [[retailer]]) to obtain authorization to return the product. The resulting RMA or RGA number must be displayed on or included in the returned product's packaging;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Dubbs, “Many (unhappy) Returns”, Operations &amp; Fulfillment, Vol. 9, No. 3, March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/return-merchandise-authorization-RMA|title=What is return merchandise authorization (RMA)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Return to vendor''' ('''RTV''') refers to the process where goods are returned to the original vendor as opposed to the distributor.&lt;ref name=RTV/&gt;

==Return merchandise authorization==
The issuance of an RMA/RGA is a key gatekeeping moment in the [[reverse logistics]] cycle, providing the vendor with a final opportunity to diagnose and correct the customer's problem with the product (such as improper installation or configuration) ''before'' the customer permanently relinquishes ownership of the product to the manufacturer, commonly referred to as a return. As returns are costly for the vendor and inconvenient for the customer, any return that can be prevented benefits both parties.

==Return management==
Returned merchandise requires management after the return. The product has a second life cycle after the return.

An important aspect of RMA management is learning from RMA trends to prevent further returns. RMAs may be minimized in a number of ways. Adding a customer survey capability may prevent RMAs by detecting problems in advance of returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agiloft.com/customer-support.htm#rma|title=Flexible Customer Support Software by Agiloft|website=www.agiloft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returns are sometimes minimized by reducing transaction errors prior to the merchandise leaving the seller.&lt;ref&gt;“Canon Slashes Chargebacks by Underscoring Accountability”, Chargebacks Solutions Monitor, Vol. 4, No. 4, February 2001, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Providing additional information to consumers also reduces returns.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J Bowman, “From Cash to Cash: The Ultimate Supply-Chain Measurement Tool”, Global Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Strategies, Vol. 5, No. 6, June 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to vendor==
Return to vendor (RTV) refers to the process where goods are returned to the original vendor instead of the distributor. In many cases the RTV was originally returned to the seller by the end consumer. While RTV transactions usually occur between the seller and the vendor, in some instances the end consumer returns the product directly to the vendor, sidestepping the distributor.&lt;ref name=RTV&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/emea/dk/frontlines/Collaboration_in_Reverse_Logistics.pdf|last= Daga|first=Ashish|title=''Collaboration in Reverse Logistics''.

'''The Road Safety Act 2006''' (c 49) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The provisions contained in the Act are designed to improve road safety and help achieve casualty reduction targets. The Government’s strategy for improving road safety was set out in the framework paper "Tomorrow’s Roads – safer for everyone".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/strategytargetsperformance/tomorrowsroadssaferforeveryone Tomorrow’s Roads – safer for everyone]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim is to improve road safety and achieve casualty reduction targets of 40% of those killed and seriously injured and 50% reduction for children by 2010.

The Act creates a new criminal offence of causing death by careless, or inconsiderate, driving.  This offence was introduced because of public concern about deaths on the roads and the minimal sentence allowed under the law as it was before the introduction of the Act.  A person can now be sentenced summarily to 12 months (in England and Wales) or 6 months or a fine both or on indictment to 5 years or a fine or both.  The Act also increased the penalty for use of a hand-held mobile phone or similar device.  Section 26 provides for an obligatory endorsement (with disqualification at the court's discretion) for the offence.

The provisions of the Act cover:
*Drink driving
*Speeding
*New offences
*Penalties and enforcement
*Driver training
*Driver fatigue
*Driver and vehicle licensing
*Motor insurance

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Rwanda]] on 17 December 1978. It followed a coup by [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] in 1973 and the dissolution of the former sole legal party, [[Parmehutu|MDR-Parmehutu]]. The new constitution created a presidential republic with no term limits for the [[List of Presidents of Rwanda|President]], and made the [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development|National Revolutionary Movement for Development]] the sole legal party. It was approved by 89.1% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/rw.html Elections in Rwanda] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7626">'''''Schmidt v Calgary Board of Education''''' (Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Sinclair, Clement and Moir, JJ.A. October 26, 1976) is the basis for the legal requirement in [[Alberta]] that, where a [[separate school]] jurisdiction exists (they exist in only some of Alberta), members of the minority faith that established the separate school jurisdiction must be considered and treated as residents, electors, and ratepayers of the separate school jurisdiction. This decision was handed down prior to the enactment of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and it has not been appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] so it is not ultimately determinative of the issue.

==Significance==

''Schmidt'' is a civil rights case, pre-Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The key question is whether there was an illegal expression of discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs, contrary to the [[Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act]], 1972 (Individual's Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Alta.), c.2, s.3(b) - School Act, R.S.A. 1970, c. 329, ss. 53,142, 143).

It is also a constitutional law case, relating to the provisions that enshrine the rights of those who choose to establish and operate separate schools in Alberta. (British North America Act, 1867, s. 93 - Alberta Act, 1905 (Can.), c.3, s. 17 - Individual's Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Alta.), c. 2, ss.1(2), 3(b))

==History==

The applicant, Mr. Schmidt, was Roman Catholic, and the father of two young (school-aged) children. The parents had earlier lived in [[Ontario]], where they had enrolled their daughters in a public school, although a Roman Catholic school was available to them. In Ontario, members of the minority faith have the option of being residents, electors, and ratepayers of the public school system.

Mr. Schmidt's employer transferred him to [[Calgary]], where he sought to enroll his children in the public school system (as he had done in Ontario). Staff of the [[Calgary Board of Education]] advised Mr. Schmidt that he must either pay a non-resident tuition fee for each child or first enroll his children in the separate school system and negotiate with that system to have them transfer the children to the public school system (the Calgary Board of Education) and pay tuition. Mr. Schmidt objected to this process, on the basis that the parents of the children should have the direct opportunity to enroll their children in the public school system. (Mr. Schmidt, although a Roman Catholic, supported public school education and preferred to have his daughters educated in a public school.)

Mr. Schmidt lodged a complaint with the [[Alberta Human Rights Commission]]. A Board of Inquiry, organized pursuant to the Individual Rights Protection Act, 1972 (Alberta), found against him and upheld the proposition that, in Alberta, wherever a separate school jurisdiction exists, members of the minority faith that established the separate school jurisdiction must be considered and treated as residents, electors, and ratepayers of the separate school jurisdiction. The Board of Inquiry concluded that Mr. Schmidt would have to enroll his children with the [[Calgary Catholic School District|Calgary Roman Catholic Separate School District]] and ask the Separate School District to enter into a tuition agreement with the Calgary Board of Education so that it (CBE) would enroll his child.

Mr. Schmidt appealed the decision of the Board of Inquiry, by commencing an action before the [[Alberta court of queen's bench|Court of Queen's Bench, Alberta]]. The Court of Queen's Bench found in his favour, overturning the decision of the Board of Inquiry.

The Calgary Board of Education appealed, and the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench was overturned on appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of Alberta|Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division]].

==Main Findings==

Mr. Justice Moir, speaking for the Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division (now the Alberta Court of Appeal), made several findings. Primary among these are:

:* Once a religious minority has established their own school jurisdiction, all members of that faith become members and are excluded from the public jurisdiction. The law makes it clear that there "is no machinery for getting out so long as you are of the religious faith of the minority who have acted to establish the separate school district."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;[http://www.public-schools.ab.ca/Public/law/schmidt.htm Re Schmidt and Calgary Board of Education (1976), 72 D.L.R. (3d) 330 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "[t]he majority of the minority have the right to compel the entire minority to join the separate school division."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

:* Paying taxes to a public jurisdiction does not make an individual a resident of that jurisdiction if there exists separate school jurisdiction in which they should be a resident. Justice Moir states, "The fact that Schmidt is paying his taxes to the public school board must be by error in law as I can find no authority for it. In my opinion it cannot effect Schmidt's residence."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

:* School jurisdictions are permitted to ask the faith of those parents who enroll their children in the jurisdiction. Justice Moir states, "As soon as the minority opted out of the public school system (be it Protestant or Catholic) it was necessary to ask 'Are you a Roman Catholic of a Protestant?'"&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; He continues, "In order to have two separate school systems it is necessary to have a legislative method of dividing or separating the minority from the majority."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; He offers the following example: "it is essential in legislation dealing with 'Indians' that Parliament be able to define the class to which the legislation is to apply. Likewise if separate schools are to be permitted a mechanism for separating the group had to be found."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

:* Minority faiths (meaning Roman Catholics and Protestants) have guaranteed rights to separate school jurisdictions that cannot be superseded by any act of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Justice Moir states, "The existence of two systems is guaranteed to the minority.... This is the situation as it was in 1901, and in 1905 and the way it is in Calgary today. In my opinion there is no legislative authority in Alberta to abolish that scheme..."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; He continues, "It is elementary to say that the provisions of a statute of Alberta are incapable of affecting the validity of the British North America Act, 1867, or of the Alberta Act. The scheme having been approved of by the Imperial Parliament, the Parliament of Canada, as well by the Legislature of Alberta, is binding. In my opinion it cannot be held inoperative by reason of the Individual Rights Protection Act."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

The text of the full decision is available in most Canadian legal databases; however, a free and openly accessible copy of the decision is available on the website of the [[Public School Boards' Association of Alberta]].

'''Social credit''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[Distributism|distributive]] philosophy developed by [[C. H. Douglas]] (1879–1952), a British engineer who published a book by that name in 1924.  It encompasses [[economics]], [[political science]], [[history]], and [[accounting]].  Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, "Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is [[Personal development|self-development]], is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Democracy|edition=Fifth Authorised  |location=Epsom, Surrey, England |last=Douglas |first= C.H.|year=1974 |publisher=Bloomfield Books |isbn=978-0-904656-06-0 |pages=18 |url=https://archive.org/details/econdemocracy00dougiala |accessdate=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon "[[Basic income|absolute economic security]]" for the individual, where "they shall sit every man under his vine and under his [[Figs in the Bible|fig tree]]; and none shall make them afraid."&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=1954–55 |year=1954 |title=Cover |periodical=The Douglas Quarterly Review |series=The Fig Tree, New Series |publication-place=Belfast, Northern Ireland |publisher=K.R.P. Publications |volume=1 |issue=June |at=Cover |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Micah|chapter=4|verse=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his words, "what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's [[Utopia]], but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own."&lt;ref name="The Necessity for a National rather than an International Financial System"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |date=1933 |title=Major C.H. Douglas Speaks |location=Sydney |publisher=Douglas Social Credit Association |pages=41 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while he was reorganising the work at Farnborough, during World War I, that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to individuals for [[wage]]s, [[Salary|salaries]] and [[dividend]]s.  This seemed to contradict the theory of classic [[Ricardian economics]], that all costs are distributed simultaneously as [[purchasing power]]. Troubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry ("delivery of goods and services", in his opinion), Douglas decided to apply [[engineering]] methods to the economic system.

Douglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in nearly every case, except that of companies becoming [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: [[consumer]]s did not have enough income to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine ''[[The English Review]]'', where he suggested: "That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility."&lt;ref&gt;"The Delusion of Super-Production", C.H. Douglas, ''English Review'', December 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later formalized this observation in his A+B theorem. Douglas proposed to eliminate this difference between total prices and total incomes by augmenting consumers' [[purchasing power]] through a National Dividend and a Compensated Price Mechanism.

According to Douglas, the true purpose of [[Production (economics)|production]] is [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and production must serve the genuine, freely expressed interests of consumers. In order to accomplish this objective, he believed that each citizen should have a beneficial, not direct, inheritance in the communal [[Capital (economics)|capital]] conferred by complete access to consumer goods assured by the National Dividend and Compensated Price.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |title=Credit-Power and Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1933 |publisher=The Social Credit Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |url=https://archive.org/details/creditpowerdemoc00douguoft |accessdate=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}{{rp|108}}  Douglas thought that consumers, fully provided with adequate [[purchasing power]], will establish the policy of [[Manufacturing|production]] through exercise of their monetary vote.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"/&gt;{{rp|89–91}} In this view, the term [[economic democracy]] does not mean [[workers' control|worker control]] of industry, but democratic control of credit.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"/&gt;{{rp|4–9}} Removing the policy of production from [[Financial institution|banking institutions]], government, and industry, social credit envisages an "[[aristocracy]] of producers, serving and [[Accreditation|accredited]] by a democracy of consumers."&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"/&gt;{{rp|95}}

The policy proposals of social credit attracted widespread interest in the decades between the world wars of the twentieth century because of their relevance to economic conditions of the time. Douglas called attention to the excess of production capacity over consumer purchasing power, an observation that was also made by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in his book, ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''.&lt;ref name="Keynes General Theory"&gt;{{cite book |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |last=Keynes |first=John M. |year=1936 |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co Ltd. |location=London, England |pages=32, 98–100, 370–371 |isbn=978-1-56000-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Douglas shared some of Keynes' criticisms of classical economics, his unique remedies were disputed and even rejected by most economists and bankers of the time. Remnants of social credit still exist within [[Social Credit Party (disambiguation)|social credit parties]] throughout the world, but not in the purest form originally advanced by Douglas.

==Economic theory==

===Factors of production and value===
Douglas disagreed with [[classical economists]] who recognised only three [[factors of production]]:   [[Land (economics)|land]], [[Labour (economics)|labour]] and [[Physical capital|capital]]. While Douglas did not deny the role of these factors in production, he considered the “[[Intangible cultural heritage|cultural inheritance of society]]” as the primary factor. He defined cultural inheritance as the knowledge, techniques and processes that have accrued to us incrementally from the origins of civilization (i.e. [[Progress (history)|progress]]). Consequently, mankind does not have to keep "[[reinventing the wheel]]". "We are merely the administrators of that cultural inheritance, and to that extent the cultural inheritance is the property of all of us, without exception.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, C.H. (22 January 1934). "[http://www.polskawalczaca.com/library/ALOR%20-%20Monopolistic%20Idea.pdf The Monopolistic Idea]" address at Melbourne Town Hall, Australia. The Australian League of Rights: Melbourne. Retrieved 28 February 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Karl Marx]] claimed that [[labour theory of value|labour creates all value]]. While Douglas did not deny that all costs ultimately relate to labour charges of some sort (past or present), he denied that the present labour of the world creates all wealth. Douglas carefully distinguished between [[value (economics)|value]], [[historical cost|costs]] and [[price]]s. He claimed that one of the factors resulting in a misdirection of thought in terms of the nature and function of money was economists' near-obsession about values and their relation to prices and incomes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Social Credit |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1973 |publisher=Gordon Press |location=New York |pages=60 |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/social_credit_by_ch_douglas.pdf |isbn=978-0-9501126-1-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209091428/http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/social_credit_by_ch_douglas.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt; While Douglas recognized [[use value|"value in use"]] as a legitimate theory of values, he also considered values as subjective and not capable of being measured in an objective manner. Thus he rejected the idea of the role of money as a standard, or measure, of value. Douglas believed that money should act as a medium of communication by which consumers direct the distribution of production.

===Economic sabotage===
Closely associated with the concept of cultural inheritance as a factor of production is the social credit theory of economic sabotage. While Douglas believed the cultural heritage factor of production is primary in increasing wealth, he also believed that economic sabotage is the primary factor decreasing it. The word wealth derives from the Old English word ''wela'', or "well-being", and Douglas believed that all production should increase personal well-being. Therefore, production that does not directly increase personal well-being is waste, or economic sabotage.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The economic effect of charging all the waste in industry to the consumer so curtails his purchasing power that an increasing percentage of the product of industry must be exported. The effect of this on the worker is that he has to do many times the amount of work which should be necessary to keep him in the highest standard of living, as a result of an artificial inducement to produce things he does not want, which he cannot buy, and which are of no use to the attainment of his internal standard of well-being.&lt;ref name="dl.lib.brown.edu"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=1919 |title=A Mechanical View of Economics |periodical=The New Age |series=1373 |publication-place=38 Cursitor Street, London |publisher=The New Age Press |volume=XXIV |issue=9 |pages=136 |url=http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1140814692791748.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=14 March 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By modern methods of accounting, the consumer is forced to pay for all the costs of production, including waste. The economic effect of charging the consumer with all waste in industry is that the consumer is forced to do much more work than is necessary. Douglas believed that wasted effort could be directly linked to confusion in regards to the purpose of the economic system, and the belief that the economic system exists to provide employment in order to distribute goods and services.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But it may be advisable to glance at some of the proximate causes operating to reduce the return for effort ; and to realise the origin of most of the specific instances, it must be borne in mind that the existing economic system distributes goods and services through the same agency which induces goods and services, i.e., payment for work in progress. In other words, if production stops, distribution stops, and, as a consequence, a clear incentive exists to produce useless or superfluous articles in order that useful commodities already existing may be distributed. This perfectly simple reason is the explanation of the increasing necessity of what has come to be called economic sabotage ; the colossal waste of effort which goes on in every walk of life quite unobserved by the majority of people because they are so familiar with it ; a waste which yet so over-taxed the ingenuity of society to extend it that the climax of war only occurred in the moment when a culminating exhibition of organised sabotage was necessary to preserve the system from spontaneous combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Democracy, Fifth Authorised Edition |location=Epsom, Surrey, England |last=Douglas |first= C.H.|year=1974 |publisher=Bloomfield Books |isbn=978-0-904656-06-0 |pages=74 |url=https://archive.org/details/econdemocracy00dougiala |accessdate=12-11-2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Purpose of an economy===
Douglas claimed there were three possible policy alternatives with respect to the economic system:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. The first of these is that it is a disguised Government, of which the primary, though admittedly not the only, object is to impose upon the world a system of thought and action.

2. The second alternative has a certain similarity to the first, but is simpler. It assumes that the primary objective of the industrial system is the provision of employment.

3. And the third, which is essentially simpler still, in fact, so simple that it appears entirely unintelligible to the majority, is that the object of the industrial system is merely to provide goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Warning Democracy |last=Douglas |first= C.H.|year=1935 web|url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20Warning%20Democracy.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2008 |publisher=Australian League of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Douglas believed that it was the third policy alternative upon which an economic system should be based, but confusion of thought has allowed the industrial system to be governed by the first two objectives. If the purpose of our economic system is to deliver the maximum amount of goods and services with the least amount of effort, then the ability to deliver goods and services with the least amount of employment is actually desirable. Douglas proposed that unemployment is a logical consequence of machines replacing labour in the productive process, and any attempt to reverse this process through policies designed to attain full employment directly sabotages our cultural inheritance. Douglas also believed that the people displaced from the industrial system through the process of mechanization should still have the ability to consume the fruits of the system, because he suggested that we are all inheritors of the cultural inheritance, and his proposal for a national dividend is directly related to this belief.

===The creditary nature of money===
Douglas criticized classical economics because many of the theories are  based upon a [[Barter|barter economy]], whereas the modern economy is a monetary one. Initially, money originated from the productive system, when cattle owners punched leather discs which represented a head of cattle. These discs could then be exchanged for corn, and the corn producers could then exchange the disc for a head of cattle at a later date. The word “pecuniary"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/cow_words_one.htm|title=billcasselman.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the Latin ''pecunia'', originally and literally meaning "cattle" (related to ''pecus'', meaning "beast").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pollock |first=Fredrick |date=1996 |title=The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I |publisher=Lawbook Exchange Ltd |pages=151 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the productive system and the monetary system are two separate entities. Douglas demonstrated that loans create [[Deposit account|deposits]], and presented [[mathematical proof]] in his book ''Social Credit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/socialcredit/p2c1.htm |title=The Working of the Money System |accessdate=27 February 2008 |author=C.H. Douglas |work=Social Credit |publisher=Mondo Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank credit comprises the vast majority of money, and is created every time a bank makes a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/canada_money_supply.pdf |title=The Bank in Brief: Canada's Money Supply |accessdate=28 February 2008 |publisher=Bank of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas was also one of the first to understand the creditary nature of money. The word [[Credit (finance)|credit]] derives from the Latin ''credere'', meaning "to believe". "The essential quality of money, therefore, is that a man shall believe that he can get what he wants by the aid of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |date=22 April 1927 |title=Engineering, Money and Prices |place=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=Warning Democracy |pages=15 |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20Warning%20Democracy.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economists, money is a [[medium of exchange]]. Douglas argued that this may have once been the case when the majority of wealth was produced by individuals who subsequently exchanged it with each other. But in modern economies, [[division of labour]] splits production into multiple processes, and wealth is produced by people working in association with each other. For instance, an automobile worker does not produce any wealth (i.e., the automobile) by himself, but only in conjunction with other auto workers, the producers of roads, gasoline, insurance, etc.

In this opinion, wealth is a pool upon which people can draw, and money becomes a [[Voucher|ticketing system]]. The efficiency gained by individuals cooperating in the productive process was named by Douglas as the "[[unearned increment]] of association" – historic accumulations of which constitute what Douglas called the cultural heritage. The means of drawing upon this pool is money distributed by the banking system.

Douglas believed that money should not be regarded as a commodity but rather as a ticket, a means of distribution of production.&lt;ref name="UseOfMoney"&gt;Douglas, C.H. (13 February 1934). "[http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20The%20Use%20of%20Money.htm]" address at St. James’ Theatre, Christchurch, New Zealand. The Australian League of Rights: Melbourne. Retrieved 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "There are two sides to this question of a ticket representing something that we can call, if we like, a value. There is the ticket itself – the money which forms the thing we call '[[effective demand]]' – and there is something we call a price opposite to it."&lt;ref name="UseOfMoney"/&gt; Money is effective demand, and the means of reclaiming that money are prices and taxes. As real capital replaces labour in the process of modernization, money should become increasingly an instrument of distribution. The idea that money is a medium of exchange is related to the belief that all wealth is created by the current labour of the world, and Douglas clearly rejected this belief, stating that the cultural inheritance of society is the primary factor in the creation of wealth, which makes money a distribution mechanism, not a medium of exchange.

Douglas also claimed the problem of production, or [[scarcity]], had long been solved. The new problem was one of distribution. However; so long as orthodox economics makes scarcity a value, banks will continue to believe that they are creating value for the money they produce by making it scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Credit |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1973 |publisher=Gordon Press |location=New York |pages=47 |url=http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/socialcredit/p1c2.htm |isbn=978-0-9501126-1-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas criticized the banking system on two counts:
# for being a form of government which has been [[Centralization|centralizing]] its power for centuries, and
# for claiming ownership of the money they create.
The former Douglas identified as being anti-social in policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/possible_social_credit_in_alberta.pdf|format=PDF|title=FIRST INTERIM REPORT ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL CREDIT PRINCIPLES TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA|accessdate=18 December 2008|author=C.H.

(24 November 1936). "[http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20Dictatorship%20by%20Taxation.pdf]" address at Ulster Hall, Belfast. The Australian: Melbourne. Retrieved 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Douglas, money is merely an [[Abstract object|abstract]] representation of the real credit of the community, which is the ability of the community to deliver goods and [[service (economics)|services]], when and where they are required.

In January 1919, "A Mechanical View of Economics" by C. H. Douglas was the first article to be published in the magazine ''New Age'', edited by [[Alfred Richard Orage]], critiquing the methods by which economic activity is typically measured:

It is not the purpose of this short article to depreciate the services of accountants; in fact, under the existing conditions probably no body of men has done more to crystallise the data on which we carry on the business of the world; but the utter confusion of thought which has undoubtedly arisen from the calm assumption of the book-keeper and the accountant that he and he alone was in a position to assign positive or negative values to the quantities represented by his figures is one of the outstanding curiosities of the industrial system; and the attempt to mould the activities of a great empire on such a basis is surely the final condemnation of an out-worn method.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1920, Douglas presented the A + B theorem in his book, ''Credit-Power and Democracy'', in critique of accounting methodology pertinent to income and prices. In the fourth, Australian Edition of 1933, Douglas states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A factory or other productive organization has, besides its economic function as a producer of goods, a financial aspect – it may be regarded on the one hand as a device for the distribution of purchasing-power to individuals through the media of wages, salaries, and dividends; and on the other hand as a manufactory of prices – financial values. From this standpoint, its payments may be divided into two groups:

:Group A: ''All payments made to individuals (wages, salaries, and dividends).''

:Group B: ''All payments made to other organizations (raw materials, bank charges, and other external costs).''

Now the rate of flow of purchasing-power to individuals is represented by A, but since all payments go into prices, the rate of flow of prices cannot be less than A+B. The product of any factory may be considered as something which the public ought to be able to buy, although in many cases it is an intermediate product of no use to individuals but only to a subsequent manufacture; but since A will not purchase A+B; a proportion of the product at least equivalent to B must be distributed by a form of purchasing-power which is not comprised in the description grouped under A. It will be necessary at a later stage to show that this additional purchasing power is provided by loan credit (bank overdrafts) or export credit.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"/&gt;{{rp|22–23}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beyond [[empirical]] evidence, Douglas claims this [[deductive]] [[theorem]] demonstrates that total prices increase faster than total incomes when regarded as a [[Stock and flow|flow]].

In his pamphlet entitled "The New and the Old Economics", Douglas describes the cause of "B" payments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think that a little consideration will make it clear that in this sense an overhead charge is any charge in respect of which the actual distributed purchasing power does not still exist, and that practically this means any charge created at a further distance in the past than the period of cyclic rate of circulation of money. There is no fundamental difference between tools and intermediate products, and the latter may therefore be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New and the Old Economics |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/New%20and%20Old%20Economics--C%20H%20Douglas.pdf |publisher=Tidal Publications |location=Sydney, n.d. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1932, Douglas estimated the cyclic rate of circulation of money to be approximately three weeks. The cyclic rate of circulation of money measures the amount of time required for a loan to pass through the productive system and return to the bank. This can be calculated by determining the amount of [[Clearing (finance)|clearings]] through the bank in a year divided by the average amount of [[deposit account|deposits]] held at the banks (which varies very little). The result is the number of times money must turnover in order to produce these [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] figures. In a testimony before the Alberta Agricultural Committee of the Alberta Legislature in 1934, Douglas said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now we know there are an increasing number of charges which originated from a period much anterior to three weeks, and included in those charges, as a matter of fact, are most of the charges made in, respect of purchases from one organization to another, but all such charges as capital charges (for instance, on a railway which was constructed a year, two years, three years, five or ten years ago, where charges are still extant), cannot be liquidated by a stream of purchasing power which does not increase in volume and which has a period of three weeks. The consequence is, you have a piling up of debt, you have in many cases a diminution of purchasing power being equivalent to the price of the goods for sale.&lt;ref name="The Douglas System"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |date=1934 |title=The Douglas System of Social Credit: Evidence taken by the Agricultural Committee of the Alberta Legislature, Session 1934 |location=Edmonton |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |pages=90 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Douglas, the major consequence of the problem he identified in his A+B theorem is exponentially increasing debt. Further, he believed that society is forced to produce goods that consumers either do not want or cannot afford to purchase. The latter represents a favorable [[balance of trade]], meaning a country exports more than it imports. But not every country can pursue this objective at the same time, as one country must import more than it exports when another country exports more than it imports. Douglas proposed that the long-term consequence of this policy is a [[trade war]], typically resulting in real war – hence, the social credit admonition, “He who calls for Full-Employment calls for War!”, expressed by the [[Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], led by [[John Hargrave]]. The former represents excessive capital production and/or military build-up. Military buildup necessitates either the violent use of weapons or a superfluous accumulation of them.
Douglas believed that excessive capital production is only a temporary correction, because the cost of the capital appears in the cost of consumer goods, or taxes, which will further exacerbate future gaps between income and prices.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the first place, these capital goods have to be sold to someone. They form a reservoir of forced exports. They must, as intermediate products, enter somehow into the price of subsequent ultimate products and they produce a position of most unstable equilibrium, since the life of capital goods is in general longer than that of consumable goods, or ultimate products, and yet in order to meet the requirements for money to buy the consumable goods, the rate of production of capital goods must be continuously increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=1925 |title=A + B AND THE BANKERS |periodical=The New Age |publication-place=38 Cursitor Street, London |publisher=The New Age Press |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/A+B%20and%20the%20Bankers--CH%20Douglas,%20New%20Age%201925.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The A + B theorem and a cost accounting view of inflation===
The replacement of labour by capital in the productive process implies that overhead charges (B) increase in relation to income (A), because "'B' is the financial representation of the lever of capital”.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"/&gt;{{rp|25}} As Douglas stated in his first article, "The Delusion of Superproduction":&lt;ref name="douglassocialcredit.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/the_delusion_of_super-production_douglas.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Delusion of Superproduction |accessdate=11 December 2008 |author=C.H. Douglas |publisher=The English Review |date=December 1918 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120060609/http://www.douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/the_delusion_of_super-production_douglas.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The factory cost – not the selling price – of any article under our present industrial and financial system is made up of three main divisions-direct labor cost, material cost and overhead charges, the ratio of which varies widely, with the "modernity" of the method of production. For instance, a sculptor producing a work of art with the aid of simple tools and a block of marble has next to no overhead charges, but a very low rate of production, while a modern screw-making plant using automatic machines may have very high overhead charges and very low direct labour cost, or high rates of production.

Since increased industrial output per individual depends mainly on tools and method, it may almost be stated as a law that intensified production means a progressively higher ratio of overhead charges to direct labour cost, and, apart from artificial reasons, this is simply an indication of the extent to which machinery replaces manual labour, as it should.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If overhead charges are constantly increasing relative to income, any attempt to stabilize or increase income results in increasing prices. If income is constant or increasing, and overhead charges are continuously increasing due to technological advancement, then prices, which equal income plus overhead charges, must also increase. Further, any attempt to stabilize or decrease prices must be met by decreasing incomes according to this analysis. As the [[Phillips Curve]] demonstrates, inflation and unemployment are trade-offs, unless prices are reduced from monies derived from outside the productive system. According to Douglas's A+B theorem, the systemic problem of increasing prices, or inflation, is not "too much money chasing too few goods", but is the increasing rate of overhead charges in production due to the replacement of labour by capital in industry combined with a policy of full employment. Douglas did not suggest that inflation cannot be caused by too much money chasing too few consumer goods, but according to his analysis this is not the only cause of inflation, and inflation is systemic according to the rules of cost accountancy given overhead charges are constantly increasing relative to income. In other words, inflation can exist even if consumers have insufficient purchasing power to buy back all of production. Douglas claimed that there were two limits which governed prices, a lower limit governed by the cost of production, and an upper limit governed by what an article will fetch on the open market. Douglas suggested that this is the reason why deflation is regarded as a problem in orthodox economics because bankers and businessmen were very apt to forget the lower limit of prices.

===Compensated price and national dividend===
Douglas proposed to eliminate the gap between purchasing power and prices by increasing consumer purchasing power with credits which do not appear in prices in the form of a price rebate and a dividend. Formally called a "Compensated Price" and a "National (or Consumer) Dividend", a National Credit Office would be charged with the task of calculating the size of the rebate and dividend by determining a national [[balance sheet]], and calculating [[Aggregate data|aggregate]] production and consumption statistics.

The price rebate is based upon the observation that the real cost of production is the mean rate of consumption over the mean rate of production for an equivalent period of time.

: &lt;math&gt; \text{real cost (production)} = M \cdot \cfrac{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{dC}{dt} \, dt}{\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \frac{dP}{dt} \, dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''M'' = money distributed for a given programme of production,
* ''C'' = consumption,
* ''P'' = production.

The physical cost of producing something is the materials and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] that were consumed in its production, plus that amount of consumer goods labour consumed during its production. This total consumption represents the physical, or real, cost of production.

: &lt;math&gt; \text{true price } (\$) = \text{cost } (\$) \cdot \dfrac{\text{consumption } (\$) + \text{depreciation } (\$)}{\text{credit } (\$) + \text{production } (\$)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* Consumption = cost of consumer goods,
* Depreciation = depreciation of real capital,
* Credit = Credit Created,
* Production = cost of total production

Since fewer inputs are consumed to produce a unit of output with every improvement in process, the real cost of production falls over time. As a result, prices should also decrease with the progression of time. "As society's capacity to deliver goods and services is increased by the use of plant and still more by scientific progress, and decreased by the production, maintenance, or depreciation of it, we can issue credit, in costs, at a greater rate than the rate at which we take it back through prices of ultimate products, if capacity to supply individuals exceeds desire."&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"/&gt;{{rp|132}}

Based on his conclusion that the real cost of production is less than the financial cost of production, the Douglas price rebate (Compensated Price) is determined by the ratio of consumption to production. Since consumption over a period of time is typically less than production over the same period of time in any industrial society, the real cost of goods should be less than the financial cost.

For example, if the money cost of a good is $100, and the ratio of consumption to production is 3/4, then the real cost of the good is $100(3/4) = $75. As a result, if a consumer spent $100 for a good, the National Credit Authority would rebate the consumer $25. The good costs the consumer $75, the retailer receives $100, and the consumer receives the difference of $25 via new credits created by the National Credit Authority.

The National Dividend is justified by the displacement of labour in the productive process due to technological increases in productivity. As human labour is increasingly replaced by machines in the productive process, Douglas believed people should be free to consume while enjoying increasing amounts of leisure, and that the Dividend would provide this [[Economic freedom|freedom]].

===Critics of the A + B theorem and rebuttal===
Critics of the theorem, such as J. M. Pullen, Hawtrey and [[John Maynard Keynes|J. M. Keynes]] argue there is no difference between A and B payments. Other critics, such as Gary North, argue that social credit policies are inflationary. "The A + B theorem has met with almost universal rejection from academic economists on the grounds that, although B payments may be made initially to “other organizations,” they will not necessarily be lost to the flow of available purchasing power. A and B payments overlap through time. Even if the B payments are received and spent before the finished product is available for purchase, current purchasing power will be boosted by B payments received in the current production of goods that will be available for purchase in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Major Douglas and Social Credit: A Reappraisal |last=Pullen |first=J. M. |author2=G. 0. Smith |year=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. W. Joseph replied to this specific criticism in a paper given to the Birmingham Actuarial Society, "Banking and Industry":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let A1+B1 be the costs in a period to time of articles produced by factories making consumable goods divided up into A1 costs which refer to money paid to individuals by means of salaries, wages, dividends, etc., and B1 costs which refer to money paid to other institutions. Let A2, B2 be the corresponding costs of factories producing capital equipment. The money distributed to individuals is A1+A2 and the cost of the final consumable goods is A1+B1. If money in the hands of the public is to be equal to the costs of consumable articles produced then A1+A2 = A1+B1 and therefore A2=B1. Now modern science has brought us to the stage where machines are more and more taking the place of human labour in producing goods, i.e. A1 is becoming less important relatively to B1 and A2 less important relatively to B2.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In symbols if B1/A1 = k1 and B2/A2 = k2 both k1 and k2 are increasing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since A2=B1 this means that (A2+B2)/(A1+B1)= (1+k2)*A2/(1+1/k1)*B1 = (1+k2)/(1+1/k1) which is increasing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus in order that the economic system should keep working it is essential that capital goods should be produced in ever increasing quantity relatively to consumable goods. As soon as the ratio of capital goods to consumable goods slackens, costs exceed money distributed, i.e. the consumer is unable to purchase the consumable goods coming on the market."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in a reply to Dr. Hobson, Douglas restated his central thesis: "To reiterate categorically, the theorem criticised by Mr. Hobson: the wages, salaries and dividends distributed during a given period do not, and cannot, buy the production of that period; that production can only be bought, i.e., distributed, under present conditions by a draft, and an increasing draft, on the purchasing power distributed in respect of future production, and this latter is mainly and increasingly derived from financial credit created by the banks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Douglas Theory; a reply to Mr. J.A. Hobson |last=Douglas |first=C.H.|year=1922 |publisher=London: Cecil Palmer |pages=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/douglastheoryrep00doug/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incomes are paid to workers during a multi-stage program of production. According to the convention of accepted orthodox rules of accountancy, those incomes are part of the financial cost and price of the final product. For the product to be purchased with incomes earned in respect of its manufacture, all of these incomes would have to be saved until the product's completion. Douglas argued that incomes are typically spent on past production to meet the present needs of living, and will not be available to purchase goods completed in the future – goods which must include the sum of incomes paid out during their period of manufacture in their price. Consequently, this does not liquidate the financial cost of production inasmuch as it merely passes charges of one accountancy period on as mounting charges against future periods. In other words, according to Douglas, supply does not create enough demand to liquidate all the costs of production. Douglas denied the validity of [[Say's Law]] in economics.

While John Maynard Keynes referred to Douglas as a "private, perhaps, but not a major in the brave army of heretics",&lt;ref name="Keynes 1936 publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co Ltd"&gt;{{cite book |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |last=Keynes |first=John M. |year=1936 |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co Ltd. |location=London, England |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ |isbn=978-1-56000-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he did state that Douglas "is entitled to claim, as against some of his orthodox adversaries, that he at least has not been wholly oblivious of the outstanding problem of our economic system."&lt;ref name="Keynes 1936 publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co Ltd"/&gt; While Keynes said that Douglas's A+B theorem "includes much mere mystification", he reaches a similar conclusion to Douglas when he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus the problem of providing that new capital-investment shall always outrun capital-disinvestment sufficiently to fill the gap between net income and consumption, presents a problem which is increasingly difficult as capital increases. New capital-investment can only take place in excess of current capital-disinvestment if future expenditure on consumption is expected to increase. Each time we secure to-day's equilibrium by increased investment we are aggravating the difficulty of securing equilibrium to-morrow.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Keynes 1936 publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co Ltd"/&gt;

The criticism that social credit policies are inflationary is based upon what economists call the [[quantity theory of money]], which states that the quantity of money multiplied by its velocity of circulation equals total purchasing power. Douglas was quite critical of this theory stating, "The velocity of the circulation of money in the ordinary sense of the phrase, is – if I may put it that way – a complete myth. No additional purchasing power at all is created by the velocity of the circulation of money. The rate of transfer from hand-to-hand, as you might say, of goods is increased, of course, by the rate of spending, but no more costs can be canceled by one unit of purchasing power than one unit of cost. Every time a unit of purchasing power passes through the costing system it creates a cost, and when it comes back again to the same costing system by the buying and transfer of the unit of production to the consuming system it may be cancelled, but that process is quite irrespective of what is called the velocity of money, so the categorical answer is that I do not take any account of the velocity of money in that sense."&lt;ref name="Douglas 1933"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=1933 |year=1933 |title=The Birmingham Debate |periodical=The New Age |volume=Vol. LII, No. 23 |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/Douglas-Hawtrey%20Birmingham%20debate%20Final%20Edit.pdf |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722095628/http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/Douglas-Hawtrey%20Birmingham%20debate%20Final%20Edit.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta Social Credit government published in a committee report what was perceived as an error in regards to this theory: "The fallacy in the theory lies in the incorrect assumption that money 'circulates', whereas it is issued against production, and withdrawn as purchasing power as the goods are bought for consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/socredus/compendium/alberta-march-1945.txt |title=The Alberta Post-War Reconstruction Committee Report of the Subcommittee on Finance |accessdate=1 March 2008 |work=Simple Text |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/socredus/compendium/alberta-march-1945.txt&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:52:50|archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics argue that if the gap between income and prices exists as Douglas claimed, the economy would have collapsed in short order. They also argue that there are periods of time in which purchasing power is in excess of the price of consumer goods for sale.

Douglas replied to these criticisms in his testimony before the Alberta Agricultural Committee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What people who say that forget is that we were piling up debt at that time at the rate of ten millions sterling a day and if it can be shown, and it can be shown, that we are increasing debt continuously by normal operation of the banking system and the financial system at the present time, then that is proof that we are not distributing purchasing power sufficient to buy the goods for sale at that time; otherwise we should not be increasing debt, and that is the situation.&lt;ref name="The Douglas System"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political theory==
C.H. Douglas defined democracy as the “will of the people”, not rule by the majority,&lt;ref name ="ND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20The%20Nature%20of%20Democracy.pdf|title=The Nature of Democracy |accessdate=13 April 2008 |author=C.H. Douglas |publisher=Australian League of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that social credit could be implemented by any political party supported by effective public demand. Once implemented to achieve a realistic integration of means and ends, party politics would cease to exist. Traditional [[ballot box]] democracy is incompatible with Social Credit, which assumes the right of individuals to choose freely one choice at a time, and to contract out of unsatisfactory associations. Douglas advocated what he called the “responsible vote”, where anonymity in the voting process would no longer exist. "The individual voter must be made individually responsible, not collectively taxable, for his vote."&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20Realistic%20Constitutionalism.pdf |accessdate=28 February 2008 |author=C.H.

Douglas also opposed the [[secret ballot]] arguing that it resulted in electoral irresponsibility, calling it a "Jewish" technique used to ensure [[Barabbas]] was freed leaving Christ to be crucified.&lt;ref name=sten/&gt;

Douglas considered the constitution an organism, not an organization.&lt;ref name="RC"/&gt; In this view, establishing the [[Superior (hierarchy)|supremacy]] of [[common law]] is essential to ensure protection of [[individual rights]] from an all-powerful parliament. Douglas also believed the effectiveness of [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] is determined structurally by application of a Christian concept known as [[Trinitarianism]]: "In some form or other, sovereignty in the [[British Isles]] for the last two thousand years has been Trinitarian. Whether we look on this Trinitarianism under the names of King, Lords and Commons or as Policy, Sanctions and Administration, the Trinity-in-Unity has existed, and our national success has been greatest when the balance (never perfect) has been approached."&lt;ref name="RC"/&gt;

Opposing the formation of Social Credit parties, C.H. Douglas believed a group of elected amateurs should never direct a group of competent experts in technical matters.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, C.H.

Retrieved 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While experts are ultimately responsible for achieving results, the goal of politicians should be to pressure those experts to deliver policy results desired by the populace. According to Douglas, "the proper function of Parliament is to force all activities of a public nature to be carried on so that the individuals who comprise the public may derive the maximum benefit from them. Once the idea is grasped, the criminal absurdity of the [[party system]] becomes evident."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, C.H. (30 October 1936).

==History==
[[File:C H Douglas.jpg|180px|thumb|C. H. Douglas, founder of the "social credit" economic theory, in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada.]]

C. H. Douglas was a [[civil engineer]] who pursued his higher education at [[Cambridge University]]. His early writings appeared most notably in the British intellectual journal ''[[The New Age]]''. The editor of that publication, [[Alfred Richard Orage|Alfred Orage]], devoted the magazines ''The New Age'' and later ''The New English Weekly'' to the promulgation of Douglas's ideas until his death on the eve of his BBC speech on social credit, 5 November 1934, in the ''Poverty in Plenty'' Series.

Douglas’s first book, ''Economic Democracy'', was published in 1920, soon after his article ''The Delusion of Super-Production''&lt;ref name="douglassocialcredit.com"/&gt; appeared in 1918 in the ''English Review''. Among Douglas’s other early works were ''The Control and Distribution of Production'', ''Credit-Power and Democracy'', ''Warning Democracy'' and ''The Monopoly of Credit''. Of considerable interest is the evidence he presented to the Canadian House of Commons Select Committee on Banking and Commerce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/major_douglas-testimony_ottawa_1923.pdf |format=PDF |title=Select Committee on Banking and Commerce |accessdate=11 December 2008 |year=1923 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203171111/http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/major_douglas-testimony_ottawa_1923.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923, to the British Parliamentary [[Macmillan Committee|Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry]] in 1930, which included exchanges with economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], and to the Agricultural Committee of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta Legislature]] in 1934 during the term of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] Government in that [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]].

The writings of C. H. Douglas spawned a worldwide movement, most prominent in the British Commonwealth, with a presence in Europe and activities in the United States where Orage, during his sojourn there, promoted Douglas’s ideas. In the United States, the New Democracy group was directed by the American author [[Gorham Munson]] who contributed a major book on social credit titled ''Aladdin’s Lamp: The Wealth of the American People''. While Canada and [[New Zealand]] had electoral successes with “social credit” political parties, the efforts in England and Australia were devoted primarily to pressuring existing parties to implement social credit. This function was performed especially by Douglas’s social credit secretariat in England and the [[Australian League of Rights|Commonwealth Leagues of Rights]] in Australia. Douglas continued writing and contributing to the secretariat’s journals, initially ''Social Credit'' and soon thereafter ''The Social Crediter'' (which continues to be published by the Secretariat) for the remainder of his lifetime, concentrating more on political and philosophical issues during his later years.

===Political history===
During early years of the philosophy, the management of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] resisted pressure from some trade unionists to implement social credit, as hierarchical views of [[Fabian socialism]], economic growth and [[full employment]], were incompatible with the National Dividend and abolition of [[wage slavery]] suggested by Douglas. In an effort to discredit the social credit movement, one leading Fabian, Sidney Webb, is said to have declared that he didn’t care whether Douglas was technically correct or not – he simply did not like his policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richardccook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ch-douglas-1879-52-1979-centenary.pdf|last=Lee |first=Jeremy |publication-date=July 1972 |date=July 1972 |title=C.H. Douglas The Man and the Vision |publisher=Australian League of Rights |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 the world's first [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government was elected in [[Alberta]], Canada led by [[William Aberhart]]. A book by Maurice Colbourne, entitled ''The Meaning of Social Credit'', had convinced Aberhart that the theories of Major Douglas would facilitate for Alberta's recovery from the [[Great Depression]]. Aberhart added a heavy dose of [[fundamentalist Christianity]] to Douglas' theories, and the [[Canadian social credit movement]], which was largely nurtured in Alberta, thus acquired a strong [[social conservatism|social conservative]] influence.

Douglas was consulted by counselled the 1921-1935 [[United Farmers of Alberta]] provincial government in Alberta, but the UFA saw only difficulties in trying to bring in Social Credit.  Douglas became an advisor to Aberhart, but withdrew after short time and never visited Alberta after 1935 due to strategic differences. Aberhart sought orthodox counsel with respect to the Province's finances, and the correspondence between them was published by Douglas in his book, ''The Alberta Experiment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alberta Experiment |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1937 |publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode |location=London |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20The%20Alberta%20Experiment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Aberhart, the [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]], wanted to balance the provincial budget, Douglas argued the concept of a "[[balanced budget]]" was inconsistent with Social Credit principles. Douglas stated that, under existing rules of financial cost accountancy, balancing all budgets within an economy simultaneously is an arithmetic impossibility.&lt;ref name="Douglas 346-7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/douglas-c-h_fallacy-of-a-balanced-budget.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620145506/http://cooperativeindividualism.org/douglas-c-h_fallacy-of-a-balanced-budget.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2010 |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=28 July 1932 |date=28 July 1932 |title=The Fallacy of a Balanced Budget |work=The New English Weekly |pages=346–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Aberhart, Douglas stated:&lt;ref name="Douglas 346-7"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This seems to be a suitable occasion on which to emphasise the proposition that a Balanced Budget is quite inconsistent with the use of Social Credit (i.e., Real Credit – the ability to deliver goods and services 'as, when and where required') in the modern world, and is simply a statement in accounting figures that the progress of the country is stationary, i.e., that it consumes exactly what it produces, including [[capital asset]]s. The result of the acceptance of this proposition is that all [[capital appreciation]] becomes quite automatically the property of those who create and issue of money [i.e., the banking system] and the necessary unbalancing of the Budget is covered by Debts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Douglas sent two social credit technical advisors from the United Kingdom, L. Denis Byrne and George F. Powell, to Alberta. But early attempts to pass social credit legislation were ruled ''[[ultra vires]]'' by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and/or the [[Privy Council]] in London. Drawing on the monetary theories of [[Silvio Gesell]], William Aberhart issued a currency substitute known as [[prosperity certificates]]. These [[scrip]]s intentionally depreciated in value the longer they were held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glenbow.org/exhibitions/online/libhtm/prosp.htm |title=Prosperity Certificate |accessdate=27 February 2008 |author=Glenbow Museum |publisher=Glenbow Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Douglas openly criticized the idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gesell's theory was that the trouble with the world was that people saved money so that what you had to do was to make them spend it faster. Disappearing money is the heaviest form of continuous taxation ever devised. The theory behind this idea of Gesell's was that what is required is to stimulate trade – that you have to get people frantically buying goods – a perfectly sound idea so long as the objective of life is merely trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20The%20Approach%20to%20Reality.pdf |title=The Approach to Reality |accessdate=27 February 2008 |author=C. H. Douglas |publisher=The Australian League of Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They did provide spending power to many impoverished Albertans in the time they were in circulation.

Aberhart did bring in a measure of social credit, with the establishment of a government-owned banking system, the Alberta Treasury Branches, still in operation today and now the only government-owned bank in North America that serves the public.

Under [[Ernest Manning]], who succeeded Aberhart after his death in 1943, the [[Alberta Social Credit Party]] soon departed from its origins and became popularly identified as a [[right-wing politics|right wing]] [[populism|populist]] party. In the Secretariat’s journal, ''An Act for the Better Management of the Credit of Alberta'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=8 February 1947 |publication-place=Liverpool |year=1947 |volume=17 |issue=23 |title=An Act for the Better Management of the Credit of Alberta |periodical=The Social Crediter |publisher=K.R.P. Publications Ltd. |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas published a critical analysis of the Social Credit movement in Alberta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date=28 August 1947 |publisher=K.R.P. Publications Ltd. |publication-place=Liverpool |volume=20 |issue=26 |year=1947 |title=Social Credit in Alberta |periodical=The Social Crediter |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |publication-date= 4–11 September 1947 |year=1947 |publisher=K.R.P. Publications Ltd. |publication-place=Liverpool |volume=21 |issue=1,2 |title=Social Credit in Alberta |periodical=The Social Crediter |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he said, "The Manning administration is no more a Social Credit administration than the British government is Labour". Manning accused Douglas and his followers of [[anti-Semitism]], and purged "Douglasites" from the Alberta government.  The [[British Columbia Social Credit Party]] won power in 1952 in the province to Alberta's west, but had little in common with Social Credit bank reform, Major Douglas or his theories.

Social credit parties also enjoyed some electoral success at the federal level in Canada. The [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] was initiated mostly by Albertans, and eventually created another base of support in [[Quebec]]. Social Credit also did well nationally in [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|New Zealand]], where it was the country's third party for almost 30 years.

==Philosophy==
Douglas described Social Credit as "the policy of a philosophy", and warned against considering it solely as a scheme for monetary reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Policyofaphilosophy.htm#1a |title=The Policy of a Philosophy |accessdate=1 March 2008 |author=C.H. Douglas |publisher=Australian League of Rights |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904045608/http://www.alor.org/Library/Policyofaphilosophy.htm#1a &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called this philosophy "practical Christianity" and stated that its central issue is the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. Douglas believed that there was a [[Biblical Canon|Canon]] which permeated the universe, and [[Jesus Christ]] was the Incarnation of this Canon. However, he also believed that Christianity remained ineffective so long as it remained [[Trancendentalism|transcendental]]. Religion, which derives from the Latin word ''religare'' (to “bind back”), was intended to be a binding back to reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20Brief%20for%20the%20Prosecution.htm |title=Brief for the Prosecution |author=C.H. Douglas |publisher=Veritas Publishing Co. Pty, Ltd|isbn=978-0-949667-80-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Credit is concerned with the incarnation of Christian principles in our organic affairs. Specifically, it is concerned with the principles of association and how to maximize the increments of association which redound to satisfaction of the individual in society – while minimizing any decrements of association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ABC of Social Credit |author=E. S. Holter|publisher=Vancouver: Institute of Economic Democracy, Sixth Printing, Dec.1978 | isbn=978-0-920392-24-9 |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal of Social Credit is to maximize [[Immanence|immanent]] [[sovereignty]]. Social credit is consonant with the Christian doctrine of [[salvation]] through [[Grace (Christianity)|unearned grace]], and is therefore incompatible with any variant of the doctrine of salvation through works. Works need not be of Purity in intent or of desirable consequence and in themselves alone are as "filthy rags". For instance, the present system makes destructive, obscenely wasteful wars a virtual certainty – which provides much "work" for everyone. Social credit has been called the Third Alternative to the futile [[Left-right politics|Left-Right Duality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aladdin's Lamp: The Wealth of the American People |last=Munson |first=Gorham |year=1945 |publisher=Creative Age Press |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Douglas defined social credit as a philosophy with Christian origins, he did not envision a Christian [[theocracy]]. Douglas did not believe that religion should be mandated by law or external compulsion. Practical Christian society is Trinitarian in structure, based upon a constitution where the constitution is an organism changing in relation to our knowledge of the nature of the universe.&lt;ref name="RC"/&gt;  "The progress of human society is best measured by the extent of its creative ability. Imbued with a number of natural gifts, notably reason, memory, understanding and free will, man has learned gradually to master the secrets of nature, and to build for himself a world wherein lie the potentialities of peace, security, liberty and abundance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Alberta Post-War Reconstruction Committee Report of the Subcommittee on Finance | year = 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas said that social crediters want to build a new civilization based upon absolute economic security for the individual – where “they shall sit every man under his vine and under his [[Figs in the Bible|fig tree]]; and none shall make them afraid.”&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In keeping with this goal, Douglas was opposed to all forms of taxation on real property. This set social credit at variance from the land-taxing recommendations of [[Henry George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Land for the (Chosen) People Racket|last=Douglas |first=C.H.|year=1943 |publisher=KRP Publications Ltd |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social credit society recognizes the fact that the relationship between man and God is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Why I am a Social Crediter|
last=Monahan| first=Bryan | pages= 3 |isbn=978-0-85855-001-8|year= 1971|publisher= Tidal Publications|location= Sydney | url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Monohan%20BW%20-%20Why%20I%20Am%20A%20Social%20Crediter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, it is essential to allow man the greatest possible freedom in order to pursue this relationship.  Douglas defined freedom as the ability to choose and refuse one choice at a time, and to contract out of unsatisfactory associations. Douglas believed that if people were given the economic security and leisure achievable in the context of a social credit dispensation, most would end their service to [[Mammon]] and use their free time to pursue spiritual, intellectual or cultural goals resulting in self-development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/UseofSocialCredit.htm#1a |title=The Use of Social Credit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas opposed what he termed "the pyramid of power". [[Totalitarianism]] represents this pyramid and is the antithesis of social credit. It turns the government into an end instead of a means, and the individual into a means instead of an end – ''Demon est deus inversus'' – “the Devil is God upside down.” Social credit is designed to give the individual the maximum freedom allowable given the need for association in economic, political and social matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Why I am a Social Crediter|last=Monahan| first=Bryan | pages=7 |publisher=Tidal Publications |isbn=978-0-85855-001-8|year= 1971|url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Monohan%20BW%20-%20Why%20I%20Am%20A%20Social%20Crediter.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Credit elevates the importance of the individual and holds that all institutions exist to serve the individual – that the State exists to serve its citizens, not that individuals exist to serve the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1920 |pages=33 |isbn=978-0-904656-00-8 |publisher=Heritage for Institute of Economic Democracy |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas emphasized that all policy derives from its respective philosophy and that “Society is primarily [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and must have regard to the organic relationships of its prototype.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;C.H. Douglas letter to L.D. Byrne, 28 March 1940&lt;/ref&gt;
Social credit rejects [[Dialectical Materialism|dialectical materialistic]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "The tendency to argue from the particular to the general is a special case of the sequence from materialism to collectivism. If the universe is reduced to molecules, ultimately we can dispense with a catalogue and a dictionary; all things are the same thing, and all words are just sounds – molecules in motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alor.org/Library/Douglas%20CH%20-%20Brief%20for%20the%20Prosecution.htm|title=Brief for the Prosectution |accessdate=29 March 2009 |author=C.H. Douglas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas divided philosophy into two schools of thought that he termed the "classical school" and the "modern school", which are broadly represented by philosophies of [[Aristotle]] and [[Francis Bacon]] respectively. Douglas was critical of both schools of thought, but believed that "the truth lies in appreciation of the fact that neither conception is useful without the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/socialcredit/p1c1.htm |title=Static and Dynamic Sociology |accessdate=1 March 2008 |author=C.H. Douglas |work=Social Credit |publisher=Mondo Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism for antisemitism===
{{Antisemitism}}
Social crediters and Douglas have been criticized for spreading [[antisemitism]]. Douglas was critical of "international Jewry", especially in his later writings. He asserted that such Jews controlled many of the major banks and were involved in an [[Jewish conspiracy|international conspiracy]] to centralize the power of finance. Some people have claimed that Douglas was antisemitic because he was quite critical of pre-Christian philosophy. In his book ''Social Credit'', he wrote that, "It is not too much to say that one of the root ideas through which Christianity comes into conflict with the conceptions of the [[Old Testament]] and the ideals of the pre-Christians' era is in respect of this dethronement of abstractionism."&lt;ref name="SocialCreditBook"&gt;
{{cite book |title=Social Credit |last=Douglas |first=C. H. |year=1973 |publisher=Gordon Press |location=New York |pages=22 |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/social_credit_by_ch_douglas.pdf |isbn=978-0-9501126-1-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209091428/http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/social_credit_by_ch_douglas.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas was opposed to abstractionist philosophies, because he believed that these philosophies inevitably resulted in the elevation of [[abstractions]], such as the state, and [[legal fiction]]s, such as [[corporate personhood]], over the individual. He also believed that what Jews considered as abstractionist thought tended to encourage them to endorse communist ideals and an emphasis on [[collectives]] over individuals. John L. Finlay, in his book ''Social Credit: The English Origins'', wrote, "Anti-Semitism of the Douglas kind, if it can be called anti-Semitism at all, may be fantastic, may be dangerous even, in that it may be twisted into a dreadful form, but it is not itself vicious nor evil."&lt;ref name="Finlay"&gt;
{{cite book |title=Social Credit: The English Origins |last=Finlay |first=John L |year=1972 |publisher=McGill-Queens University Press |location=Montreal| pages=105 |isbn=978-0-7735-0111-9 |url=http://www.geocities.com/socredus/compendium/finlay-1972.txt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/socredus/compendium/finlay-1972.txt&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:52:52|archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Social Discredit: Anti-Semitism, Social Credit and the Jewish Response'', Janine Stingel writes that "Douglas' economic and political doctrines were wholly dependent on an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Social Discredit: Anti-Semitism, Social  Credit and the Jewish Response |last=Stingel |first=Janine |page=13 
|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal | year=2000| 
isbn=978-0-7735-2010-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; John L. Finlay disagrees with Stingel's assertion and argues that, "It must also be noted that while Douglas was critical of some aspects of Jewish thought, Douglas did not seek to discriminate against Jews as a people or race. It was never suggested that the National Dividend be withheld from them."&lt;ref name="Finlay" /&gt;

==Literary figures==
As lack of finance has been a constant impediment to the development of the arts and literature, the concept of economic democracy through social credit had immediate appeal in literary circles. Names associated with social credit include [[C.M. Grieve]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Herbert Read]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Storm Jameson]], Eimar O'Duffy, [[Sybil Thorndyke]], [[Bonamy Dobrée]], [[Eric de Maré]] and the American publisher [[James Laughlin]]. [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[GK Chesterton]] espoused similar ideas. In 1933 Eimar O'Duffy published ''Asses in Clover'', a science fiction fantasy exploration of social credit themes. His social credit economics book ''Life and Money: Being a Critical Examination of the Principles and Practice of Orthodox Economics with A Practical Scheme to End the Muddle it has made of our Civilisation'', was endorsed by Douglas.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]] described a social credit economy in his posthumously-published first novel, ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'', and his ''[[Beyond This Horizon]]'' describes a similar system in less detail. In Heinlein's future society, government is not funded by taxation. Instead, government controls the currency and prevents inflation by providing a price rebate to participating business and a guaranteed income to every citizen.

In his novel ''The Trick Top Hat'', part of his ''[[Schrödinger's Cat trilogy|Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy]]'', [[Robert Anton Wilson]] described the implementation by the President of an alternate future United States of an altered form of social credit, in which the government issues a National Dividend to all citizens in the form of "trade aids," which can be spent like money but which cannot be lent at [[interest]] (in order to mollify the banking industry) and which eventually expire (to prevent inflation and hoarding).

More recently, [[Richard C. Cook]], an analyst for the [[United States Civil Service Commission|U.S. Civil Service Commission]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[NASA]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]], and author of the books ''Challenger Revealed'' and ''We Hold These Truths'', has written several articles relating to social credit and [[monetary reform]] at [[Globalresearch.ca|Global Research]], an independent research and media group of writers, scholars, journalists and activists.  Frances Hutchinson, Chairperson of the Social Credit Secretariat, has co-authored, with Brian Burkitt, a book entitled ''The Political Economy of Social Credit and [[Guild Socialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Political Economy of Social Credit and Guild Socialism |last=Hutchinson |first=Frances |publisher=Routledge |location=UK |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-14709-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFI Standards are revised and updated every five years to incorporate the latest scientific information and to respond to emerging issues. As part of this process, comments were received during two 60-day public comment periods in 2013 and 2014, and input was received from 12 public workshops across the United States and Canada. About 10,000 stakeholders were invited to submit comments. Participants included public and private landowners, forest sector representatives, Indigenous communities, conservation groups, industry, academia and government officials. 

Independent oversight was provided at each stage of the revision process by the SFI External Review Panel, a group of independent experts representing conservation, professional, academic and public organizations, operating at arm’s length from SFI. The SFI External Review Panel reviewed every public comment submitted to ensure that all comments were considered, and to guarantee the Standard revision process was transparent, objective and credible. The responses to comments are posted on the SFI website.

The SFI Program only certifies lands in the United States and Canada, and program participants must comply with all applicable laws. For sources outside of North America without effective laws, participants must avoid illegal or other controversial sources.&lt;ref name="C20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/Section7_sfi_requirements_2010-2014.pdf |title=SFI Requirements 2010-2014 Section 7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826175220/http://www.sfiprogram.org/files/pdf/Section7_sfi_requirements_2010-2014.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFI Program supports activities by international experts to find ways to address the problem of illegal logging&lt;ref name="C21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/forest-conservation/prevent-illegal-logging.php |title=Prevent Illegal Logging |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014001529/http://www.sfiprogram.org/forest-conservation/prevent-illegal-logging.php |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the international, multi-stakeholder Forest Legality Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/fla/ |title=Forest Legality Alliance |publisher=Wri.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard promotes responsible forestry practices based on 14 Principles, 13 Objectives, 21 Performance Measures and 55 Indicators that address the 90 percent of the world’s forests that are not certified. The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard distinguishes SFI from all other forest certification programs in that it sets mandatory practice requirements for the responsible procurement of all fiber, even if it is sourced from non-certified land. These fiber sourcing requirements include measures to broaden the practice of biodiversity, use best management practices to protect water quality, and utilize the services of forest management and harvesting professionals. Because it governs how SFI Program Participants procure fiber from non-certified land, supporters argue that the Standard encourages the spread of responsible forestry practices.

SFI has certified more than 285 million acres (115 million hectares)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/about-us/basics-of-sfi/|title=Basics of SFI - SFI|author=|date=|website=www.sfiprogram.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its standard in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. At the end of October 2010, SFI had 959 [[chain of custody]] certifications at 2,339 locations.  According to the [[United Nations]], SFI was the fastest growing organization for chain of custody certifications in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 Forest Products- Annual Market Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717023154/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Directors that governs the SFI program has three chambers that recognize economic, environmental and social sectors equally.&lt;ref name="C8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/sustainable-forestry-initiative/sfi-governance.php |title=SFI Governance |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014010228/http://www.sfiprogram.org/sustainable-forestry-initiative/sfi-governance.php |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors include representatives of environmental, conservation, professional and academic groups, independent professional loggers, family forest owners, public officials, labor and the forest products industry.&lt;ref name="C9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php#top |title=SFI Board of Directors |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104014327/http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php#top |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and comparisons ==

===Third-party reviews ===

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]]/[[Food and Agriculture Organization]], in its ''2009-2010 Forest products Annual Review'', says: "Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |title=2009-2010 Forest Products- Annual Market Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dovetail Partners Inc., in its ''2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report'', states: "the previous differences between forest certification programs are much less distinct ... each program generally has the same structural programmatic requirements, although the required content and level of detail provided by each may vary considerably."&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailCertReport0310b.pdf |title=2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531220823/http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailCertReport0310b.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFI is generally considered less stringent than that of the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/science/earth/12timber.html Mireya Navarro, “Environmental Groups Spar Over Certifications of Wood and Paper Products”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0812/environment_1-1.html |article=FSC Versus SFI|author=Christine MacDonald|date=August 12, 2009|publisher=Architecture Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, SFI allows more tree farming and does not require conservation plans or consultation with local and indigenous stakeholders (except for public lands).&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt;

SFI is less highly rated than FSC for example by Consumer Reports “Greener Choices”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels/labelCategory.cfm?labelCategoryName=Sustainable%20Wood 
“Sustainable Wood”&lt;/ref&gt; and Green America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenamerica.org/programs/woodwise/publishers/simplesteps/FSCvsSFI.cfm
"FSC: The Premier Forest Certification Program"
by Jennifer Gerholdt, Magazine PAPER Project Coordinator&lt;/ref&gt; Others rate SFI/PEFC and FSC equally: TerraChoice (part of [[Underwriters Laboratories]] Global Network) in its 2010 Sins of Greenwashing report, like its 2009 one, counts the SFI/PEFC and FSC in its second-tier list of "legitimate" environmental standards and certifications.;&lt;ref name="C17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/findings/greenwashing-report-2010/ |title=Sins of Greenwashing |publisher=Sins of Greenwashing |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does Environment Canada's EcoLogo.&lt;ref name="C14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/education/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=743D106D-1 |title=Environment Canada's EcoLogo |publisher=Ec.gc.ca |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611114921/http://www.ec.gc.ca/education/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=743D106D-1 |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A National Association of State Foresters forest certification policy statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateforesters.org/node/1032 |title=NASF Resolution No. 2008-7: Forest Certification Policy Statement |publisher=Stateforesters.org |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by resolution in 2008 states: "While in different manners, the ATFS (American Tree Farm System), FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability. . . . No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility."

=== Green Building Council ===
On April 5, 2016, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] issued a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) pilot alternative compliance path (ACP) designed to screen out illegal forest products from LEED buildings. While the ACP is being tested as a credit, it will ultimately become a prerequisite that applies to all LEED projects. As a pilot, the ACP does not become a permanent part of the LEED standard without an affirmative vote of the USGBC membership.  The ACP pilot recognizes all certified sources - FSC, PEFC, SFI and ATFS and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGBC Announces New LEED Pilot ACP Designed to Help Eliminate Irresponsibly Sourced Materials—Like Illegal Wood—From the Building Material Supply Chain|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/usgbc-announces-new-leed-pilot-acp-designed-help-eliminate-irresponsibly-sourced-materials%E2%80%94|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACP will apply to all LEED v4 rating systems including Homes v4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED Reference Guide for Homes Design and Construction|url=http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-reference-guide-homes-design-and-construction|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to all LEED 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED 2009 Rating System Selection Guidance.” U.S. Green Building Council|url=http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-2009-rating-system-selection-guidance|website=U.S. Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; rating systems. 

The ACP categorizes the various forest certification standards based on the ASTM D7612-10 (2015) standard, which is titled “Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Practice for Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7612.htm|website=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASTM ([[ASTM_International|American Society for Testing and Materials]]) International is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards.

Other [[green building]] tools, including two [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI)-approved rating systems in the United States –  ANSI-ICC 700-2008: National Green Building Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahbgreen.org/Guidelines/ansistandard.aspx |title=National Green Building Standard |publisher=Nahbgreen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Assessment Protocol for Commercial Buildings (formerly Green Globes U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegbi.org/green-globes/ansi-gbi-standard.asp |title=ANSI / GBI Standard |publisher=Thegbi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) –  [[Green Building Initiative|Green Globes]] and [[Built Green Canada]] recognize wood products certified by credible third-party certification programs like SFI.

=== Conservation organizations ===
The SFI Program is supported by conservation groups such as [[Conservation International]], [[American Bird Conservancy]], [[Ducks Unlimited]], and the [[Conservation Fund]] (which serves on its Board).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php |title=Board Members |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104014327/http://www.sfiprogram.org/board.php |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike SFI, the FSC included environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace]] among its founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc.org/history.html|title=History of FSC|publisher=Fsc.org|date=|accessdate=2013-02-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422113655/http://www.fsc.org/history.html|archivedate=2012-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/forests/solutions-to-deforestation/ |title=Solutions to Deforestation |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Wildlife Federation]] and [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) currently serve on the FSC Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsc.org/bod.html |title=Board of Directors |publisher=Fsc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503212719/http://www.fsc.org/bod.html |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sierra Club]] endorses only FSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/forestcertification/ |title=Forest Certification Committee |publisher=Sierraclub.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301171528/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/forestcertification/ |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of SFI==

===Marketing practices===
On September 9, 2009 the Washington State Forest Law Center, on behalf of the environmental protection group ForestEthics, filed complaints against SFI Inc. with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;ref name="C23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wflc.org/cases/credibleforestcert/SFIcomplaints |title=Complaints filed against SFI |publisher=Wflc.org |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref name="C23"/&gt;

The FTC complaint accuses SFI Inc. of misleading consumers with deceptive marketing practices. The complaint cites various aspects of SFI’s marketing, including its claim that it is an “independent” not-for-profit organization, its dependence on the timber industry for funding, and the vagueness of SFI’s environmental standards, which allow SFI-certified landowners to be certified merely because the landowner is complying with state environmental regulations. The complaint cites SFI’s certification as an example of [[greenwash]].

Both the FTC and IRS investigated the complaints made against SFI and found them without merit. No action was taken by either investigative body.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the IRS and FTC investigation needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}}


===Conflict of interest===
The complaint filed with the IRS requests an examination of SFI Inc.’s non-profit status, based on the fact that SFI benefits the private interests of its corporate landowners and not the public interest, as well as the fact that SFI draws more than 80% of its funding from the wood and paper industry.&lt;ref name="C24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gisf.research.yale.edu/assets/pdf/ypfc_perspectives/fsc_sfi_comparison.pdf|title=THE FOREST STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND THE SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY INITIATIVE: POINTS OF COMPARISON|author=|date=|website=yale.edu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint asserts that in serving the private interests of wood and paper companies that want a ‘green’ image, SFI is inappropriately granted a nonprofit status reserved for public charities.&lt;ref name="C25"&gt;[http://forestethics.org/downloads/SFI_IRS_complaint.pdf Washington State Forest Law Center complaint against SFI filed with IRS]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706181943/http://forestethics.org/downloads/SFI_IRS_complaint.pdf |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS investigated the complaint as well as conducted a thorough examination of SFI’s non-profit status and concluded that it was appropriate and that no further action was required.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the IRS investigation needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}}


=== Sierra Club complaint ===

The [[Sierra Club]] has lodged a formal complaint with the SFI,&lt;ref name="C26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wflc.org/cases/credibleforestcert/SFI%20Complaint |title=Sierra Club complaint filed with SFI |publisher=Wflc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that [[Weyerhaeuser]] engaged in risky and irresponsible logging on steep slopes that led to 1,259 landslides in 2007 on SFI-certified Weyerhaeuser lands in Washington state.&lt;ref name="C27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/1021/news_2-1.html |title=High Tension Over Big Timber |publisher=Architectureweek.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/ger_ofr2008-5_dec2007_landslides.pdf |title=Landslide Reconnaissance Following the Storm Event of December 1–3, 2007, in Western Washington |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenging SFI to back up its claims of 'independence' and 'rigorous audits,' the Sierra Club requested that Weyerhaeuser's SFI certification be revoked.&lt;ref name="C26" /&gt;

A peer reviewed landslide study concluded that the Washington State landslides that the Sierra Club attributed to Weyerhaeuser’s logging practices were the result of extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall and not the result of steep slope logging by the company.{{Citation needed|reason=A link to the study needed to verify this claim|date=September 2015}} Landslides occur on both logged and unlogged sites, but science shows that logging (and logging roads) dramatically increase the risk of landslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregonwild.org/sites/default/files/pdf-files/Heiken,%20D.%20Landslides%20and%20clearcuts%20-%20science.pdf|title=LANDSLIDES AND CLEARCUTS: What Does The Science Really Say?|last=Heiken|first=Doug|date=|website=www.oregonwild.org|publisher=Oregon Wild|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21747">The '''Sustainable Groundwater Management Act''' ('''SGMA''') is a three-bill package that passed the [[California State Legislature|California state legislature]] and was signed into [[Law of California|California state law]] by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] in September 2014. Its purpose is to ensure better local and regional management of [[groundwater]] use and it seeks to have a [[sustainable]] groundwater management in California by 2042. It emphasizes local management and formed groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) from local and regional authorities.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;

Proposition&amp;nbsp;1 provides $100 million to financially support sustainable groundwater management as well as cleanup and storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.water.ca.gov/irwm/grants/sgwp/solicitation.cfm|title=Draft Proposal Solicitation Package for Groundwater Sustainability Plans and Projects|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

[[File:Groundwaterimage.jpg|thumb|660x660px|Groundwater diagram in relation to the hydrologic and hydro-social cycle]]

Groundwater in California is used by 85% of the population, mostly used by the [[Economy of California#Agriculture|agriculture industry]] as the main water source for crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://waterinthewest.stanford.edu/groundwater/overview/index.html|title=Understanding California's Groundwater {{!}} Water in the West|website=Stanford University |access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, groundwater use has been poorly managed and under-regulated to a point where the state is facing major depletion.

Groundwater is particularly crucial in California because the dearth of [[surface water]] means that it supplies between one-third and two-thirds of the state's freshwater supply, depending on [[Climate of California|climatic conditions]]. It is being pumped in excess of the natural rate of replenishment, which in return is lowering the ground[[water table]], a phenomenon called "overdraft" that can cause severe land [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]].&lt;ref name="stanf"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tara Moran|editor1-last=Amanda Cravens|title=California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014: Recommendations for Preventing and Resolving Groundwater Conflicts|date=April 2015|publisher=Water in the West, Stanford University|location=Stanford, CA|url=http://waterinthewest.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/SGMA_RecommendationsforGWConflicts_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[California Department of Water Resources|Department of Water Resources]] (DWR) noted that of California's 450 groundwater basins, 40 were in overdraft and 11 were identified as being in "critical" conditions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  and groundwater levels have dropped to 50 feet below historic levels—up to 100 feet below in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. Knowing how much groundwater is being taken out and used is difficult because there is no reporting requirement. There are a few exceptions that require basins operating under government regulation and special state legislation. Managing groundwater is also challenging because it does not adhere to property lines and freely moves underground. With few incentives and fewer regulations to conserve groundwater, California farms have planted higher-value crops that require year-round [[irrigation]] and have drilled deeper wells to retrieve groundwater from sinking [[aquifer]]s. Drought conditions in California are only pushing for a more heavily regulated groundwater management to be implemented now.

==Legislation==
The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) consists of three bills. It was primarily authored by [[California State Assembly]]member [[Roger Dickinson]] (AB 1739) and [[California State Senate|State Senator]] [[Fran Pavley]] (SB 1319 and SB 1168).&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Groundwater: Sustainable Groundwater Management Act|url=http://groundwater.ucdavis.edu/SGMA/|website=Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AB 1739 ===

AB 1739 gives the [[California Department of Water Resources]] (DWR) or a groundwater sustainability agency (GSA) the authority to establish fees (detailed in SB 1168) and offer support to "entities that extract or use groundwater to promote water conservation and protect groundwater resources". GSAs are locally controlled organizations in California's high- and medium-priority groundwater basins and are responsible for preparing a groundwater sustainability plan (GSP), implementing SGMA, and coordinating with neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://groundwater.ca.gov/docs/sgma_brochure_jan_2015.pdf|title=Sustainable Groundwater Management Act|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AB 1739 also requires DWR to organize and publish an online report with estimates of [[groundwater replenishment]] and best practices. GSAs are required to submit a groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) to the DWR for review. DWR must determine regulations to evaluate, implement, and coordinate GSPs based on conditions of "[[hydrology]], water demand, regulatory restrictions that affect the availability of [[surface water]], and unreliability of, or reductions in, surface water deliveries to the agency or water users in the basin, and impact of those conditions on achieving sustainability and shall include the historic average reliability and deliveries of surface water to the agency or water users in the basin".&lt;ref name=ppp&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposal Solicitation Package For Groundwater Sustainability Plans and Projects|last=|first=|date=|url = http://www.water.ca.gov/irwm/grants/sgwp/sgwp_docs/2017_SGWP_Grant_PSP_05082017.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SB 1319 ===

Approved by Governor [[Jerry Brown]] on September 16, 2014, Senator Pavley's SB 1319 authorized local agencies to implement a groundwater plan. Management of groundwater prior to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act was unregulated and voluntary for the various agencies using groundwater ranging from special districts under authority granted from the state, city, and county ordinances and court adjudicated basins. Senate bill 1319 requires for the groundwater management plans to follow specific and include components that the state deems as sustainable for the specific groundwater basin and aligns with the SGMA timeline. If an agency was seeking funds from the Department of Water Resources for a project regarding groundwater or groundwater quality, they too have to abide to specific requirements such as preparing and implementing a groundwater management plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1319|title=Bill Text - SB-1319 Groundwater.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managing groundwater is a challenging task, one that has been addressed by the SGMA. Groundwater is out of sight which makes it difficult to monitor, especially when the groundwater basins boundaries reach across multiple agencies and users. Pumping unregulated and mismanaged groundwater can lead to a "[[tragedy of the commons]]", with each user maximizing the resource for their own gain with little responsibility for the depleting aquifer. The SGMA set basin boundaries based on a 2003 Department of Water Resources report. The report broke it down into there being 431 current groundwater basins in California that have been delineated, of these basins 24 are subdivided into 108 basins to total 515 basins in all. The report based these boundaries off the alluvial sediments found using geographic maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watereducation.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/groundwatermgthandbook_oct2015.pdf|title=The 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act: A Handbook to Understanding and Implementing the Law|last=|first=|date=2015|website=watereducation.org|publisher=Water Education Foundation|access-date=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Groundwater is difficult to manage due to it being unseen and not neatly aligned with the jurisdiction of these set basin boundaries. The SGMA calls for the GSAs to communicate and work with the overlapping groundwater uses and allow for a governance of the basin through different means. These can include a memorandum of agreement (unofficial and often made outside the courts) between the multiple parties or through a legal joint agreement. By these agreements the groundwater basin can be regulated by multiple GSAs or just by one agency.

===  SB 1168 ===

The [[California Constitution]] and SB 1168 require that any use of the groundwater be both reasonable and beneficial.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1168|title=Bill Text - SB-1168 Groundwater management |website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; California has a history of complex water rights, in which the Reasonable and Beneficial Use Doctrine is a key tenet. The doctrine was originally developed for riparian landowners and surface water management, but SB 1168 applied it to the context of groundwater and the SGMA, stating that any use of groundwater has to be sustainably managed for long-term reliability and multiple economic, social, and environmental benefits for future uses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Specifically, SB 1168 gives GSAs the authority to:
* Require registration from a groundwater extraction facility
* Require that a groundwater extraction facility be measured by a water-measuring device and to regulate the extraction based off the measurements
* Conduct inspections and obtain warrants

It requires the Department of Water Resources to:
* Investigate the California's groundwater basins every five years and report its findings to the [[California State Legislature]]
* Look at the monitoring of groundwater elevations in each basin and prioritize them based on adverse effects to the local habitats and [[streamflow]]s

[[File:Groundwater monitoring, Coronado National Memorial (6540935393).jpg|thumb|400x400px|An Electronic "Barologger" data-logger is being used to measure the depth to groundwater in this well. This is one form of groundwater monitoring that SB 1168 requires extraction facilities to implement regularly.]]

=== SB 13 amendments ===

Since the collection of bills that make up SGMA were complex, some minor changes were made in SB 13 pertaining to GSA formation. Prior to SB 13, existing law required that each high- and medium-priority groundwater basins be managed after implementing a groundwater sustainability plan and subjected reporting requirements to the [[California State Water Resources Control Board|State Water Resources Control Board]]. SB 13 changed DWR's role with respect to reviewing, posting, and tracking GSA formation notices. Changes include notifying reviews, GSA boundaries which overlap, and service area boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CA Department of Water Resources|title=Groundwater Sustainability Agencies|url= http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/sgm/gsa.cfm|website=water.ca.gov| publisher =State of California|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill overview==
=== Key definitions ===

Key terms in the GSMA are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=University of California, Davis|title=The 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act: A Handbook to Understanding and Implementing the Law|date=2015|publisher=Water Education Foundation|location=Sacramento, CA|pages=1–90|url=http://groundwater.ucdavis.edu/files/208021.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Sustainable yield''': the maximum quantity of water calculated over long-term conditions in the basin, including any temporary excess that can be withdrawn over a year without an undesirable result
* '''Sustainable groundwater management''': the management and use of groundwater that can be maintained without causing an undesirable result.
* '''Undesirable results''' include any of the following:
** Persistent lowering of groundwater levels
** Significant and unreasonable reductions in groundwater storage
** Significant and unreasonable [[saltwater intrusion]]
** Significant and unreasonable degradation of water quality
** Significant and unreasonable land [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]]
** [[Surface water]] depletion having significant and unreasonable effects on beneficial uses

=== Groundwater sustainability agencies ===

A GSA is a local agency that implements the SGMA as the primary entity responsible for reaching groundwater sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kincaid | first1=Valerie|last2=Stager|first2=Ryan|title=Know Your Options: A Guide to Forming Groundwater Sustainability Agencies|date=September 2015| publisher= California Water Foundation|pages=1–44|url= http://californiawaterfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CF_GSA_Guide_09.30.15_web.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is required to develop and implement a groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) to consider the interests of all of its stakeholders.

Any local agency or combinations thereof may form a GSA for the basin in which they overlap. A "local agency" refers to a local public agency that has water supply, management, and land use obligations within the groundwater basin. The SGMA determined 43 high-priority groundwater basins and 84 medium-priority groundwater basins, totaling 127 basins accounting for 96% of California's groundwater. These basins must adopt GSPs by 2020 or 2022 (depending on the basin) and have until 2040 or 2042 to attain sustainability. A local agency can decide not to form a GSA and submit an alternative proposal to DWR if they believe the alternative will meet the objectives and long-term goals of the GSMA. The DWR is required to assess the alternative proposal to see if it satisfies the objectives and goals of the SGMA. If it does not, the local agency is required to form a GSA and develop a GSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=University of California, Davis|title=The 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act: A Handbook to Understanding and Implementing the Law|date=2015|publisher=Water Education Foundation|location=Sacramento, CA|pages=1–90|url=http://groundwater.ucdavis.edu/files/208021.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GSMA required GSAs to be formed by June 30, 2017.

As part of its implementation, DWR has developed a Strategic Plan to document its Sustainable Groundwater Management (SGM) Program, which expands on its responsibilities in SGMA. The Strategic Plan describes the state's groundwater conditions, identifies legislation, policies, and success factors, describes the goals and objectives of DWR actions, and presents the plan for DWR communication and outreach with stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Groundwater Sustainability Program|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2015|website=water.ca.gov|publisher=California Department of Water Resources|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception==
=== Support ===

Support for the act stemmed from the goal of avoiding negative impacts of lowering the [[water table]] and [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]] throughout California with implementing specific, measurable objectives. California has had a long history of complex [[water rights]] dealing with the ownership and management of surface water. Groundwater has stayed under the regulation radar, which led to the overdraft of vital basins and the subsidence of land taking place throughout the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. The SGMA gives responsibility to both state authority and local oversight to bring groundwater basins in California to sustainable yields within a given time period.

=== Criticism ===

One of the main arguments in opposition of AB 1739 and SB 1168 was from the [[California Farm Bureau Federation]] (CFBF), which was concerned that the bills were rushed and did not allow enough time to address many of the complex issues of groundwater. In addition, the Farm Bureau explained that there would be "huge long-term economic impacts" on farms as well as state and local economies, with a "very real potential to devalue land", thereby affecting the viability of farms and business as well as jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1739|title=Bill Analysis|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents from the CFBF included counties in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] and agricultural businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cannon Leahy|first1=Tina|title=Desperate Times Call for Sensible Measures: The Making of the California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act|journal=Golden Gate University Environmental Law Journal|date=January 2016|volume=9|issue=4|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable Groundwater Planning Funds ==

This initial PSP has made $86.3 million available for the, "planning, development, or preparation of GSPs" and a minimum of $10 million from the initial PSP has been earmarked for Severely Disadvantaged Communities.&lt;ref name=ppp/&gt; Eligibility for grant approval requires that the GSPs address high- or medium-priority basins. The  SWRCB has already released its initial round of funding for certain preventative and restorative groundwater initiatives which can be seen below.

{{Financial risk types}}
A '''systemically important financial institution''' ('''SIFI''') or '''systemically important bank''' ('''SIB''') is a [[bank]], [[insurance]] company, or other [[financial institution]] whose failure might trigger a [[financial crisis]]. They are colloquially referred to as "[[too big to fail]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsb.org/what-we-do/policy-development/systematically-important-financial-institutions-sifis/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
As the [[2007-2012 global financial crisis]] has unfolded, the international community has moved to protect the [[global financial system]] through preventing the failure of SIFIs, or, if one does fail, limiting the adverse effects of its failure. In November 2011, the [[Financial Stability Board]] published a list of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104bb.pdf |title= List of Systemically Important Financial Institutions |author= Financial Stability Board |date=November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] introduced new regulations (known as [[Basel III]]) that also specifically target SIFIs. The main focus of the regulations is to increase bank capital requirements and to introduce capital surcharges for systemically important banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs207.htm |title=Global systemically important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement – final document |author=BCBS |date=November 2011 |work= |publisher=BIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some economists have warned that the tighter Basel III capital regulation, which is primarily based on [[risk-weighted asset]]s, may further negatively affect the stability of the financial system.&lt;ref name="OECDSlovikfeb2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kg0ps8cq8q6-en |title=OECD study on regulation of systemically important banks |publisher=OECD |date= February 2012 |author=Slovik, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repec_SlovikFeb2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/oec/ecoaaa/916-en.html |title= Abstract: Systemically Important Banks and Capital Regulation Challenges |first=Patrick |last=Slovik |publisher=Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank (RePec)|location=St. Louis |date= February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that both the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee are only policy research and development entities. They do not establish laws, regulations or rules for any financial institution directly. They merely act in an advisory capacity. It is up to each country's specific lawmakers and regulators to enact whatever portions of the recommendations they deem appropriate. Each country's internal financial regulators make their own determination of what is a ''Systemically Important Financial Institution''. Once those regulators make that determination, they may set specific laws, regulations and rules that would apply to those entities.

Virtually every Systemically Important Financial Institution operates at the top level as a holding company made up of numerous subsidiaries. It is not unusual for the subsidiaries to number in the hundreds. Even though the uppermost holding company is located in the home country, where it is subject, at that level, to that home regulator, the subsidiaries may be organized and operating in several different countries. Each subsidiary is then subject to potential regulation by every country where it actually conducts business.

At present (and for the likely foreseeable future) there is no such thing as a global regulator. Likewise there is no such thing as global insolvency, global bankruptcy, or the legal requirement for a global bail out. Each legal entity is treated separately. Each country is responsible (in theory) for containing a financial crisis that starts in their country from spreading across borders. Looking up from a country prospective as to what is a Systemically Important Financial Institution may be different than when looking down on the entire globe and attempting to determine what entities are significant.

The degree of interconnectedness between financial institutions is almost completely unknown at any specific point in time. When trouble breaks out, fear and contagion effects are extremely unpredictable. Therefore, determining exactly what entities are ''significant'' is a difficult assignment, as the real certainty is determinable only well after the fact.

== Definition ==
As of November 2011, a standard definition of ''systemically important financial institution'' had not been decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/06/banks-disappointed-not-on-g-sifi-list |title=Some banks will be disappointed not to be on the G-Sifi list for regulation |date=6 November 2011 |publisher=The Observer |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Basel Committee has identified factors for assessing whether a financial institution is systemically important: its size, its complexity, its interconnectedness, the lack of readily available substitutes for the financial infrastructure it provides, and its global (cross-jurisdictional) activity. In some cases, the assessments of experts, independent of the indicators, will be able to move an institution into the SIFI category or remove it from SIFI status.

==Banks==
{{further information|List of systemically important banks|List of bank stress tests}}

===Asia===
Banks in Japan deemed systemically important are stress tested by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). Banks in China are mostly state run and are stress tested by the national banking authority.

===European Union===
Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) are determined based on four main criteria: (a) size, (b) cross-jurisdiction activity, (c) complexity, and (d) substitutability. The list of G-SIBs is published annually by the [[Financial Stability Board]] (FSB). The G-SIBs must maintain a higher capital level – capital surcharge – compared to other banks.

In November 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_131111.pdf 2013 update of group of global systemically important banks(G-SIBs)]&lt;/ref&gt; the FSB updated the list of G-SIBs, and the following banks were included: [[Bank of America]], [[Bank of China]], [[The Bank of New York Mellon|Bank of New York Mellon]], [[Barclays]], [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Citigroup]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Groupe BPCE]], [[Crédit Agricole]], [[HSBC]], [[ING Group|ING Bank]], [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]], [[Mizuho Financial Group]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Nordea]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Banco Santander]], [[Société Générale]], [[Standard Chartered]], [[State Street Corporation|State Street]], [[Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group|Sumitomo Mitsui FG]], [[UBS]], [[UniCredit]], [[Wells Fargo]].

Compared with the group of G-SIBs published in 2011, three banks have been added: BBVA, Standard Chartered and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited; and three banks removed: Dexia, as it is undergoing an orderly resolution process, and Commerzbank and Lloyds, as result of a decline in their global systemic importance.

===United States===

====Stress testing====
In the USA, the largest banks are regulated by the [[Federal Reserve]] (FRB) and the [[Office of the Comptroller of Currency]] (OCC). These regulators set the selection criteria, establish hypothetical adverse scenarios and oversee the annual tests. 19 banks operating in the U.S. (at the top tier) have been subject to such testing since 2009.  Banks showing difficulty under the stress tests are required to postpone share buybacks, curtail dividend plans and if necessary raise additional capital financing.

====G-SIB Capital Requirements====

In December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issued a long-awaited proposal to impose additional capital requirements on the U.S.’s global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/bcreg20141209a1.pdf|title= Federal Reserve Proposed Rule to Further Strengthen the Capital Positions of the Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies |website= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141209a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal implements the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) G-SIB capital surcharge framework that was finalized in 2011, but also proposes changes to BCBS’s calculation methodology resulting in significantly higher surcharges for US G-SIBs compared with their global peers. The proposal has not been finalized, and leading experts such a PwC believe it will be finalized in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-g-sib-proposal.pdf|title= G-SIB capital: A look to 2015 |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/g-sib-proposal.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal, which industry experts expect will be finalized in 2015, requires U.S. G-SIBs to hold additional capital (Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA)) equal to the greater of the amount calculated under two methods. The first method is consistent with BCBS’s framework,and calculates the amount of extra capital to be held based on the G-SIB’s size, interconnectedness,cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity. The second method is introduced by the U.S. proposal, and uses similar inputs but replaces the substitutability element with a measure based on a G-SIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding (STWF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-g-sib-proposal.pdf|title= G-SIB capital: A look to 2015 |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/g-sib-proposal.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market-based bank capital regulation ERNs===
Stress testing has limited effectiveness in risk management. Dexia passed the European stress tests in 2011. Two months later it requested a €90 billion bailout guarantee.{{harv|Goldfield|2013}}&lt;ref name="voxeu29aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/market-based-bank-capital-regulation|title=Market-based bank capital regulation|author1=Jeremy Bulow|author2=Jacob Goldfield|author3=Paul Klemperer|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldfield, a former Senior Partner of Goldman Sachs and Economics Professors, Jeremy Bulow at Stanford and Paul Klemperer at Oxford, argue that ''Equity Recourse Notes''' (ERNs), similar in some ways to [[contingent convertible debt]], (CoCos), should be used by all banks rated SIFI, to replace non-deposit existing unsecured debt. "ERNs would be long-term bonds with the feature that any interest or principal payable on a date when the stock price is lower than a pre-specified price would be paid in stock at that pre-specified price."{{harv|Goldfield|2013}}&lt;ref name="voxeu29aug2013" /&gt; Through ERNs, distressed banks would have access to much needed equity as willing investors purchase tranches of ERNs similar to pooling tranches of subprime mortgages. In this case however, the market, not the public takes the risks. Banking can be pro-cyclical by contributing to booms and busts. Stressed banks become reluctant to lend since they are often unable to raise capital equity through new investors.&lt;ref name="FT_Harford28aug2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Markets must force banks, like petulant toddlers, to grow up|author=Tim Harford|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/631f6ce6-0fd1-11e3-a258-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2dMY8rKqf|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harv|Goldfield et al|2013}}&lt;ref name="voxeu29aug2013" /&gt; claim that ERNs would provide a "counterweight against pro-cyclicality."

====Resolution plans====
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for supervision by the Federal Reserve submit resolution plans annually to the Federal Reserve (FRB) and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). Each plan, commonly known as a '''living will''', must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/04/13/business/13reuters-usa-banks.html U.S. Regulators Fail 'Living Wills' at Five of Eight Big Banks] April 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2014 Category 2 firms will be required to submit resolution plans while category 1 firms will submit their 3rd resolution plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-resolution-planning-wave-1.pdf|title= 2014 Resolution planning: The guidance you won’t receive |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/resolution-planning-wave-1.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, April, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution plan requirement under the Dodd Frank Act in Section 165(d), is in addition to the FDIC's requirement of a separate covered insured depository institution ("CIDI") plan for CIDIs of large bank holding companies. The FDIC requires a separate CIDI resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC’s core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., “material entities”), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold. Similar to the assumptions made for resolution plans, the FDIC recently issued assumptions to be made in CIDI plans including the assumption that the CIDI will fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/2014-resolution-plan-cidis.pdf|title= First take: Ten key points from the FDIC’s resolution plan guidance |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/2014-resolution-plan-cidis.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Qualified Financial Contracts=====
When a company enters insolvency (either through bankruptcy or FDIC receivership), an automatic stay is triggered that generally prohibits creditors and counterparties from terminating, offsetting against collateral, or taking any other mitigating action with respect to their outstanding contracts with the insolvent company. However, under US law counterparties to QFCs are exempt from this stay and may usually begin to exercise their contractual rights after the close of business the next day. In case of receivership, the FDIC must decide within this time period whether to transfer the QFC to another institution, retain the QFC and allow the counterparty to terminate it, or repudiate the QFC and pay out the counterparty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.pdf |title= Resolution preparedness: Do you know where your QFCs are? |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, March, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the US Secretary of Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPR”) that would establish new recordkeeping requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts (“QFCs”). The NPR requires US systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”) and certain of their affiliates to maintain specific information electronically on end-of-day QFC positions, and to be able to provide this information to regulators within 24 hours if requested. The NPR is intended to help the FDIC with decision-making by making available detailed information on a failed company’s QFCs, given the FDIC’s expanded receivership powers under Dodd-Frank’s Orderly Liquidation Authority (“OLA”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.pdf |title= Resolution preparedness: Do you know where your QFCs are? |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, March, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-bank entities==
The concept of a systemically important financial institution in the U.S. extends well beyond traditional banks and is often included under the term [[Non-banking financial company]]. It includes large hedge funds and traders, large insurance companies, and various and sundry [[Systemically important financial market utility|systemically important financial market utilities]]. For historical background see [[Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate#Arguments for a systemic risk regulator]]

Regarding which entities will be so designated the [[Dodd-Frank Act of 2010]] contains the following in TITLE I—FINANCIAL STABILITY, Subtitle A—Financial Stability Oversight Council, Sec. 113. ''Authority to require supervision and regulation of certain nonbank financial companies'' (2) considerations:
* the extent of the leverage of the company;
* the extent and nature of the off-balance-sheet exposures of the company;
* the extent and nature of the transactions and relationships of the company with other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies;
* the importance of the company as a source of credit for households, businesses, and State and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the United States financial system;
* the importance of the company as a source of credit for low-income, minority, or underserved communities, and the impact that the failure of such company would have on the availability of credit in such communities;
* the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company, and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse;
* the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the activities of the company;
* the degree to which the company is already regulated by 1 or more primary financial regulatory agencies;
* the amount and nature of the financial assets of the company;
* the amount and types of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding; and
* any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate.

FSOC subsequently issued clarification under [http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Nonbank%20Designations%20-%20Final%20Rule%20and%20Guidance.pdf Final Rule on Authority to Designate Financial Market Utilities as Systemically Important], which includes the following chart recasting the above statutory requirements into a six-category FSOC analytical framework including:

The following are quotes from the FSOC final rule regarding each element of the six factor framework.

'''Interconnectedness'''
Interconnectedness captures direct or indirect linkages between financial companies that may be conduits for the transmission of the effects resulting from a nonbank financial company's material financial distress or activities.

'''Substitutability'''
Substitutability captures the extent to which other firms could provide similar financial services in a timely manner at a similar price and quantity if a nonbank financial company withdraws from a particular market. Substitutability also captures situations in which a nonbank financial company is the primary or dominant provider of services in a market that the Council determines to be essential to U.S. financial stability.

'''Size'''
Size captures the amount of financial services or financial intermediation that a nonbank financial company provides. Size also may affect the extent to which the effects of a nonbank financial company's financial distress are transmitted to other firms and to the financial system.

'''Leverage'''
Leverage captures a company's exposure or risk in relation to its equity capital. Leverage amplifies a company's risk of financial distress in two ways. First, by increasing a company's exposure relative to capital, leverage raises the likelihood that a company will suffer losses exceeding its capital. Second, by increasing the size of a company's liabilities, leverage raises a company's dependence on its creditors' willingness and ability to fund its balance sheet. Leverage can also amplify the impact of a company's distress on other companies, both directly, by increasing the amount of exposure that other firms have to the company, and indirectly, by increasing the size of any asset liquidation that the company is forced to undertake as it comes under financial pressure. Leverage can be measured by the ratio of assets to capital, but it can also be defined in terms of risk, as a measure of economic risk relative to capital. The latter measurement can better capture the effect of derivatives and other products with embedded leverage on the risk undertaken by a nonbank financial company.

'''Liquidity risk and maturity mismatch'''
Liquidity risk generally refers to the risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs, either through its cash flows, maturing assets, or assets salable at prices equivalent to book value, or through its ability to access funding markets. For example, if a company holds assets that are illiquid or that are subject to significant decreases in market value during times of market stress, the company may be unable to liquidate its assets effectively in response to a loss of funding. In order to assess liquidity, the Council may examine a nonbank financial company's assets to determine if it possesses cash instruments or readily marketable securities, such as Treasury securities, which could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of distress. The Council may also review a nonbank financial company's debt profile to determine if it has adequate long-term funding, or can otherwise mitigate liquidity risk. Liquidity problems also can arise from a company's inability to roll maturing debt or to satisfy margin calls, and from demands for additional collateral, depositor withdrawals, draws on committed lines, and other potential draws on liquidity.

A maturity mismatch generally refers to the difference between the maturities of a company's assets and liabilities. A maturity mismatch affects a company's ability to survive a period of stress that may limit its access to funding and to withstand shocks in the yield curve. For example, if a company relies on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions, it will be subject to significant refunding risk that may force it to sell assets at low market prices or potentially suffer through significant margin pressure. However, maturity mismatches are not confined to the use of short-term liabilities and can exist at any point in the maturity schedule of a nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities.

'''Existing regulatory scrutiny'''
The Council will consider the extent to which nonbank financial companies are already subject to regulation, including the consistency of that regulation across nonbank financial companies within a sector, across different sectors, and providing similar services, and the statutory authority of those regulators.

FSB plan to expand the above list also to include G-SII status for the world's largest [[reinsurance|reinsurers]], pending a further development of the G-SII assessment methodology, to be finalized by IAIS in November 2015. The revised G-SII assessment methodology will be applied from 2016.&lt;ref name="FSB list of G-SIIs per Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141106a.pdf|title=2014 update of list of global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs)|format=PDF|publisher=Financial Stability Board|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, IAIS published the first-ever global insurance capital standard entitled ''Basic Capital Requirements (BCR)'', to apply to all group activities (incl. non-insurance activities) of G-SIIs, as a foundation for the ''Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA)'' requirements. Beginning in 2015, the BCR ratio{{#tag:ref|The BCR Ratio is calculated by dividing "Total Qualifying Capital Resources" by "Required Capital", both of which are initially derived from a comparable market adjusted valuation approach using current estimates of insurance liabilities - and both are determined on a consolidated group-wide basis for all financial and material non-financial activities (including all holding companies, insurance legal entities, banking legal entities and any other companies within the group). ''BCR Total Qualifying Capital Resources'' are classified as either core or additional capital. ''BCR Required Capital'' is determined by using a "factor-based" approach with 15 factors applying to defined segments and their specified exposure measures within the main categories of a G-SII’s activity - traditional life insurance, traditional non-life insurance, non-traditional insurance, assets and non-insurance.&lt;ref name="BCR developed by IAIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaisweb.org/view/element_href.cfm?src=1/23745.pdf|title=IAIS Develops Basic Capital Requirements for Global Systemically Important Insurers|format=PDF|publisher=International Association of Insurance Supervisors|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} will be reported on a confidential basis to group-wide supervisors - and be shared with the IAIS for purposes of refining the BCR as necessary. IAIS currently{{when|date=August 2017}} work to develop the methodology for the introduction of HLA requirements, to be published by end-2015, and to be applied starting from January 2019 towards those G-SIIs being identified in November 2017. From January 2019, all G-SIIs will be required to hold capital no lower than the BCR plus HLA. Subjecting insurers to enhanced supervisory oversight is not up to FSB/IAIS, but up to individual jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="FSB list of G-SIIs per Nov 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCR developed by IAIS"/&gt;

When [[MetLife]]—the United States’s largest life insurer—was designated as a systemically important institution in late 2014 by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) which had been established by the [[Dodd-Frank Act]], they challenged the designation as "arbitrary and capricious" in federal court and won. In April 2016 when judge [[Rosemary Collyer]], found in favor of Metlife in a Federal District Court decision, the value of MetLife stocks rose sharply.&lt;ref name="nyt_2016_04_11"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/1SrYa2N | title=Snoopy the Destroyer | publisher=The New York Times | date=11 April 2016 | accessdate=11 April 2016 |first=Paul |last=Krugman}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 2018 a panel of judges on the US Court of Appeals dropped the appeal after the Financial Stability Oversight Council dropped the appeal at the request of the Trump administration.&lt;ref name="wsjjan2318"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clozel|first1=Lalita|title=Court Drops Government’s Appeal of MetLife Case|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/court-drops-governments-appeal-of-metlife-case-1516742046|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsjjan18"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Ryan|title=MetLife Cements Legal Victory in Shedding ‘Systemically Important’ Label|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/metlife-and-fsoc-file-motion-to-dismiss-appeal-in-sifi-litigation-1516325850|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Americas====
{{Main article|Systemically important financial market utility}}

The U.S. government legislation defines the term ''financial market utilities'' (FMU) for other organizations that play a key part in [[financial markets]] such as [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]]s settlement systems.  They are entities whose failure or disruption could threaten the stability of the financial system.

===Asset Managers===

====United States====
It is widely anticipated {{By whom|date=October 2018}} that the Financial Stability Oversight Council will eventually designate certain significant asset managers as nonbank systematically important financial institutions (Nonbank SIFIs).&lt;ref name="pwc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-regulatory-brief-nonbank-sifi-asset-manager.pdf |title= Nonbank SIFIs: Up next, asset managers |website=http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/nonbank-sifi-asset-manager.jhtml |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, October, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSOC recently asked the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) to undertake a study that provides data and analysis on the asset management industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-04-11/pdf/2012-8627.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study analyzed the industry and describes potential threats to U.S. financial stability from vulnerabilities of asset managers.  The study suggested the industry’s activities as a whole make it systemically important and may pose a risk to financial stability. Furthermore, it identified the extent of assets managed by the major industry players. This request for the study is considered by some as a first step in by the FSOC in reviewing the industry and individual player to determine which are systematically important. Once designated as systematically important those entities will be subject to additional oversight and regulatory requirements.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"/&gt;

In 2013, the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research released its report on ''Asset Management and Financial Stability'', the central conclusion was that the activities of the asset management industry as a whole make it systemically important and may pose a risk to US financial stability. Furthermore, in 2014 the Financial Stability Board and the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued the Consultative Document which proposed methodologies for identifying globally active systemically important investment funds. Both reports further the conclusion that is likely the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council will designate a few large US asset managers as systemically important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-dodd-frank-act-nonbank-sifis-asset-management.pdf|title= Nonbank SIFIs: No solace for US asset managers |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/dodd-frank-act-nonbank-sifis-asset-management.jhtml, February, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thomas v. Winchester,''''' 6 N.Y. 397 (1852),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which established the "imminent danger to human life" doctrine, was at the head of the cases in assaulting the protective wall of privity in the tort field. Subsequent examples include: ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'', ''[[Goldberg v. Kollsman Instrument Corp.]]'', and finally, Judge Jones's landmark holding in ''[[Codling v. Paglia]]'', in which the Court demolished what was left of the privity barrier in tort cases by adopting the doctrine of strict products liability.

In ''Thomas v. Winchester'', the Court, departing from the old common law rule in ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'', held that a commercial packager of a poison falsely labeled as harmless medicine, who sold it to a druggist who, in turn, sold it to the plaintiff who then ingested it should be liable for her acute distress. The Court found a way around the lack of privity between the consumer and the packager by adopting the rule that a party who puts falsely labeled poison into the market and thus "puts human life in imminent danger" should respond in damages to the ultimate consumer.

Ryan of the Department of Infrastructure - 29 and 30 MAY 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other rolling stock owned outright.]]

The '''Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010''' ('''the THR Act''') is a law enacted by the Parliament of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], [[Australia]] and is the prime [[statute]] regulating the activities of [[Heritage railway|tourist and heritage rail]] operators in the State.  The [[Act of Parliament|Act]] covers the bulk of Victoria's operational tourist and heritage [[railways]] including many heavy and light rail operations and [[tram]]ways, predominantly in regional areas of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

The Tourist and Heritage Railways Act and the supporting regulations were developed by the [[Transport Legislation Review]] conducted by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]].  The Act was the first dedicated [[statute]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] for the tourist and heritage railways sector (the THR sector) and is also the only dedicated principal [[statute]] for the THR sector in [[Australia]].  The Act was passed in late 2010 and came into force on 1 October 2011.  It replaced provisions regulating the THR sector in the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;This Act was known as the [[Transport Act 1983]] before its title was changed from 1 July 2010 by the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tourist and Heritage Railways Act is part of the transport [[policy]] and [[legislation]] framework in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] headed by the [[Transport Integration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]] - see paragraph (m) in the definition of "transport legislation" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the Act is the Minister for Public Transport, the [[Terry Mulder|Hon Terry Mulder MLA]].

== Outline ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:twi2005a.jpg|thumb|right|SW2 644 operated by the [[Tramway Museum Society of Victoria]] at Trams in the Twilight, Bylands, 25 February 2006.]] --&gt;
The broad purpose of the Act is ".&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;to promote the long term viability of the tourist and heritage railway sector and promote an improvement in the operations of that sector as part of an integrated and sustainable transport system&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act establishes a regulatory scheme with the following key elements:
* development of an '''asset register''' for tourist and heritage assets including state-owned assets&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* provision for new '''lease agreements''' for the state rail assets used by tourist and heritage operators&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* creation of a '''voluntary registration scheme'''&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, Part 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* establishment of a '''Tourist and Heritage Railways Registrar''' and advisory committee.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry background ==
The Tourist and Heritage Railways Act and the background to its development and passage was summarised by Ian Shepherd, Kate Williams and Jenny Gabriele in an article in the Railway Gazette International.&lt;ref name="Ian Shepherd 2012, page 59"&gt;Ian Shepherd, Kate Williams and Jenny Gabriele, Supporting Victoria's Railway Heritage, Railway Gazette International, May 2012, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors noted that "With around 60 tourist and heritage railways or tramways, Australia has more lines per capita that Europe or the USA.  A third of them are in Victoria, where Australia's railway preservation movement started with the formation of the [[Puffing Billy Preservation Society]] in 1955."&lt;ref name="Ian Shepherd 2012, page 59"/&gt;  The tourist and heritage railways sector in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] today consists of organisations which operate, restore and preserve tourist and heritage [[railways]] and [[tram]]ways.  It is estimated that around 3,500 Victorians are actively involved in the industry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], [[Hansard]], [[Legislative Assembly]], 27 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1 January 2011 there were around 22 organisations across the State although only 17 are expected to be subject to the new [[statute]].  The THR [[organisations]] operate in various locations across [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], primarily in regional areas.  The railways attract [[tourism]] and provide economic benefits to the regional areas where they operate with an estimated half a million people visiting the railways each year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The group isalso be regulated by the Tourist and Heritage Railways Act.]]

The Act regulates the majority of the operational tourist and heritage railways in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  To be covered by the Act, a tourist and heritage railway operator must be a not for profit [[organisation]] that provides historical and heritage-related rail services mostly for tourists and mostly in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The following railways are covered by the Act:

Instead, the Puffing Billy Railway is regulated by its own [[statute]], the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/etra1977269/ Emerald Tourist Railway Act 1977].  The [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Tourist and Heritage Railways Act] does also not extend to static rail exhibits such as the [http://www.steamengine.com.au/index.php/contact Williamstown Rail Museum].

== Regulators ==
{{See also|Director, Transport Safety|VicTrack|Director of Public Transport|Public Transport Development Authority}}
The prime regulator of the tourist and heritage railway sector in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the [[Director, Transport Safety]] or Transport Safety Victoria (TSV). The prime regulators of the tourist and heritage railway sector in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are [[VicTrack]] and the [[Public Transport Development Authority]] (trading as Public Transport Victoria).

[[VicTrack]] holds all State owned rail land, infrastructure and assets. [[VicTrack]] leases assets to tourist and heritage railway operators when they are not required for mainstream transport operations and therefore non operational. Public Transport Victoria provides general coordination and support to the THR sector and is a [[regulatory agency|regulator]] under the Act.

=== VicTrack ===
[[File:Mornington Railway Gala Day, February 2007.jpg|300px|thumb|A diesel locomotive operated by the [[Mornington Railway]] crosses Moorooduc Highway in February 2007]]
[[VicTrack]] is established under the [[Transport Integration Act]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]], see section 116.  See generally Division 1 of Part 6 of the Act for provisions relating to [[VicTrack]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is required under that Act to ".&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;provide or enable access to the non-operational transport-related land, infrastructure or assets where this supports the transport system&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;".  [[VicTrack]] is charged with considering providing this access for a variety of reasons including for ".&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;tourist and heritage rail operations&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;." and ".&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;through the granting of leases for business or community purposes&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]], section 120(1)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this function, [[VicTrack]] is required to collaborate with the Secretary of the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]], or more particularly the Public Transport Victoria, in protecting land, infrastructure and [[assets]] which are registered on the Victorian Heritage Register.  [[VicTrack]] must do this ".&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;whilst ensuring that reasonable access is provided for public enjoyment and historical appreciation and that support is provided to tourist and heritage operators&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]], section 120(1)(f).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Registrar ===
Part 2 of the Act provides that the [[Director of Public Transport|Director]] must appoint a person to be the Tourist and Heritage Railway Registrar.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Registrar is the key administrator for the purposes of the Act.   The function of the Registrar is to compile and maintain an [[asset]] register for the sector, a register of [[lease|lease agreements]] granted by [[VicTrack]] and a group register for THR railway groups.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advisory committee ====
[[File:Bellarine-peninsula-railway-no4-steam-loco.jpg|thumb|right|Ex [[Fyansford Cement Works Railway]] steam locomotive No.4 on The Bellarine Railway]]
The Act enables Public Transport Victoria to establish an advisory committee to provide advice to PTV on—
* the voluntary registration scheme for T and H operators; and
* other matters relating to the provision of historical and heritage related rail services.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of members and the composition of the advisory committee is set out in [[regulations]] made under the Act.

== Rail asset register ==
Part 3 of the [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Tourist and Heritage Railways Act] provides for establishment and operation of a tourist and heritage rail asset register.  The broad purpose of the Part is to gather and maintain accurate information about THR assets.  The register is required to be established by Public Transport Victoria and divided into three divisions listing assets owned by the State, assets owned by custodians and assets owned by persons other than the State or the custodian which the owner has elected to include on the register.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remainder of the provisions regulate the information to be included in the register, the form of the register and access, currency and accuracy of information, inspection of assets and the relationship of the register to the separate Victorian Heritage Register established under the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130922195711/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ha199586/ Heritage Act 1995].&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, sections 10 to 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lease agreements ==
Part 4 of the [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Act] sets out a scheme to facilitate the leasing of land and assets by [[VicTrack]] for tourist and heritage railways purposes.  The [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Act] provides power for [[VicTrack]] to grant [[leases]] of land which must include  a range of matters including a description of the land and [[fixture (property law)|fixture]]s, the term of the lease, the amount of rent (if payable), maintenance and [[insurance]] arrangements, subleasing rights or restrictions, reclamation rights and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar provision is made for the leasing of assets and these also require the lease to include certain minimum terms.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Part also imposes a duty on [[VicTrack]] to provide copies of [[leases]] to the Registrar who must keep a register of the agreements and details about duration and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voluntary accreditation scheme ==

Part 5 of the [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Act] provides for a voluntary [[accreditation]] scheme for tourist and heritage railway operators.  Public Transport Victoria is required to establish the scheme and a register known as the Tourist and Heritage Railway Group Register.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 22(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the scheme is to enable operators which meet certain criteria to register in order to demonstrate their commitment to best business practice and continuous improvement and to access programs and initiatives made available under the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 22(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The other provisions in the Part regulate the matters to be recorded in the register, applications for registration, registration itself, changes of details, removal from the register and rights of review to the [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] concerning decisions made by the Registrar.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, sections 23 to 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other notable provisions ==
The [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Act] contains two general provisions in Part 6.  The first provision confirms that THR operators are not required to fence [[railways]] or contribute to fencing costs and that operators are not liable for any damage which may be caused by the railway not being fenced.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining and final provision in the [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Act]&lt;ref&gt;Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, section 31.&lt;/ref&gt; confers power on the [[Governor in Council]] to make [[regulations]] to support the [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Act] including in relation to the asset register, criteria for registration on the group register, fees for registration, safety in connection with TH railways, powers of THR operators, conduct requirements, trespassing and interference with equipment, fixtures and other things.

{{See also|Transport Legislation Review}}
The development of the proposal for the [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Tourist and Heritage Railways Act] was managed by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] in Victoria as part of its  [[Transport Legislation Review]] project.&lt;ref name="Ian Shepherd 2012, page 59"/&gt;

The Department commenced the process by holding an inter Government agency workshop in June 2008 followed by workshops with the THR sector in August of that year.  This was followed by a period of research and policy development leading into further workshops and target consultation with the industry in April 2010 where new regulatory concepts were outlined in detail.  Ultimately, the proposal for a new regulatory scheme for the tourist and heritage railways sector was presented to the [[Victorian Parliament]] as proposed [[legislation]] in late July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shepherd, Kate Williams and Jenny Gabriele, Supporting Victoria's Railway Heritage, Railway Gazette International, May 2012, page 59 - 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parliamentary approval ==

=== Introduction ===
The [http://kirra.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_act/tahra201079o2010363/ Tourist and Heritage Railways Act] was introduced into the upper house of the [[Victorian Parliament]], the [[Legislative Council]], as the Tourist and Heritage Railways Bill 2010.  The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the proposal was the Minister for Public Transport, the [[Martin Pakula|Hon Martin Pakula MLC]].  The [[Justin Madden|Hon Justin Madden MLC]], the Minister for Planning, moved the second reading of the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] on 27 July 2010 on behalf of the Public Transport Minister.

==== Second reading speech ====
[[File:R711 Steamrail Open Day 2007.jpg|thumb| '''[[Steamrail Victoria]]''' is a not-for-profit volunteer group established in 1965 to the restore and operate historic [[locomotive]]s and rolling stock used on the [[Rail transport in Victoria|railways in Victoria]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition to operating [[railfan]] special trains and charters for private groups, the group also operates special steam trains in the [[Melbourne]] suburban area. The picture shows Victorian Railways R class locomotive R 711 on display at the Steamrail Victoria Open Day weekend alongside preserved Victorian Railways L class electric locomotive and a swing door suburban train on 12 March 2007. ]]

The Minister set the context for the Bill in his second [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] speech in support of the Bill as follows:

::"The Bill is aligned to the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act's]] new vision and shared objectives for transport in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. This vision is one of an integrated and [[sustainable]] transport system. A sustainable transport system works to secure ongoing economic, social and environmental benefits for the state. It must promote social outcomes and economic prosperity. The transport system should also support the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.

::The tourist and heritage railway sector makes vital and significant contributions in these areas. Victoria's tourist and heritage railways positively contribute to community spirit and conserve Victoria's [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] for future generations.  The groups provide a foundation for local and regional community involvement and make major contributions, both directly and indirectly, to community wellbeing. The railways also attract local, regional and international [[tourism]], benefiting local [[business]] and [[employment]].

::The Bill renews and modernises [[legislation]] applying to the tourist and heritage rail sector to ensure the sector is equipped to make these social and economic contributions both now and in the future. The groups that comprise the sector are diverse, but all groups within the scope of this Bill share common characteristics. They are active rail operators with strong heritage objectives, and they attract patronage from tourists and visitors. Indeed, tourist and heritage railways attract more than half a million visitors each year, bringing clear [[economic]] value to the State. Their operations run under not-for-profit organisational structures and revenue from visitors is of primary importance. Typically, the groups draw heavily on [[volunteering|volunteers]]. They also rely on [[donations]], Government grants and external funding for capital projects as well as for day-to-day activities.

::Tourist and heritage rail operators keenly restore, preserve and operate heritage and other unique types of trains and trams. Approximately 3500 people are actively engaged in operational rail and tram preservation activities in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]—as [[employees]], as members and as volunteers. The sector's story, collectively, is one of success. Victorians can be justly proud of their tourist and heritage railways and the social, economic and cultural benefits they bring to the State.

::"This Bill supports these important not-for-profit groups to promote their ongoing viability. Entities that operate historical or heritage-related rail and [[tram]] services primarily as a [[tourist]] activity are given new settings under the Bill. This includes better arrangements relating to land and [[asset]] use, and access to a voluntary registration scheme that will promote improved performance and [[business]] practices.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Debate and passage ===
The Tourist and Heritage Railways Bill was strongly supported by the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] parties and other members during its passage through the [[Victorian Parliament]].

==== Upper house ====
The lead Liberal Party speaker in the first house of passage the [[Legislative Council]], David Koch MLC, observed that—

::This is a common-sense Bill that corrects and ties up many loose ends for these small rail operations, which will now have their own advisory group and great support from the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] in undertaking what I think is seen collectively as an important part of the tourism industry and of preserving our history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], [[Hansard]], [[Legislative Council]], 12 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was passed by the [[Legislative Council]] on 12 August 2010 after a short debate and introduced into the [[lower house]], the [[Legislative Assembly]], on the same day.

==== Lower house ====
[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|The Bill which became the Tourist and Heritage Railways Act was considered by the [[Victorian Parliament]] between late July and early October 2010. The proposal was strongly supported by all parties.  The Act is the only dedicated Act applying to the tourist and heritage railways sector in any [[Australia]]n State.]]

Support from the Opposition parties for the Bill was equally strong in the [[Legislative Assembly]].  The lead speaker in the [[Legislative Assembly]], the then Shadow Transport Minister and now the Minister for Public Transport in the [[Victorian Government]], [[Terry Mulder|Terry Mulder MP]], commented that—

::"The Bill comes about as a result of the tourist and heritage [[railway]] operators, the manner in which their organisations were functioning and the fact that they were looking for a significant level of support in terms of viability and ongoing operation for their visitors. They provide a great [[tourist attraction]] here in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in promoting the heritage of our [[railway]] networks, and it is commendable that the Government has picked up this issue and decided to throw its support behind these organisations, many of which are run by volunteers and people who are absolutely passionate about [[trains]] and particularly passionate about some of the older trains that were on the tracks hauling [[passengers]] on our [[railway]] network in the very early years.

'''VinylPlus''' was founded by the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM), the European Stabiliser Producers Association (ESPA), European Plasticisers and the European Plastics Converters (EuPC) in 2011 when the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] industry renewed a previous initiative called Vinyl 2010. VinylPlus is a ten-year, industry-wide voluntary commitment to develop more ecologically responsible ways to produce, use and recycle PVC. The programme aligns with the principles and targets of the [[United Nations|UN]]’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and the [[circular economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=91|title=VinylPlus - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VinylPlus includes all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters and recyclers. It covers the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland.

VinylPlus is included in the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] Registry of Commitments, and is a member of the Green Industry Platform, the global partnership led by the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)]] and the United Nations Environment Platform Programme (UNEP). VinylPlus is also registered as a partner on the UN Partnerships for SDGs platform where it is recognised as fulfilling the SMART criteria. 

== History ==
VinylPlus succeeded Vinyl 2010, which was the European PVC industry’s first voluntary commitment. Vinyl 2010 was set up in 2000 around the principles of [[Responsible Care]] adopted by the European chemicals industry in the 1980s . Its programme aimed to shift the PVC industry to a more sustainable model by improving recycling and substituting hazardous additives.

At the same time, the [[European Union]] also started addressing environmental concerns about plastics, notably developing the [[Waste framework directive|Waste Framework Directive]] (EU Directive 2008/98/EC), which laid down key EU recycling rules.

Vinyl 2010 also set up a monitoring committee, which was kept upon the creation of VinylPlus. The committee was designed as an independent verification of the programme’s activities, and includes representatives from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], trade unions, consumer associations, academia and members of the European 

== Progress Report ==
VinylPlus publishes an annual Progress Report summarising progress and data. Progress is measured against each of the five sustainability challenges identified for PVC. All information included in the report is presented to the Monitoring Committee and independently audited by third parties.

== Product Label ==
The VinylPlus Product Label was launched in 2018 as an identification tool.

== Recycling ==
One aspect of the programme is to Improve recycling figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vinylplus.eu/recycling/circular-economy|title=VinylPlus - The Circular Economy|website=vinylplus.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum ==
VinylPlus organises an annual forum: The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum. The first one took place in Istanbul in 2013. The event aims to encourage dialogue on sustainability by assembling representatives from the PVC industry, policy makers, consumer groups, retailers, architects, designers, recyclers and NGOs.  The themes from past forums have been:

* 2013: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth for Europe and Beyond
* 2014: Enhancing the Value of Partnerships
* 2015: More Vinyl, Less Carbon
* 2016: Smart Vinyl For Our Cities
* 2017: Towards Circular Economy
* 2018: Meeting Societal Needs

== Governance ==
VinylPlus’s management Board represents all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters. The Monitoring Committee offers guidance and advice, while ensuring an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the Voluntary Commitment. The Monitoring Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry. The Monitoring Committee’s stated goal is to ensure VinylPlus’s transparency, participation and accountability. 

== Affiliates ==
==== Recovinyl ====
The Recovinyl  programme was set up in 2003 as part of Vinyl 2010’s commitment. Its original mission was to advance waste collection and recycling schemes. When the Vinyl 2010 programme ended, it was given a dual role under the new VinylPlus initiative. While Recovinyl still encourages PVC recycling, it also aims to optimise resource efficiency by acting as an intermediary between recyclers and converters.

==== Vinyl Foundation ==== 
The Vinyl Foundation is the non-profit organisation that manages the funds from the European PVC product manufacturers, compounders and raw material traders that support VinylPlus.
