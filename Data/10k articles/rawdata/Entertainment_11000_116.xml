'''''13th''''' is a 2016 American documentary by director [[Ava DuVernay]]. The film explores the "intersection of race, justice, and mass incarceration in the United States;"&lt;ref name="dargis"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/movies/13th-review-ava-duvernay.html Manohla Dargis, "Review: ‘13TH,’ the Journey From Shackles to Prison Bars"], ''The New York Times'', September 29, 2016. Retrieved February 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; it is titled after the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which freed the slaves and prohibited slavery, with the exception of slavery as punishment for a crime.

DuVernay contends that slavery has been perpetuated in practices since the end of the American Civil War through such actions as criminalizing behavior and enabling police to arrest poor [[freedmen]] and force them to work for the state under [[convict leasing]]; suppression of African Americans by [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], [[lynching]]s and [[Jim Crow]]; politicians declaring a [[war on drugs]] that weigh more heavily on minority communities and, by the late 20th century, [[mass incarceration]] of people of color in the United States. She examines the [[prison-industrial complex]] and the emerging detention-industrial complex, demonstrating how much money is being made by corporations from such incarcerations.

''13th'' has garnered acclaim from film critics. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]], and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special]] at the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oscar Nominations |url=http://oscar.go.com/nominees |website=The Oscars |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=January 24, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DZOQ92zN?url=http://oscar.go.com/nominees |archivedate=January 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film begins with an audio clip of former President Barack Obama stating that the US has 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the world's prisoners. This film features several prominent activists, academics, politicians from "both sides of the aisle," and public figures, such as [[Angela Davis]], [[Bryan Stevenson]], [[Van Jones]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Cory Booker]], [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/the-13th-trailer-ava-duvernay-netflix-prison-race|title=The 13th: inside Ava DuVernay's Netflix prison documentary on racial inequality|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|date=September 26, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=February 16, 2017|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It deeply explores the economic history of slavery and post-Civil War racist legislation and practices that replaced it as "systems of racial control" and forced labor from the years after the abolition of slavery to the present. Southern states criminalized minor offenses, arresting freedmen and forcing them to work when they could not pay fines; institutionalizing this approach as [[convict leasing]] (which created an incentive to criminalize more behavior). They [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] across the South at the turn of the 20th century, excluding them from the political system (including juries), at the same time that [[lynching]] of blacks by white mobs reached a peak in these decades. In addition to such violence, [[Jim Crow]] legislation was passed by Democrats to legalize segregation and suppress minorities, forcing them into second-class status. Following the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s that restored civil rights, the film notes the Republican Party's appeal to southern white conservatives, including the claim to be the party to fight the war on crime and war on drugs, which began to include mandatory, lengthy sentencing. A new wave of minority suppression began, reaching African Americans and others in the northern, mid-western and western cities where many had migrated in earlier decades. After their presidential candidates lost to Republicans, Democratic politicians such as [[Bill Clinton]] joined the war on drugs.

As a result, from the early 1970s to the present, the rate of incarceration and the number of people in prisons has climbed dramatically in the United States, although the rate of crime has continued to decline since the late 20th century. As late as the 2016 presidential election, certain politicians worked to generate fear of crime, claiming high rates in New York City, for instance, which was not true. The documentary says crime lower overall than it has been in decades, but Republican candidates are said to have raised it to create fear. Private prison contractors had entered the market to satisfy demand as arrests and sentences increased, forming an independent group with its own economic incentives to criminalize minor activities and lengthen sentences in order to keep prisons full. Politicians and businessmen in rural areas encouraged construction of prisons to supply local jobs, and they also have had incentives to keep prisons full.

Decades later, studies have shown that private prisons are no more efficient and are often more abusive than those run by the federal or state governments. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The federal [[Bureau of Prisons]] announced in 2016 its intention to stop contracting with private providers for prison services. The over-incarceration of adults has severely damaged generations of black and minority families and their children.

The film explores the role of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], backed by corporations, that has provided Republican state and federal legislators with draft legislation to support the prison-industrial complex. Only after some of the relationships were revealed did corporations like [[Wal-Mart]] and others receive criticism and drop out of the organization. Many businesses continue to make huge profits from prisons, including [[Securus_Technologies|Securus]], which provides telephone services at high rates and [[Aramark]] which provides food services that are substandard. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The film explores the demonization of minority poor through these decades to serve political ends, contributing to unrealistic fears of minorities by whites and to persistent problems of police brutality against minority communities. In the 21st century, the regularity of fatal police shootings of unarmed minorities in apparently minor confrontations has been demonstrated by videos taken by bystanders and by the increasing use of cams in police cars or worn by officers; DuVernay ends the film with a graphic procession of recent videos of fatal shootings of blacks by police, what Manohla Dargis describes as, after the previous discussion, having the effect of "a piercing, keening cry."&lt;ref name="dargis"/&gt;

==Production==
The film was written by [[Ava DuVernay]], who wrote and directed [[Selma (film)|''Selma'']] (2015), and [[Spencer Averick]]. Averick also edited the film. Produced and filmed in secrecy, ''13th'' was revealed only after it was announced as the opening film for the [[2016 New York Film Festival]], the first documentary ever to open the festival.&lt;ref name="lockett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Gordon|title=2016 New York Film Festival to Open With Ava DuVernay Documentary ‘The 13th’|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/new-york-film-festival-2016-opening-night-1201817239/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film was released on October 7, 2016 on [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="lockett"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lockett|first1=Dee|title=Ava DuVernay’s The 13th Will Be the First Documentary to Ever Open the New York Film Festival|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/ava-duvernay-documentary-the-13th-to-open-nyff.html|date=July 19, 2016|publisher=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companion piece ''13th: A Conversation with [[Oprah Winfrey]] &amp; [[Ava DuVernay]]'' was released on January 26, 2017 in the United States and on January 31, 2017 worldwide on the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/01/ava-duvernay-oprah-winfrey-discuss-13th-netflix-special-clip-1201773438/|title=13TH: A Conversation with Oprah Winfrey &amp; Ava DuVernay Clip|website=IndieWire|last=Calvario|first=Liz|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''13th'' strikes at the heart of America's tangled racial history, offering observations as incendiary as they are calmly controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/13th |title=13th (2016) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/13th |title=13th reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised what she called the power of DuVernay's film and its meticulous marshaling of facts. She says, summarizing the film: "The United States did not just criminalize a select group of black people. It criminalized black people as a whole, a process that, in addition to destroying untold lives, effectively transferred the guilt for slavery from the people who perpetuated it to the very people who suffered through it."&lt;ref name="dargis"/&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film four stars and named it one of the best films of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/20-best-movies-of-2016-w452453/zootopia-w453614|title=20 Best Movies of 2016|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amusement Today''''' is a monthly periodical that features articles, news, pictures and reviews about all things relating to the [[amusement park]] industry, including parks, [[List of amusement rides|rides]], and ride manufacturers. The trade newspaper, which is based in [[Arlington, Texas]], United States, was founded in January 1997 by Gary Slade, Virgil E. Moore III and Rick Tidrow.&lt;ref name=AT4_11&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1997 | title = Sale of Amusement Today Inc. completed | journal = Amusement Today | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, ''Amusement Today'' won the Impact Award in the services category for "Best New Product" from the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] (IAAPA). A year later, in 1998, the magazine founded the '''Golden Ticket Awards''', for which it has become best known for throughout the amusement park industry. On January 2, 2001, Slade bought out his two partners, giving him sole ownership of the paper.&lt;ref name=AT4_11/&gt; The paper has two full-time and two part-time staff members at its Arlington office, along with two full-time writers and several freelance writers in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://amusementtoday.com/contact-us-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Aquarion Evol'''''|アクエリオンEVOL|Akuerion Evoru}} is the sequel to the 2005 anime series ''[[Genesis of Aquarion]]''. It was originally announced on February 25, 2011, by the production staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/aqevol/entry-10811572924.html|title=アクエリオンEVOL発表！｜アクリオンEVOL STAFF BLOG|date=2011-02-25|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from January to June, 2012 and its premiere featured an hour-long special that combined the first two episodes in a single broadcast. [[Funimation]] has licensed the anime in North America.

The story is set in the same universe as the original ''[[Genesis of Aquarion]]'', and takes place twelve thousand years after. The protagonists live on a planet called Vega, while most of the antagonists originate from its "sister planet", Altair. The main character, Amata Sora, a young man that has kept his ability to fly a secret since youth, meets a girl named Mikono Suzushiro, and they become fast friends. However, invaders from Altair begin large-scale attacks against Vega, forcing Amata and Mikono into a long battle for the planet as members of an organization called Neo-DEAVA. There they, along with other young men and women called Elements who also possess special powers, are recruited to pilot giant robots called Aquaria in the defense of Vega.

Like the original, the themes of love, mutual understanding, and individual growth play an important role in the story, albeit in different ways. For example, a prohibition on romance is enacted on the members of Neo-DEAVA for the duration of the series. The main characters are again reincarnations of the legendary beings described in ''Aquarion'', and much of the latter half of the series works to establish connections with the series' predecessor.

==Plot summary==
{{main|List of Aquarion Evol characters}}
Twelve thousand years after the events of ''[[Genesis of Aquarion]]'', mankind living on the planet {{nihongo|Vega|ヴェーガ|Vēga}} is threatened by a new enemy from the planet {{nihongo|Altair|アルテア界|Arutea Kai}} whose female population was wiped out by a mysterious disease called the {{nihongo|Curse of Eve|イヴの呪い|Ivu no Noroi}}. The Alteans using their "Abductors", just like the Shadow Angels, invade the cities in Vega to kidnap its female inhabitants, looking for a way to ensure the preservation of their race.

To defend against the invasion, the {{nihongo|Neo-DEAVA|ネオ・ディーバ|Neo Dība}} organization establishes two teams, one composed of only males and other of only females, each one piloting their own giant machines called "Aquaria". To protect their new friend Mikono, teenager Amata Sora makes use of the power he has kept in secret his entire life and by combining Vectors with male and female pilots into one single robot, the legendary giant Aquarion is reborn.

==Themes==

Aquarion EVOL, while a giant robot show at heart, focuses mostly on the characters and character development. Of its many themes, that of love is the most prominent. The restriction placed on the members of Neo-DEAVA that forbids love at the same time permits a real development in the characters' relationships from infatuation and teen romance to love. It also presents a different view of love held by characters of Altair, whose perceptions of it are warped by the current state of their planet - that of the complete extinction of women. The theme of love is explored further in a few other examples, such as a character from Neo-DEAVA and an Altair spy growing very attached to each other, and another character being forced to examine his own feelings after his love interest is transformed into a man. Overall, love and relationships between characters lead to them being able to at least partially understand each other.

While not as big a theme as romantic love in the series, family relationships are also explored. Three of the main characters - Amata, Mikono, and MIX - all have strained relationships with parents for various reasons, and each is forced to come to terms with what those relationships have produced. Amata's feeling of abandonment, Mikono's feelings of shyness, and MIX's moral opposition to her father's behavior are all explored through the relationships they have with each other.

As in the original ''Aquarion'', reincarnation of people of myth and legend is a major theme. However, the series repeatedly undermines assumptions made by the viewers, especially those that have watched the original series. The many plot twists regarding the identity of the characters' reincarnations are brought to a head during their final battle.

==Production==

Many staff members from the original ''Aquarion'' were brought back to work on this series; however, as the director Kawamori wished to create a series that didn't require viewers to have seen the original, many themes were reworked.

The main character designs were split between two designers: Chinatsu Kurahana, who worked on the male characters, and Ishida Kana, who was in charge of the female ones.

'''''Arcania: Fall of Setarrif''''' is the standalone expansion for ''[[Arcania: Gothic 4]]''. It was released on October 25, 2011 after a long period of silence from both publishers and after being delayed indefinitely in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgwatch.com/#18159 |title=RPGWatch |publisher= |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923172559/http://www.rpgwatch.com/#18159 |archivedate=23 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced by [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[JoWooD Entertainment|JoWooD]] on December 9, 2010.

==Plot==
''Arcania: Fall of Setarrif'' ties up the loose ends of the main game's story and adds yet another chapter to the epic tale. After the demon that possessed King Rhobar III was exorcised, it made its way to Setarrif to find a new host. In Setarrif, which is cut off from the rest of the island, chaos and anarchy spread rapidly.

King Rhobar III is troubled by these facts and is afraid of losing the city and some of his companions, which are in Setarrif at that very moment. The nameless hero therefore is sent by the king and must journey to Setarrif but he has no idea of what lies before him.

===Overview===
A new threat casts its shadow over the Southern Isles. A mysterious demon, consumed by hatred, terrifies the population and pools his force against the coastal city of Setarrif. The dramatic situation exacerbates after a volcanic eruption in the mountains nearby. Thereupon the nameless hero joins forces with his strongest allies and courageously faces the new menace.

==Development==
The development of the addon started around mid 2010, although it was planned earlier in the development of ''[[Arcania: Gothic 4]]''. With the current financial problems of the publisher, no other details have been revealed regarding the development of the game. JoWooD's community manager announced on one of the fansites that the debut trailer will be available in March 2011.

On March 3, 2011, [[JoWooD Entertainment]] released the official website and first trailer for the addon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcania-game.com/addon1/|title=Arcania - Fall of Setarrif - News|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2011, [[JoWooD Entertainment]] announced that the expansion has been delayed indefinitely because of legal issues with BVT Games Fund III.

However, on September 21, 2011, the new publisher, Nordic Games, announced that the add-on will be available on October 25, 2011 for Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spawnpoint.com/news/33232/Arcania_Fall_Of_Setarrif |title=SpawnPoint - Where Gaming Begins |publisher= |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401214928/http://www.spawnpoint.com/news/33232/Arcania_Fall_Of_Setarrif |archivedate=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">'''"Assume a can opener"''' is a [[catchphrase]] used to mock [[economist]]s and other theorists who base their conclusions on impractical or unlikely assumptions. The phrase "takes aim at how economists use assumptions to simplify—and sometimes oversimplify—the problems they face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankiw|first=N. Gregory|title=Macroeconomics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UT64rsFG1b0C&amp;pg=PA238 |edition=7th|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=1-4292-1887-8|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be used to express the writer's disdain for "the propensity of modern economic theory for unjustified and oversimplified assumptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaletsky|first=Anatole|title=Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tddtKDXru4cC&amp;pg=PA156 |year=2010|publisher=Public Affairs, a member of the Perseus Books Group|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-871-0|page=156|chapter=11 "There is no can opener"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
It derives from a joke which dates to at least 1970 and possibly originated with British economists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Popik]]: ''[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/assume_you_have_a_can_opener_economics_joke_about_opening_a_food_can “Assume you have a can opener” (economics joke about opening a food can)].'' In: ''The Big Apple.'' December 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The first book mentioning it is likely ''Economics as a Science'' (1970) by [[Kenneth E. Boulding]]:&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Boulding: ''Economics as a Science.'' McGraw-Hill, 1970, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a story that has been going around about a physicist, a chemist, and an economist who were stranded on a desert island with no implements and a can of food. The physicist and the chemist each devised an ingenious mechanism for getting the can open; the economist merely said, "Assume we have a can opener"!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase was popularized in a 1981 book and has become sufficiently well known that many writers on economic topics use it as a catchphrase without further explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/08/first-assume-can-opener|title=First, Assume a Can Opener.....|last=Drum|first=Kevin|date=August 18, 2010|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/11/monetary-policy-5|title=Monetary policy: First, assume a can-opener|date=November 28, 2012|work=The Economist|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of usage==
The joke and its application to economists were taken up in the 1981 book ''Paper Money'' by "Adam Smith" ([[pseudonym]] of [[George Goodman]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/books/bullish-about-the-system.html|title=Bullish about the system|last=Silk|first=Leonard|date=March 22, 1981|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he applied the story to the then-tendency of economists to assume that [[inflation]] would go away, and mocked the notion that economists are "the high priests of this esoteric mystery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PylGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8NAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6867,2372868&amp;dq=assume-a-can-opener&amp;hl=en|title=Straight talk given on economic mess|date=March 28, 1981|work=Daily Times|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, he asks "why the economists are always wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/09/books/books-of-the-times-books-of-the-times.html|title=Books of the Times: Review of Paper Money by Adam Smith|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Christopher|date=March 9, 1981|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "assume a can opener" became "his nagging accusation against the deductive logic and analytical [[economic model|models]] of economists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/books/bullish-about-the-system.html|title=Bullish about the system|last=Silk|first=Leonard|date=March 22, 1981|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian finance minister [[Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa]] used the phrase in 2006 to illustrate that "Very often, when economists comment, they assume politics away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C1EFC385A0C778EDDA80994DE404482|title=High and low finance: Temptations of a minister of finance|last=Norris|first=Floyd|date=November 24, 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in Australia to describe "a [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] who has lost all touch with reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/terry-mccranns-column/swans-speech-a-laugh-a-minute/story-e6frfig6-1226071313597|title=Swan's speech a laugh a minute|last=McCrann|first=Terry|author2=Herald-Sun|date=June 8, 2011|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and politicians "assuming away" the problem of getting a global [[greenhouse gas]] deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/doing-nothing-as-preferable-to-this/story-e6frg6zo-1226014408604|title=Doing nothing is preferable to this|last=Carmody|first=Geoff|date=March 2, 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in India to describe [[Sino-American relations|American economic policy toward China]].&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/04/05/idINIndia-56134720110405|title=Easy money will keep pressure on commodities|last=Kemp|first=John|date=April 5, 2011|work=Reuters India|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been extended beyond economics to describe diplomats and negotiators working toward peace in the [[Middle East]], who have "attempted to build confidence among the warring parties as if the conflict were just a big misunderstanding" and who "assumed leaders who did not exist, as a way to conjure a preferable reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EE5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oPQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4988,1702377&amp;dq=assume-a-can-opener&amp;hl=en|title=Peace Processing 101|last=May|first=Cliff|date=February 17, 2009|work=Gettysburg Times|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also sometimes applied to models in other fields as well such as the social sciences where certain problems are solved based on unrealistic assumptions.

In the context of [[broadcasting]], '''backhaul''' refers to uncut program content that is transmitted [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] to an individual [[television station]] or [[radio station]], [[broadcast network]] or other receiving entity where it will be integrated into a finished [[TV show]] or [[radio show]]. The term is independent of the medium being used to send the backhaul, but [[communications satellite]] transmission is very common. When the medium is satellite, it is called a [[wildfeed]].

Backhauls are also referred to sometimes as "[[Clean feed (TV)|clean feeds]]", being "clean" in the sense that they lack any of the [[post-production]] elements that are added later to the feed's content (i.e. [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen graphic]]s, [[voice-overs]], [[bumper (media)|bumpers]], etc.) during the integration of the backhaul feed into a finished show.  In live [[sports]] production, a backhaul is used to obtain live game [[footage]] (usually for later repackaging in highlights shows) when an off-air source is not readily available. In this instance the feed that is being obtained contains all elements except for [[TV commercial]]s or [[radio ad]]s run by the host network's [[master control]]. This is particularly useful for obtaining live coverage of post-game press conferences or extended game highlights ("melts"), since the backhaul may stay up to feed these events after the network has concluded their broadcast.

[[Electronic news gathering]], including "live via satellite" [[interview]]s, [[reporter]]s' [[live shot]]s, and [[sporting event]]s are all examples of [[radio]] or [[television]] content that is backhauled to a station or network before being made available to the public through that station or network.  [[Cable TV]] channels, particularly [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) along with ([[Public-access television|local origination]]) channels, may also backhauled to [[cable headend]]s before making their way to the subscriber.  Finished [[Network affiliate|network]] feeds are not considered backhauls, even if [[local insertion]] is used to modify the content prior to final transmission.

There exists a dedicated group of enthusiasts who use [[TVRO]] (TV receive-only) gear such as [[big ugly dish]]es or "BUDs" to peek in on backhaul signals that are available on any of the dozens of [[broadcast satellite]]s that are visible from almost any point on Earth. In its early days, their hobby was strengthened by the fact that most backhaul was [[analog (signal)|analog]] and "[[in the clear]]" (unscrambled or unencrypted) which made for a vast smorgasbord of free television available for the technically inclined amateur. In recent years, full-time content and cable channels have added [[encryption]] and [[conditional access]], and occasional signals are steadily becoming [[digital broadcasting|digital]], which has had a deleterious effect on the hobby.

Some digital signals remain [[free-to-air|freely accessible]] (sometimes using [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] dishes as small as one meter) under the international [[DVB-S]] standard or the US [[Motorola]]-proprietary [[Digicipher]] system. The small dishes may either be fixed (much like [[direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] antennas), positioned using a [[electric motor|rotor]] (usually [[DiSEqC]]-standard) or may be [[toroid]]al in design (twin toroidal [[Reflector (antenna)|reflector]]s focus the incoming signal as a line, not a point, so that multiple [[Low-noise block converter|LNB]]s may receive signal from multiple satellites). A "blind-search" receiver is often used to try every possible combination of frequency and [[bitrate]] to search for backhaul signals on individual communication satellites.

==Documentaries containing backhauled content==
The 1992 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Feed'' &lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0104244|title=Feed}}&lt;/ref&gt; was compiled almost entirely using unedited backhaul from [[political campaign]] coverage by local and network television.  A similar documentary about the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 U.S. presidential election]] named ''[[Spin (documentary)|Spin]]'' was made in the same way in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In classical [[tragedies]], the '''catastasis''' (pl. ''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], the '''catastasis''' is that part of a speech, usually the [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], in which the orator sets forth the subject matter to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not a classical one; it was invented by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Scaliger]] in his ''Poetics'' (published posthumously in 1561).&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Walker, ''Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961-1991'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002: {{ISBN|0-8240-6697-9}}), p. 639; Scaliger wrote: "catastasis est vigor ac status fabulae, in qua res miscetur in ea fortunae tempestate, in quam subducta est."&lt;/ref&gt; It "is more or less equivalent to the ''summa epitasis'' of Donatus and Latomus and to what Willichius sometimes called the ''extrema epitasis'',"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin T. Herrick, ''Comic Theory in the Sixteenth Century'' (University of Illinois Press, 1950), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used in 1616 in England.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N.

The '''cha-cha-chá''', or simply '''cha-cha''' in the U.S., is a [[dance]] of [[Cuba]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 1944. ''Cuban music from A to Z''. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giro, Radamés 2007. ''Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en South Korea''. La Habana. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; It  is danced to [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|the music of the same name]] introduced by Cuban composer and violinist [[Enrique Jorrin]] in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the [[danzón-mambo]]. The name of the dance is an [[onomatopoeia]] derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet.&lt;ref&gt;Jorrín, Enrique 1971. Origen ddwadel chachachá. ''Signos 3'' Vil esparza, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:Cha start.JPG|thumb|Cha start|thumb|right|250px|Cha-cha rhythm]]

In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorrín worked as a violinist and composer with the [[charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] group [[Orquesta América]]. The group performed at dance halls in [[Havana]] where they played [[danzón]], danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-orientated crowds. Jorrín noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danzón-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorrín began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less [[syncopation|syncopated]].&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio. 1981. Diccionario de la Música Cubana. La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. {{ISBN|959-10-0048-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Orquesta América performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a [[triple step]] in their footwork producing the sound "cha-cha-cha". Thus, the new style came to be known as "cha-cha-chá" and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Coll, Israel (February 8, 2006). "Enrique Jorrín". Conexión Cubana. Retrieved 2007-01-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-chá (two, three, cha-cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the [[Santería]] religion. For example, one of the steps used in the dance for the [[orisha]] [[Ogun]] uses an identical footwork pattern. These Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of cha-cha-chá and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s, especially those of African origin.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette (2004) Cuba and its Music, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the footwork of the cha-cha-chá was likely inspired by these Afro-Cuban dances.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer (2013)The Artistry of Afro-Cuban Bata Drumming Aesthetics, transmission, Bonding, and creativity&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Orquesta América released two of Jorrin’s compositions, "[[La Engañadora]]" and "Silver Star", on the Cuban record label [[Panart]]. These were the first cha-cha-chá compositions ever recorded. They immediately became hits in Havana, and other Cuban charanga orchestras quickly imitated this new style. Soon, there was a cha-cha-chá craze in Havana’s dance halls, popularizing both the music and the associated dance. This craze soon spread to [[Mexico City]], and by 1955 the music and dance of the cha cha cha had become popular in Latin America, the United States, and Western Europe, following in the footsteps of the [[mambo (dance)|mambo]], which had been a worldwide craze a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette (2007) 'The Kingsmen and the cha cha cha.;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Cha-cha-chá is danced to authentic [[Cuban music]], although in ballroom competitions it is often danced to [[Latin Pop]] or [[Rock en español|Latin Rock]]. The music for the [[Ballroom dance|international ballroom]] cha-cha-chá is energetic and with a steady beat. The music may involve complex [[polyrhythm]]s.

[[File:Dance reedit 2.webm|right|thumb|A cha-cha-cha dance video]]

Styles of cha-cha-chá dance may differ in the place of the [[Glossary of ballroom dance terms#Chasse|chasse]] in the rhythmical structure.&lt;ref&gt;Cuban rhythms are usually scored in 2/4 time, whereas in North America the music would typically be scored in 4/4. This does not affect the sense of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha count is "two, three, chachacha", "four-and-one, two, three" or "one, two, three, chacha". The dance does not start on the first beat of a bar, though it can start with a transfer of weight to the lead's right.&lt;ref name="Laird 2003"&gt;Laird, Walter 2003. ''The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing''. International Dance Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, many social dancers count "one, two, cha-cha-cha" and may find it difficult to make the adjustment to the correct timing of the dance, "two, three, cha-cha, one".

=== Pattern ===
The basic pattern involves the lead (usually the man) taking a [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Check|checked]] forward step with the left foot, [[partial weight transfer|retaining some weight]] on the right foot.  The knee of the right leg must stay bent and close to the back of the left knee, the left leg having straightened just prior to receiving part weight. This step is taken on the second beat of the bar. Full weight is returned to the right leg on the second step (beat three).

The fourth beat is split in two so the count of the next three steps is 4-and-1. These three steps constitute the ''cha-cha chasse''. A step to the side is taken with the left foot, the right foot is half closed towards the left foot (typically leaving both feet under the hips or perhaps closed together), and finally there is a last step to the left with the left foot. The length of the steps in the chasse depends very much on the effect the dancer is attempting to make.&lt;ref name="Laird 2003"/&gt;

The partner takes a step back on the right foot, the knee being straightened as full weight is taken. The other leg is allowed to remain straight. It is possible it will shoot slightly but no deliberate flexing of the free leg is attempted. This is quite different from technique associated with [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], for instance. On the next beat (beat three) weight is returned to the left leg. Then a chasse is danced RLR.

Each partner is now in a position to dance the bar their partner just danced. Hence the fundamental construction of Cha-cha extends over two bars.

The checked first step is a later development in the "international cha-cha" style. Because of the action used during the forward step (the one taking only part weight) the basic pattern turns left, whereas in earlier times Cha-cha was danced without rotation of the alignment. Hip actions are allowed to occur at the end of every step. For steps taking a single beat the first half of the beat constitutes the foot movement and the second half is taken up by the hip movement. The hip sway eliminates any increase in height as the feet are brought towards each other.
In general, steps in all directions should be taken first with the ball of the foot in contact with the floor, and then with the heel lowering when the weight is fully transferred; however, some steps require that the heel remain lifted from the floor. When weight is released from a foot, the heel should release from the floor first, allowing the toe to maintain contact with the floor.

=== Hip movement ===
[[File:Ballroom dance competition cha cha.jpg|thumb|A young girl dancing cha-cha-chá The girl moves her hips while holding the torso relatively still.]]

In traditional [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Rhythm|American Rhythm]] style, Latin hip movement is achieved through the alternate bending and straightening action of the knees, though in modern competitive dancing, the technique is virtually identical to the [[Latin dance|"international Latin"]] style.

In the international Latin style, the weighted leg is almost always straight. The free leg will bend, allowing the hips to naturally settle into the direction of the weighted leg. As a step is taken, a free leg will straighten the instant before it receives weight. It should then remain straight until it is completely free of weight again.

== International Latin style cha-cha ==
Cha-cha is one of the five dances of the "Latin American" program of international ballroom competitions.

As described above, the basis of the modern dance was laid down in the 1950s by Pierre &amp; Lavelle&lt;ref&gt;Lavelle, Doris 1983. ''Latin &amp; American dances''. 3rd ed, Black, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and developed in the 1960s by [[Walter Laird]] and other top competitors of the time. The basic steps taught to learners today are based on these accounts.

In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced generally without any [[Rises and falls|rise and fall]]; this is the modern ballroom technique of Cha-cha (and other ballroom dances).

'''Edward Herbert Beresford '''"'''Chip'''"''' Monck''' (born March 5, 1939 in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]) is an American Tony Award nominated lighting designer, most famously serving as the master of ceremonies at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]].

==Personal history==
Monck was born in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] to a mother from [[Nutley, New Jersey]] and a father from [[Liverpool]], [[England]], he acquired the nickname "Chip" at a summer camp in [[Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=Grandfather&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Kevin|title=Chip Monck: Grandfather of Rock and Roll Productions|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/www.kevinmmitchell.com/writer/articles/chipmonck.html|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Monck went to the [[South Kent School]] on Ice Hockey and Crew scholarships, he became more interested in welding and machinery, designing a potato harvester that he sold to [[International Harvester|McCormick]]. He began volunteering with a summer theater group at [[Wellesley College]], learning the basics of theatrical lighting from Greg Harney. He began auditing classes at [[Harvard]] while working with the university's theater company.&lt;ref name=Grandfather /&gt;

==Early career==
Monck began working at the Greenwich Village nightclub [[The Village Gate]] in 1959, lighting comedians and Jazz and Folk artists, and living in the basement apartment under the club ([[Bob Dylan]] wrote "[[A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]" on Monck's IBM [[Selectric]] typewriter). He began an eight-year-long relationship with the [[Newport Folk Festival]], and a nine-year one with the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], while continuing to work at the Gate. He became friends with Charles Altman of the [[Altman Lighting Co.]], repairing equipment and borrowing lighting instruments to improve the stage lighting of the Gate. He began lighting the stage of the [[Apollo Theater]] in Harlem.

In 1967, he lit the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which featured the first major American appearances by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Who]], as well as the first major public performances of [[Janis Joplin]]. Monck's work can be seen in the [[D. A. Pennebaker]] film ''[[Monterey Pop]]''. That year, he also lit [[The Byrds]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] and his first [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] concert. The following year, he worked with [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]] in Europe, and began working with concert impresario [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], renovating the Fillmore theaters.  He also designed the distinctive half-shell stage at the [[Miami Pop Festival (December 1968)]], which was called the Flying Stage, and was one of the festival's two, simultaneously operating main stages.

==Woodstock==
In 1969 he lit the concert that would define his career and make him a public figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/so-you-want-to-be-a-rock-and-roll-star-e5b836118fcc |title=Neil Ratner Rock Doc - My Offbeat Rock &amp; Roll Journey|publisher=Soundcloud }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monck was hired to plan and build the staging and lighting, ten weeks of work for which he was paid $7,000.&lt;ref name=Grandfather /&gt; Much of his plan had to be scrapped when the promoters were not allowed to use the original location in [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Wallkill, New York]]. The stage roof that was constructed in the shorter time available was not able to support the lighting that had been rented, which wound up sitting unused underneath the stage. The only light on the stage was from spotlights.

He was drafted just before the concert started as the [[Master of Ceremonies|master of ceremonies]] when Michael Lang noticed that they had forgotten to hire one. He can be heard (and seen) in recordings of Woodstock making the stage announcements, including requests to "stay off the towers" and the warning about the "[[Lysergic acid diethylamide|brown acid]]".&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Rick|title=Chip Monck: The man who shined light on Woodstock|url=http://blog.chron.com/40yearsafter/2009/08/chip-monck-the-man-who-shined-light-on-woodstock/|accessdate=12 October 2011|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|To get back to the warning that I’ve received, you might take it with however many grains of salt you wish, that the brown acid that is circulating around us is not specifically too good. It's suggested that you do stay away from that. Of course it’s your own trip, so be my guest. But please be advised that there’s a warning on that one, okay?}}

==The Rolling Stones==
Four months after Woodstock, Monck and Lang planned the [[Altamont Free Concert]] for the Rolling Stones, which also had to move from the original planned location, but this time with unfortunate results. Members of the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle club were hired to provide security for the concert with [[Altamont Free Concert#Death of Meredith Hunter|terrible results]]. Monck confronted a member of the Angels stealing a large custom carpet that was part of the Rolling Stones stage set&lt;ref name=STP_Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenfield|first=Robert|title=S.T.P. : a journey through America with the Rolling Stones|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-306-81199-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fm95AhPb2v0C&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Chip%20Monck%20angels%20carpet&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=Chip%20Monck%20angels%20carpet&amp;f=false|edition=1. Da Capo Press edition.|quote=Chip Monck gets knocked down when he tries to gain possession of the purple starburst carpet the Stones have worked on.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lost teeth being hit in the mouth with a pool cue. He later tracked down the person and managed to trade the carpet for a case of brandy.&lt;ref name=Grandfather /&gt;

Monck invented an innovative method of stage lighting for the 1972 tour. Instead of raising 3,000 pounds of lamps to the trusses, Monck installed a 40' x 8' array of [[Mylar]] mirrors. A row of spotlights sitting on the floor behind the stage bounced light off the mirrors onto the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedland|first=Nat|title=Chop Monck Tell How He Wires Giant Events For Lights/Sound|journal=Billboard|date=November 2, 1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA32-IA5&amp;dq=Chip%20Monck&amp;pg=PA32-IA5#v=onepage&amp;q=Chip%20Monck&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

In 1974, Monck was the host of ''Speakeasy'', a short-lived rock and roll talk show that featured mostly chat and some live performances by such acts as [[Tom Waits]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]]. Monck's persona was well-known enough to be parodied as "Chick Monk" on [[Second City Television|SCTV]] by [[Tony Rosato]] as a marriage councilor employing strobe lights and a fog machine.&lt;ref name=SCTV&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Jeff|title=Second City Television : a history and episode guide|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C|isbn=978-0-7864-3191-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPFX6daYP0MC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Chip%20Monck%22&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chip%20Monck%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1974, he provided production services for the [[Muhammad Ali]]/[[George Foreman]] boxing match [[The Rumble in the Jungle]], and the associated three-day music festival [[Zaire 74]], which featured performances by [[James Brown]], [[Celia Cruz]] and the [[Fania All-Stars]], [[B.B. King]], [[Miriam Makeba]], [[The Spinners (American band)|The Spinners]], [[Bill Withers]], and [[Manu Dibango]]. Monck's work can be seen in the films ''[[Soul Power (film)|Soul Power]]'' and ''[[When We Were Kings]]''.

He was the lighting designer for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name=TakingWoodstock&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Nick|title=Taking Woodstock: Then and Now|url=http://focusfeatures.com/article/taking_woodstock__then_and_now?film=taking_woodstock|publisher=Focus Features|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as consulting on the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney.

In 2003, Monck received the Parnelli Award for Lifetime Achievement in the concert touring industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{https://parnelliawards.com/past-winners/2003-parnelli-winners/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Monck resides in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], Australia&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle /&gt; concentrating on corporate and retail lighting.&lt;ref name=Grandfather /&gt;

In 2011, he served as the Director of Production of the [[One Great Night On Earth]] Festival, planned for December 1, 2012. This event was intended to raise funds to help Australians in regions devastated by natural disasters like the [[Black Saturday bushfires]], flooding and drought.

==Early life and marriage==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Clarice Vance was born in [[Ohio]] in 1870. She began her career in farce comedy in the early 1890s and was such a hit singing the songs interpolated into plot that she quickly won fame, singing ragtime and dialect songs as a single. When she performed with the James and Bonnie Thornton troop, he coined her, "The Southern Singer".&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;

She married "Mose" Gumble, head of Remick Music Publishing in New York, in 1904, but divorced him in 1914. Gumble was a well known songwriter along with his brother, Albert, but is remembered today as the man who gave [[George Gershwin]] his first job plugging songs at Remick. According to the 1900 census, this well known marriage was preceded by a marriage to William A. Sims who served briefly as her manager. According to the ''New York Clipper'' she was granted a divorce from John Blanchard in early 1904. This was followed by her marriage to Gumble.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Recent research into [[Pike County, Ohio]] census records indicate that Clarice's mother's name was Mary Vance, solving the riddle of her stage name. Her middle name was actually "Etta" not Ella. This was confirmed by Sterling Morris after obtaining a copy of the original notice in ''Variety'' of her marriage to Gumble in 1904. ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} archives reveal that Vance later married Phelps Decker, a screen scenario writer and for a short time, manager in the New York offices of [[Universal Pictures]]. His services were terminated in early 1928&lt;ref&gt;Diana Birchall. ''Onoto Watanna, The Story of Winnifred Eaton''  University of Illinois Press, 2001.&lt;!--page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered by his wife, "former vaudeville actress Clarice Vance" to have asphyxiated himself on February 5, 1928 in their apartment at 35 East 15th St. Manhattan, New York. He was 16 years her junior.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Scenarist Found Dead" (February 9, 1928) ''Orange County Independent'', Middletown, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Vance was known as a "[[coon song|coon singer]]",&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt; singing popular Negro dialect songs of the day. She was a handsome woman, slightly over 6' tall and could project over a 26-piece [[orchestra]] when she sang on the stage. She shared the bill with the leading headliners of the day and her impish face appears on dozens of sheet music covers from 1897 to 1914. Her picture appeared in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' at one point. In 1910 she starred in a short-lived but lavish [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, ''A Skylark''.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt; She played at least three extended engagements in London, the most successful being a 26-week appearance at the London Palace in 1909.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Her records exhibit a rare, radiant and very droll wit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDhScPotlyA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rdaDEyf-DU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhIYcZj1Wc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPk-nL8UzA8&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded for [[Edison Records]] in 1905 (two selections) and from 1906 to 1909 for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]].&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt; Her most popular song was "Mariar",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UugnwXGSDOg&lt;/ref&gt; co-written by her husband; she recorded three versions of it.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Later life==
Vance's life after 1923 is shrouded in mystery. In the early 1920s she appeared briefly in movies in character parts and slid into total oblivion, but according to the 1935 California voters registration she was living in San Francisco, listing her profession as 'dramatic coach' and residing at 1045&lt;!-- 1043 --&gt; Bush Street.

From 1944 to 1951, the comedian lived in a rooming house at 1535 Pine Street in San Francisco. From 1951 until her death in 1961 she was a patient at [[Napa State Hospital|Napa State Mental Hospital]] in [[Napa, California]]. She died there, aged 91, knowing only her name and that she was "an actress".&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;

'''''Dead Trigger 2''''' is a [[zombie]]-themed  [[first-person perspective|first person]]   [[survival horror]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Madfinger Games]]. It was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices on October 23, 2013, and for [[Facebook]] on February 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Dave|title=Dead Trigger 2 launches on Facebook today as free-to-play release|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/02/20/dead-trigger-2-launches-on-facebook-today-as-free-to-play-release/|website=VG247|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original ''[[Dead Trigger]]'', ''Dead Trigger 2'' is a [[single-player video game|single-player]] zombie-themed shooter.

''Dead Trigger 2'' utilizes the [[Unity game engine]]. It was released as a [[free-to-play]] game; [[microtransaction]]s are included in the final product, but the developers had tested the game without in-app purchases to make sure the core gameplay works without them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Dead+Trigger+2/news.asp?c=48927 MWC 2013: Dead Trigger 2 will be F2P but provide pure gameplay and is being tested without IAP | Dead Trigger 2 news | Android | Pocket Gamer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Dead Trigger 2'' is a zombie-apocalypse-themed first-person shooter with survival horror and action role-playing elements, currently available on iOS, Android and recently on Windows Phone 8.1 mobile devices. Running on the Unity game engine, the game features a progression system, numerous environments, unlockable and upgradable weapons, and various story-based and quick-play mission types.

''Dead Trigger 2'' is a free-movement shooter; rather than the on-rails gameplay typical of mobile zombie shooters, the player controls the character's movement like a typical console or PC FPS. The game features two dramatically different control paradigms; with the default controls, the player merely aims at zombies - his or her weapons will attack automatically when a zombie is underneath the crosshair. The advanced control scheme functions like the first game - the player presses a button to fire the weapon, and an additional button lets the player aim down the weapon's sights for increased accuracy.

Gameplay typically revolves around completing objectives while killing zombies (occasionally killing zombies is the only objective). The player has a limited amount of health that is refreshed at the start of each mission. The player loses health when hit by zombies or by certain environmental hazards (i.e. radiation). The player can regain health by taking healing pills or getting a health power up from a special zombie.

Enemies come in two flavors, standard zombies and special zombies. Standard zombies often plod along at a slow pace and attack with their arms, but some may sprint or carry melee weapons for increased damage. Special zombies have distinct appearances and unique traits; they are deadlier and tougher to kill, but drop blueprints or large amounts of cash (and sometimes health) when killed.

In addition to carrying two primary weapons, the player also carries a melee weapon and up to three types of consumable items. Consumables include health pills, grenades, exploding chickens and others.

== Reception ==

}}

''Dead Trigger 2'' received positive reviews from critics. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 77 out of 100 based on 12 critics.&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;

There has been controversy of what players are calling "pay to win" with regards to game difficulty scaling steeply and slowing progress to a crawl unless the player pays real money for in game perks and items.

'''Diether Krebs''' (11 August 1947 in [[Essen]], [[Germany]] – 4 January 2000 in [[Hamburg]]) was a German [[actor]], [[cabaret]] artist and [[comedian]].

==Life and career==

===Youth and initial success===

Diether Krebs was born on 11 August 1947 in Essen, the son of a [[stationery]] shop owner. His [[Godparent|godfather]] was [[Diether Posser]], a lawyer, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and erstwhile Minister for Justice and Finance for [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Krebs gained his first experience in the theatre at school at the Humboldt ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in Essen. He took acting lessons at the renowned "[[Folkwang Hochschule|Folkwangschule]]" school of [[performing arts]] in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] and took on his first role at the theatre in [[Oberhausen]], followed by some small film roles. Of these, his most noteworthy appearance was in the film ''[[Zoff (film)|Zoff]]'' (1971) in which he played alongside well-known actors such as [[Jürgen Prochnow]] and [[Claus Theo Gärtner]].

From 1973, Krebs became famous for his role as "Michael Graf" in the legendary [[German television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Ein Herz und eine Seele]]'', the German version of ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. Krebs played the same role as [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]]'s Mike, the left-wing son-in-law of Alfred Tetzlaff ([[Alf Garnett]]), played by [[Heinz Schubert (actor)|Heinz Schubert]]. In 1974, however, he left the series due to differences with the producers [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]].

In the time that followed, Krebs made many television appearances, both in light entertainment and in more sophisticated series. In 1975, Peter Zadek chose him to play in ''[[Ice Age (1975 film)|Eiszeit]]'' with [[Heinz Bennent]]; in 1980 he played a main role in ''[[Die Judenbuche]]'' based on the story by [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]].

===Detective thrillers===

In 1978, Krebs turned to [[crime]] series: for eight years, from 1978 to 1986, he played "Dieter Herrle", the miserable chief detective in the series ''[[SOKO 5113]]''. He made several guest appearances in the classic detective series ''[[Tatort]]'', as well as in the famous ''[[Polizeiruf 110]]'' and ''[[Der Alte (television series)|Der Alte]]''.

===Comedian and cabaret artist===

Krebs achieved more success as a cabaret artist and comedian: in 1981, he made regular appearances on ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Rudis Tagesshow|de}}'' with [[Rudi Carrell]], alongside Beatrice Richter and [[Klaus Havenstein]]. This poked fun at the main news programme, the ''[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]'', and caused a good deal of uproar. Krebs left his series, again because of disagreements with the producer ([[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]).

From 1985 to 1987 Krebs achieved [[cult]] status with his comedy series ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sketchup (Comedy)|de|3=Sketchup (Comedy)|lt=Sketchup}}'' in which he took on a wide range of different roles, accompanied at first by [[Beatrice Richter]] and then by [[Iris Berben]]. The series also became popular in other countries, such as [[Belgium]]. This series, followed by ''Knastmusik'' (1990) and ''Lauter nette Nachbarn'' (also 1990) built up Krebs's reputation as a comedian.

===Actor, singer and presenter===

In the years that followed, Diether Krebs acted in roles of varying quality. In 1986 he played the hairdresser "Hupsi" in [[Helmut Dietl]]'s successful series ''[[Kir Royal – Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters]]''; in 1993 he took on a role in the [[catastrophe film]] ''Möbius'' by Matti Geschonneck. In 1991 he acted as a long-distance driver in the comedy ''[[Go Trabi Go]]'' by [[Peter Timm]]. That same year, he entered the German [[music charts]]: for a while he became famous as "Martin", a naive [[Environmentalism|tree-hugger]] in a hand-knitted [[Fair Isle (technique)|Fair Isle]] jumper with straggly hair and prominent teeth. He also played this character on stage.

Krebs also worked as a [[television presenter]], for example hosting the New Year Gala on [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] from 1996 and the ''Goldene Henne'' media award ceremony in 1999, also on MDR.

===Hard times and a comeback===

The last years of Diether Krebs's life were marked by his dwindling success and serious illness. In 1993, the [[RTL Television|RTL]] show ''R.O.S.T. - Die Diether Krebs-Show'', which also starred [[Hugo Egon Balder]], was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The [[Sat.1]] comedy series ''Der Dicke und der Belgier'' with the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] comedian [[Carry Goossens]] was also cancelled in 1998 due to low [[viewing figure]]s.

Krebs was a strong smoker and by then he was suffering from lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/erinnerungen-an-diether-krebs-der-alleswoller-a-499064.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, at this time, he developed a new character which he played on stage: "Herr Krups", a funny sales rep with horn-rimmed glasses and wonky teeth. In 1998 he set off on a tour, starting in [[Berlin]], with a routine including his own version of the [[Ruhrgebiet]]'s ode to [[Currywurst]]. The text of this song which  [[Herbert Grönemeyer]] made famous was written by Krebs.

===His last role===
In 1999, Diether Krebs played his last role in the Ruhrgebiet-based action comedy film ''[[Bang Boom Bang]]''. Playing slimeball [[shipping agent]] Werner Kampmann he appeared alongside [[Ralf Richter (actor)|Ralf Richter]] and others in this film directed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter Thorwarth|de}}. Some film critics acclaimed this as Krebs's best ever part. Krebs was also scheduled to act in the longer cinema version of the film but died 8 month earlier from lung cancer.

'''''Fat Tony &amp; Co.''''' is a nine-episode Australian television series focusing on [[Tony Mokbel]] and covers the manhunt which lasted 18 months and dismantled a drug empire. It premiered on 23 February 2014 and concluded on 30 March 2014 on the [[Nine Network]]. It is technically a part of the ''[[Underbelly (series)|Underbelly franchise]]'', with various actors reprising their role from previous series.

== Production ==

=== Conception ===
''Fat Tony &amp; Co.'' has been marketed as a sequel to the [[Underbelly (series 1)|first series]] of ''[[Underbelly (TV series)|Underbelly]]'', however due to changes in funding with Screen Australia it was not branded as an ''Underbelly'' series.&lt;ref name="Formal announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/08/underbelly-cast-reunite-for-fat-tony-co.html |title=Underbelly cast reunite for Fat Tony &amp; Co.|date=4 August 2013 |publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fat Tony and Co'' actually runs chronologically alongside of ''Underbelly'', with the storyline being told from the point of view of Mokbel. The first few episodes chronicle his rise while the "[[Melbourne gangland killings|Melbourne gangland war]]" is taking place but the later episodes focus on his disappearance and arrest in Greece, and other events that unfolded after the original series of Underbelly concluded.

After a rumour in November 2012, ''Fat Tony &amp; Co.'' was officially announced on 3 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/11/rumour-tony-mokbel-drama.html |title=Rumour: Tony Mokbel drama |date=2 November 2012 |publisher=[[TV Tonight]] |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production for the series began on 5 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Formal announcement"/&gt;

''Fat Tony &amp; Co.''' was directed by Peter Andrikidis, Andrew Prowse and Karl Zwicky, with Jo Rooney, Andy Ryan, Peter Gawler and Elisa Argenzio Lambert serving as producers.&lt;ref name="Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screentime.com.au/blog/my-product/fat-tony-and-co/#folio-desc-1 |title=Fat Tony &amp; Co |date=29 January 2014 |publisher=Screentime Pty Ltd |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most of ''Fat Tony &amp; Co.'' was shot in Melbourne, some sequences were filmed in Athens, Greece.&lt;ref name="Formal announcement"/&gt;

=== Casting ===
Most of the cast from the first series of ''[[Underbelly (series)|Underbelly]]'' return to play the same characters, although some were unavailable to reprise their signature roles such as [[Kat Stewart]] who played Roberta Williams, replaced by [[Hollie Andrew]]; [[Caroline Gillmer]] who played Judy Moran, replaced by [[Debra Byrne]], and [[Callan Mulvey]] who played Mark Moran, replaced by Jake Ryan.&lt;ref name="Formal announcement"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16706">'''Gelotophobia''' is a [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]] of being laughed at, a type of [[social phobia]]. While most people do not like being laughed at,&lt;ref name="Heyd1982"&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Place of Laughter in Hobbes's Theory of Emotions |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=285–295  |date= April 1982  |first= David |last=Heyd |doi=10.2307/2709204 |jstor=2709204}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a sub-group of people that exceedingly fear it, and without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychiatry]], and has been studied intensively.

In his clinical observations, [[:de:Michael Titze|Dr. Michael Titze]]&lt;ref name=Titze&gt;Titze, M. (1996). "The Pinocchio Complex: Overcoming the fear of laughter". ''Humor &amp; Health Journal'' '''5''', 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; found that some of his patients seemed to be primarily worried about being laughed at. They tended to scan their environment for signs of laughter and ridicule. Furthermore, they reported that they had the impression of being ridiculous themselves. Additionally, Titze observed a specific movement pattern among them when they thought they were being laughed at—awkward, wooden movements that resembled those of wooden puppets. He described this state as "[[Pinocchio]]-syndrome". 

Two other behaviours related to laughter are [[gelotophilia]], the joy of being laughed at, and [[katagelasticism]], the joy of laughing at others.

== Causes and consequences ==

From the clinical observations a model of the causes and consequences of gelotophobia was drawn up&lt;ref&gt;Ruch, W. (2004). "Gelotophobia: A useful new concept?" Paper presented at the 2004 Colloquium Series, Department of Psychology, [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], Berkeley US.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the condition could be studied scientifically. The model claims that gelotophobia can be caused by any one of three things at different stages of development: 

The putative causes of gelotophobia:
* In infancy: development of primary shame failure to develop an interpersonal bridge (e.g. unsupportive infant–caregiver interactions).  
* In childhood and youth: repeated traumatic experiences of not being taken seriously or being laughed at/ridiculed (e.g. [[bullying]]).
* In adulthood: intense traumatic experience of being laughed at or ridiculed (e.g. [[wikt:mockery|mockery]]).

The consequences of gelotophobia:
* Social withdrawal to avoid being ridiculed. 
* Appearing 'cold as ice'/humourless. 
* Psychosomatic disturbances, e.g. blushing, [[tension headache]], trembling, dizziness, sleep disturbances. 
* Demonstrating 'Pinocchio Syndrome:' clumsy, 'agelotic' face, 'wooden puppet' appearance. 
* Lack of liveliness, spontaneity, joy. 
* Inability to experience humour/laughter as relaxing and joyful social experiences. 
* Anger when being laughed at by other people (in some cases this results in violent attacks on the people who were laughing).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-27323470 "Gelotophobia: living a life in fear of laughter"], ''[[BBC News]],'' 26 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Later this model was revised and expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruch|first=Willibald|last2=Hofmann|first2=Jennifer|last3=Platt|first3=Tracey|last4=Proyer|first4=René|date=2014|title=The state-of-the art in gelotophobia research: A review and some theoretical extensions|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/humr.2014.27.issue-1/humor-2013-0046/humor-2013-0046.xml|journal=Humor|volume=27|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1515/humor-2013-0046|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and outlook ==

Here is a quick checklist of gelotophobic behaviours which suggest that people are gelotophobic:
* They avoid social situations to avoid being laughed at or ridiculed. 
* They worry that people think they do not engage with them in a warm, friendly way, or think they are humourless. 
* They struggle to know what to say to people in a 'natural'  way. 
* They have low [[self-esteem]] due to feeling incompetent in social situations. 
* When people are talking and laughing, they feel their body getting tense, which then makes their movements appear wooden and stiff rather than being relaxed and natural. 
* They think they are not a lively person, are not spontaneous, and do not experience many joyful moments in their daily life. 
* They worry that they look ridiculous to others. 

Anyone who displays or experiences at least half of these characteristics may be gelotophobic. Since laughter is used as an integral part of communication and how people form and maintain relationships, it is natural to see how those who tend to be gelotophobic will find that their [[social interaction]]s are seriously affected.

Usually laughter is contagious and leads to positive emotions such as exhilaration and joy, yet no one likes to be laughed at or made fun of. Most people dislike being laughed at to some degree and gelotophobia can range from having no fear at all, to borderline, to pronounced or extreme gelotophobia.

== Assessment ==

There is a fifteen-item questionnaire for the subjective assessment of gelotophobia, e.g. the GELOPH&lt;15&gt;. This questionnaire has been used to show that gelotophobia exists, to varying degrees, in a normal population.&lt;ref name=Ruch2008&gt;Ruch, W., &amp; Proyer, R. T. (2008). "[http://www.reference-global.com/toc/humr/21/1 The fear of being laughed at: Individual and group differences in gelotophobia]".

Research into gelotophobia using the GELOPH scales shows that empirically, the condition exists outside of people who seek therapy due to experiencing a problematic fear of being laughed at. In the first studies, gelotophobes were distinguished from other people with shame-based problems and non-shame based neurotics and samples of a normal population.&lt;ref name=Ruch2008/&gt; Basically, this means that even though gelotophobia shares similar problems,  high scores were also found for these criteria in individuals with Asperger's syndrome and Cluster A personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Elisabeth M.|last2=Schulter|first2=Günter|last3=Freudenthaler|first3=H.

== Emotions ==

Although at face value the emotions relating to gelotophobia would be predominantly fear, there is a distinct interplay with three dominant emotions:&lt;ref name="Platt, T. 2009"&gt;Platt, T. &amp; Ruch, W. (2009). "The emotions of gelotophobes: Shameful, fearful and joyless?" ''Humor'', '''22''', 91-110.&lt;/ref&gt; low levels of joy,  high levels of fear, and high levels of shame. More importantly, where shame in a typical week exceeds joy, gelotophobia is more likely to develop.&lt;ref name="Platt, T. 2009"/&gt; Gelotophobes say that they are bad at regulating their emotions, and they more easily pick up the negative moods of other people. They also suppress expression of their emotions and do not share their feelings readily with others.&lt;ref&gt;Papousek, I., Ruch, W., Freudenthaler, H. H., Kogler, E., Lang, B., &amp; Schulter, G. (2009). "Gelotophobia, emotion-related skills and responses to the affective states of others". ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]]'', '''47''', 58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perception and personality ==

Gelotophobes do not have the ability to understand the difference between playful forms of humorous interactions such as teasing, and crueller forms such as ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first=Tracey. 
 |last=Platt 
 |date=May 2008 
 |title=Emotional responses to ridicule and teasing: Should gelotophobes react differently? 
 |journal=Humor
 |volume=21 
 |issue=2 
 |pages=105–128 
 |doi=10.1515/HUMOR.2008.005 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even if someone is trying to be friendly and playful, a gelotophobe will feel apprehensive and mistake the interaction for ridicule. It can also mean that people may feel they are being bullied when in fact they are not.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, T., Proyer, R.T. &amp; Ruch, W. (2009). "[http://www.psychologie-aktuell.com/fileadmin/download/PschologyScience/2-2009/03_Platt.pdf Gelotophobia and bullying: The assessment of the fear of being laughed at and its application among bullying victims]". ''Psychology Science Quarterly'', 5,135-147.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gelotophobes are often located in both the [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]] PEN and the [[Five factor model|Big Five]] models of personality. Gelotophobia correlates highly with introversion and [[neuroticism]], and on older P-scales, gelotophobes score higher in psychoticism.&lt;ref&gt;Ruch, W., &amp; Proyer, R. T. (2009). "Who Fears Being Laughed at? The Location of Gelotophobes in the Eysenckian PEN-model of Personality". ''Personality and Individual Differences'', '''46'''(5-6), 627-630.&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensional assessment of personality pathology, a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] personality disorder instrument, showed that those with a fear of being laughed at tend to be socially avoidant and submissive, as well as having identity problems. Social withdrawal and suspiciousness most frequently predicted gelotophobia.

Paul Lewis (Boston College, US) speculated whether political gelotophobia might affect elections in the US ("The twin fears of being effectively mocked or ineffective in mocking others [too harsh, blunt, tasteless] led candidates to aggressive and proactive strategies [going on TV to show they can take a joke, be funny—anything to avoid being rendered pathetically ridiculous or inappropriately derisive]") [p.&amp;nbsp;42, conference abstract from the 2009 conference of the International Society for Humor Studies [http://www.hnu.edu/ishs/ ISHS] in Long Beach, California];&lt;ref name ="lewisp"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lewis, P.|title="Partisan gelotophobia and preemptive humor strategies". &lt;small&gt;Paper presented at the 21st Annual Conference of the International Society for Humor Studies, Long Beach, CA.&lt;/small&gt;|url=http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/english/faculty/facalpha/lewis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Christie Davies]], who is also president of the ISHS,  comments satirically on the results of recent elections in the UK. He noticed that losers in those elections were frequently bald—"To be bald is to suffer from gelotophobia, to fear being laughed at; to fear being laughed at is to fear disorder; to fear disorder is to embrace absolutism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001414.php Socialaffairsunit.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths, intelligence and humour ability ==

A number of tests show that gelotophobes often underestimate their own potential and achievements. Gelotophobes tend to see themselves as less [[virtue|virtuous]] than people who know them.&lt;ref name="Proyer &amp; Ruch 2009"/&gt; Similarly, in an intelligence study, gelotophobes consistently underestimated their intellectual performance by as much as 6 [[IQ]] points.&lt;ref name="Proyer &amp; Ruch 2009a"&gt;Proyer, R. T., &amp; Ruch, W. (2009). "How virtuous are gelotophobes? Self- and Peer-reported character strengths among those who fear being laughed at". ''Humor'', '''22''', 145-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelotophobes have a different experience of laughter: it does not lift their mood or make them more cheerful. They personally characterise their own humour as being inept, yet once again, tests show that they are no different from other people at making witty remarks and humour.&lt;ref&gt;Ruch, W., Beermann, U., &amp; Proyer, R. T. (2009). "Investigating the humor of gelotophobes: Does feeling ridiculous equal being humorless?" ''Humor'', '''22''', 111-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grapevine radio''' refers to the transmission infrastructures, used for distributing audio programs, which were built to serve a small number of rural [[upstate South Carolina]] communities from the early 1930s to the middle 1940s. Despite their name, these systems did not employ radio transmitters, but were actually a type of "[[telephone newspaper]]", because the programs were sent telephonically over wires strung to subscribing homes.

The equipment used to distribute programming over a facility's wire network was located at a central site, for example a general store's back room. Programs normally consisted of retransmissions of radio stations, however, some programming was locally produced, originating from a studio at the distribution site or relayed from a local church or other gathering place. The locally produced programs included announcements and emergency messages, commercials and live performances. The transmissions were made daily, generally starting around 6 a.m. and running until 10:00 p.m. or midnight.

The grapevine systems soon became unneeded, because they primarily served homes that did not have electricity. Once a community received electric service the local grapevine system would soon close down, as the subscribers switched to radio receivers that could receive a wide selection of programs at no cost, instead of the single program and monthly fees characteristic of the grapevine systems.
==Historical background==
Information about the grapevine installations (also called "speakerline") is limited, because of their brief history and the fact that they do not appear to have been established outside a small region of South Carolina. Unlike radio stations, they did not require government approval to operate. Their existence was also dependent on an unusual and short-lived economic and technical environment, as they required a central distribution site that had access to electricity, plus a surrounding community of prospective subscribers that did not have electric service.

Throughout the 1930s large parts of the United States, including most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less [[Crystal radio|crystal radio receivers]], and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the [[Great Depression]] meant that many people could not even afford a newspaper subscription. Thus, there was a lack of entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/37277242/THE_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RURAL_WIRED_RADIO_SYSTEMS_IN_UPSTATE_SOUTH_CAROLINA "The Development of Rural Wired Radio Systems in Upstate South Carolina"] by Susan K. Opt, ''Journal of Radio Studies 1'' (1992), pages 73-74. (academia.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that "we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world".&lt;ref&gt;''Listening to Radio, 1920-1950'' by Ray Barfield, 1996, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rural electrification#United States|rural electrification]] projects of the 1930s and 1940s eventually eliminated potential customers, making the grapevine systems no longer needed as their former customers switched to listening to radio stations.
==Initial installation at Mauldin==
[[File:Map of Mauldin, South Carolina grapevine radio system (1936).gif|thumb|right|425px|Wire layout of Gordon Rogers' "grapevine radio" installation as of 1936. The transmissions originated from his home near Mauldin, South Carolina.]]
The first grapevine system was begun in the winter of 1930-1931 by a high school student, Gordon F. Rogers, who lived on farm in central Greenville county near [[Mauldin, South Carolina]]. The Rogers farm, unlike most of its neighbors, had electrical service. Gordon Rogers had shown an early aptitude for engineering, developing a clock that automatically turned on the farm's chicken coup lights at 3:00 a.m., as well as an automated system for watering the chickens.&lt;ref name="yen"&gt;"Yen for Electricity Takes SC Country Boy a Long Way: The Gordon Rogers Story", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', April 22, 1952, page 11-A.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers also had an early interest in radio. Dissatisfied with a battery operated set, he successfully reconditioned a vacuum tube receiver that ran on AC electrical power. At this point he decided to also run a single-wire connection with a ground return from his receiver to a loudspeaker at the home of a neighbor who didn't have electricity. With this setup, whenever Rogers' radio was on the neighbor also heard what was being received. Word of this innovation quickly spread, and within a month lines had been run to seven nearby homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/ARCHIVE-RCA/RCA-Engineer/1980-07-08.pdf#page=71 "Bringing Radio to the Rural Home"] by G. F. Rogers, ''RCA Engineer'', July/August 1980 (Vol. 26, No. 1), pages 69-71. (americanradiohistory.com) &lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers' system was essentially sending one-way telephone signals over his own wires, but he had to use voltages far higher than that used by standard telephone lines, because he was sending not only audio but also the power needed to operate what would become hundreds of loudspeakers. His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers had to provide the wire, poles (often actually fence posts) and speakers needed to connect to the main system lines. Unskilled attempts by individuals to tap into the lines without paying generally caused service disruptions for nearby customers, which made it possible to locate and remove the improper connections. Although at first the service was provided for free, as the number of participants grew Rogers began charging a monthly 10 cent fee.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This charge was later raised to 25 cents, and at times a $1 surcharge was applied to finance replacement of sections of the transmission lines that needed to be upgraded from the original iron wire to higher quality materials. The system became profitable enough to finance Rogers' attendance at [[Clemson University|Clemson College]].&lt;ref name="yen"/&gt; In 1933, at the time of his college enrollment, the system had 5 miles (8 kilometers) of lines and 15 subscribers. Increasing demand, spurred by finding a source of affordable speakers ($2.85 each), expanded the number of connections to more than 200 within the next four months, and by June 1934 the transmission lines spanned 15 miles (24 kilometers). By around 1935, there were 600 homes connected to the grapevine service, including sites in [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]] and [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] counties, located up to 24 miles (38 kilometers) distant from the Rogers farm distribution site. The infrastructure had also grown to 400 miles (645 kilometers) of transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) pages 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Programming was provided for about 12 hours each day. Rogers introduced a "local talent" program that featured live performances. A record player provided music for times when static made it difficult to receive the radio rebroadcasts that provided most of the schedule. Provisions were also made to make local announcements.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a [[carrier current]] link from the system based at Ware Place allowed programming originating at that location to be picked up and concurrently transmitted by the Mauldin system.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the spring of 1936, Rogers, now a junior at Clemson, presented a paper, "Bringing Radio to the Rural Home", at a regional conference of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], which provided technical information about his innovation. His review won first place in its category.&lt;ref&gt;"Clemson Junior Contest Winner", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', April 23, 1936, page 5. Rogers' paper was republished in the July/August 1980 issue of ''RCA Engineer'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauldin-based system remained in operation until the area received electrical service, shutting down around 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional installations==
===Ware Place===
Gordon Rogers' original system served northern [[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville county]]. A second wire network, originating from a small store in [[Ware Place, South Carolina]], was later established which provided an extensive program service for the southern part of the county. The store's owners, J. R. Chandler, Jr. and his cousin J. E. Chandler, became familiar with the Mauldin facility, and around 1934 arranged for Gordon Rogers and Sherman Fox to install similar distribution equipment at their store.&lt;ref&gt;''Images of America: Fork Shoals'', 2012, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandlers became active participants operating the system and supplying local programming. A studio, which included a piano and a pulpit, was built in the rear of the store. There was also a connection to the local school.&lt;ref&gt;"Augusta Road Life Livened by 'Grapevine'" by Hattie S. Sims, ''The Greenville (South Carolina) News'', March 3, 1957, page 1-D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers were initially charged 25 cents a month, which was later increased to 35 cents. Individual homes had to maintain their local wire connections, and purchase their own speakers: $3 to $5 for a small one, and $7 to $8 for a large one. An unusual additional benefit resulted from the discovery that, after the grapevine programming ended for the night, individual subscribers could hear each other if they spoke loudly into their speakers, resulting in a form of party-line communication. At its peak over 500 homes were connected. The system continued to run during World War II in order to supply war news, after which it was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hickory Tavern===
This installation helped launch the political career of Robert C. Wasson, who went on to become the state's Tax Chairman. The Wasson family ran a small store in [[Hickory Tavern, South Carolina]], located in southwest Laurens county. The needed equipment was purchased in March 1936 and the service was immediately popular. Later that year, when Robert Wasson announced what would be a successful candidacy for the [[South Carolina House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]], a newspaper report noted that the store he ran "is known as Wasson Brothers store, mill, and grapevine radio system serving 200 rural homes".&lt;ref&gt;"Robert C. Wasson Seeks House Seat", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', July 8, 1936, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers were charged 25 cents per month, and paid $6.50 for a small speaker or $10.50 for a large one — this fee included installation. Robert Wasson's mother, Effie Owens Wasson, handled most of the operational duties, and at its peak about 500 houses within a 12 mile (19 kilometer) radius were connected. Regular news reports and live entertainment made up an important part of the daily schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising over the facility was credited with helping to establish the Eaddy-Blakes corner drug store in Laurens, and a former pharmacy employee later wrote that "were Dr. Eaddy still living I'm sure he would attribute the biggest thing to his success in the drug business was this advertising... It cost him about a dollar a week and he had every person from the area as a regular customer in a short time". &lt;ref&gt;"Grapevine Radio System" (letter from R. A. Martin), ''The Greenville (South Carolina) News'', May 7, 1980, Section B, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wasson served seven terms in the South Carolina legislature. One of his political objectives was getting electrical service for his community, and after the rural electrification program reached his district the grapevine service ceased operations in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Grapevine': A Radio Started Career in Politics" by Jonathan W. Oatis (AP), ''Greenwood (South Carolina) Index-Journal'', August 11, 1980, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saylors Crossroads===
Saylors Crossroads, South Carolina is a small community located in southeastern [[Anderson County, South Carolina|Anderson county]]. This system was inspired by the existence of the Ware Place operations, and was established by Charles Murdock in 1937. The Murdock family operated a general store, and a small studio was constructed in a building behind the store. The grapevine service was run by Selma Saylors, who was the twin sister of Charles Murdock's wife. Programming primarily consisted of relaying the transmissions of a local radio station, [[WAIM]] in Anderson. WAIM signed off at 9 p.m. each evening, and at that point the program source was switched to picking up "a station in Cincinnati" (presumably [[WLW]]). Local programming included the Sunday morning church services from Mount Bethel Baptist Church, carried from 1938 to 1940. 

Subscribers paid 45 cents a month, and chose between three speaker sizes: a smaller square-shaped speaker for $7.50, a larger square-shaped speaker for $9.50, and a heart-shaped speaker for $12.50. The speaker purchases financed the installation of the wire connection to the main transmission lines. At its peak, the service had 500 subscribers. This system ended operations in 1941, after the community received electric service.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) pages 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Williamston===
This system was operated by Carl Ellison, who owned a general store located at [[Williamston, South Carolina]] in east central Anderson county. It remained in operation for "seven or eight years", starting sometime in the 1930s and continuing through at least 1940. It had also been initially inspired by the Ware Place operations.

The Ellisons lived in a house behind the general store, and they converted their living room to serve as a studio for locally produced programming. The service cost 50 cents a month, and reached 700 subscribers. Like the Ware Place system, after the grapevine programming ended for the night individuals could be heard by other subscribers by speaking loudly into their speakers. The system featured ministers from Greenville who preached over the system on Friday nights. It also carried the Sunday services from the First Baptist Church in Williamston.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) pages 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sites===
Gordon Rogers estimated that a total of ten to twelve grapevine operations were eventually installed, all located in South Carolina. Additional locations reportedly included Walhalla (located in the center of South Carolina's easternmost county, Oconee), another "near Mauldin", and one "across the Savannah river from Augusta, Georgia".&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Jason King (radio)|Jason King]]''' (né '''Griffiths''') and '''[[Joel Ross]]''' (né '''Hogg'''), known professionally as '''JK and Joel''', were a radio presenting duo, best known for hosting the [[The Official Chart|official UK chart]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] between 2005 and 2007 and presented the [[CBBC]] show ''[[Hider in the House]]''. In August 2012 JK &amp; Joel confirmed they had split after years of limited success.

==Radio career==

===Viking FM===
The two first worked together at [[Viking FM]] in Kingston upon Hull from 1996 when Ross joined the station from [[Yorkshire Coast Radio]] to present the overnight programme. King was hosting the afternoon show at the time. In 1998 King took over the breakfast show and Ross, who was on the afternoon programme, later began reading the travel bulletins on the show, as a punishment for turning up late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/14/radio | title = The industry is in a complete mess | publisher = The Guardian | accessdate =27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not getting along at first (King heatbutted Ross, breaking his nose), eventually the two were paired up as co-hosts and together they won two Gold Sony Radio Academy Awards for 'Breakfast Show Of The Year' and a Silver for 'Entertainment Show'.

===Key 103===
They left Viking FM to join [[Key 103]] in Manchester in 2000, taking over from Mike Toolan as hosts of the breakfast show where they won a further 3 Sony radio awards, Gold for UK best breakfast show, Silver for UK's best presenters and Bronze for the competition award. Joel was sacked from Key 103 after turning up three hours late for work, agreeing to join BBC Radio 1 towards the end of 2003. JK saw out the remainder of his contract with Key 103, presenting the breakfast show alone before joining Radio 1 in 2004. However, Joel came back to present their final breakfast show together.

===BBC Radio 1===
They went on to join BBC Radio 1 in Spring of 2004. They initially hosted a weekend afternoon programme before moving to the Radio 1 Chart show in March 2005. They also presented the early breakfast show every Monday - Thursday from 4{{nbsp}}am to 7{{nbsp}}am replacing [[Nemone Metaxas]] who left to join [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. They did not host the early breakfast show on a Friday, to compensate for their Sunday chart show and TV commitments, being replaced by [[Fearne Cotton]] and [[Reggie Yates]] of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' fame. They were let go from Radio One in late 2007, during a large presenter shake-up at the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://metro.co.uk/2007/09/06/jk-and-joel-axed-in-radio-one-shake-up-114285/ | title = JK and Joel axed in Radio One shake up| publisher = Metro | accessdate =27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virgin / Absolute Radio===
They quickly joined the national radio station [[Absolute Radio|Virgin Radio]] to present their 10{{nbsp}}am{{snd}}1{{nbsp}}pm slot at weekends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/jk-and-joel-join-virgin-radio/290191.article | title = JK and Joel join Virgin Radio | publisher = BroadcastNow | accessdate =27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the station in the later part of 2008 following the radio stations take over and subsequent rebranding as [[Absolute Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a128532/jk-and-joel-quit-virgin-radio.html#~oCE8nx9KQraqpQ | title = JK and Joel quit Virgin Radio| publisher = DigitalSpy | accessdate =27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio Aire and return to Key 103===
JK and Joel made a return to radio in early 2009, covering shows on Manchester's Key 103 and Leeds' Radio Aire. In July 2009, it was announced that the duo would permanently take over the breakfast show from Simon Logan on Radio Aire. The pair signed a contract for two years. They made their debut on 20 July 2009 and left the station on 20 July 2011.

===Bauer Radio===
They also presented ''JK and Joel's Saturday Night Thing'' on some [[Bauer City &amp; National|Bauer Place]] stations until July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://radio.bauermediaadvertising.com/news/detail/radio_aire_gets_new_programme_director | title = Radio Aire gets new Programme Director | publisher = Bauer Media Group | accessdate =27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Radio===
In August 2011, JK and Joel signed to the [[Global Group]], working on separate stations including Heart and Capital.

==Television career==

===As presenters===
In February 2007 the two men became presenters of the award-winning [[CBBC]] show ''[[Hider in the House]]'', where a celebrity has to be hidden in a house, without one parent finding out. The show ran for 4 series and was the channel's most watched show.

Also in February 2007, JK and Joel appeared on Virgin Media TV channel 999, 'Virgin iD' introducing the new features of the cable service.

On 7 July 2007, JK and Joel launched on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] with their new show music quiz show ''[[Sing It Back]]''.

Between 2008 and 2009, the pair presented series 2 and 3 of ''[[Escape from Scorpion Island]]'' on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in [[Australia]] and the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

They hosted the first series of ''[[My Camp Rock]]'' on the [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]] in the UK and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 2009.

Their TV show ''Remote Control Star'' launched on BBC in early 2011.

From November 2011, the duo started presenting for Flirt!TV on Tour - a weekly mini series following different nights out at Universities around the country.

They have also hosted programmes for [[BBC Three]], Pure Soap, and [[Men &amp; Motors]]. JK and Joel have presented: "''Playboyz''", a fast-moving gadget series for [[Men &amp; Motors|Granada Men and Motors]] and "''Motor Maniacs''", a series dedicated to men obsessed with bikes and cars.

They have been the hosts of "''Pure Soap''" on [[BBC Three]], a daily 30-minute live show looking at all things to do with [[soap opera]]s.

===As contestants===
Ross distinguished himself by winning [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5's]] 2005 ''[[Britain's Worst Celebrity Driver]]'' competition on 25 September 2005, despite the best efforts of JK, his co-driver.

In January 2006, the duo won a "celebrity pairings" edition of ''[[The Weakest Link]]'', raising £12,900 for the Five Stars Scanner Appeal, a children's [[Charitable organization|charity]] they had supported while working in Manchester.

In March 2006 JK took part in Channel 4's final series of The Games coming in third place for the men.

On 12 June 2012, the double act appeared on CBBC's 'Hacker Time', as guests.

==Other work==
In 2010 JK and Joel presented [[Party in the Park]] Leeds in front of 70,000 people and live on [[Radio Aire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5435">'''''La víbora de la mar''''' (lit. The sea snake) is a traditional [[singing game]] originating in Mexico. It is a popular children's game in [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]], and also in Spain where it is known as "pasemisí".

==The game==

Children form a line holding each other's waist or clothing, and two other children raise their arms together to form an arch. Of the two children forming the arch, one of them is "Melón" ([[Honeydew (melon)|Honeydew]] or [[Cantaloupe]]) the other is "Sandía." ([[Watermelon]])

The children begin to sing the song, as the "snake" begins to run (without separating) passing repeatedly under the arch. The lyrics of the song are such that the last of the word of each stanza can be repeated at will, and the children might decide to bring the arch down to "capture" someone. The fun in the game is not knowing when the arch will fall, "capturing" one of the children.

The children who form the arch then ask: "With whom will you stay? Melón or Sandía?" The captured child must then queue up next to the "fruit" of his choice, thereby forming another arch through which the line must pass.

Once all children that formed the original line are divided between "melón" and "sandía", the resulting queues must compete in a game of [[tug of war]].

==The Verses==

The words to the song are:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
Spanish:&lt;br&gt;
"A la víbora, víbora&lt;br/&gt;
de la mar, de la mar&lt;br/&gt;
por aquí pueden pasar.&lt;br/&gt;
Los de adelante corren mucho&lt;br/&gt;
y los de atrás se quedarán&lt;br/&gt;
tras, tras, tras, tras.

Una mexicana que fruta vendía&lt;br/&gt;
ciruela, chabacano, melón o sandía.&lt;br/&gt;
Verbena, verbena, jardín de [[Matatenas|matatena]].&lt;br/&gt;
Verbena, verbena, la virgen de la cueva.&lt;br/&gt;
Campanita de oro déjame pasar,&lt;br/&gt;
Con todos mis hijos menos el de atrás&lt;br/&gt;
Tras, tras, tras, tras.&lt;br/&gt;
Será melón, será sandía&lt;br/&gt;
será la vieja del otro día&lt;br/&gt;
día, día, día, día.

El puente está quebrado,&lt;br/&gt;
que lo manden componer&lt;br/&gt;
Con cáscaras de huevo&lt;br/&gt;
y pedazos de oropel&lt;br/&gt;
pel, pel, pel, pel."

{{col-2}}
English Translation:&lt;br&gt;
'' "To the snake, the snake''&lt;br&gt;
'' Of the sea, of the sea''&lt;br&gt;
'' All of you can pass through here,''&lt;br&gt;
'' Those up front run quickly''&lt;br&gt;
'' Those at back are left behind''&lt;br&gt;
'' 'hind, 'hind, 'hind, 'hind.''

'' One Mexican (woman), who sold fruits''&lt;br&gt;
'' Plums, apricots, cantaloupes or watermelons''&lt;br&gt;
'' [[Vervain|Verbena]], verbena, garden of [[Knucklebones|jacks]]''&lt;br&gt;
'' Verbena, verbena, the virgin of the cave''&lt;br&gt;
'' Little golden bell, let me pass''&lt;br&gt;
'' With all my children, except the one that's last''&lt;br&gt;
'' Last, last, last, last.''&lt;br&gt;
'' Will it be cantaloupe? Will it be watermelon?''&lt;br&gt;
'' Will it be the old lady we saw the other day?''&lt;br&gt;
'' Day, day, day, day.''

'' The bridge is broken''&lt;br&gt;
'' Send someone to have it fixed''&lt;br&gt;
'' With broken bits of eggshells''&lt;br&gt;
'' And pieces of aluminum foil''&lt;br&gt;
'' Foil, foil, foil, foil".''
{{col-end}}

==Variations==

In Mexico, it has become quite popular to play this game at weddings. In this variation, single men and women are often divided, the groom and bride standing on chairs to form the arch under which everyone passes. (The groom often uses the veil or train of the bride's dress). In this case, the song is not sung, and the rhythm of music is followed, which gets faster and faster, the participants struggling to keep the "snake" together, while running through tables, chairs and the couple. At the end of the game, depending on the sex of the participants, the bride throws from her chair the wedding bouquet, and the groom the garter. The bouquet used to be a symbol of happiness, but in today's practice the single woman who catches the bouquet is believed to be the next to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wedding facts, fables, and fairy tales|url=http://www.hobartsprinting.com/wedding_facts.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same goes to the single man who catches the garter. In some instances, it is said that they will marry each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tale of the Tossing of the Garter and other customs|url=http://www.wedalert.com/content/articles/tale_tossing_of_the_garter.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114090546/http://www.wedalert.com/content/articles/tale_tossing_of_the_garter.asp|archivedate=2010-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Spain]] the game is known as "pasemisí". &lt;ref&gt;https://juanocagames.wikispaces.com/Pasemis%C3%AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mihoradelrecreo.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/pasemisi-pasemisa.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://juegos.cosasdepeques.com/pase-misi-pase-misa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar games in other traditions==
Similar games such as these exist in other traditions as well. This game can be likened to "[[London Bridge is Falling Down]]" in English-speaking countries, and a similar game in [[Japan]] exists, played to a song called [[Toryanse]].

'''''Les Caquets de l'accouchée''''' is an anonymous French [[satire]] composed of several quires published in 1622. They were reunited in 1623 under the title « ''Recueil général des Caquets de l'Accouchée'' ».&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept of '''mathematical fallacy'''. There is a distinction between a simple ''mistake'' and a ''mathematical fallacy'' in a proof: a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof just in the same way, but in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is some concealment in the presentation of the proof. For example, the reason validity fails may be a [[division by zero]] that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a certain quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] of obvious [[contradiction]]s. Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are conditional, and are not applicable in the cases that are the exceptions to the rules.

The traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, so that the meaning of [[fallacy]] is here slightly different from the [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]]. The latter applies normally to a form of argument that is not a genuine rule of logic, where the problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to deeper insights into a subject (such as the introduction of [[Pasch's axiom]] of [[Euclidean geometry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[five color theorem|five colour theorem]] of [[graph theory]]). ''Pseudaria'', an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to [[Euclid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|Helberg|1908|loc=Chapter II, §I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics.  In [[elementary algebra]], typical examples may involve a step where division by zero is performed, where a [[root of a function|root]] is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values of a [[multiple valued function]] are equated.  Well-known fallacies also exist in elementary Euclidean geometry and [[calculus]].

==Howlers==

Examples exist of mathematically correct results derived by incorrect lines of reasoning. Such an argument, however true the conclusion, is mathematically [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] and is commonly known as a ''howler''. For example, the calculation ([[anomalous cancellation]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{16}{64} = \frac{16\!\!\!/}{6\!\!\!/4}=\frac{1}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
Although the conclusion &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; is correct, there is a fallacious, invalid cancellation in the middle step. &lt;ref&gt;The same fallacy also applies to&lt;math&gt; \frac{19}{95} = \frac{19\!\!\!/}{9\!\!\!/5} = \frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt; , to &lt;math&gt;\frac{26}{65} = \frac{26\!\!\!/}{6\!\!\!/5} = \frac{2}{5}&lt;/math&gt;, and to &lt;math&gt;\frac{49}{98} = \frac{49\!\!\!/}{9\!\!\!/8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another classical example of a howler is [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem#A bogus .22proof.22: p.28A.29 .3D det.28AIn.C2.A0.E2.88.92.C2.A0A.29 .3D det.28A.C2.A0.E2.88.92.C2.A0A.29 .3D 0|proving the Cayley-Hamilton theorem]] by simply substituting the scalar variables of the characteristic polynomial by the matrix.

Bogus proofs, calculations, or derivations constructed to produce a correct result in spite of incorrect logic or operations were termed "howlers" by Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the field of mathematics the term ''[[Howler (error)|howler]]'' has various meanings, generally less specific.

== Division by zero ==
The [[Division by zero|division-by-zero fallacy]] has many variants. The following example uses division by zero to "prove" that &lt;math&gt;2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, but can be modified to prove that any number equals any other number.

# Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; be equal, non-zero quantities
#:&lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Multiply by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;a^2 = ab&lt;/math&gt;
# Subtract &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Factorization|Factor]] both sides: the left factors as a [[difference of squares]], the right is factored by extracting &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from both terms
#:&lt;math&gt;(a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b)&lt;/math&gt;
# Divide out &lt;math&gt;(a - b)&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;a + b = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Observing that &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;b + b = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Combine like terms on the left
#:&lt;math&gt;2b = b&lt;/math&gt;
# Divide by the non-zero &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

''[[Q.E.D.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Harro|last=Heuser|title=Lehrbuch der Analysis - Teil 1|edition=6th|publisher=Teubner|year=1989|isbn=978-3-8351-0131-9|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallacy is in line 5: the progression from line 4 to line 5 involves division by ''a'' − ''b'', which is zero since ''a'' equals ''b''. Since [[division by zero]] is undefined, the argument is invalid.

== Multivalued functions ==
{{Main article |Multivalued function}}
Many functions do not have a unique [[inverse function|inverse]]. For instance, while squaring a number gives a unique value, there are two possible [[square root]]s of a positive number. The square root is [[multivalued function|multivalued]]. One value can be chosen by convention as the [[principal value]]; in the case of the square root the non-negative value is the principal value, but there is no guarantee that the square root given as the principal value of the square of a number will be equal to the original number; e.g. the principal square root of the square of −2 is 2.

==Calculus==
[[Calculus]] as the mathematical study of infinitesimal change and [[limit of a function|limits]] can lead to mathematical fallacies if the properties of [[integral]]s and [[differential (mathematics)|differentials]] are ignored. For instance, a naive use of [[integration by parts]] can be used to give a false proof that 0 = 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ed|last=Barbeau|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=21|number=3|year=1990|pages=216–218|title=Fallacies, Flaws and Flimflam #19: Dolt's Theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letting &lt;math&gt;\textstyle u = \frac{1}{\log x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle dv = \frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, we may write:

: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = 1 + \int \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

after which the antiderivatives may be cancelled yielding 0 = 1. The problem is that antiderivatives are only defined up to a constant and shifting them by 1 or indeed any number is allowed. The error really comes to light when we introduce arbitrary integration limits ''a'' and ''b''.

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = 1 |_a^b + \int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = 0 + \int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx = \int_a^b \frac{1}{x \, \log x} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

Since the difference between two values of a constant function vanishes, the same definite integral appears on both sides of the equation.

==Power and root==
Fallacies involving disregarding the rules of elementary [[arithmetic]] through an incorrect manipulation of the [[nth root|radical]].

=== Positive and negative roots ===

Care must be taken when taking the [[square root]] of both sides of an [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]. Failing to do so results in a proof of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Fun, Games and Puzzles |edition=illustrated |first1=Jack |last1=Frohlichstein |publisher=Courier Corporation |year=1967 |isbn=0-486-20789-7 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7CVzMosF-kC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=w7CVzMosF-kC&amp;pg=PA207 Extract of page 207]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;5 = 4.&lt;/math&gt;
Proof:
:Start from
::&lt;math&gt;-20 = -20&lt;/math&gt;
:Write this as
::&lt;math&gt;25-45 = 16-36&lt;/math&gt;
:Rewrite as
::&lt;math&gt;5^2-5\times9 = 4^2-4\times9&lt;/math&gt;
:Add &lt;math&gt;81/4&lt;/math&gt; on both sides:
::&lt;math&gt;5^2-5\times9+81/4 = 4^2-4\times9+81/4&lt;/math&gt;
:These are perfect squares:
::&lt;math&gt;(5-9/2)^2 = (4-9/2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:Take the square root of both sides:
::&lt;math&gt;5-9/2 = 4-9/2&lt;/math&gt;
:Add &lt;math&gt;9/2&lt;/math&gt; on both sides:
::&lt;math&gt;5 = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:''[[Q.E.D.]]''

The fallacy is in the second to last line, where the square root of both sides is taken: ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; only implies ''a'' = ''b'' if ''a'' and ''b'' have the same sign, which is not the case here. In this case it implies ''a'' = –''b'' and should read '''5-9/2 = -(4-9/2)''', which, by adding '''9/2''' on both sides, correctly reduces to '''5 = 5'''.

As another example of the danger of taking the square root of both sides of an equation, consider the fundamental identity&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959|loc=Chapter VI, §I.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos^2x=1-\sin^2x&lt;/math&gt;
which holds as a consequence of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Then, by taking a square root,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = \sqrt{1-\sin^2x}&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;1+\cos x = 1+\sqrt{1-\sin^2x}.&lt;/math&gt;
But evaluating this when ''x'' = π implies
:&lt;math&gt;1-1 = 1+\sqrt{1-0}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;0=2&lt;/math&gt;
which is incorrect.

The error in each of these examples fundamentally lies in the fact that any equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = a^2&lt;/math&gt;
has two solutions, provided ''a'' ≠ 0,
:&lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt;
and it is essential to check which of these solutions is relevant to the problem at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1959|loc=Chapter VI, §II}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the above fallacy, the square root that allowed the second equation to be deduced from the first is valid only when cos ''x'' is positive.  In particular, when ''x'' is set to π, the second equation is rendered invalid.

===Squaring both sides of an equation===

When both sides of an equation are squared, sometimes solutions are induced that were not present in the original equation.

An example of this kind of fallacy, is the following invalid proof that &lt;math&gt;-2 = 2&lt;/math&gt;:
:Let
::&lt;math&gt;x = -2.&lt;/math&gt; 
:Squaring gives
::&lt;math&gt;x^2 =  4&lt;/math&gt;
:whereupon taking a square root implies
::&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{4} = 2,&lt;/math&gt;
:so that
::&lt;math&gt;x = -2 = 2, &lt;/math&gt;
:which is absurd. 
When the square root was extracted, it was the ''negative'' root &amp;minus;2, rather than the ''positive'' root, that was relevant for the particular solution in the problem.

=== Square roots of negative numbers ===

Invalid proofs utilizing powers and roots are often of the following kind:
:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=i \cdot i = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

The fallacy is that the rule &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; is generally valid only if both ''x'' and ''y'' are positive (when dealing with real numbers), which is not the case here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of "i" [the square root of minus one] |first1=Paul J. |last1=Nahin |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4008-3029-9 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PflwJdPhBlEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PflwJdPhBlEC&amp;pg=PA12 Extract of page 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, imaginary roots are obfuscated in the following:

:&lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1} = (-1)^\frac{2}{4} = ((-1)^2)^\frac{1}{4} = 1^\frac{1}{4} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The error here lies in the last equality, where we are ignoring the other fourth roots of 1,&lt;ref&gt;In general, the expression &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{1}&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to ''n'' complex numbers, called the [[Root of unity|''n''th roots of unity]].&lt;/ref&gt; which are −1, ''i'' and −''i'' (where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]). Since we have squared our figure and then taken roots, we cannot always assume that all the roots will be correct. So the correct fourth roots are ''i'' and −''i'', which are the imaginary numbers defined to square to −1.

=== Complex exponents ===
When a number is raised to a complex power, the result is not uniquely defined (see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|Failure of power and logarithm identities]]). If this property is not recognized, then errors such as the following can result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e^{2 \pi i} &amp;= 1 \\
(e^{2 \pi i})^{i} &amp;= 1^{i} \\
e^{-2 \pi} &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The error here is that the rule of multiplying exponents as when going to the third line does not apply unmodified with complex exponents, even if when putting both sides to the power {{math|''i''}} only the principal value is chosen.  When treated as [[multivalued function]]s, both sides produce the same set of values, being {{math|1={e&lt;sup&gt;2''πn''&lt;/sup&gt; {{!}} ''n'' ∈ ℤ} }}.

== Geometry ==
Many mathematical fallacies in [[geometry]] arise from using in an additive equality involving oriented quantities (such adding vectors along a given line or adding oriented angles in the plane) a valid identity, but which fixes only the absolute value of (one of) these quantities. This quantity is then incorporated into the equation with the wrong orientation, so as to produce an absurd conclusion. This wrong orientation is usually suggested implicitly by supplying an imprecise diagram of the situation, where relative positions of points or lines are chosen in a way that is actually impossible under the hypotheses of the argument, but non-obviously so. Such a fallacy is easy to expose by drawing a precise picture of the situation, in which some relative positions will be different from those in the provided diagram. In order to avoid such fallacies, a correct geometric argument using addition or subtraction of distances or angles should always prove that quantities are being incorporated with their correct orientation.

=== Fallacy of the isosceles triangle ===
[[File:Fallacy of the isosceles triangle2.svg|thumb]]
The fallacy of the isosceles triangle, from {{harv|Maxwell|1959|loc=Chapter II, § 1}}, purports to show that every [[triangle]] is [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], meaning that two sides of the triangle are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. This fallacy has been attributed to [[Lewis Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Lewis Carroll in Numberland| author=Robin Wilson| pages=169–170| publisher=Penguin Books| isbn=978-0-14-101610-8| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a triangle △ABC, prove that AB = AC:
# Draw a line [[bisection|bisecting]] ∠A
# Draw the perpendicular bisector of segment BC, which bisects BC at a point D
# Let these two lines meet at a point O.
# Draw line OR perpendicular to AB, line OQ perpendicular to AC
# Draw lines OB and OC
# By [[solution of triangles|AAS]], △RAO ≅ △QAO (∠ORA = ∠OQA = 90°; ∠RAO = ∠QAO; AO = AO (common side))
# By [[congruence (geometry)|RHS]],&lt;ref&gt;Hypotenuse-leg congruence&lt;/ref&gt; △ROB ≅ △QOC (∠BRO = ∠CQO = 90°; BO = OC (hypotenuse); RO = OQ (leg))
# Thus, AR = AQ, RB = QC, and AB = AR + RB = AQ + QC = AC
''Q.E.D.''

As a corollary, one can show that all triangles are equilateral, by showing that AB = BC and AC = BC in the same way.

The error in the proof is the assumption in the diagram that the point O is ''inside'' the triangle.  In fact, O always lies at the circumcircle of the △ABC (except for isosceles and equilateral triangles where AO and OD coincide).  Furthermore, it can be shown that, if AB is longer than AC, then R will lie ''within'' AB, while Q will lie ''outside'' of AC (and vice versa).  (Any diagram drawn with sufficiently accurate instruments will verify the above two facts.)  Because of this, AB is still AR + RB, but AC is actually AQ − QC; and thus the lengths are not necessarily the same.

== Proof by induction ==
There exist several fallacious [[Proof by induction|proofs by induction]] in which one of the components, basis case or inductive step, is incorrect. Intuitively, proofs by induction work by arguing that, if a statement is true in one case, it is true in the next case, and hence by repeatedly applying this it can be shown to be true for all cases. This "proof" shows that [[all horses are the same colour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Induction and Analogy in Mathematics | series=Mathematics and plausible reasoning |volume=1 |first = George | last=Pólya | author-link=George Pólya| year=1954 |page=120 | publisher=Princeton}} (The original was that any n girls have the same colour eyes).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Let us say that any group of N horses is all of the same colour.
# If we remove a horse from the group, we have a group of N - 1 horses of the same colour. If we add another horse, we have another group of N horses. By our previous assumption, all the horses are of the same colour in this new group, since it is a group of N horses.
# Thus we have constructed two groups of N horses all of the same colour, with N - 1 horses in common. Since these two groups have some horses in common, the two groups must be of the same colour as each other.
# Therefore, combining all the horses used, we have a group of N + 1 horses of the same colour.
# Thus if any N horses are all the same colour, any N + 1 horses are the same colour.
# This is clearly true for N = 1 (i.e. one horse is a group where all the horses are the same colour). Thus, by induction, N horses are the same colour for any positive integer N. i.e. all horses are the same colour.

The fallacy in this proof arises in line 3. For N = 1, the two groups of horses have N − 1 = 0 horses in common, and thus are not necessarily the same colour as each other, so the group of N + 1 = 2 horses is not necessarily all of the same colour. The implication "Every N horses are of the same colour, then N+1 horses are of the same colour" works for any N greater than one, but fails to be true when N = 1. The basis case is correct, but the induction step has a fundamental flaw. If we were additionally given the fact that any two horses shared the same colour, we could correctly induct from the base case of N = 2.

The game began to be developed in 1996 by two graphic designers and one programmer who met at school: Pavel Pekárka, Michal Pekárka, and Jan Hilgard.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"&gt;https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The musician  Zdeněk Houb was added to the team as co-author of the screenplay. Work on the game initially took place at home on older PCs. Unlike other Czech adventures of the period, this one did not have a humorous element. In addition, the game was notable for having the player see the action through the player's eyes like in [[Asmodeus: Tajemný kraj Ruthaniolu|Asmodeus]] , rather than a third-person view. The developers sought inspiration from the [[LucasArts]]' series of Indiana Jones games.

The game was premiered at the 1998 Invex, and entered into the JRC distribution network. &lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825014259/http://www.future-games.cz/www/posel/posel.htm|title=Future Games - Posel bohů|date=25 August 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became one of the most successful Czech games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/posel-bohu-cst-/Recenze.aspx?c=A000404_poselbohu_bw|title=Posel bohů|date=28 November 1998|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and gameplay==
The payer is archaeological expert Stanislav Novotny, who is on a mission to discover a Mayan mystery. 

The game contains many logical-themed puzzles. It contains 100 game screens,  VGA graphics, professionally dubbed dialogue, and 50 scenic tracks.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
This game was overlooked in many of the local gaming magazines such as Score and Excalibur.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt;

According to Petr Ticháček of Bonusweb,cz, the title is the largest and most difficult game he had ever played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bonusweb.idnes.cz/posel-bohu-navod-02v-/Clanek.aspx?c=A000129_poselbohunavod_bw|title=Posel Bohů - návod|date=28 December 1998|website=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moritz "Morey" Amsterdam''' (December 14, 1908 – October 27, 1996) was an American television actor and comedian.  He was known for the role of Buddy Sorrell on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' from 1961 to 1966.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author=[[David Stout]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/29/arts/morey-amsterdam-comedian-and-joke-encyclopedia-dies.html |title=Morey Amsterdam, Comedian and Joke Encyclopedia, Dies |quote=Morey Amsterdam ... died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was in his 80's. Mr. Amsterdam suffered a heart attack at his home and died at Cedars Sinai Hospital ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 29, 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218152158/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/29/arts/morey-amsterdam-comedian-and-joke-encyclopedia-dies.html |archive-date=December 18, 2015 |dead-url=no |accessdate=August 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Amsterdam was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the youngest of the three sons of  Max and Jennie (Finder) Amsterdam, [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Some biographies list him as born in [[San Francisco]] because his father was a violinist with the [[San Francisco Symphony]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He began working in [[vaudeville]] in 1922 as the [[straight man]] for his older brother's jokes. He was a [[cello|cellist]], a skill he used throughout his career. By 1924, he was working in a [[speakeasy]] operated by [[Al Capone]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

After being caught in the middle of a gunfight, Amsterdam moved to [[California]] and worked writing jokes. His enormous repertoire, and his ability to come up with a joke on any subject, earned him the nickname '''The Human Joke Machine'''. He sometimes performed with a mock machine on his chest, hanging by a strap. He turned a hand crank and paper rolled out; he would then pretend to read the machine's joke, although actually the paper was blank.

Amsterdam's reputation for humor preceded him. [[Hal Block]] tells of Amsterdam walking up Sixth Avenue in [[New York City]] and meeting an old friend. "Where have you been?" the friend asked. "Sick," Amsterdam replied, "I've been in bed with a cold." His friend looked at him and asked, "What's so funny about that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal (republished from ''Collier's'')| date=October 18, 1950| page=M24|last=Block| first=Hal| title=A Comic's Life Isn't Funny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio, songwriting and screenwriting==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
During the 1930s, Amsterdam was a regular on ''[[Al Pearce|The Al Pearce Show]]'' radio program, and by 1937 was the master of ceremonies on ''The Night Club of the Air''. Amsterdam also had a notable career as a songwriter, with his first popular success being "Why Oh Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming".

Amsterdam was credited as the lyricist on the 1945 [[Andrews Sisters]] hit "[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]". However, the original song was written and performed by Trinidadian calypso singer [[Lord Invader]], and composed by [[Lionel Belasco]]. Amsterdam had altered some lyrics for the Andrews Sisters record, and was subsequently involved in a copyright suit over the song, which dragged on until 1948. In the end, Lord Invader was given a substantial royalty payment for having written the lyrics of original piece, while Amsterdam retained the credit (and the publishing rights) for his revised version of the lyric.

In the early 1940s, Amsterdam was a screenwriter, contributing dialogue for two [[East Side Kids]] films. He is listed as screenwriter for the 1943 film ''[[The Ghost and the Guest]]'' and 1944's ''[[Bowery Champs]]''.

By 1947, he was performing on three daily radio shows. Beginning in 1948, he appeared on the radio show ''[[Stop Me If You've Heard This One]]''. ''[[The Morey Amsterdam Show]]'' aired on [[CBS]] radio from July 10, 1948, to February 15, 1949. For three months, it was on both radio and television with different scripts for the same premise and cast. He also did a radio show called the ''Laugh and Swing Club'', broadcasting from the Filmart Theater on Vine Street in Hollywood, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

==Television==
[[File:Morey amsterdam WNBTshow bookmark promotion.jpg|thumb|left|80px|Bookmark promotion for Amsterdam's late night NBC show.]]
''[[The Morey Amsterdam Show]]'' ran on CBS TV from December 1948 to March 1949 and on [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] from April 1949 to October 1950. Among Morey's regular guests was song-and-dance man [[Art Carney]]. The cigarette girl was future author [[Jacqueline Susann]], wife of the producer of the show, [[Irving Mansfield]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Jazz musician [[Johnny Guarnieri|Johnny Guarneri]] led the band.

In 1950, he briefly hosted the comedy-variety show ''[[Broadway Open House]]'', TV's first late-night entertainment show, on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; One of the pioneering TV creations of NBC president [[Sylvester "Pat" Weaver|Pat Weaver]], it demonstrated the potential for late-night programming and led to the later development of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref name=alex&gt;McNeil, Alex. ''Total Television: a Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present''. Penguin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was originally to be hosted by comic [[Don Hornsby|Don "Creesh" Hornsby]] (so nicknamed because he yelled "Creesh" often), but he died of [[polio]] two weeks before the premiere broadcast. Hornsby's replacements, hosting different nights each week, were Amsterdam (Monday and Wednesday) and the raucous [[Jerry Lester]] (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays), the brother of character actor [[Buddy Lester]]. Amsterdam soon exited the show, leaving Lester the sole host.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In February 1952, Amsterdam made his dramatic TV debut on an episode of the DuMont Television Network series ''[[Not for Publication (DuMont TV series)|Not for Publication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, he appeared as "Jack Connors" in the third episode ("The Three Pretenders") of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire (TV series)|How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', with [[Barbara Eden]] and [[Merry Anders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Marry a Millionaire: The Three Pretenders|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0606170|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dick van dyke show 1962.JPG|thumb|180px|Amsterdam as Buddy, in this episode the house guest of Rob and Laura Petrie on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1962)]]
In 1958, he appeared as saloon manager Lucien Bellingham in an episode of the CBS [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]'' entitled "The Moor's Revenge". He later guest-starred on the CBS sitcom ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'', with [[Harry Morgan]] and [[Cara Williams]].

His best-known role was as comedy writer Buddy Sorrell on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', a role suggested for him by his friend [[Rose Marie]], who also appeared on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Vince|title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book|publisher=Chicago Review Press|edition=3|year=2011|location=Chicago|pages=51–52|isbn=978-1-56976-839-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's creator, [[Carl Reiner]], based the character on his old friend [[Mel Brooks]], with whom he worked on the writing staff of ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''. Like Amsterdam himself, Buddy had a ready quip for any situation, and one of the show's most popular running gags was his insult-laden feud with producer Mel Cooley ([[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]]). Buddy was also one of the rare overtly Jewish characters on TV in that era, with one episode revolving around his belated decision to have a Bar Mitzvah. Amsterdam also wrote lyrics for the show's theme song, which were never heard on the air, but have been performed by [[Dick Van Dyke]] in concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Vince|title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book|publisher=Chicago Review Press|edition=3|year=2011|location=Chicago|page=379|isbn=978-1-56976-839-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dyke sang those lyrics on the October 23, 2010 edition of the NPR show ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Available as transcript and audio [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130739954 WWDTM 10-23-10], npr.org; accessed January 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amsterdam was an occasional panelist on ''[[Match Game]]'' and the short-lived ''[[Can You Top This?]]'' (which he also executive produced) during the 1970s. He appeared as a small-time criminal in several episodes of the soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' in the 1990s. Amsterdam and Rose Marie later appeared as panelists on ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' and guest-starred together in a February 1996 episode of the NBC sitcom ''[[Caroline in the City]]'' (his final TV appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025440/|title=Morey Amsterdam|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Amsterdam appeared in the low-budget film ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' with [[Charles Bronson]], and he did a notable dramatic turn in the 1960 noir classic ''[[Murder, Inc. (1960 film)|Murder, Inc.]]'' as Catskill nightclub owner Walter Sage, the first victim (according to the film) of the newly minted Murder, Incorporated.

Amsterdam played Cappy, owner of the local nightclub, in the ''[[Beach Party]]'' movies of the 1960s, which were produced by [[American International Pictures]], of which he was vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-morey-amsterdam-19961029-snap-20161027-story.html|title=From the Archives: Morey Amsterdam; 'Buddy' on 'Dick Van Dyke Show' - Los Angeles Times|last=Writer|first=Myrna Oliver, Times Staff|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Rose Marie also co-starred in the 1966 film, ''[[Don't Worry, We'll Think of a Title]]'', a comedy co-written and co-produced by Amsterdam. The film features [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]], their co-star on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', with [[cameo appearance|cameos]] by the show's co-producer [[Danny Thomas]] and co-star [[Carl Reiner]]. His later roles included appearances in ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1968), ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'' (1976), ''[[When Nature Calls]]'' (1985) and ''Side by Side'' (1988).

==Death==
Amsterdam died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Cedars Sinai Hospital]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California, on October 27, 1996, at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=intamst&gt;Vallance, Tom, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-morey-amsterdam-1350735.html "Obituary: Morey Amsterdam "], ''[[The Independent]]'' (London), November 4, 1996.

He was entombed at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

'''Nick Gillard''' is an English [[stunt man]] and [[stunt coordinator|coordinator]]. He is best known as the technical [[lightsaber]] choreographer and stunt coordinator for the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequels]].

==Biography==

Gillard was born in [[Brighton, England]]

At the age of twelve, Gillard ran away from [[military school]] to join the circus where he performed as bareback horse rider. Over the next few years Gillard worked with several circus's including [[Circus Althoff]] in Germany and [[Los Muchachos Circus]] in Spain. Gillard was invited to do [[stunts]] on ''[[The Thief of Baghdad (1978 film)|The Thief of Baghdad]]''. He enjoyed it, and later left the circus to perform stunt work in films, including the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'']].&lt;ref name=sw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/bio/nickgillard.html |title=Star Wars: Bio – Nick Gillard |publisher=Lucasfilm  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030808175631/http://www.starwars.com/bio/nickgillard.html |archivedate=8 August 2003 |accessdate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars/18028/star-wars-den-of-geek-goes-jedi-training-with-nick-gillard |title=Star Wars: Den of Geek goes Jedi training with Nick Gillard |work=Den of Geek |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a stunt man, Gillard held the world record for longest fire stunt, with a fire burn without air for over two minutes on ''[[Alien 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WtG8KF73Rc4C&amp;q=%22nick+gillard%22+guinness&amp;dq=%22nick+gillard%22+guinness&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gqcXUdr8BMuM0QH-5oGYCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA Guinness Book of Records]&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed a 200-foot power boat jump over two bridges in the film ''[[Amsterdamned]]'', and was set on fire over 100 times.&lt;ref name=sw/&gt;

He had a minor role in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' as [[Jedi Master]] Cin Drallig ("Nic Gillard" spelled backwards) and was [[Mark Hamill]]'s first choice as his stunt double for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Among his movie credits are ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''.

'''Nickelodeon India''' is an Indian children's pay television network based in [[Mumbai]]. It is the Indian equivalent to the [[Nickelodeon|original American network]] and is owned by [[Viacom 18]], a joint venture between [[Viacom]] and [[TV18]]. Nick India is available in four languages: [[Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].

==History==
Nickelodeon India was launched on 16 October 1999 and was initially picked up by [[Zee TV]].&lt;ref name="Nick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/news_analysis/newsletter/111099/zee111099.htm|title=ZEE TV TO LAUNCH NICKELODEON|date=October 11, 1999|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Zee TV]] launched a Nickelodeon-branded programming block as part of a distribution deal between Viacom International and [[Zee Entertainment Enterprises]]. It was replaced by the [[Cartoon Network India|Cartoon Network]] block in 2002.&lt;ref name=Cartoon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/y2k2/aug/aug87.htm|title=Cartoon Network block replaces Nick on Zee TV|date=August 14, 2002|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Viacom revamped Nickelodeon in India to increase its viewership, including branding it as Nick, local productions and starting Hindi feed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationxpress.com/index.php/interviews/nickelodeon-india-business-and-operations-head-pradeep-hejmadi|title=Nickelodeon India business and operations head Pradeep Hejmadi  - AnimationXpressAnimationXpress|website=www.animationxpress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k4/may/may182.htm|title=Nick to get 'MTV India treatment' for makeover|date=2004-05-22|work=Indian Television Dot Com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viacom signed a programming deal with [[Sun Network]] in 2007 according to which Nickelodeon shows will air on [[Chutti TV]] dubbed in Tamil and Telugu. This deal was later cancelled when Nickelodeon decided to add Tamil and Telugu language tracks to their own channel.&lt;ref name=Tar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k9/dec/dec197.php|title=Sun's Chutti TV targets 25% ad growth in 2010|date=19 December 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2010 Nick India rebranded using the current logo.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programmes broadcast by Nickelodeon (India)}}

In the channel's first years of broadcasting it aired mostly original programmes from the US, like ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[Aaahh! Real Monsters]]'', ''[[As Told by Ginger]]'', ''[[Rocket Power]]'', ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'' and other animated shows such as ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[The Angry Beavers]]'', ''[[CatDog]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. The network also aired live action shows, such as ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]'', ''[[Drake &amp; Josh]]'', ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'', ''[[Legends of the Hidden Temple]]'', Nick Bites and many more.

After the success of international game shows Nick India produced two local game shows, ''Dum Dama Dum''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k4/nov/nov86.htm|title=Nick brings 'Double Dare' Hindi version|date=2004-11-09|work=Indian Television Dot Com|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Gilli Gilli Gappa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k6/mar/mar175.htm|title=Nick launches "Gilli Gilli Gappa" on Holi|date=March 14, 2006|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They launched [[Krrish (franchise)#J Bole Toh Jadoo .282003.29|''J Bole Toh Jadoo'']], a spin-off series of 2003's ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]''. The series premiered on 14 November 2005 on [[Children's Day]].

In 2006 Nick India started acquiring Japanese series such as [[Ninja Hattori-kun|''Ninja Hattori'']], [[Perman (manga)#Anime|''Perman'']] and ''[[Mighty Cat Masked Niyander]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationxpress.com/index.php/animation/nick-scores-hat-trick-with-new-shows-on-board|title=Nick scores hat trick with new shows on board  - AnimationXpressAnimationXpress|website=www.animationxpress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick started airing [[Colors TV|Colors]]'s Mythological show ''[[Jai Shri Krishna]]'' in 2009. The show was re-edited and customised for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afaqs.com/news/story/23109_Colors-to-share-Jai-Shri-Krishna-with-Nick-but-with-a-different-touch|title=Colors to share Jai Shri Krishna with Nick, but with a different touch|date=January 16, 2009|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also acquired ''[[Little Krishna]]'', an animated series produced by BIG Animation India and The Indian Heritage Foundation in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-others/tp-variety/animation-series-little-krishna-debut-on-may-11/article1051136.ece|title=Animation series ‘Little Krishna’ debut on May 11|date=May 7, 2009|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickelodeon India from 2011 started producing local animated programming and launched ''[[Keymon Ache]]'' and a theatrical movie based on the series.&lt;ref name=Key&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov62.php|title=Nick's Keymon Ache to make its theatrical debut on 9 November|date=November 6, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local strategy became successful with ''[[Motu Patlu]]'' in 2012 and they later launched more local animated series like ''[[Pakdam Pakdai]]'' in 2013, ''[[Shiva (animated TV series)|Shiva]]'' in 2015, ''[[Gattu Battu]]'' in 2017 and ''[[Rudra: Boom Chik Chik Boom|Rudra]]'' in 2018. 

Nickelodeon India for a long time has been giving less importance on American original series. Many of the [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio#Nickelodeon (main shows)|animated shows]] have been neglected by the channel and even internationally popular shows like ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' haven't had a proper run on the channel. The probable cause of this is due to the channel's low ratings and failure to gain relevance with the children in its first years of broadcasting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/interviews/y2k7/executive/Nina_Jaipuria.htm|title='The focus for Nick in 2007 is to drive reach' : Nina Elavia Jaipuria - Nick India vice president &amp; general manager|date=2007-02-12|work=Indian Television Dot Com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Nick Jr. (India)|Nick Jr.]] also wasn't in a good condition until 2012 when the dedicated channel launched and the new [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio#Noggin/Nick Jr. Network (preschool shows)|shows from Nick Jr.]] started airing. Nick India did not even broadcast live action series such as [[ICarly|''iCarly'']] until several years later with the launch of the now-discontinued [[TeenNick (India)|TeenNick]] block on [[Nick Jr. (India)|Nick Jr. India]]. Nina Elavia Jaipuria, the head of Nickelodeon India says live action shows do not connect with the viewers as much as animated shows do, even with dubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bestmediainfo.com/2018/06/ad-rate-correction-alone-will-not-correct-the-index-says-nick-s-nina-elavia-jaipuria/|title=Ad rate correction alone will not correct the index, says Nick’s Nina Elavia Jaipuria|website=www.bestmediaifo.com|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionpost.com/our-gameplan-is-to-maximise-market-and-revenue-share/|title=‘Our gameplan is to maximise market and revenue share’ – TelevisionPost: Latest News, India’s Television, Cable, DTH,  TRAI|website=www.televisionpost.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Nick HD+ changed its schedule with a larger focus on original Nickelodeon shows from the US, while the standard-definition Nick channel continues to only show locally made series for the masses.

'''''Nirvanna the Band the Show''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] mockumentary television series based on the [[web series]] of the same name, created by and starring [[Matt Johnson (director)|Matt Johnson]] and Jay McCarrol. It premiered on February 2, 2017 on [[Viceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/awards-and-festivals/tiff/matt-johnson-the-enemy-inside-tiffs-gates/article31793991/ |title='Can-con bad boy' Matt Johnson: Meet the enemy inside TIFF’s gates |publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' |date=September 9, 2016 |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has been renewed for a third season and there are plans for a fourth.

==Premise==
The show stars the duo as "Nirvanna the Band," two hapless lifelong best friends and roommates, who engage in a series of complex [[publicity stunt]]s around their home city of [[Toronto]] in the hopes of landing a gig at [[The Rivoli]], despite the fact that they have never actually written or recorded a single song, nor taken any other steps to get their band ready.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/television/nirvanna-the-band-the-show-is-back-viceland-september-2016/ |title=Nirvanna the Band the Show is back – but this time it's bigger and on proper TV |publisher=''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'' |date=June 6, 2016 |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The show is a combination of scripted scenes, candid camera footage of people unaware the show is being filmed, and improvisation. Often times the show is influenced by events that happen in reality. For example, in the fifth episode, "The Big Time", creators Johnson and McCarrol used the premiere of Johnson's real life movie ''[[Operation Avalanche (film)|Operation Avalanche]]'' at the [[2016 Sundance Film Festival]] to film an episode around the concept of the character Matt sneaking a fictional movie of the same name into the festival. In the same episode, a woman unaware of the show being filmed intrudes on a scripted conversation between Johnson and [[Kevin Smith]] (appearing as himself), offering Johnson alcohol, which inspired Johnson and McCarrol to include the concept of the character of Matt discovering a love of alcohol in the episode. The show frequently blends the line between fiction and reality in ways like these, with actors breaking character and characters breaking the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjWd0a7wS4E|title=Thoughts on Nirvanna the Band the Show|last=|first=|date=|website=Youtube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally created as web series between 2007 and 2009, it was later expanded into a full television series which premiered on [[Viceland]] on February 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/film/article/nirvanna_the_band_the_show-created_by_matt_johnson_and_jay_mccarrol |title=nirvanna the band the show |publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]'' |date=September 11, 2016 |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cartt.ca/article/viceland%E2%80%99s-original-comedy-%E2%80%98nirvanna-band-show%E2%80%99-arrives-february-2 |title=Viceland’s original comedy ‘Nirvanna the Band the Show’ arrives February 2 |publisher=''Cartt.ca'' |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three episodes were also screened at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]] as part of its ''Primetime'' program of television projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/television/nirvanna-the-band-to-premiere-at-tiff-2016/ |title=Nirvanna the Band the Show to premiere at TIFF |publisher=''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'' |date=August 3, 2016 |accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was originally announced in 2016 as slated to air on [[City (TV network)|City]], but was later shifted to Viceland with City airing only the first episode as a preview special. The second season has not been picked up for broadcast outside of Canada, however is available for streaming in Australia via [[SBS_(Australian_TV_channel)#SBS_On_Demand|SBS On Demand]] and in Britain via [[Channel 4]] On Demand.

The characters, Matt and Jay, are based on characters McCarrol and Johnson started developing in high school in Mississauga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/nirvanna-the-band-the-show-viceland-matt-johnson-jay-mccarrol/ |title=Nirvanna the Band the Show puts Toronto front and centre in hilarious new show for VICELAND |publisher=''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'' |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The show has received mostly positive reviews.

Jake Howell of [[The Globe and Mail]] praised the show, commenting "Bickering like a married couple, Matt and Jay's constant back-and-forth enabling, backstabbing and belittling of each other has thus far made for great television."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/why-arent-people-watching-nirvanna-the-band-the-show/article36786267/|title=Why aren’t people watching Nirvanna the Band the Show?|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calum Marsh of [[National Post]] gave the series a positive review, stating "The intricate arrangement of jokes, careful plotting of action and meticulous orchestration of references demand considerably more from an audience than one tends to expect of a mainstream sitcom."

While Kate Robertson of NOW Toronto was critical of the show's racist jokes saying "The pop culture references are always 90s, and the show aims to preserve a certain part of Toronto that many of us associate with those years. There’s also an uneasy, dated quality to it. Things have changed: ironic racist jokes of the past were never funny after all. They were just excuses to be shocking and racist. Maybe gags like this are an effort to highlight the persistent prejudices from the beginning of political correctness in the 90s, but it’s still a show programmed for a 2017 audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/nirvanna-the-band-the-show-season-two/|title=TV review: Nirvanna The Band The Show's nostalgia schtick is starting to feel dated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Private Duty Nurses''''' is a 1971 film written and directed by [[George Armitage]]. It is a sequel to ''[[The Student Nurses]]'' (1970) for [[New World Pictures]]. [[Roger Corman]] says they got the idea for the title after being sent a letter of complaint about the first film from the Private Duty Nurses Association.&lt;ref name="New World"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher T|last= Koetting|title=Mind Warp!: The Fantastic True Story of Roger Corman's New World Pictures|publisher=Hemlock Books|year= 2009 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was followed by ''[[Night Call Nurses]]'' (1972).

*Joseph Kaufmann as Dr. Selden
*Dennis Redfield as Domino

==Production==
George Armitage had made a few films for Roger Corman, acting in ''[[Von Richtofen and Brown]]'' and writing and acting in ''[[Gas-s-s-s]]''. He wanted to direct. Armitage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Peter Bogdanovich]] and Francis [Ford Coppola] had left working with Roger, so there was an opening there for directors, I asked him if I could direct, and he said sure. He said: “Would you like to do a nurse movie or a stewardess move?” I said I’d like to do a stewardess movie, and he said: “Okay, well then you can do the nurse movie.” Okay! Anyways, I got into it, and I wrote the script, and I got Everett Chambers, from ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', a crew of some TV guys that I’d worked with, and some young commercial crew. This fellow called [[Fouad Said]] had invented this thing called Cinemobile... and I used it to film on location. I did everything on location... I shot the whole movie in the South Bay, Manhattan Beach—it’s exactly the same place and time period that [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] used in ''[[Inherent Vice]]''.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-george-armitage/|first= Nick |last=Pinkerton|title=Interview with George Armitage|website=Film Comment|date=28 April 2015|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Armitage was familiar with the Manhattan beach area having surfed there when he was younger.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.money-into-light.com/search/label/Interview%3A%20GEORGE%20ARMITAGE%20%28PART%201%20OF%203%29|website=Money Into Light|title=Interview with George Armitage - Part One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armitage said the film had to feature sex but he put in a let-down sex scene at the beginning.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was talking to the girls and they said: “Hey, why don’t you do a guy who’s just a lousy lay. Sometimes you run into that.” And I thought that’d be perfect for the South Bay, because it was a pretty crazy culture going on down there at the time, so that’s what we did.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Armitage heard about the band Sky, went to see them perform at a high school, and cast them in the film.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

Armitage says Corman left him alone for most of the film.
&lt;blockquote&gt;He wanted us to do whatever we felt, what we were thinking of poetically, socially, culturally at the time. So I tried to look at it from a woman’s point-of-view, adding my own feelings about what was going on. Corman and I got along very well. I didn’t like the way Hollywood treated him—he was kind of an underdog and I loved the fact that he would just say, “Here, go make the movie.” He never came to the set, he totally allowed us to do what we were doing... And ''Private Duty Nurses'' was done in 15 days.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''ROH World Television Championship''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[Championship (professional wrestling)#Gimmick/style championships|world television championship]] in the [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. With the introduction of the ROH World Television Championship, the [[Championship (professional wrestling)#Gimmick/style championships|television type championship]] returned to national exposure.&lt;ref name="PWTorchannounced"/&gt;

There has been a total of seventeen reigns shared between fourteen champions. The first champion was crowned on March 5, 2010, when [[Eddie Edwards (wrestler)|Eddie Edwards]] defeated [[Davey Richards]] in the finals of a tournament.&lt;ref name="WOROHTVChamp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WVROHTVApril26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVtapingsnight2"/&gt;

The current champion is [[Jeff Cobb]], who is in his first reign.&lt;ref name="Martinez1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/06/17/6-16-roh-in-dallas-results-new-roh-tv-champion-crowned-the-briscoes-vs-killer-elite-squad-for-the-roh-tag-titles-cody-vs-shane-taylor-the-young-bucks-vs-the-boys-jay-lethal-vs-marty-scurll-vs/|title=6/16 ROH in Dallas results: New ROH TV Champion crowned, The Briscoes vs. Killer Elite Squad for the ROH Tag Titles, Cody vs. Shane Taylor, The Young Bucks vs. The Boys, Jay Lethal vs. Marty Scurll vs. Flip Gordon |last=Powell|first=Jason|date=2018-06-17|work=[[Ring of Honor]]|&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Lethal's second reign is the longest in the title's history. During that reign, Lethal also won the [[ROH World Championship]] in a Title vs. Title match at [[Best in the World 2015]].

==History==
The creation of the ROH World Television Championship was announced via ROH's official website on January 20, 2010.&lt;ref name="PWTorchannounced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WVannounced"/&gt; An [[Single-elimination tournament|eight-man single elimination tournament]] was then planned to determine the inaugural champion. The tournament was to start on February 4 and conclude on February 6, 2010 at [[The Arena (Philadelphia)|The Arena]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] at the [[Broadcast delay|tapings]] of ROH's television program ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]''.&lt;ref name="WVannounced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1264017860|title=Ring of Honor to add new TV title|last=Gerweck|first=Steve|date=2010-01-20|work=[[Ring of Honor]]|publisher=WrestleView.com|accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the new championship addition, ROH President Cary Silkin said, "We’ve been talking about adding a secondary championship for some time. Not only will this give the athletes of Ring of Honor another tremendous goal to work towards, it will also give our great partner, HDNet, a championship that is sure to be defended on the television program. We’re happy to publicly give thanks to HDNet for giving us the chance to add this title to the television show...".&lt;ref name="WVannounced"/&gt;

It is ROH's second secondary singles championship in their history. The [[ROH Pure Championship]] was used from February 14, 2004 to August 12, 2006, prior its [[Championship unification#Professional wrestling|unification]] with the [[ROH World Championship]].&lt;ref name="titlehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/rohpuretitle.php|title=ROH Pure Championship reign history|publisher=ROH Wrestling.com|accessdate=2010-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404064124/http://www.rohwrestling.com/rohpuretitle.php &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the championship announcement, wrestling columnist James Caldwell gave his comments: "I like the idea. It gives mid-card wrestlers on ROH's roster something to fight for in the context of trying to win a wrestling match to "move up the company ladder." Caldwell further remarked that "ROH bringing back the TV Title to national TV is consistent with ROH's current marketing under Jim Cornette to "re-capture an old-school flavor" to their product."&lt;ref name="PWTorchannounced"/&gt;

After the ''Ring of Honor Wrestling'' show was cancelled in March 2011, the title became inactive. Although Daniels stopped defending it, he still carried the belt with him as part of his villainous character. With the sale of ROH to the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] and a new television show scheduled to air in September, ROH reinstated the title for June's Best in The World event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Will Represent ROH On Broadcast TV?|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/who-will-represent-roh-on-broadcast-tv/|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=ROH TV Title match announced for "Best in the World" Internet PPV this month|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_50599.shtml|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2011-06-08|date=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tournament===
The tournament was scheduled to span over a two-day weekend, starting on February 5 and ending on February 6 at events recorded for later broadcast on ''Ring of Honor Wrestling''.&lt;ref name="WVannounced"/&gt; However, due to [[February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard#Mid-Atlantic|severe weather conditions]] in the Philadelphia area, the second day of taping was canceled.&lt;ref name="cancel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38804.shtml|title=Ring of Honor cancels tonight's ROH TV taping |last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-02-06|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belt designs===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ROH TV Title 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=A black leather championship belt covered by decorative silver plates.|A close-up of the center plate of the first design (2010-2012) of the ROH World Television Championship belt]] --&gt;
The championship belt was introduced on March 5, 2010, when it was given to the newly crowned inaugural champion Eddie Edwards.&lt;ref name="WOROHTVChamp"/&gt; The physical championship belt was designed All Star Championship Belts d/b/a ASCB, LLC. The title's base is a black leather strap that is covered with four small silver plates. The center of the title has one large silver plate. All plates have an inner blue covering. The two small outer plates have a caricature of the earth and a [[satellite]] in [[orbit]]. The middle plates have figures resembling a [[camera operator|cameraman]] filming a television production. Underneath each figure, lies the ROH logo and the words "Ring of Honor Wrestling". The central plate has the engravings of the ROH logo as well as the statement "World Television Wrestling Champion" hovering above the backdrop of a city, with a television lying on top of a globe with an overhead shot of a wrestling ring between them in front of the [[skyline]].&lt;ref group="N" name="design"&gt;This description is based on the first design of the ROH World Television Championship, as seen in the images throughout the article.&lt;/ref&gt; The design was changed again in November 2012 to its current design during the reign of Adam Cole, the new design seemed to be based on the [[WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name="tvresults"&gt;[http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/roh-tv-results ROH TV Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124200616/http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/roh-tv-results |date=2013-01-24 }}, rohwrestling.com&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Jay Lethal]]'s record-setting reign, the belt design was modified to emphasize the "ROH Champion" portion of the title, with Lethal claiming the championship was more prestigious than the [[ROH World Championship]] because he was the champion.

On January 1, 2018, ROH announced on their YouTube page that their World Tag, Six Man World Tag Team, and World Television Championships will receive new designs which will debut at the next set of television tapings.

==Champions==
Overall, there have been 20 reigns by 16 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Eddie Edwards, who defeated Davey Richards in the finals of an eight-man tournament on March 5, 2010.&lt;ref name="WOROHTVChamp"/&gt; 

The current champion is [[Jeff Cobb]], who is in his first reign as champion. He defeated [[Punishment Martinez]] on September 29, 2018 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] during the [[Death Before Dishonor XVI]] TV tapings.

'''''Radio Oranje''''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈraːdijoː ˌoːˈrɑn.jə|}}; [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: "Radio Orange") was a Dutch-language radio programme on the [[BBC]] European Service managed by the [[Dutch government-in-exile]] and broadcast to the occupied Netherlands during [[World War II]]. It was broadcast from [[London]], and was broadcast for 15 minutes at 9PM each day.

The first broadcast occurred on 28 July 1940, when [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] made a speech. In total, Wilhelmina spoke on ''Radio Oranje'' 34 times during the course of the war.

The '''Original SWAT World Challenge''' is an annual competition of law enforcement [[SWAT]] teams. It is usually held close to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], USA and its goals are to encourage exchange of ideas/techniques and promote the high level of tactical skills, mental focus and physical endurance possessed by SWAT Teams.

== History ==

The event began in 2004 under its original name of World SWAT Challenge and was won by San Antonio, Texas. In 2005, Germany's [[GSG 9]] won all eight events and in 2006 won four of the eight events maintaining its top SWAT World Challenge ranking. The event was renamed Original SWAT World Challenge in 2005 when the tactical footwear company Original SWAT became title sponsor, and has since been expanded into the World SWAT Series which will include regional competitions capable of hosting 25-30 competing teams. The first of these was the Northeastern SWAT Challenge in late 2006, followed in 2007 by the addition of the Rocky Mountain Tactical Challenge, and a Mid-Western SWAT Challenge in 2008. These regional events follow the same format of the OSWC but with six events rather than eight, and are not limited to thirty teams.

[[OLN]] televised the 2007 event which was held 24–28 April close to Little Rock, Arkansas at [[Camp Joseph T. Robinson]] ([[United States National Guard|National Guard]] Base). This could become the regular venue for the competition. Original SWAT Footwear Company has discontinued its sponsorship of the event, and is now the title sponsor of the 2008 Original SWAT Tactical World Cup.

== Events ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}

These are the current rankings of the competing teams as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swatseries.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110716171629/http://www.swatseries.com/ |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are designated from their city/state or country of origin.

'''Schwabing''' is a [[borough]] in the northern part of [[Munich]], the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Bavaria]]. It is divided into the city borough 4 (Schwabing-West) and the city borough 12 (Schwabing-Freimann). The main boulevard is [[Leopoldstraße]].&lt;ref name="DK 2015"&gt;{{cite book|first1=D.

==Overview==

[[File:WalkingMan 7663.jpg|thumb|[[Walking Man (sculpture)|Walking Man]]]]

Schwabing used to be famous as Munich's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] quarter and is still popular among tourists and locals, especially young people, for its accumulation of bars, clubs, and restaurants.&lt;ref name="Hemminger 2012"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Patrick|last1=Hemminger|accessdate=2018-06-12|title=Münchner Boulevard|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/leopoldstrasse-muenchner-boulevard-1.1461916|newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=German|date=7 September 2012|issn=0174-4917|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular location is the ''[[Englischer Garten]]'', or English Garden, one of the world's largest public parks. (Other not so commonly known parks in Schwabing are: [[Leopoldpark]], [[Petuelpark]] and [[Biotop am Ackermannbogen]]).

The main buildings of Munich's largest [[university|universities]], [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universität]] and the [[Technical University of Munich]] and [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] are situated in the nearby [[Maxvorstadt]]. A student housing area called "[[Studentenstadt]]" (literally, "student city") is located in the north of Schwabing.

Schwabing became very famous especially during the reign of Prince Regent [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]] when numerous artists like [[Ludwig Ganghofer]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Oskar Panizza]], [[Otto Julius Bierbaum]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Ernst von Wolzogen]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Isolde Kurz]], [[Ludwig Thoma]], [[Max Halbe]], [[Annette Kolb]], [[Stefan George]], [[Karl Wolfskehl]], [[Ludwig Klages]], [[Roda Roda]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Max Dauthendey]], [[Mechtilde Lichnowsky]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Leonhard Frank]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]], [[Claire Goll]], [[Oskar Maria Graf]], [[Hugo Ball]], [[Hermann Kesten]], [[Thomas Theodor Heine]], [[Olaf Gulbransson]], [[Bruno Paul]], [[Eduard Thöny]] and [[Rudolf Wilke]] lived or worked there. [[Lenin]] was a resident of Schwabing for some years, as was noted psychoanalyst and bohemian [[Otto Gross]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer E. Michaels (1983) ''Anarchy and Eros: Otto Gross' Impact on German Expressionist Writers'': 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Countess [[Fanny zu Reventlow]] was known as "The Bohemian Countess of Schwabing".

The [[gentrification]] of Schwabing and various construction projects have led to protests, as around 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130603113436/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/muenchen/konstantin-wecker-interview-sollen-die-normalverdiener-rausziehen-1.1098447 Konstantin Wecker: Interview „Sollen die Normalverdiener rausziehen?

'''Wenceslao Moreno''' (April 17, 1896 – April 20, 1999),&lt;ref name=TV&gt;[http://www.tv.com/senor-wences/person/142481/summary.html Senor Wences], [[TV.com]], accessed 5 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''Señor Wences''', was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]]. His popularity grew with his frequent appearances on [[CBS|CBS-TV]]'s ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1999/04/19241 "Passage: Wenceslao Moreno, 103"], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', 21 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wenceslao Moreno was born in [[Peñaranda de Bracamonte]], [[Salamanca]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; His father was Antonio Moreno Ros, and his mother was Josefa Centeno Lavera. Both parents were born in the province of Salamanca, his father in Peñaranda de Bracamonte and his mother in Cordovilla. Señor Wences's family on both sides were Roman Catholic. Señor Wences was one of the benefactors of the Convent of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]] (1515-1582) in [[Alba de Tormes]], Salamanca, where he had a house. He attended Mass there every Sunday when vacationing during the summer. The street that leads to the convent received the name of Señor Wences while he was alive. Several other places in Salamanca and in [[Castile (historical region)|Castille]] have streets named for him.

At age 15, he became a bullfighter, however had to give-up the sport after a serious injury.  Doctors advised him to exercise his injured arm so he learned to juggle and joined friends' circus act.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

==Career==
Performing under the [[stage name]] "Señor Wences", Moreno was known for his speed, skill, and grace as a ventriloquist. His stable of characters included Johnny, a childlike face drawn on his hand, placed atop an otherwise headless doll, with whom the ventrilloquist conversed while switching voices between Johnny's [[falsetto]] and his own voice with great speed. He opened his act by drawing Johnny's face on his hand, on stage. He would first place his thumb next to, and in front of, his bent first finger; the first finger would be the upper lip, and the thumb the lower lip. He used lipstick to draw the lips onto the respective fingers and then drew eyes onto the upper part of the first finger, finishing the effect with a tiny long-haired wig on top of his hand. Flexing the thumb would move the "lips."  The inspiration for Johnny came from his school days when the teacher punished him for imitating classmates and answering "present" when they were absent.  His punishment was to clean the inkwells and he smeared some of the ink on his hand, then clenched his fist to create the face.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news| title=Senor Wences, 103; Ventriloquist Made 'S'awright' a Household Word| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/21/news/mn-29535| date=21 April 1999| last=Brownfield| first=Paul| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular Señor Wences character was the gruff-voiced Pedro, a disembodied head in a box. Wences was forced to suddenly invent the character when his regular, full-sized dummy was destroyed&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt; during a 1936 train accident en route to Chicago.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Pedro would either "speak" from within the closed box, or speak with moving lips{{spaced ndash}}simply growling, "s'awright" ("it's all right"){{spaced ndash}}when the performer opened the box's front panel with his free hand. A large part of the entertainer's comedy lay in the well-timed, high-speed exchange of words between himself and his creations, and in the difference in their voice pitches.

Part of his act involved throwing his voice while his mouth was otherwise engaged (i.e. smoking or drinking.) Another favorite prop was a telephone, with the ventriloquist playing both sides of a telephone conversation. For the "caller" he simulated a "filtered" voice, as it would sound over a telephone wire. This voice always began a conversation with a shouted "Moreno?"{{spaced ndash}}using Señor Wences' true surname. He would respond "No, Moreno is not here."

He usually built to a big finish that combined ventriloquism with [[juggling]] and [[plate-spinning]]. As he performed his routines, Pedro and Johnny heckled him.
[[File:Senor Wences 1962.JPG|thumb|180px|Wences with another of his puppet characters, Cecilia Chicken, in 1962]]
Although he was an international favorite for decades, his main career was made in the United States, where he arrived in 1934 or 1935.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref name =AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In addition to live performances at nightclubs, he appeared regularly on TV [[variety show]]s, including frequent appearances on CBS's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', where he was a guest 48 times,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Severo, Richard. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E3D9173AF932A15757C0A96F958260 Senor Wences, Ventriloquist Who Was a TV Regular, 103"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino theaters and in feature films.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Much later in his career he was introduced to a new generation of fans on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. His last TV appearance was on ''The Very Best of the Ed Sullivan Show #2'', a retrospective in which the nonagenarian talked about "Suliban" and performed a brief spot of ventriloquism.

He pronounced his name the traditional [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] way, which in English sounds like "WEN-thess". After Sullivan would announce him saying his name as "Señor Wen-sess", the ventriloquist would subtly correct Sullivan's pronunciation by announcing himself to the audience: "Hello, I am Señor Wen-thess".

In the early 1980s, a [[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|Tri-State]] [[Honda]] dealer's commercial featured Señor Wences with Johnny. Pedro's "s'awright" was a voice from the elaborate [[glovebox]]. Señor Wences would point out all of the car's features to which Johnny would reply, "Nice!" This may have been Wences final commercial appearance. It was shot in [[Puerto Rico]] because its star declined to travel to New York. In 1986, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Garry Shandling Show]]''.

In 2009 Señor Wences was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary ''I'm No Dummy'', directed by [[Bryan W. Simon]].&lt;ref name=Dummy&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/| website=[[IMDb]]| title=I'm No Dummy| accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DCR&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165| journal=Digital Cinema Report| title=Hollywood’s Corporate Delusion| date=9 June 2009| last=Dager| first=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catch phrases===
One of Wences's trademark bits of [[shtick]] (referenced several times below) involves his dialogue with a low voice emanating from inside a box. At the opening of the dialogue he would shout, "Hello in the box!" At the conclusion of the dialogue, he would open the lid of the box and ask "S'aright?" ("It's all right?") and the box voice would answer "S'ariiight!"

Another involved explaining to his hand puppet Johnny that something was easy (or difficult) to do, to which the puppet would reply the contrary, such as, "Easy for you, for me ees very deefeecult!" in his Spanish accent.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Anderson, Polly. [http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/04-99/04-21-99/zzzddobi.htm Archive of obituaries: "Ventriloquist Senor Wences"], [[Associated Press]], ''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|South Coast Today]]'', [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], 21 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

These catchphrases were incorporated into a record Wences released in 1959 by [[Joy Records (New York)]], featuring the songs "S-All Right? S-All Right" and "Deefeecult For You{{spaced ndash}}Easy For Me".

==Death and legacy==
Wences received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the US National Comedy Hall of Fame in 1996.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Despite his retirement by age 100, Wences' famous puppets Johnny and Pedro "continued working". Ventriloquists [[Jay Johnson (ventriloquist)|Jay Johnson]], Rickie Layne and [[Michele LaFong]] performed at Wences' 100th birthday celebration at the [[New York Friars' Club]] (where he was made a lifetime member&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/04/20/entertainment/main43871.shtml "Señor Wences Dead At 103"]. [[Associated Press]]. [[CBS News]]. 20 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;), and he was so impressed with LaFong that he befriended her.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite journal| magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=March 1998| title=Then and Now| pages=27-38| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adsxAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=senor+wences+life&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=senor+wences+| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did he give her his puppets,&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; but also taught her how to perform his classic routines.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott. [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/wences-puppets-gotta-hand-em-article-1.796165# "Wences' Puppets: Gotta Hand It To 'Em"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 7 January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas headliner LaFong is the only ventriloquist authorized by the Wences Estate to perform Johnny and Pedro, plus Wences' routines. Another famous ventriloquist who was present at Wences' birthday party, and who met him there for the first time was [[Paul Winchell]]. &lt;ref name=me&gt;Evanier, Mark. [http://www.newsfromme.com/pov/col124/ "Senor Wences"], ''News From ME'', 13 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Wences died just after his 103rd birthday.&lt;ref name=TV/&gt; He had been residing in New York City's [[Upper West Side]]&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; on 54th Street, just around the corner from the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]. That section of 54th Street has been named Señor Wences Way.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; His portrait can be seen at the [[The Players (New York City)|Players Club]] in New York.

[[File:ShrimpOnTheBarbieScreenshot.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from the advertisement]]
"'''Shrimp on the barbie'''" is an out-dated phrase that originated in a series of [[television advertisement]]s by the [[Australian Tourism Commission]] starring [[Paul Hogan]] from 1984 through to 1990. It is no longer used in Australian culture.&lt;ref name="BakerBendel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Bill|author2=Peggy Bendel|issue=Summer 2005|url=http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm|title=Come and Say G'Day!|journal=Travel Marketing Decisions|publisher=The Association of Travel Marketing Executives|accessdate=2007-12-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104153701/http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm|archivedate=2007-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celebchef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benjaminchristie.com/recipes/shrimp-on-the-barbie|title=Shrimp on the Barbie|accessdate=2010-01-15|author=Benjamin Christie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual quote spoken by Hogan is "I'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you", and the actual slogan of the ad was "Come and say G'day". It has since been used, along with some variations, to make reference to [[Australia]] in [[popular culture]].

==Details==
The advertisement pre-dated Hogan's popularity in the 1986 film ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' and thus were not initially seen as celebrity advertisements in the US, as he was relatively unknown in the United States (though well known in the UK through his long-running [[The Paul Hogan Show|television comedy show]]), although the film somewhat increased the commercial's popularity.&lt;ref name="BakerBendel"/&gt;

The advertisements were developed by the Australian agency [[Mojo (advertising)|Mojo]] in conjunction with American agency [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son|N.W. Ayer]]. The campaign was launched during the [[National Football Conference Championship Game]] in January 1984. Before the campaign, Australia was approximately number 78 on the "most desired" vacation destination list for Americans, but became number 7 three months after the launch, and soon became number 1 or 2 on Americans' "dream vacation" list, remaining in that position for most of the next two decades.&lt;ref name="BakerBendel"/&gt;

"Barbie" is [[Australian slang]] for ''[[barbecue]]'' and the phrase "slip a shrimp on the barbie", for Americans, often evokes images of a fun social gathering under the sun. Australians, however, invariably use the word ''[[prawn]]'' rather than ''[[shrimp]]''. Because the commercial was commissioned for broadcast in the [[United States of America|United States]], the change was made to limit audience confusion.&lt;ref name="BakerBendel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="celebchef" /&gt; The commercial was so influential that three decades later, [[USC Trojans football]] player Chris Tilbey, an Australian, reported that he was quoted the "shrimp on the barbie" line "Every day. Every day".&lt;ref name="uscfootball"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eLjPvWofc8#t=1m57s |title=USC Football - Kiwi Crasher |date=2017-06-01 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the opening sequence of the 1994 cult comedy ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'', when protagonist Lloyd Christmas (portrayed by [[Jim Carrey]]) tries to hit on an [[Austria|Austrian]] woman, mistaking her for an Australian: "Let's put another shrimp on the barbie". She then turns him down, saying "Let's not".

Prawns are a popular traditional Christmas seafood in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/business-old/one-week-of-the-year-when-prawns-are-king/story-e6frg95o-1111118381043|title=One week of the year when prawns are king|newspaper=The Australian|date=22 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/raw-prawn-you-may-have-to-shell-out-more/story-e6frg8y6-1226229732198|title=Raw prawn? You may have to shell out more|newspaper=The Australian|date=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[crustacean]]s such as [[shrimp (food)|shrimp]] and prawns are less common, on average, in the Australian cuisine than in the United States. In the late 1980s, annual per capita consumption of shrimp stood at 1.3&amp;nbsp;kg in the United States, second only to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/ac058e/AC058E04.htm|title=World Shrimp Market Situation and Outlook|publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contract theory]], '''signalling''' (or '''signaling'''; see [[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#Doubled_consonants|spelling differences]]) is the idea that one party (termed the [[Agent (law)|agent]]) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]).  For example, in [[Michael Spence|Michael Spence's]] job-market signalling model, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring education credentials.  The informational value of the credential comes from the fact that the employer believes the credential is positively correlated with having greater ability and difficult for low ability employees to obtain. Thus the credential enables the employer to reliably distinguish low ability workers from high ability workers.

==Introductory questions==
Signalling took root in the idea of [[asymmetric information]] (a deviation from [[perfect information]]), which says that in some economic transactions, inequalities in access to information upset the normal market for the exchange of goods and services. In his seminal 1973 article, [[Michael Spence]] proposed that two parties could get around the problem of asymmetric information by having one party send a '''signal''' that would reveal some piece of relevant information to the other party.&lt;ref name="Spence1973"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michael Spence | title=Job Market Signaling | journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume=87 | issue=3 | year=1973 | pages=355–374 | doi=10.2307/1882010 | jstor=1882010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That party would then interpret the signal and adjust her purchasing behaviour accordingly—usually by offering a higher price than if she had not received the signal.
There are, of course, many problems that these parties would immediately run into.
* How much time, energy, or money should the sender (''agent'') spend on sending the signal?
* How can the receiver (the ''principal'', who is usually the buyer in the transaction) trust the signal to be an honest declaration of information?
* Assuming there is a '''signalling equilibrium''' under which the sender signals honestly and the receiver trusts that information, under what circumstances will that equilibrium break down?

==Job-market signalling==
In the job market, potential employees seek to sell their services to employers for some [[wage]], or [[price]]. Generally, employers are willing to pay higher wages to employ better workers.  While the individual may know his or her own level of ability, the hiring [[firm]] is not (usually) able to observe such an intangible trait—thus there is an asymmetry of information between the two parties.  Education [[credential]]s can be used as a signal to the firm, indicating a certain level of ability that the individual may possess; thereby narrowing the informational gap.  This is beneficial to both parties as long as the signal indicates a desirable attribute—a signal such as a criminal record may not be so desirable.

===Spence 1973 "Job Market Signaling" paper===

====Assumptions and groundwork====

[[Michael Spence]] considers hiring as a type of investment under uncertainty,&lt;ref name="Spence1973"/&gt; analogous to buying a [[lottery ticket]], and refers to the attributes of an applicant which are observable to the employer as indices.  Of these, attributes which the applicant can manipulate are termed signals.{{ clarify | date = July 2015 | reason = Is that right?? By "indices", does Spence mean "observable attributes" as a whole? or only a subset of observable attributes, those which the applicant *can’t* manipulate?  (Does anyone have access to the original paper?!)}} Applicant age is thus an index, but is not a signal since it does not change at the discretion of the applicant.

The employer is supposed to have [[conditional probability]] assessments of productive capacity, based on previous experience of the market, for each combination of indices and signals.{{ clarify | date = July 2015 | reason = What does "supposed to" mean in this context?  In Spence’s model, maybe?}} The employer [[Bayesian statistics|updates those assessments]] upon observing each employee’s characteristics.

The paper is concerned with a [[risk-neutral]] employer. The offered wage is the [[Expected value|expected]] [[marginal product]]. Signals may be acquired by sustaining signalling costs (monetary and not). If everyone invests in the signal in the exactly the same way, then the signal can't be used as discriminatory, therefore a critical assumption is made: the costs of signalling are negatively [[correlated]] with [[productivity]]. This situation as described is a feedback loop: the employer updates his beliefs upon new market information and updates the [[wage schedule]], applicants react by signalling, and [[recruitment]] takes place.

[[Michael Spence]] studies the signalling equilibrium that may result from such a situation.  He began his 1973 model with an hypothetical example:&lt;ref name="Spence1973"/&gt; suppose that there are two types of employees—good and bad—and that employers are willing to pay a higher wage to the good type than the bad type. Spence assumes that for employers, there's no real way to tell in advance which employees will be of the good or bad type.

Bad employees aren't upset about this, because they get a [[free rider problem|free ride]] from the hard work of the good employees. But good employees know that they deserve to be paid more for their higher productivity, so they desire to invest in the signal—in this case, some amount of [[education]]. But he does make one key assumption: ''good-type employees pay less for one unit of education than bad-type employees''. The cost he refers to is not necessarily the cost of [[tuition]] and living expenses, sometimes called out of pocket expenses, as one could make the argument that higher ability persons tend to enroll in "better" (i.e. more expensive) institutions. Rather, the cost Spence is referring to is the [[opportunity cost]].  This is a combination of 'costs', monetary and otherwise, including psychological, time, effort and so on.  Of key importance to the value of the signal is the differing cost structure between "good" and "bad" workers.  The cost of obtaining identical credentials is strictly lower for the "good" employee than it is for the "bad" employee.

The differing cost structure need not preclude "bad" workers from obtaining the [[credential]].  All that is necessary for the signal to have value (informational or otherwise) is that the group with the signal is positively correlated with the previously unobservable group of "good" workers.  In general, the degree to which a signal is thought to be correlated to unknown or unobservable attributes is directly related to its value.

====The result====

Spence discovered that even if education did not contribute anything to an employee's productivity, it could still have value to both the employer and employee.  If the appropriate cost/benefit structure exists (or is created), "good" employees will buy more education in order to signal their higher productivity.

The increase in wages associated with obtaining a higher credential is sometimes referred to as the “[[sheepskin effect]]”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Hungerford |first2=Gary |last2=Solon |title=Sheepskin Effects in the Returns to Education |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=69 |issue=1 |year=1987 |pages=175–177 |jstor=1937919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since “sheepskin” informally denotes a [[diploma]].  It is important to note that this is not the same as the returns from an additional year of education.  The "sheepskin" effect is actually the wage increase above what would normally be attributed to the extra year of education.  This can be observed empirically in the wage differences between 'drop-outs' vs. 'completers' with an equal number of years of education.  It is also important that one does not equate the fact that higher wages are paid to more educated individuals entirely to signalling or the 'sheepskin' effects.  In reality education serves many different purposes to individuals and society as a whole.  Only when all of these aspects, as well as all the many factors affecting wages, are controlled for, does the effect of the "sheepskin" approach its true value.  Empirical studies of signalling indicate it as a statistically significant determinant of wages, however it is one of a host of other attributes—age, sex, and geography are examples of other important factors.

====The model====

To illustrate his argument, Spence imagines, for simplicity, two productively distinct groups in a population facing one employer. The signal under consideration is education, measured by an index y and is subject to individual choice. Education costs are both monetary and psychic. The data can be summarized as:

:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Data of the Model
! Group
! Marginal Product
! Proportion of population
! Cost of education level y
|-
|    '''I'''
|    1
|   &lt;math&gt;q_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
|   y
|-
|    '''II'''
|    2
|  &lt;math&gt;1-q_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| y/2
|}

Suppose that the employer believes that there is a level of education y* below which productivity is 1 and above which productivity is 2. His offered wage schedule W(y) will be:

: &lt;math&gt;W(y) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; y &lt; y* \\ 2, &amp; y &gt; y* \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Working with these hypotheses Spence shows that:

# There is no rational reason for someone choosing a different level of education from 0 or y*.
# Group I sets y=0 if 1&gt;2-y*, that is if the return for not investing in education is higher than investing in education.
# Group II sets y=y* if 2-y*/2&gt;1, that is the return for investing in education is higher than not investing in education.
# Therefore, putting the previous two inequalities together, if 1&lt;y*&lt;2, then the employer initial beliefs are confirmed.
# There are infinite equilibrium values of y* belonging to the interval [1,2], but they are not equivalent from the welfare point of view. The higher y* the worse off is Group II, while Group I is unaffected.
# If no signaling takes place each person is paid his unconditional expected marginal product &lt;math&gt;2-q_{1}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Group I is worse off when signaling is present.

In conclusion, even if education has no real contribution to the marginal product of the worker, the combination of the beliefs of the employer and the presence of signalling transforms the education level y* in a prerequisite for the higher paying job. It may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labor, without this necessarily being true.

===Another model===

For a signal to be effective, certain conditions must be true.  In equilibrium the cost of obtaining the credential must be lower for high productivity workers and act as a signal to the employer such that they will pay a higher wage.

[[File:Simple signalling framework.PNG|Illustration of a simple two person model]]

In this model it is optimal for the higher ability person to obtain the credential (the observable signal) but not for the lower ability individual. The table shows the outcome of low ability person '''l''' and high ability person '''h''' with and without signal '''S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''':

:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Summary of the outcome for '''l''' and '''h''' with and without '''S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''
! Person
! Without Signal
! With Signal
! Will the person obtain the signal '''S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''?
|-
|    '''l'''
|    W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
|  W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; - C&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;(l)
| No,   because W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; - C&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;(l)
|-
|    '''h'''
|    W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
|  W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; - C&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;(h)
| Yes, because W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; - C&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;(h)
|}

The structure is as follows:
There are two individuals with differing ability (productivity) levels.

*A higher ability / productivity person: '''h'''
*A lower ability / productivity person : '''l'''

The premise for the model is that a person of high ability ('''h''') has a lower cost for obtaining a given level of education than does a person of lower ability ('''l'''). Cost can be in terms of monetary, such as tuition, or psychological, stress incurred to obtain the credential.

*'''W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the expected wage for an education level less than '''S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''
*'''W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' is the expected wage for an education level equal or greater than '''S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''

'''For the individual:'''

:Person&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; - Person&lt;sub&gt;(no credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;≥&lt;/big&gt; Cost&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Obtain credential

:Person&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; - Person&lt;sub&gt;(no credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;&lt;/big&gt; Cost&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Do not obtain credential

Thus, if both individuals act rationally it is optimal for person '''h''' to obtain '''S&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' but not for person '''l''' so long as the following conditions are satisfied.

Edit: note that this is incorrect with the example as graphed.  Both 'l' and 'h' have lower costs than W* at the education level.  Also, Person&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; and Person&lt;sub&gt;(no credential)&lt;/sub&gt; are not clear.

Edit: note that this is ok as for low type "l":   &lt;math&gt;W_{o} &gt; W^{*} -  C^{'}(l)&lt;/math&gt;   , and thus low type will choose Do not obtain credential.

Edit: For there to be a separating equilibrium the high type 'h' must also check their outside option; do they want to choose the net pay in the separating equilibrium (calculated above) over the net pay in the pooling equilibrium.  Thus we also need to test that:   &lt;math&gt;W^{*} - C^{'}(h) &gt;   W^{*} q_{1} + W_{o} (1-q_{1})&lt;/math&gt;   Otherwise high type 'h' will choose Do not obtain credential of the pooling equilibrium.


'''For the employers:'''

:Person&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;=&lt;/big&gt; ''&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;'''''('''Productivity &lt;big&gt;|&lt;/big&gt; Cost&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;≤&lt;/big&gt; Person&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; - Person&lt;sub&gt;(no credential)&lt;/sub&gt;''')'''

:Person&lt;sub&gt;(no credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;=&lt;/big&gt; ''&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;'''''('''Productivity &lt;big&gt;|&lt;/big&gt; Cost&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Person&lt;sub&gt;(credential)&lt;/sub&gt; - Person&lt;sub&gt;(no credential)&lt;/sub&gt;''')'''

In equilibrium, in order for the signalling model to hold, the employer must recognize the signal and pay the corresponding wage and this will result in the workers self-sorting into the two groups. One can see that the cost/benefit structure for a signal to be effective must fall within certain bounds or else the system will fail.&lt;ref&gt;http://economics.mit.edu/files/552&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPOs==
Leland and Pyle (1977) analyse the role of signals within the process of [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]. The authors show how companies with good future perspectives and higher possibilities of success ("good companies") should always send clear signals to the market when going public (e.g. the owner should keep control of a significant percentage of the company). To be reliable, the signal must be too costly to be imitated by "bad companies". If no signal is sent to the market, asymmetric information will result in [[adverse selection]] in the IPO market.

==Brands==
Waldfogel and Chen (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldfogel | first1 = Joel | last2 = Chen | first2 = L | year = | title = Does Information Undermine Brand? Information Intermediary Use and Preference for Branded Web Retailers | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Economics | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 425–449 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6451.2006.00295.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate the importance of brands in signalling quality in online marketplaces.

==eBay Motors' Price Premium==
Signalling has been studied and proposed as a means to address asymmetric information in markets for Lemons.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. A. (1970). The market for" lemons": Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism. ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 488-500.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, signalling theory has been applied in used cars market such as [[eBay Motors]]. For example, Lewis (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Gregory | year = | title = Asymmetric Information, Adverse Selection and Online Disclosure: The Case of eBay Motors | url = | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 101 | issue = 4| pages = 1535–1546 | doi=10.1257/aer.101.4.1535}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the role of information access and shows that the voluntary disclosure of private information increases the prices of used cars on eBay. Further, Dimoka et al. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dimoka | first1 = Angelika | last2 = Hong | first2 = Yili | last3 = Pavlou | first3 = Paul | year = | title = On Product Uncertainty in Online Markets: Theory and Evidence | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 395–426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed data from eBay Motors on the role of signals to mitigate product uncertainty. Extending the information asymmetry literature in consumer behavior literature from the agent (seller) to the product, authors theorized and validated the nature and dimensions  of product uncertainty, which is distinct from, yet shaped by, seller uncertainty. Authors also found information signals (diagnostic product descriptions and third-party product assurances) to reduce product uncertainty, which negatively affect [[price premium]]s (relative to the book values) of the used cars in online used cars markets.

==Outside options==
Most signalling models are plagued by a multiplicity of possible equilibrium outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Game Theory|last = Fudenberg|first = Drew|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tirole|first2 = Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study published in the ''[[Journal of Economic Theory]]'', a signalling model has been proposed that has a unique equilibrium outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Investments as signals of outside options|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053113002056|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|date = 2014|pages = 683–708|volume = 150|doi = 10.1016/j.jet.2013.12.001|first = Susanne|last = Goldlücke|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the principal-agent model it is argued that an agent will choose a large (observable) investment level when he has a strong outside option. Yet, an agent with a weak outside option might try to bluff by also choosing a large investment, in order to make the principal believe that the agent has a strong outside option (so that the principal will make a better contract offer to the agent). Hence, when an agent has private information about his outside option, signalling may mitigate the [[hold-up problem]].

== (Self-)signalling and gambling ==
Signalling influences bettors in domains that are relevant to their identity or commitments. When betting on or against a group, belief, or ideal, such as a favorite sports team or politician, the choice of bet (i.e., for or against) sends a signal to the bettor about his or her identity. Betting on the outcome seems to send a reaffirming signal to the bettor about her identity, whereas betting against the outcome seems to send a signal to the bettor that the outcome is less important than before. As a result, bettors are reluctant to bet against such identity-relevant outcomes, even when bets against identity-relevant outcomes are more favorable than bets on identity relevant outcomes. When presented real gambles of equal expected value (ev = $7.50) on the [[2000 US Presidential election]], for example, both supporters of [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] were more likely to bet their candidate to win (74%) the election than to lose the election (26%). As further evidence, more than 45% of [[NCAA|N.C.A.A]]. basketball and hockey fans turned down a free chance to earn $5 if their team lost its upcoming game.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Tang|first2=Simone|last3=Larrick|first3=Richard P.|date=2016-10-12|title=Betting Your Favorite to Win: Costly Reluctance to Hedge Desired Outcomes|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|journal=Management Science|doi=10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|issn=0025-1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles''' ('''SSAR''') is an international [[herpetological society]].  It is a [[non-profit organization]] supporting education, conservation, and research related to [[reptiles]] and [[amphibians]].  Regular publications include the ''Journal of Herpetology'' and ''Herpetological Review''.  It is the largest international herpetological society, and is recognized worldwide for having the most diverse program of publications, meetings, and other activities.

The SSAR Conservation Committee brings conservation issues that affect reptiles and amphibians to the attention of [[State government|state]] and [[Federation|federal]] [[government agencies]], [[non-government organization]]s, and [[herpetologist]]s worldwide. The committee serves as a liaison between the SSAR and public and private groups to provide expert advice, factual knowledge, and educational information about problems confronting amphibians and reptiles, including [[habitat protection]], [[Endangered species|endangered]], [[Threatened species|threatened]], and special concern species, commercial and private use, contaminants, and priorities for conservation-oriented research. 
The committee coordinates SSAR responses to proposed national and international legislation and other conservation matters involving reptiles and amphibians. Official responses are submitted for approval by the President and Secretary before public release. Chair submits annual report to Secretary prior to the annual meeting of the Board. 
The SSAR also supports numerous grants programs, international exchanges and international cooperative efforts for study and publications.

==History==
The society was founded as a regional organization, The Ohio Herpetological Society (OHS), by two young but serious-minded amateurs, Kraig Adler and David M. Dennis, then 16 and 17 years of age respectively. They decided in the fall of 1957 to formalize interactions amongst a small group of amateur herpetologists throughout Ohio and began publishing a combined journal and newsletter (called the ''Trimonthly Report'') in January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty, John J., and Breck Bartholomew. 2007. ''Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles: A Fifty Year History 1958–2007.'' Herpetological Circulars 36. The Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles (SSAR). 60 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-916984-72-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the society was changed to The Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles on January 1, 1967.

==Publications==
The SSAR publishes a number of books and series including:

* ''Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles''
* ''Contributions to Herpetology''
* ''Facsimile Reprints in Herpetology''
* ''Herpetological Circulars''
* ''Herpetological Conservation''
* ''Herpetological Review''
* ''Journal of Herpetology''

[[Ireland]] has become increasingly popular as a surfing destination, due to its exposed location on the turbulent [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] seaboard.&lt;ref name="WannaSurf"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Europe/Ireland/|title=Ireland - WannaSurf, surf spots atlas, surfing photos, maps, GPS location|last=Ltd|first=Wannasurf.com|website=www.wannasurf.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island has 3,172 kilometers of coastline, and the southern and western shores are exposed for waves originating in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="SurferToday"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.surfertoday.com/travel/11079-the-best-surf-spots-in-ireland|title=The best surf spots in Ireland|last=SurferToday.com|first=Editor at|work=SurferToday|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ireland is located at a high [[latitude]], the warm ocean currents of the [[North Atlantic drift]] ensures mild water temperatures throughout the year, with a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F) in winter and a maximum of 21&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) in summer.&lt;ref name="IrishCandC" /&gt;

The numerous [[beach]]es, [[reef]]s, [[headland]]s and [[cove]]s along the west coast of Ireland serve as popular surf spots. Ireland has played host to international events since the 1960s, and is home to many surf shops, schools and clubs.&lt;ref name="IrishCandC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/Atravel/Surfing.html|title=Surfing in Ireland Irish culture and customs - World Cultures European|website=www.irishcultureandcustoms.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Surfing has been documented in Ireland as early as 1949, however it wasn't until 1964 that the "Bray Island Surf Club" was founded. Ireland was first represented at the [[World Surfing Championship]] in 1966 by Kevin Cavey, which in turn inspired the first [[Irish National Surfing Championships]], held in [[Tramore]], [[County Waterford|Co. Waterford]] in 1967. The first [[Irish Inter County Surfing Championships]] was held in 1968, followed by a full Irish team entry in the inaugural [[European Surfing Championships]] of 1969.

The growing interest in competition surfing mirrored a general interest in surfing across the island, with the number of participants and clubs growing rapidly throughout the late 60s; by 1970, there were an estimated 400 surfers in the country. This led to the foundation of the [[Irish Surfing Association]] in that year.&lt;ref name="IrishSurfingHistory"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishsurfing.ie/about-us/our-history.html|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=|work=www.irishsurfing.ie|access-date=2017-04-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kevincavey.com/irish-surf-history.html|title=Surf History|last=Cavey|first=Kevin|date=|website=kevincavey.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing body==
''Irish Surfing'', also known as the ''Irish Surfing Association'', is a voluntary organisation that governs the sport of surfing on the island of Ireland. It participates in club development, instructor training and surf school regulation, and promoting surfing safety and the protection of the environment, as well as overseeing competitive surfing in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishsurfing.ie/about-us/who-we-are.html|title=Who We Are|last=|first=|date=|work=www.irishsurfing.ie|access-date=2017-04-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Big wave surfing==
Ireland's location on the edge of the North Atlantic makes it a good location for accessing large waves. The record for the largest measured wave, at 19&amp;nbsp;m (62&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, is held by a buoy off the north-west coast of the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afloat.ie/marine-environment/coastal-notes/item/34501-world-s-biggest-wave-recorded-off-ireland|title=‘World’s Biggest Wave’ Recorded Off Ireland|last=|first=|date=|work=afloat.ie|access-date=2017-04-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satellite imagery has shown a tendency for the generation of waves in excess of 9&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) tall in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afloat.ie/watersport/surfing/item/33567-new-big-wave-hotspot-discovered-off-irish-coast|title=New Big Wave Hotspot Discovered Off Irish Coast|last=|first=|date=|work=afloat.ie|access-date=2017-04-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's most iconic big wave, known as "Ailleens" after the nearby ''Aill na Searrach'' cliffs, is located off the [[Cliffs of Moher]], [[County Clare|Co. Clare]], and is a popular location for [[tow-in surfing]]. Although championed by many as a "perfect wave", with a potential height of 12&amp;nbsp;m (39&amp;nbsp;ft), Ailleens is not an everyday occurrence, as it requires stormy conditions and strong east winds offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildatlanticway.com/stories/watersports/aileen-s-wave|title=Biggest Waves in the World {{!}} Wild Atlantic Way|last=Fáilte Ireland|first=|date=|website=www.wildatlanticway.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ireland.com/what-is-available/water-sports/surfing/articles/the-perfect-wave/|title=Aileen’s – Ireland’s Perfect Wave  #irlnd|work=Ireland.com|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mullaghmore, County Sligo|Mullaghmore]] Head's 9&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) waves, in [[County Sligo|Co.

{{nihongo|'''Tokyo DisneySea'''|東京ディズニーシー|Tōkyō DizunīShī}} is a {{convert|176|acre|ha|sigfig=4|adj=on}} [[theme park]] at the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] located in [[Urayasu, Chiba|Urayasu]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], Japan, just outside [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11282/1180329-37-0.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110084953/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11282/1180329-37-0.stm |archivedate=10 January 2012 |title=Japan's Disneyland a little different |author=Rob Owen |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=9 October 2011 |accessdate=13 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 4 September 2001, at a cost of 335 billion yen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tokyo DisneySea Project (1988 to 2001)|url=http://www.olc.co.jp/en/50th/05.html|publisher=Oriental Land Company|accessdate=22 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518061949/http://www.olc.co.jp/en/50th/05.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owned by [[The Oriental Land Company]], which licenses Disney characters and themes from The Walt Disney Company, Tokyo DisneySea attracted an estimated 13.46 million visitors in 2016, making it the fifth-most-visited theme park in the world.&lt;ref name="2016 attendance"&gt;{{cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2016 Theme Index and Museum Index|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=6 June 2017|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tokyo DisneySea was the second theme park to open at the Tokyo Disney Resort and the ninth park of the twelve worldwide Disney theme parks to open. Tokyo DisneySea was the fastest theme park in the world to reach the milestone of 10 million guests, having done so in 307 days after its grand opening.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Tim. "DisneySea bolts to 10 million. (In Brief)." Amusement Business 15 July 2002: 8. General OneFile. Web. 21 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record-holder was [[Universal Studios Japan]] 338 days after its opening.

==Concept==
Tokyo DisneySea has an overall nautical exploration theme to it. The idea for the park can be traced to a proposal to build a second theme park in Southern California called "[[Port Disney]]" in [[Long Beach, California]], with the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] as the main attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/reviews/tokyo_disneysea/|title=Tokyo DisneySea|work=Theme Park Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was scrapped after the company endured financial trouble with the [[Disneyland Paris|Euro Disney]] project. Later the idea was passed on to the Oriental Land Company to expand their resort.

==Layout==
There are seven themed areas or "ports of call". The entrance to the park is Mediterranean Harbor, which opens up to six more nautically themed ports: American Waterfront, Lost River Delta, Port Discovery, Mermaid Lagoon, Arabian Coast, and Mysterious Island.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;

===Mediterranean Harbor===
{{main|Mediterranean Harbor (Tokyo DisneySea)}}
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Mediterranean Harbour View1 201306.jpg|thumb|left|Mediterranean Harbor]]
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Mediterranean Harbour Venice 20130607.jpg|thumb|right|Re-creation of Venice]]
Mediterranean Harbor is the entrance "port-of-call" and themed as an Italian port city, with [[Venetian Gondolas]] that guests can board and ride.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt; Littered throughout the port are various shops and restaurants. Mediterranean Harbor's layout differs from the entry "lands" of other Disney parks as it is a large "V" shape rather than a main street that leads to a hub (as found in [[Disneyland]]'s [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] or [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]' Hollywood Boulevard"). To the right, the path leads to Mysterious Island, and to the left, the path leads to the American Waterfront. Built into the architecture of the port is [[Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta]]; the hotel serves as a full-scale reproduction of the various buildings of Portofino and Venice's ports, and serves as the southern berm (or border) of the park. Mediterranean Harbor also features [[Fortress Explorations|"Fortress Explorations",]] a large-scale interactive play area for guests that features exploration-themed activities and attractions. The nighttime show [[Fantasmic!|"Fantasmic!"]] premiered on 28 April 2011 as part of the park's 10th anniversary celebration.

===Mysterious Island===
{{main|Mysterious Island (Tokyo DisneySea)}}
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Mysterious Island View 201306.jpg|thumb|right|A walk in Mysterious Island]]
Mysterious Island is a "port-of-call" within Mount Prometheus, the giant volcano that is the park's centerpiece and most prominent feature. It relies heavily on the storytelling of [[Jules Verne]] and, specifically, the mythology of the volcano fortress mentioned several times in the books called "Vulcania". The Mount Prometheus ride employs technology similar to [[Epcot]]'s [[Test Track]].&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt; The smallest "port of call", it nevertheless holds two of the more popular attractions: "[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (attraction)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]", a thrill ride, and "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", a [[dark ride]]. While appearing to be a volcano on the water, Mysterious Island is not an island; it is built into the side of Mount Prometheus, which is part of the show building for the two attractions. The architecture in this port is of Victorian style.

===Mermaid Lagoon===
{{main|Mermaid Lagoon (Tokyo DisneySea)}}
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Mermaid Lagoon Interior View 201306.jpg|thumb|left|Mermaid lagoon]]
Mermaid Lagoon is home to the characters of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. The facade is made to resemble King Triton's palace and features seashell-inspired architecture. This "port of call" is mostly indoors and recreates the feeling of being underwater.  Attractions include Flounder's Flying Fish Coaster; [[Scuttle's Scooters]]; [[Jumpin' Jellyfish]]; Blowfish Balloon Race; The Whirlpool; all of which are children's rides. Also in this area are Ariel's Playground, which is a children's playground and extensive walk-through attraction that recreates the various settings in the movie; and the Mermaid Lagoon Theater, which houses 'King Triton's Concert', a musical show featuring live actors, large-scale [[puppetry]] and [[Audio-Animatronics]] that recreate the story of The Little Mermaid.

===Arabian Coast===
{{main|Arabian Coast (Tokyo DisneySea)}}
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Arabian Coast View2 201306.jpg|thumb|right|Building in the Arabian Coast area]]
This is themed after ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. It recreates an Arabian harbor combined with an "enchanted world from 1001 Arabian Nights". There are four attractions in the land: [[Sindbad's Storybook Voyage]], an indoor [[dark ride]] boat ride whose art direction seems to be (at first glance) a variation on [[It's a Small World|"It's a Small World"]] (with its own theme song, "Compass of your Heart", composed by [[Alan Menken]]); Caravan Carousel, a double-decker [[carousel]] that holds over 190 passengers; Jasmine's Flying Carpets; and the Magic Lamp Theater, which houses a combined live-action/animatronic based magic show with a 3D movie featuring the [[Genie (Disney's Aladdin)|Genie]].

===Lost River Delta===
{{main|Lost River Delta (Tokyo DisneySea)}}
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Lost River Delta View2 201306.jpg|thumb|left|Lost River Delta]]
Located at the back of the park, the dominant structure in this "port of call" is the ruins of an ancient [[Aztec]] pyramid which houses the dark thrill ride, [[Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull]]. Also in the Lost River Delta is the DisneySea Steamer Line which transports guests back to Mediterranean Harbor, 'Out of Shadowland', a live theatrical show that follows Mei, a young girl lost in a world of shadows who finds confidence and strength through her sojourn there. Furthermore, the Lost River Delta contains an [[Intamin]] [[roller coaster]] named [[Raging Spirits]], which opened in 2005 and is similar to [[Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril]] at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] in Paris.

===Port Discovery===
{{main|Port Discovery (Tokyo DisneySea)}}
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Port Discovery 201306.jpg|thumb|right|Port Discovery near Aquatopia]]
This "port of call" is home to the fictional 'Marine Life Institute'; Port Discovery houses two attractions: [[Aquatopia]], a boat ride that uses LPS tracking (the 'trackless' technology also used in Tokyo Disneyland's [[Pooh's Hunny Hunt]]) to move and spin through a lagoon amid waterfalls and whirlpools, and the {{RailGauge|2ft6in|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[DisneySea Electric Railway]], an overhead electric trolley that transports riders to and from the American Waterfront. On 12 May 2017, the land became home to [[Nemo &amp; Friends SeaRider]] based on [[Finding Nemo]]/[[Finding Dory]] which replaced the former [[StormRider]] simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Finding Nemo" attraction coming to Tokyo DisneySea Park in Spring 2017, StormRider to close|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/headlines/new-finding-nemo-attraction-coming-to-tokyo-disneysea-park-in-spring-2017-stormrider-to-close/|website=Inside the Magic|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Waterfront===

[[File:DisneySea Electric Railway.jpg|thumb|right|DisneySea Electric Railway]]
[[File:Tokyo DisneySea Cape Cod.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Cod]]

This "port of call" represents the northeastern seaboard of the United States in the early 20th century. It features two themed areas, an "Old Cape Cod" section, and a "New York Harbor" section. The land is dominated by a large passenger ship, [[SS Columbia (Tokyo DisneySea)|SS ''Columbia'']], which is usually the site for various shows and events. Guests have the option of riding the area's "Big City Vehicles" which roam the streets of the area. It also features the {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge [[DisneySea Electric Railway]], which takes passengers from The American Waterfront to nearby Port Discovery. The port has a Broadway-themed theater which plays the show "Big Band Beat", which features 1940's-style swing jazz performed by a 12-piece band, as well as 20 singers/dancers.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt; The port's most popular attraction is the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Tower of Terror]], an elaborately themed free-fall [[E ticket|E-ticket]] ride.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;

[[Toy Story Mania]] is an interactive 4-D theme park attraction located at the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park.&lt;ref name="Toy Story Mania"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toy Story Mania |url=http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/attraction/detail/str_id:aw_toy/|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inspired by Disney [[Pixar|Pixar's]] [[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]. The attraction opened on 9 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Cinderella" Attraction and Toy Story Mania! Coming to Tokyo Disney Resort |url=http://www.jtcent.com/extras/news/news_090507.html|publisher=Joe's Tokyo Disneyland Resort Photo Site|accessdate=16 September 2014|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guests wear 3-D glasses while riding spinning vehicles that travel through virtual environments based on classic carnival games. There are shooters on the vehicles to let guests to shoot targets in those 3-D games like "egg toss" and "balloon pop".&lt;ref name="Toy Story Mania"/&gt;

'''Traxxas''' is a [[remote control]] model manufacturer based in [[McKinney, Texas]], [[United States]]. Traxxas offers [[electric]] and [[nitromethane|nitro]] powered [[radio-controlled car|vehicles]] (on-road and off-road), boats, and aircraft for drivers of all skill levels. Traxxas' slogan is "The Fastest Name In Radio Control".&lt;ref name="abouttraxxas" /&gt;

==Company history==

Traxxas was founded in 1986, with the goal of offering fully assembled, hobby-level [[radio controlled cars|radio control cars]] that could be run right out of the box with little or no assembly, an idea that was new at the time. Traxxas began offering models as "Ready-to-Run" or "RTR", but now refers to these models as "Ready-To-Race". 
Starting in 1987, Traxxas began selling a series of electric powered [[stadium truck]] and [[Dune buggy|buggy]] models. In 1989, Traxxas released its first [[radio-controlled boat]], the Villan IV. In 1992, Traxxas released its first RTR [[nitromethane|nitro]] model, the Nitro Hawk. In 1996, Traxxas released its first RTR [[nitromethane|nitro]] [[Radio-controlled boat|boat]] model, the Nitro Vee. In 1999, Traxxas released its first full sized [[monster truck]] model, the T-Maxx.&lt;ref name="abouttraxxas"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://traxxas.com/about |title=About Traxxas! |publisher=Traxxas.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012 Traxxas launched its first aircraft products, the ready-to-fly DR-1 Helicopter and QR-1 Quadcopter. In 2015, Traxxas released its largest monster truck to date, the X-Maxx, and also debuted their Self-Righting technology.

==Overview==
Traxxas radio-controlled vehicles come fully assembled and "Ready-to-Run". However, Traxxas refers to their vehicles as "Ready-to-Race". Electric models feature sealed electronics allowing them to be run in wet conditions. Electric models are offered in either brushed or brushless versions and most include Traxxas Power Cell batteries and Peak Detecting Fast Chargers. Nitro models also include a battery and charger to support the EZ-Start starting system. Nitro models are powered by the Pro.15, TRX 2.5 Racing Engine, or TRX 3.3 Racing Engine.

Depending on the model, it will come with a TQ 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system or a TQi 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system. Some models also feature the Traxxas Link Wireless Module and Telemetry sensors for tuning and keeping track of the vehicle's performance. Some of the Slash short course truck models feature the Traxxas exclusive On-Board radio system. Several brushless powered models and higher-end nitro models feature Traxxas Stability Management. The Self-Righting feature works with the X-Maxx, E-Maxx, and Stampede 4X4 VXL models.

==Traxxas Racing==
Traxxas currently sponsors the [[Speed Energy Formula Off-Road]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/rebranded/|title=SST Trucks To Race In Rebranded SPEED Energy Formula Off-Road Presented By Traxxas|work=Stadium Super Trucks|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=March 4, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307103628/http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/rebranded/|archivedate=March 7, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Traxxas fields trucks in the series for [[Matt Brabham]] and [[Sheldon Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/sheldon-creed-outduels-traxxas-teammate-matt-brabham-for-honda-indy-toronto-victory/|title=Sheldon Creed Outduels TRAXXAS Teammate Matt Brabham for Honda Indy Toronto Victory|work=[[Speed Energy Formula Off-Road]]|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewbrabham.com/news/matt-joins-traxxas/|title=Brabham joins Team Traxxas|work=[[Matthew Brabham]]|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=August 15, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816151456/http://www.matthewbrabham.com/news/matt-joins-traxxas/|archivedate=August 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traxxas also sponsors athletes who compete in [[motocross]]. This includes Ryder DiFrancesco, Carson Mumford, Gage Schehr, Axell Hodges, and Justin Mulford.

Traxxas was the lead sponsor for [[John Force Racing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnforceracing.com/|title=John Force Racing|work=JohnForceRacing.com|date=June 28, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; team member, [[Courtney Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtneyforce.com/|title=Courtney Force|work=CourtneyForce.com|date=June 28, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the daughter of [[John Force]]. Courtney Force drives the Traxxas [[Chevrolet]] [[Camaro]] SS [[Funny Car]] in the [[NHRA]].

Traxxas was a sponsor in the [[Championship Off-Road Racing]] (CORR) series until its demise in 2008. It took over as the title sponsor in an [[off-road racing]] series called the Traxxas TORC Series. Traxxas demonstrated its products at events and had a Traxxas Mobile Support Center on site. The Mobile Support Center carried Traxxas parts, cars, trucks, and boats. Traxxas' lead sponsorship of the TORC Series ended in 2014.
{{main article|Traxxas TORC Series}}
Traxxas-sponsored drivers in short course racing are Mike Jenkins, Keegan Kincaid, RJ Anderson, and [[Jeremy McGrath]].

In 2010, Traxxas sponsored the No. 18 [[Toyota Tundra]] of [[Kyle Busch]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.race-dezert.com/home/traxxas-sponsor-kyle-busch-nascar-truck-series-races-9912.html|title=Traxxas to Sponsor Kyle Busch in Three NASCAR Truck Series Races|work=Race-Dezert|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxx trucks===
The Maxx family consists of several models originally based around the T-Maxx that was released in 1999.

;T-Maxx Classic
In 2008, Traxxas introduced a further revised version of the, then, T-Maxx 2.5. It is now called the T-Maxx Classic. Changes were limited to a new paint scheme, subtly revised graphics and new wheels and tires (the same ones used on the T-Maxx 2.5R).
The T-Maxx now comes standard with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system.

;T-Maxx 3.3

The T-Maxx 3.3 was very similar to the T-Maxx 2.5R, however there were some differences. The biggest one was Traxxas' larger, more powerful TRX 3.3 nitro engine. Other differences were mirror chrome versions of the 2.5R's 3.8&amp;nbsp;inch wheels, "Talon" [[All-terrain tire|all-terrain]] style tires (first used on Revo), a [[wheelie]] bar, and a different body paint scheme. It has a claimed top speed of 45+MPH.

In 2008, Traxxas introduced a revised T-Maxx 3.3. The new model featured a new body, with new paint and graphics. It also features a new chassis with the wheelbase extended by 30&amp;nbsp;mm which features a new [[skid plate]]. Other features include, new "Hurricane" wheels, new 6.3&amp;nbsp;inch "Giant Maxx" [[All-terrain tire|all-terrain]] style tires (.55&amp;nbsp;inches taller than the previous 5.75&amp;nbsp;inch "Talon" tires), new dual stage air filter, newly standard "resonator" tuned exhaust pipe, and a new digital high torque steering servo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoeco.at/modellbau_news/Press%20release/2008.04%20TRAXXAS%20new%20TMAXX%202008%20.pdf/|title=The New T-Maxx 3.3|publisher=hoeco|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="traxxas.com"/&gt;

;E-Maxx

The E-Maxx is the electric counterpart to the T-Maxx. It shares the same [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and differential parts as the T-Maxx, but trades the central metal chassis for a molded composite tub chassis housing a remote shifted two-speed transmission (now discontinued, the emaxx currently has a 1-speed transmission), two 550 sized electric motors, related electronics and batteries. The original (model 3906) E-Maxx ran on two 7.2 volt battery packs, using a total of 14.4 volts to run the system through its Novak designed EVX [[Electronic speed control|ESC]]. The Novak was also capable of running two 8.4 volt batteries, totaling to 16.8 volts. Traxxas later equipped the model 3906 E-Maxx with a waterproof EVX-2 ESC which runs two 8.4 volt batteries, and can also run [[lithium polymer battery|LiPo]] batteries.

In 2007, Traxxas introduced an updated version of the E-Maxx (model 3905). This model featured a new extended wheelbase chassis, a new transmission [[skid plate]], new waterproof EVX-2 16.8 volt speed control, new sealed differentials, drive shafts, pivot balls, and ball bearings, new dual waterproof steering servos, water tight receiver box, new steering linkage, redesigned bulkheads, new hex hardware, new single speed strengthened, brushless ready transmission (a two-speed transmission is available as an accessory), Revo spec slipper clutch, new battery holders, 3.8&amp;nbsp;inch mirror chrome wheels and "Chevron" tires, and a new body with new paint and revised graphics. Both models have a claimed top speed of 30+ MPH.

;E-Maxx Brushless Edition
In late 2009, Traxxas released the E-Maxx Brushless Edition (model 3908). It features the same Castle Creations "NEU" [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]] and "Mamba Monster" [[Electronic speed control|brushless ESC]] as the E-Revo Brushless Edition. Other features included 17&amp;nbsp;mm splined hubs, a wheelie bar, Traxxas' 2.4[[Hertz|GHz]] radio system, dual waterproof digital high-torque steering servos, heavy duty slipper clutch, 6.3&amp;nbsp;inch "Giant Maxx" tires, white progressive rate springs, black-chrome wheels and bumpers, and new paint and graphics.

As of January 2014 the E-Maxx Brushless Edition comes with the waterproof MXL-6s brushless power system.&lt;ref name="bsrcMXL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsquidrc.com/traxxas-brushless-e-revo-e-maxx-now-waterproof/|title=TRAXXAS BRUSHLESS E-REVO &amp; E-MAXX NOW WATERPROOF|publisher=Tim Mohr; Big Squid RC|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;X-Maxx

In late 2015, Traxxas introduced their largest monster truck to date. The X-Maxx hit the scales at almost 20 pounds. It is almost 30 inches long and almost 14 inches tall. It was given a new waterproof motor/speed control combo known as the VXL-6S brushless power system. Traxxas debuted the Self-Righting feature in the X-Maxx. This feature allows the user to press a button on the transmitter that engages the truck. The truck then rocks itself until it is back on all four tires. 
The X-Maxx also featured an entirely new chassis and suspension setup. Another notable feature that debuted on the X-Maxx is the clipless body mounting system that uses a latch system and not the standard body post and clip design. The X-Maxx was also equipped with Traxxas Stability Management to help users maintain control of the truck in conditions where traction is low.

===Revo trucks===
;Revo 3.3

In July 2009, Traxxas introduced a further revised Revo 3.3. Changes included a new body with new paint and graphics, new dual waterproof digital high torque steering servos, Traxxas' new 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system, an improved "Optidrive" two-speed reversing transmission, and new progressive 2 suspension rocker arms. Also, new deeper offset 3.8&amp;nbsp;inch "Geode" wheels increase overall width by 1&amp;nbsp;inch and new 6.3&amp;nbsp;inch "Monster Maxx" tires (lifted from the current T-Maxx) increase ground clearance by .25&amp;nbsp;inches to 4.25&amp;nbsp;inches and overall height by .9&amp;nbsp;inches to 11.02&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2009/07/21/traxxas-revo-3-3-4wd-nitro-monster-truck-reverse-2-4ghz-and-more/|title=Traxxas Revo 3.3 4WD Nitro Monster Truck: Reverse, 2.4GHz and more!|accessdate=July 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710085341/http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2009/07/21/traxxas-revo-3-3-4wd-nitro-monster-truck-reverse-2-4ghz-and-more/|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Slayer Pro 4X4
The Slayer is a four-wheel drive [[Championship Off-Road Racing|short-course]] nitro race truck. This vehicle shares many parts with the two nitro Revos including the suspension (excepting the suspension arms, which are shorter and only have one push-rod mounting hole), chassis from the 2.5, and engine of the 3.3. The body of the Slayer is larger than normal 1/10 scale vehicles; this moves the tires inboard the body rather than outboard like other stadium trucks on the market today. Slayer comes stock RTR with the TRX 3.3 racing engine and has a claimed top speed of 50+ mph.
A newer version of the Slayer was released in 2010 to update the race replica style, Slayer Pro 4x4 has [[BFGoodrich]] Mud Terrain tires or Kumho Road Venture tires. Along with the new tires new shells were released to capture the latest TORC looks.
An extended wheelbase and longer A-Arms were added to make the ultimate nitro short course R/C race truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2010/07/07/traxxas-slayer-pro-4x4/|title=Traxxas Slayer Pro 4X4|publisher=Trevor "Chilly" Duncan|accessdate=July 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710110451/http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2010/07/07/traxxas-slayer-pro-4x4/|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;E-Revo
In May 2008 Traxxas launched an electric powered version of the Revo, called the E-Revo.  The electronics are identical to the E-Maxx 16.8, consisting of dual "Titan" 550 motors, EVX-2 Waterproof ESC, and waterproof high torque servos.  The front and rear assemblies do not differ from the original Revo, but the chassis is injection molded plastic instead of an aluminum semi-monocoque chassis. Notable features include enclosed battery compartments with air intakes for cooling and a full length [[skid plate]] that completely encloses the transmission and central [[drive shaft]]s. It also features a stadium truck style low-profile body instead of a pickup truck style body like the nitro Revo. Like the E-Maxx 16.8, the E-Revo is claimed by Traxxas to be waterproof and safe to use in wet environments. It has a claimed top speed of 30+MPH.

;E-Revo Brushless Edition

In late fall 2008 Traxxas introduced the E-Revo Brushless Edition. It uses a single Castle Creations "NEU" [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]] and "Mamba Monster" [[Electronic speed control|brushless ESC]] in place of the dual "titan" brushed motors and EVX-2 waterproof [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] on the standard E-Revo. Other new features include Traxxas high current battery connectors and Traxxas' new 2.4[[Hertz|GHz]] radio system (the old system was 27[[Hertz|MHz]]). The claimed top speed varies from 25+mph on 14.4 volts from twin 6 cell [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|NiMH]] battery packs (7.2 volts each, not recommended by Castle Creations) and the stock gear ratio to 65+MPH on 22.2 volts from twin 3S [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|LiPo]] batteries (11.1 volts each) and an optional taller gear ratio.
As of January 2014, the E-Revo Brushless Edition comes with the waterproof MXL-6s brushless power system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcdriver.com/traxxas-e-revo-brushless-with-waterproof-electronics/|title=Traxxas E-Revo Brushless with Waterproof Electronics|publisher=RC Driver Magazine|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bsrcMXL" /&gt;

;E-Revo VXL Brushless Edition

In early 2018 Traxxas introduced the E-Revo VXL Brushless Edition (model 86086-4). It uses a single brushless, non-sensored, 2200kV motor with a Velineon VXL-6s [[Electronic speed control|brushless ESC]] and is largely a revamp of the E-Revo Brushless Edition and is considered a 'Maxx-Spec' truck borrowing much of its upgrades from the X-Maxx. The claimed top speed is 70+ mph (when fitted with the upgraded optional gearing), and runs on twin 2S or 3S [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|LiPo]] batteries. This model uses the TQi™ 2-channel transmitter with 6533 TSM receiver.

;Summit

The Summit was introduced in early 2009 and is one of Traxxas' newest models. It is intended to be Traxxas' extreme terrain monster truck but is not a true rock crawler and does not fit into current [[Rock crawling|Rock crawler]] classes. Many components are carried over from the E-Revo, including the chassis and major suspension and steering components, major transmission and [[Powertrain|drive line]] components, and the EVX-2 waterproof [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] with Low Voltage Detection. New components on the Summit included new 7&amp;nbsp;inch diameter "Canyon AT" soft [[all-terrain tire|all terrain]] style tires with soft foam inserts mounted on new 3.8&amp;nbsp;inch "Geode" [[beadlock]] style wheels, new front and rear remote [[locking differential]]s, new high articulation [[Constant-velocity joint|CV joints]], Traxxas' new "TQ4" 4-channel [[transmitter]], and a new 10 LED lighting system integrated into the bumpers with 4 white [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] (for headlights) and 6 red [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] (for tail lights). The Summit is powered by one of Traxxas' new "Titan 775" brushed 775 sized high torque [[Internal fan-cooled electric motor|fan-cooled]] motor. The transmission is a two-speed remote shifted unit with an ultra low [[Gear ratio|ratio]] 70:1 first gear (for low speed climbing) and a 25:1 second gear (for higher speed off roading) Another feature is an integrated "Exo-Cage" external [[roll cage]]. Updates for 2010 included the TQ2.4 4-channel 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system. Updates for 2011 included Prographix-painted body, a 4-channel TQi 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system with available iPhone / iPod dock, and the addition of a version of the EVX-2 electronic speed control compatible with lithium-polymer batteries. A further revision in 2014 updated the radio to be compatible Traxxas Link Wireless Module which can be used with Android, iPhone, or iPod devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/56076-1summit |title=Summit: 1/10 Scale 4WD Electric Extreme Terrain Monster Truck with TQi Traxxas Link Enabled 2.4GHz Radio System |publisher=Traxxas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1/16 scale models===
;1/16 E-Revo
The brushed version of the 1/16 E-Revo features the Titan 12-Turn motor and XL 2.5 Electronic Speed Control as its power system. The chassis, drivetrain, suspension, wheels, tires, and body are shared between both models of the 1/16 E-Revo.

;1/16 E-Revo VXL
Released in late spring 2009, the E-Revo VXL 1/16 is essentially a scaled down version of the larger 1/10 scale E-Revo. The body, wheels, tires, suspension and drive components are all nearly identical in design to the 1/10 scale E-Revo, just scaled down. It is powered by a Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC, both scaled down versions of the Velineon 3500kv brushless motor and VXL-3s brushless ESC used in Traxxas' 1/10 scale brushless vehicles. Some of the inevitable sacrifices inherent with the smaller scale include the lack of the optional two-speed transmission, many rubber sealed components, and dual steering servos offered on the 1/10 scale version. Claimed top speeds depend on which battery packs are used.  One 7.2 v NiMH pack will reach 30&amp;nbsp;mph. Two 7.2 v NiMH packs will reach 50&amp;nbsp;mph. One 3s 11.1v lipo pack will reach 50&amp;nbsp;mph.

;1/16 Summit VXL
The Summit VXL 1/16 was released on November 1, 2010. It is a smaller version of the 1/10 scale Summit without locking diffs, LED lights and dual steering servos. It is powered by a Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 with the exception of a few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers.The claimed top speed is 25–40&amp;nbsp;mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used. Optional front and rear LED lights are available, pre-drilled holes are located in the front and rear bumpers.

;1/16 Slash 4X4
Released in late spring 2009, The Slash VXL 1/16 is Traxxas' 1/16 scale [[Championship Off-Road Racing|short-course]] electric race truck. Although it bears the same name as 1/10 scale Slash, the designs are completely different. The 1/10 scale Slash is based on the two-wheel drive stadium truck family chassis while the Slash VXL 1/16 is actually based on a scaled down version of the four-wheel drive Revo family chassis, similar to the one used on the E-Revo VXL 1/16, and it is really more like a scaled down, electric version of the Slayer. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 with the exception of a few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers. The claimed top speed is 30–50&amp;nbsp;mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used.

===Slash trucks===
The Slash lineup of [[short course off road racing|short course]] trucks are offered in two-wheel drive and 4X4 variations with brushed or brushless motors and a standard or Low-CG (low [[center of gravity]]) chassis.

;Slash

The Traxxas Slash was introduced in 2008&lt;ref name="rccaraction.com"/&gt; and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though not as high as the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3&amp;nbsp;inch (diameter) x 1.7&amp;nbsp;inch (width) [[all-terrain tire|all-terrain]] style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0&amp;nbsp;inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex. Out-of-the-box this car features a TITAN 12 turn motor. The 2.2/3.0 design was to clear the slayers revo-spec pillow ball suspension components, Traxxas high current battery connectors, metal transmission gears, new waterproof XL-5 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]], Waterproof 2075 steering servo, 4 channel micro [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], sealed water tight receiver box, adjustable [[camber angle|camber]] links, rubber sealed [[ball bearing]]s, [[nerf bar]]s, hex hardware, light duty drive shaft yokes, new battery hold-downs, short-course truck style bumpers, progressive rate springs, and a wide short course truck style body that encompasses the tires are some of its features. The claimed top speed is about 20+MPH.

;Slash
A step up from the original Slash, this Slash model features Race Replica bodies. It features the Titan 12-Turn motor and XL-5 Electronic Speed Control as its power system. It also shares the same wheel/tire combo as the other Slash models.

;Slash OBA
In late 2014, Traxxas introduced its exclusive On-Board Audio system in the Slash OBA.&lt;ref name="slashoba"/&gt; Samples were taken from the full-size Traxxas short course race truck and used to create the intuitive sound that responds to your throttle inputs.

;Slash VXL with TSM
The Traxxas Slash VXL proved to be a very popular choice for beginner and advanced drivers alike. 
The Slash VXL received a factory-installed Low-CG chassis and the Traxxas Stability Management (TSM) which dramatically improved the overall handling and performance across varying terrains and conditions. The TSM is especially noticeable in low-traction situations such as wet or slick concrete, loose dirt and gravel, and ice and snow.

;Slash VXL with TSM &amp; OBA
The Slash VXL with On-Board Audio, Traxxas Stability Management, and factory-installed Low-CG chassis brought realistic sound and advanced handling to the Slash 2WD platform.

;Robby Gordon Gordini Slash
Famed racer, [[Robby Gordon]], who has raced behind the wheel in [[NASCAR]], desert races such as the [[Baja 1000]], and [[Dakar Rally]] had his Dakar racing rig turned into 1/10-scale by Traxxas in the form of the Robby Gordon Gordini Slash. The Gordini Slash is based on the Slash 2WD platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/58044-1robbygordongordini|title=Traxxas RTR Robby Gordon Gordini Slash|publisher=Traxxas|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ford F-150 Raptor
In the fall of 2011 Traxxas released a replica of the, then, Ford F-150 SVT Raptor. The Raptor is based on the award-winning Slash 2WD platform and features a realistic [[Ford Raptor]] body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2011/09/23/traxxas-rtr-f150-raptor-svt/|title=Traxxas Ford F-150 Raptor SVT|publisher=Trevor "Chilly" Duncan|accessdate=July 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710085632/http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2011/09/23/traxxas-rtr-f150-raptor-svt/|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2016, Traxxas released an updated version. Like the full-size [[Ford Raptor]], the model dropped the SVT naming and was simply the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor.

;Nitro Slash
The Traxxas Nitro Slash made its debut in December 2013. It is a two-wheel drive platform using an aluminum chassis and the TRX 3.3 Racing Engine. Though it shares a few parts with existing two-wheel drive models, for the most part, it is an entirely different truck. It uses a single-speed transmission and features a larger fuel tank for extended run times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2012/12/03/traxxas-nitro-slash-world-exclusive/|title=Traxxas Nitro Slash|publisher=RCCarAction.com|accessdate=July 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710071521/http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2012/12/03/traxxas-nitro-slash-world-exclusive/|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2012/12/13/traxxas-nitro-slash/|title=Traxxas Nitro Slash - World Exclusive!|publisher=RCCarAction.com|accessdate=July 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710100006/http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2012/12/13/traxxas-nitro-slash/|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Slash 4X4

Released in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a four-wheel drive one tenth scale short-course electric race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato was introduced in 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and axle carriers, otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length [[double wishbone suspension]] with four oil filled [[coilover]] shocks and progressive rate springs in staggered lengths ("long" up front; "XXlong" in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same "Velineon 3500" 10 turn 3500kV [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]] and "Velineon VXL-3S" non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless ESC]] as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the [[Mid-engine, four-wheel drive layout|M4]] layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper [[clutch]], the main one piece hollow aluminum [[drive shaft]]. The drive shaft sends power to the front and rear [[Limited slip differential|viscous limited slip differentials]], which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping [[half shaft]]s. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, nerf bars, and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica [[BFGoodrich]] [[M+S|Mud-Terrain T/A tires]] with white lettering, 2.2&amp;nbsp;inch satin chrome [[beadlock]] style "SCT" wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque steering servo, Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and [[Hex key|hex hardware]] used throughout. With the stock motor/ESC combo the claimed top speed is 35 to 65+MPH depending on the battery and gearing used. Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct "drop in" replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.

The usual complement of genuine Traxxas accessories will be offered with the Slash 4x4 including a variety of aluminum upgrade parts, a center differential, [[Constant-velocity joint|CV joint half shafts]], sway bars, a stronger clutch, the Mamba Monster Brushless system, and more.

;Slash 4X4 OBA TSM

The Slash 4X4 with Traxxas' exclusive On-Board Audio system and Traxxas Stability Management is the most recent rendition of the 4X4 model. It also comes stock with the Low-CG chassis that is seen in the Ultimate and Platinum and has been available in the Rally.

;Slash 4X4 Ultimate
The Slash 4X4 Ultimate is a step up from the original Slash 4X4. The Ultimate utilizes the Low-CG chassis that was designed for the 4X4 platform. It also features a host of factory-installed accessories such as aluminum axle carriers and steering blocks, telemetry sensors, sway bars, and GTR shocks. The Slash 4X4 Ultimate was built to be the balance between race track competition and backyard fun.

;Slash 4X4 Ultimate (LiPo)
This version of the Slash 4X4 Ultimate boasts the same features as the standard Ultimate, with the exception of the included LiPo battery.

;Slash 4X4 Platinum
Not long after the standard Slash 4x4 was announced, a race-ready "Platinum Edition" was also announced. Much like the Revo Platinum Edition, it lacks a pre-painted body, but includes most of Traxxas' available accessories as stock equipment. New features include big-bore aluminum shocks, a center differential, aluminum hubs and axle carriers, blue anodized aluminum wheel nuts, front and rear sway bars, and racing compound tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2012/11/12/traxxas-slash-4x4-platinum-edition-with-low-cg-chassis-and-hard-anodized-gtr-aluminum-shocks/|title=Traxxas Slash 4X4 Platinum Edition With Low-CG Chassis And Hard-Anodized GTR Aluminum Shocks|publisher=Trevor "Chilly" Duncan; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710104426/http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2012/11/12/traxxas-slash-4x4-platinum-edition-with-low-cg-chassis-and-hard-anodized-gtr-aluminum-shocks/|archivedate=July 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rally VXL
The 1/10-scale Rally made its debut in late 2012. Though the Rally is not a truck, at all, its entire DNA is shared with the Slash 4X4 family. Chassis, suspension, power system, and drivetrain are all shared features making the Rally easy to work on and fun to drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/RealRally|title=Traxxas 1/10 Rally- RC Car Action Magazine Sneak Peek-First Drive|publisher=Devang Patel; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction-digital.com/rccaraction/201212/?pg=44#pg44|title=Real Rally|publisher=Aaron Waldron; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadium trucks and buggies===
;Rustler
The Rustler was first introduced in 1994 and is Traxxas' two-wheel drive 1/10 scale electric [[Stadium truck]]. Its design is very similar to earlier Traxxas stadium trucks. It featured a 4-wheel independent suspension with 4 coilover shocks and 2.2&amp;nbsp;inch wheels. It was powered by a "Stinger" 540 20 turn brushed motor and a 3-speed rotary mechanical speed control or a fully proportional XL-1 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]]. It had a claimed top speed of 24+MPH.
In 2006 Traxxas released the Rustler XL-5. It featured major changes including the new "Titan 12T" 550 12 turn brushed motor, the new XL-5 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]], redesigned transmission, new tires mounted on larger 2.8&amp;nbsp;inch wheels, high torque steering [[Servomechanism|servo]], new ESC mount, Revo spec slipper clutch, select new gray colored parts, white springs, and a new paint scheme and graphics. It has a claimed top speed of 35+MPH.

In 2008 the Rustler XL-5 received the Rustler VXL body with a different paint scheme.

;Rustler VXL TSM
In 2007 Traxxas introduced the Rustler VXL. The new model had several improvements over the standard Rustler XL-5. The biggest one is its "Velineon [[Brushless DC electric motor|Brushless]] system" which consists of a 10 turn 3500kV [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]] and a 320 (rated burst) amp [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless ESC]]. Other features included Traxxas high current connectors with 12 gauge wire, hex hardware, rubber sealed [[ball bearing]]s, adjustable [[Camber angle|camber]] links, [[Chrome plating|black chrome]] wheels, steel transmission gears, strengthened differential yokes, digital high torque steering servo, fiberglass front suspension tie bar, and a new low profile body, paint scheme and graphics. The claimed top speed is 35 to 70+ mph depending on the battery and gearing setup.

As of 2009 both the Rustler XL-5 and Rustler VXL are now waterproof, featuring Traxxas' waterproof XL-5 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] (waterproof VXL3s [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless ESC]] on the Rustler VXL), 4 channel micro receiver, watertight receiver box, and waterproof high torque steering servo (waterproof digital high torque steering servo on the Rustler VXL).

;Nitro Sport;
The Nitro Sport was introduced in 1998. It is powered by the Traxxas .15 engine and later the pro .15 engine It shared many parts with the Nitro Rustler. Differences included a unique body and a few simplified parts, used mostly in the interest of making the model more affordable. It is marketed as a beginner's nitro model.

In 2009, Traxxas introduced a further revised Nitro Sport which features the same 2.8&amp;nbsp;inch wheels and tires as the Nitro Rustler and a new body similar to the Nitro Rustler's with new paint and graphics.

;Nitro Rustler
In 2007, Traxxas released a revised Nitro Rustler 2.5 (model 4407). The new model featured bigger wheels (mounted on 2.8-inch rims), a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system and new low profile Prographix painted bodies, and claimed a 50&amp;nbsp;mph top speed (using optional gears). The engine was the same EZ-Start 2 equipped TRX2.5 and but was eventually replaced with the better tuned 2.5R piston sleeve design.

The 4407 model has been replaced with the 4409 variant which sports all the same features except the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio which has been replaced with a Traxxas Top Qualifier two-channel FM unit, accompanied by a price drop. Body colors currently indicate the radio frequency channel of the Nitro Rustler as follows: Silver/Red is A2, Red/Silver is A4, Blue/Silver is A5 and Silver/Blue is A6.
This model has proved to be a very reliable and tough option when it comes to bashing and has a wide selection of aftermarket manufacturers offering stronger aluminum and composite chassis and suspension components, performance exhausts and more.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} On the other hand, some people{{Who|date=November 2012}} argue that its handling is sub-par for circuit racing, although after-market can address this issue.

;Bandit

The Traxxas Bandit was first introduced in 1995 and is Traxxas' 1/10 scale two-wheel drive buggy. It shares most of its parts with the Rustler, including the central chassis, motor, speed controls, transmission (albeit with a different gear ratio), rear shocks and shock tower, and radio system. The differences include shorter front and rear suspension arms, camber and steering links, buggy style smaller diameter and narrower wheels and tires, and a buggy style body with rear wing.

;Funny Car
Released in 2012, the Funny Car is a straight-line R/C dragster. It is powered by the ET-3s brushless power system developed by Castle Creations. On a 3S LiPo battery, it is quoted to reach 70&amp;nbsp;mph. It comes with a Traxxas TQi 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system. Scale design features include a tube-frame chassis, lift-up body, and burnout, stage, and launch modes.

;XO-1

The XO-1 is an on-road RTR 1/7 scale electric "supercar" that is designed to exceed 100&amp;nbsp;mph out of the box. To achieve this, Traxxas developed aerodynamic components to improve stability and reduce drag, and also worked with Castle Creations to create a more powerful custom ESC and motor. Also, Traxxas developed a new transmitter for it, the TQi 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz, which is built with a dock for an iPhone or iPod touch to enable in-depth, real-time monitoring of driving conditions. An iPhone or iPod touch with the Traxxas Link application is required to unlock the 100&amp;nbsp;mph top speed. Without being unlocked with an Apple device, the car will not go 100&amp;nbsp;mph. The name "XO" is taken from the slogan for the car, "Experts only". The XO-1 was released in late January, 2012 and has a suggested retail price of $699. In 2014, Traxxas updated the XO-1 with bolder graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsquidrc.com/2014-traxxas-xo-1-17th-rtr-super-car/|title=2014 TRAXXAS XO-1 1/7TH RTR SUPER CAR|publisher=Big Squid RC|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/6407xo1 |title=Traxxas – XO-1 (#6407) – Overview |publisher=Traxxas.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 27" long and 12" wide, it is the largest Traxxas electric vehicle.

;Spartan

Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan is a new single drive [[Radio-controlled boat]]. The Spartan represents Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek "deep V" style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8&amp;nbsp;inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25&amp;nbsp;inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless [[Electronic speed control|ESC]], and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)[[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]]. Both the ESC and the motor are [[water cooling|water-cooled]], with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also a departure from the steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4[[Hertz|GHz]] radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current battery connectors, 12 gauge power wire, and stainless steel [[Hex key|hex]] hardware. The claimed topspeed is {{convert|30|mi/h|kn|abbr=on}} with the included dual 8.4 volt [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|NiMH]] batteries. However, the top speed rises to {{convert|50|mi/h|kn|abbr=on}} with optional double 3S [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|LiPo]] battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.

;M41
A mid-Spring release in 2016, the Traxxas M41 Widebody is a [[catamaran]]-style boat that was based on the full-size M41 that was designed and built by Dave's Custom Boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcbperformanceboats.com/portfolio/m41/|title=Dave's Custom Boats}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electronics on the Traxxas M41 were the same that can be found in the Spartan. The M41 did come with Traxxas Stability Management, and was only available with a paint scheme that was inspired by the Traxxas Funny Car that Courtney Force drove in 2015.

==Current aircraft models==

;Aton/Aton+
The Traxxas Aton (pronounced ay-tawn) was released in late 2015. Billed first as an "easy to use aerial photo and video assistant" the Aton became known more as a sport quad for its power and ability to perform tricks. The Aton did come with a fixed mount that enabled the use of a [[GoPro]] or other similar action sports camera. Later, the Aton+ was released. This version of the quad featured a 2-axis gimbal for smoother, clearer images and video. Both quads featured three user modes, six-axis stabilization, Return-to-Home, Air Brakes, and the ability to record flight data. 
Also released with the Aton was the Traxxas Flight Link app. This app worked with the quad giving the user the ability to make adjustments to the quad, change settings, and view telemetry data.

==LaTrax models==
LaTrax was founded in 1974 by Jim Jenkins, the father of Traxxas owner and CEO Mike Jenkins. Today, the LaTrax brand is backed by Traxxas and currently produces conveniently sized 1/18-scale R/C models that are priced under $200."LaTrax delivers the perfect combination of great value, leading performance, ease of use, and award-winning support that make radio control fun for everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://latrax.com/about|title=About LaTrax|publisher=LaTrax|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://latrax.com/products|title=LaTrax Products|publisher=LaTrax|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaTrax models come fully assembled from the factory with batteries and charger included.

;Rally
In mid-2013, the LaTrax Rally made its debut. It was also the first new product to come from the LaTrax reboot. At just over 10-inches long and 6-inches wide, the Rally can fit easily into a backpack. It features waterproof electronics, a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio system, and an all-wheel drive drivetrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2013/07/01/exclusive-new-latrax-rally-we-drive-it-first/|title=EXCLUSIVE!

;Teton
The 1/18-scale LaTrax Teton monster truck was released in early 2014. Though very similar to the previously released Rally, featuring a similar drivetrain, waterproof electronics, and radio system, the Teton does have longer suspension arms and shocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcdriver.com/latrax-teton/|title=The Great Outdoors is Calling|publisher=John R. Barnes for RC Driver Magazine|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;SST
Based on the full-size trucks in the [[Speed Energy Formula Off-Road]] racing series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/|title=Speed Energy Formula Off-Road presented by Traxxas Official Site|publisher=Speed Energy Formula Off-Road|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the LaTrax SST debuted in late 2014. Initially featuring paint schemes for Traxxas athletes [[Sheldon Creed]] and [[Keegan Kincaid]], the orange Speed Energy paint scheme of [[Robby Gordon]]'s truck was later added. The SST shares the same DNA as the Rally and Teton with its chassis, drivetrain, electronics, and radio system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2014/10/02/latrax-adds-short-course-truck-to-118-lineup/|title=LaTrax Adds SST Short-Course Trucks to 1/18 Lineup|publisher=Peter Vieira; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Alias
LaTrax made its first venture into R/C aircraft with the LaTrax Alias. Released in late 2013, the Alias is more of a sport-quad that's designed for aerobatics right out of the box. Like other LaTrax vehicles, and models from parent company Traxxas, the Alias is ready to fly and comes with everything you would need all in one box.
Three different flight modes allow the Alias to be used by first-time pilots as well as veterans. Available in four colors, LaTrax also offers a host of accessories to customize. It's also easy to work on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2013/11/05/latrax-announces-new-alias-quad-copter/|title=LaTrax Announces New Alias Quad-Copter|publisher=Peter Vieira; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsquidrc.com/latrax-alias-rtf-quad-rotor-heli/|title=LATRAX ALIAS RTF QUAD-ROTOR HELI|publisher=Tim Mohr, Big Squid RC|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rotordronemag.com/quad-squad/|title=Quad Squad|publisher=Team Rotordrone|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy models==
The following is a list of vehicles, some with details on past versions, that have either been discontinued or superseded by improved models.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://traxxas.com/support/Legacy-Previous|title=Legacy and Previous Product Support|publisher=Traxxas|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxx family===

T-Maxx uses a single plate aluminum chassis, braced underneath by beam supports. The suspension used a fully independent double A-arm design, supported by eight coil over shocks, two on each corner. The drive system consisted of a mid-mounted Pro .15 nitro engine and a mid-mounted two-speed transmission driving a permanent [[four-wheel drive]] system with no center differential. The tires were massive 5.75 x 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch "chevron" style tires mounted on 3.2&amp;nbsp;inch wheels.

The T-Maxx made its debut in 1999, taking the R/C hobby and industry by storm.&lt;ref name="rccaraction.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/blog/2015/06/09/the-greatest-rc-trucks-of-all-time/|title=The Greatest RC Trucks of All Time|publisher=Peter Vieira; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the T-Maxx 2.5 was introduced. Revisions included lengthened suspension arms and Traxxas' new, more powerful, TRX 2.5 nitro engine.

In 2006, Traxxas introduced a revised T-Maxx 2.5, in an addition to the new T-Maxx 2.5R and T-Maxx 3.3. The revised T-Maxx 2.5 featured minor changes that included new gray colored parts and redesigned bulkheads and differential housings. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.

The T-Maxx 2.5R featured Traxxas' TRX 2.5R nitro engine, a new driveline similar to the Revo's, with the Torque-Control slipper clutch on the spur gear. It also included new gray colored parts and redesigned bulkheads and differential housings. The T-Maxx 2.5R included the Optidrive reverse system (originally only on the Revo) instead of the purely mechanical reverse on the original. The 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick aluminum chassis on the T-Maxx 2.5 was replaced with a stronger 4&amp;nbsp;mm chassis. The driveshafts, pivot balls, and ball bearings were all sealed with blue rubber. The old 3.2&amp;nbsp;inch wheels were replaced with new, larger 3.8&amp;nbsp;inch satin finish wheels with lower profile "chevron" tires. A new body paint scheme was also included. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.&lt;ref name="traxxas.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://traxxas.com/products/models/nitro/49104tmaxxclassic |title=T-Maxx Classic: 1/10-Scale Nitro-Powered 4WD Maxx Monster Truck with TQ 2.4GHz radio system |publisher=Traxxas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;SportMaxx
The SportMaxx model was introduced in 2003 and was based on the original T-Maxx 2.5. A two-wheel drive set up (which simply omitted the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and [[Powertrain|drivetrain]] to the front wheels) was used in the interest of saving weight. A forward only, single speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was used for the same purpose. Other differences included a different [[body shell|body]] with unique paint and graphics and different wheels. It has since been discontinued, although any T-Maxx can essentially be converted to a SportMaxx by installing Traxxas' single speed transmission accessory and removing the drivetrain to the front wheels.

;S-Maxx
The S-Maxx (or Stadium Maxx) was introduced in 2004 and is essentially the same as the Sport Maxx, but it featured a unique racing [[body shell|body]], paint and graphics, pre-glued dirt track oriented tires and a two-speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.

This special edition Maxx Truck is only available at Hobbytown USA outlets.

The S-maxx is now available with the TRX 3.3 engine and has a top speed of 45+ mph.

===Revo family===
The Revo family consists of several models originally based around the Revo.

;Revo
The Revo was introduced in 2004&lt;ref name="rccaraction.com"/&gt; as a complete redesign of a one tenth scale monster truck chassis with a more advanced and reliable design than the T-Maxx. The Revo has become popular in racing, and is also well suited to "bashing" environments such as a backyard or a construction site.  Notable characteristics include the inboard push-rod suspension system with new "GTR" shocks and springs, a complex "monocoque"-type aluminum chassis which lowers the vehicle's center of gravity, a stronger transmission that features electronically controlled reverse, sealed [[limited slip differential]]s, rubber sealed pivot balls, [[drive shaft]]s and [[ball bearing]]s, 3.8&amp;nbsp;inch wheels and [[all-terrain tire|all-terrain]] style "Talon" tires, and an updated version of Traxxas' TRX 2.5 engine, the TRX 2.5R. It has a claimed top speed of 40+MPH.

A new Revo version was launched alongside the T-Maxx 3.3 in 2006, with Traxxas' new, more powerful TRX 3.3 engine.  Because of the demands of Revo owners, the chassis was lengthened 30&amp;nbsp;mm for more stability, and the motor mount area was braced to prevent it from bending. Other minor changes included a longer version of the body with a new paint scheme to accompany the wheelbase stretch, and new wheels. New add-on upgrades were released, including a center differential, that helps transfer power between the front and rear differentials to increase handling, and a rear-braking module that must be used with the center-differential. It has claimed top speed of 45+MPH.

In April 2008, Traxxas released the limited edition Revo Platinum. It came stock with most of Traxxas upgrades and tuning parts normally available as accessories for the standard Revo 3.3. It was intended as a factory racing version of the standard Revo 3.3.

Later in 2008, Traxxas released a revised version of the Revo 3.3. It incorporated some of the features seen on the Revo platinum, including a polished "Resonator" dual chamber exhaust pipe, dual stage air filter, larger 150&amp;nbsp;cc fuel tank, [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]] coated aluminum "GTR" shocks with [[titanium nitride]] shafts, 17&amp;nbsp;mm splined wheel hubs. As is typical of a new Traxxas model, the revised Revo 3.3 received a new paint scheme.

;E-Revo

E-Revo has been tested with a 6S (6 Cell) lipo battery which in return produces amazingly fast speeds up to 65+mph. E-Revo is without a doubt one of the best [http://www.swellrc.com/the-best-of-traxxas-remote-control-cars/ traxxas remote control cars].

;Slayer

===Two-wheel drive family===
The two-wheel drive family consists of a series of nitro and electric models that use a two-wheel drive platform.

Rustler

;Nitro Rustler
Traxxas first introduced the Nitro Rustler in 1997. It is a 1/10 scale two-wheel drive [[stadium truck]]. Although they shared the same name, the Rustler and Nitro Rustler shared few parts (many parts were similar though). It was powered by Traxxas' Pro.15 nitro engine.
[[File:Stampede 003.jpg|thumb|300px|A Nitro Stampede.]]
In 2003, Traxxas released the Nitro Rustler 2.5. The main change was Traxxas' new TRX 2.5 nitro engine. Other changes included new 2.2-inch chrome wheels and paint scheme.
;Stampede;

;Nitro Stampede;

;Nitro Sport
In 2006, Traxxas introduced a revised Nitro Sport. It featured new wheels, select gray colored parts, white springs, rubber sealed [[ball bearing]]s, and a new paint scheme and graphics. It has a claimed top speed of 38+MPH.

;Jato 2.5;
In 2005 Traxxas released the Jato (pronounced Jay-toe) 2.5 (usually referred to as simply "Jato"), which was a completely new design that was based on the 1/10 scale rear wheel drive [[stadium truck]] format popular in the industry, and it replaced the Nitro Rustler as Traxxas' high end stadium truck. It was powered by the same TRX 2.5 nitro engine as the Nitro Rustler but had many new high tech features, some borrowed from the Revo, that set it apart. One of the new features was a sophisticated 2-speed [[automatic transmission]], that improved acceleration and top speed over the single speed Nitro Rustler. A new [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design was another new feature. It included new "GTR" shocks and springs, which were borrowed from the Revo, but used in a traditional configuration instead of the Revo's push-rod configuration. The suspension also included front and rear mounting points for optional [[sway bar]]s, which were offered as Traxxas accessories in three different thicknesses. The suspension was also fully adjustable for [[Camber angle|camber]], [[Caster angle|caster]], [[Toe (automotive)|toe]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|anti-squat]], and [[ride height]]. Other notable features included 2.8&amp;nbsp;inch wheels and tires, a sealed [[limited slip differential]], rubber sealed drive shafts and ball bearings, steering assembly, Revo spec slipper clutch, and hex hardware. It has a claimed top speed of 55+MPH.

;Jato 3.3;

Neither Jato, as it comes out of the box, is legal to race alongside more traditional stadium trucks in industry sanctioned events due to its stock two-speed transmission, but many local clubs allow it to race.  The Jato can be made race legal by replacing the 2-speed, wheels, and the engine with appropriate replacements offered by Traxxas or 3rd party manufacturers.

;Bandit
In 2005, Traxxas offered the Bandit with the XL-1 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] in addition to the existing 3-speed rotary mechanical speed control.

===On-Road===
;Nitro 4-tec
Later in 1998 Traxxas released the limited edition Nitro 4-tec pro. This was a stripped down race version. It did not include a radio system, servos, or even an engine (owners could install the Traxxas or aftermarket components of their choosing) and the body came unpainted. The model did however come with most of the then available Traxxas accessories, including many carbon fiber pieces, and aftermarket Pro-Line "V-Rage" performance tires.

In 2003 Traxxas released the Nitro 4-tec 2.5. The new model featured Traxxas' new TRX 2.5 nitro engine and a new paint scheme and revised graphics. The claimed top speed is 60+MPH.

;4-Tec (electric)
Traxxas first introduced the 4-tec in 1998 and it is Traxxas' 1/10 four-wheel drive scale electric [[Touring car racing|touring car]]. The 4-tec shares a few parts with the Nitro 4-tec, like the shocks, springs, wheels and the belt drive four-wheel drive system is similar. The chassis however is all nylon composite instead of aluminum and the transmission is a single speed unit. The 4-tec is powered by a "Stinger" 540 20 turn motor and uses either a 3-speed rotary mechanical speed control or a fully proportional XL-1 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] (first offered in 2005). The claimed top speed is 24+MPH. It has since been discontinued.

;XO-1;

The XO-1 is the worlds fastest ready to run (RTR) R/C car. The motor in the XO-1 is built by Traxxas and Castle Creations. This car has a claimed top speed of 100+ MPH.

;1/8 Scale NHRA Funny Car;

===1/16 scale===

;Slash VXL 1/16
Cheaper, brushed motor, versions of the 1/16 E-Revo, 1/16 Summit and 1/16 Slash, utilizing "Titan 380" motors and XL-2.5 ESCs, were added later in 2009 &amp; 2010.

;Grave Digger 1/16
The Grave Digger 1/16, released in January 2012, is a scaled down version of the [[Monster Jam]] replicas Grave Digger 1/10 scale [[monster truck]].  Unlike the earlier Traxxas 1/16 models there is only a brushed version of this model; This is also the only 1/16 model that is not [[4 wheel drive]].  This Traxxas model comes with Monster Jam tires, Monster Jam wheels, a 6 cell [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|NIMH battery]], a Titan 12T 550 brushed motor, an XL-2.5 electronic speed control, and a small backpack for traveling (as well as a way of selling the vehicle to a younger collector, who could use the backpack for school).  A velineon [[brushless motor|brushless]] system can be installed to make the model travel at about 40&amp;nbsp;mph with two batteries, but with a [[brushed motor]] the claimed top speed is about 20&amp;nbsp;mph.

;Traxxas Rally 1/16
Released in mid – October 2010, based on the 1/16 Revo VXL. Claimed top speed of 50+ mph. It is powered by a Velineon 380 brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC.
A version of the rally was a Ken Block Gymkhana Fiesta, featuring green wheels, green push-rods and turnbuckles, and the classy look of [[Ken Block]]'s Fiesta.

==Legacy flight models==
The QR-1 and DR-1 launched together at the end of 2012, Traxxas's first flying models&lt;ref name="traxxasshowroom"/&gt; take advantage of recent improvements in battery and motion-sensing technology which now allow useful amounts of time in the air and the automation of basic flight stability. They use
[[Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithium-ion polymer (LiPo)]] batteries, and micro-sized [[Vibrating structure gyroscope|gyroscopes and accelerometers]] similar to those developed for mobile phones and game controllers to help the pilot fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/top30of2013|title=Hot For 2013 [Sneak Peek]|publisher=Devang Patel; RC Car Action|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;QR-1
The quadcopter is mechanically simpler than the helicopter, but has some sophisticated electronics on board to provide stability in flight. The QR-1 has four constant-pitch propellers, which rotate at different speeds to control the movements of the aircraft. The propellors' speed is decided in detail by firmware on a circuit board in the aircraft, which compares the control inputs from the pilot with measurement of what the aircraft is actually doing in the air provided by the tiny gyroscopes and accelerometers also on the board. This arrangement allows automatic response to sudden gusts, and helps the pilot when in "expert mode" to do flips and barrel rolls.

;DR-1
The Traxxas DR-1 has a dual-rotor coaxial design, with a flybar above, which together with the automatic gyro stabilisation make for a helicopter in the easy-to-fly beginner's category. It comes with a 2.4Ghz spread-spectrum radio transmitter, so you don't have to worry about interference from anyone else flying nearby.

==Legacy marine models==
The following is a list of previous-generation boats.&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt;

===Nitro Vee===
The Traxxas Nitro Vee was first introduced in 1995 and it is Traxxas' only nitro-powered [[Radio-controlled boat]]. It is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek "deep V" style hull. It is powered by the marine version of Traxxas' Pro.15 nitro engine, which features a [[Water cooling|water-cooled head]] instead of the land version's [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] head. Power is sent directly (no reduction gears) to a single surface piercing prop. It is steered via a servo controlling the rudder/prop. Like all Traxxas nitro RTRs, the Nitro Vee features Traxxas' EZ Start electric starter/glow plug warmer. Other notable features include an inline clutch, to aid in low speed maneuvering and stop the prop from spinning while the engine is idling (useful for safety if the boat is out of water), and Traxxas' patented "Return to shore" system. It has since been discontinued.

===Villain series===

====Villain IV====
Traxxas first introduced the Villain IV in 1989 and it was Traxxas's first RTR [[Radio-controlled boat]]. It is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek "deep V" style hull. It was powered by two [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] (a [[water cooling]] kit utilizing water jackets that circulated water around the motors was available as a Traxxas accessory) "Stinger" 20 turn 540 size brushed motors and an [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] (with [[heat sink]]) BXL-1 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]]. Power was sent down twin shafts (one for each motor) through a 2:1 gear reduction drive to twin counter rotating surface piercing props. It was steered via a servo controlling both props/rudders. One feature unique among Traxxas boats was the Villain IV's realistic scale details, including realistic graphics, chrome trim and steering wheel (non functional of course). The Villain IV has since been discontinued.

====Villain EX====
Traxxas first introduced the Villain EX in 2003 and it is a twin drive electric [[Radio-controlled boat]]. It features many of the same parts as the Villan IV including the hull, twin drive system, radio system (except the transmitter) and steering. Differences include larger [[Internal fan cooled electric motor|fan cooled]] (the [[water cooling]] accessory is still available) "Titan" 21 turn 550 sized brushed motors, a new [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] 14.4 volt EVX Marine (instead of the land EVX's [[air cooling]]) [[Electronic speed control|ESC]], Traxxas' "TQ" pistol grip transmitter, and a new sealed, watertight electronics box. The Villain EX also features new graphics (which are flashy and colorful rather than realistic as on the Villain IV) and lacks the scale details found on the Villain IV.

In 2007 the Villain EX received a new [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] 14.4 volt EVX-2 Marine [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] (not to be confused with the air-cooled 16.8 volt EVX-2 Waterproof [[Electronic speed control|ESC]] used on Traxxas land vehicles) featuring Traxxas high current battery connectors. It has since been discontinued.

====Villain====
Traxxas first introduced the Villain in 2001 and it is a twin drive electric [[Radio-controlled boat]]. It is almost identical to the Villain EX, with the only major differences being the motors and ESC, and it is essentially an updated Villain IV. The Villain is powered by the same [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] (with the Villain IV/Villain EX water cooling accessory kit still available) "Stinger" 20 turn 540 sized brushed motors as the Villain IV. Instead of the Villain IV's air-cooled BXL-1 [[Electronic speed control|ESC]], the Villain features the new [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] XL-10M (marine) 8.4 volt [[Electronic speed control|ESC]]. The Villain features slightly different graphics than the Villain EX. It has since been discontinued.

==Team Traxxas (Legacy Models)==
Traxxas was once a professional line of racing vehicles, but now has retired all of the "TRX Pro Series" line of vehicles.&lt;ref name="legacy"/&gt;

;Sledgehammer
A entry-level one-tenth scale, electric, rear-wheel-drive monster truck. It had four-wheel independent suspension and eight oil filled shocks. It came with an early 90s regular cab Chevrolet truck body. The three versions produced include the original with white tub, white shocks, and gold aluminum plates; the second version (circa 1994) with white tub, black shocks, and black aluminum plates, and the third and final version which was all black plastic and blue aluminum plates.

;Spirit
A entry level touring chassis, featuring a truck body.  This model had very few adjustment options, and was meant for hobbyists not likely to customize or tune the vehicle.  This vehicle was available as an electric model only. The Spirit utilizes the same chassis as The Cat, except The Cat was an off-road buggy which also had the same intention. The chassis design was a modified version of a toy-grade Nikko chassis.

;Nitro Hawk
Traxxas's first RTR Nitro truck. The Traxxas' Nitro Hawk, though already a legacy model, is highly collectible and are still being sold at toy auctions till this time. The highest recorded bid, in 2011, sold for $360.00, much more than the price of a new one.
The Traxxas Nitro Hawk was a two-wheel drive stadium truck with an all-aluminum chassis that came with four different engines, the Image .12, the TRX12, TRX15 and Pro15 in a special long crankshaft configuration. The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel secured with a nut at the end of the crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its shoe brake system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust spring load and 2.2-inch lite dish wheels with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back.  Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.
First editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.

;SRT (Stadium Race Truck)
The Traxxas SRT had a zero-flex fiberglass chassis reinforced by a battery box and a fiberglass front deck. It had a metal gear transmission, and an aluminum motor plate. It came as an unassembled kit and was discontinued in 1998.

;TRX-1
The TRX-1 was a single decked, graphite chassis professional racing buggy.

==Nitro engines==
Currently, as with all of recent Traxxas products, all Traxxas engines are now designed in house at their Plano, Texas headquarters and manufactured in their own manufacturing facility located in Taiwan.

Traxxas has equipped most of its newer models with engines derived from the TRX 2.5. The current engine lineup consists of the older TRX Pro .15, the TRX 2.5, 2.5R, and the newest TRX 3.3 racing engine.  The 2.5 represents the displacement in cubic centimeters, equivalent to .15 cubic inches. Although the displacement is roughly the same, Traxxas designed the 2.5 from the ground up with a refined crankcase, cooling head, port timing, and other components to produce more power, in line with expensive aftermarket offerings. The engine is physically taller, and the exhaust manifold is a circular port on the rear of the engine. In Spring 2006, Traxxas introduced the TRX 3.3 small block.  The 3.3&amp;nbsp;cc displacement is about equal to 0.201 in³. The Traxxas 3.3 still maintains the same engine mounting dimensions as the 2.5, allowing the 3.3 to serve as a drop in replacement for 2.5 equipped Traxxas vehicles.

Traxxas' first engines were released in 1992. The Image 12 was a standard rebranded engine of average performance. The advent of the later TRX .12 engines were a dramatic improvement over the Image .12 and subsequently the vehicles Traxxas made increased in performance, quality and popularity.

The TRX .12's were entry level engines, and put out mediocre performance by today's standards.  Later, Traxxas introduced the TRX .15 and Pro .15 engines.  These produced slightly more power and accepted the EZ-Start system.  Traxxas named their early engines with the size in cubic inches, which is relatively common for US-made model engines. They were still considered entry level, and were often replaced with more powerful after market engines when they wore out.  Traxxas' boats used a version of the TRX Pro .15 which had a water cooling cylinder head.  The Nitro Stampede two-wheel drive monster truck, Nitro Sport two-wheel drive truck, and Nitro Vee boat model still use the Pro .15.

===Features===

====EZ-Start====
Traxxas brought on-board electric starting systems into widespread use for nitro fuel powered models. Most of their nitro-powered models carry this "EZ Start" system. It consists of a small electric motor geared to a rear engine shaft and a wiring harness to start the nitro engine in a way similar to full size automobiles. The wiring has leads to the electric motor and the electrically heated glow plug. The starter battery is kept separate from the model in a wand-like device.  The end of the wand is inserted into the vehicle's receiver, and then the user presses the button on the wand. The electric motor turns the rear shaft until ignition, or until the wand's battery drains. Traxxas has also released pull start systems for their engines, so that the EZ Start system can be replaced if the owner so chooses.  Some models may be started with starter or "bump" boxes, allowing the installation of engines with no on-car starting method, no rear shaft (and no leaking shaft seal)

====Return to shore====
A patented system employed on Traxxas's boats, the return to shore system provides similar user security to that of a fail safe on a nitro car or truck.  The return to shore system is an electric motor that drives the propeller so that a nitro boat can be driven to shore, in the event that the engine cuts out during use.  This operates by applying the brake which activates gearing that couples an electric motor to the propeller shaft of a nitro-powered boat.  This enables the boat to be returned to shore.

===Customization===
Traxxas is a top retailer in the hobby level radio control market.  Their designs make many customizations and modifications possible.  The E-Maxx has been used as a base chassis by the US Troops in [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|post-invasion Iraq]] as a bomb scout&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.asmenews.org/features/1204iraq.html |title=Press Releases Latest News and Other Related Resources – ASME |publisher=Asmenews.org |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127154511/http://www.asmenews.org/features/1204iraq.html |archivedate=2011-01-27 |df= }}{{Dead link|08=October 2018|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robotzeitgeist.com/tag/applied-marine-technology |title=Applied marine technology |publisher=Robotzeitgeist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/28/AR2006072801462_pf.html |title=Fighting Roadside Bombs: Low-Tech, High-Tech, Toy Box |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iedrobot.com/marcbot/marcbotindex.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225062841/http://iedrobot.com/marcbot/marcbotindex.htm|date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US Military the troops built this from the ground up; however, American troops clearly used the chassis and other inexpensive off-the-shelf E/T-Maxx parts.

'''Voice of the Iraqi People''' was a radio station managed by the Abroad Organization Committee ({{lang-ar|لجنة تنظيم الخارج}}) of the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], broadcasting from [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. The radio station began services in the early 1960s. The Abroad Organization Committee appointed Aziz al-Haj to run the radio broadcasts. Since the party was underground and persecuted in Iraq, this radio station was virtually the only organ with which the party could reach out to people inside Iraq. However, the political movements of the Abroad Organization Committee was severely restricted by the conditions of their exile in the [[Socialist Bloc]]. While the Iraqi Communist Party developed a more critical approach to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], the Voice of the Iraqi People broadcast were fully in line with the Soviet positions.&lt;ref name="tareq1"/&gt;

'''Wired''' was a [[Belgian]] annual [[demoparty]] which ran from 1994 to 1998. Typical competitions included [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Amiga]] demos and intros, handmade and [[ray traced graphics]], music and surprise competitions (where theme and rules are announced around two hours prior the deadline).

== History ==

The first edition took place at the [[Université de Mons-Hainaut]] in [[Mons]] from 29 to 31 October 1994. It was organized by ''Antares'' and ''Babylon 5''. Ten demos entered the [[Personal computer|PC]] competition but only two [[Amiga]] productions were presented. ''Necronomicon'' by ''Imagine'' won the PC competition. Unusually for a [[demoparty]], a ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' tournament was held at ''Wired '94''.

One year later, ''Wired '95'' was held from 3–5 November 1995 at the same place and organized by ''Antares'', [[Imphobia]] and [[TFL-TDV]]. This time, no more Amiga competitions were held, ''Wired'' became a PC only party, but additional categories were introduced: 4k intro (which previously occurred as a surprise competition only) and [[ANSI art|ANSI]]. The PC demo section saw 17 entries and the victory of ''Valhalla'' with ''Soltice''. Another remarkable production was the 64k intro winner: ''Magic Carpet'' by [[Keen Like Frogs]]. This [[demogroup|group]] managed to code an engine similar to the one used ''[[Magic Carpet (video game)|Magic Carpet]]'' in 64 kilobytes only, complete with textures and music. A French TV channel also chose this event to record a report on [[demoscene]].

For its '96 edition, which took place from 1–3 November 1996, the place changed to a sport-hall in [[Wasmes]], a little town near [[Mons]].  Organizers were [[Imphobia]] and [[Antares]].
In this new location, the event gathered about 600 demosceners from all over Europe. Again, the 64k intro competition revealed a ground breaking production: ''Paper'' by [[Psychic Link]] &amp; ''ACME''; this prefigured an effect that would become known as [[cellshading]]. This edition introduced the [[Coca-Cola]] drinking contest, where each contestant would have to drink a 1.5 L bottle as fast as possible. 

In 1997, the place stayed the same but the party date moved from winter to summer (being held on 18–20 July). Imphobia was joined by [[Bomb]], [[Pulpe]], [[Smash Designs]] and ''W.O.W.'' in its organizing efforts. This edition marked the return of Amiga and even [[Commodore 64|C-64]] competitions. The winning PC 64k intro stand out again. This time, it was ''Jizz'' by The Black Lotus introducing the generated objects and textures system to the PC world. The Magic Carpet engine was coded in 4k this time by [[Dawn of a New Age]]. For the first time, a 100kb PC game competition was held.

''Wired '98'' took place on 17–19 July 1998 and attracted 800 attenders. Organizing team was composed of Imphobia, Melting Pot, Pulpe, W.O.W. and Role. Since it was announced as the final edition, a very strange atmosphere overwhelmed the party mood. Only a few Amiga productions showed up. The PC demo competition was won by ''Cocoon'' with the heavy ''Syndrome'' demo, and the PC 64K intro competition was won by ''Quad'' with ''Theta''.

== Future ==

A ''Wired'' was to be held in [[Brussels]] in 2000, but the idea was eventually dropped.

A [[demoparty]] called ''[[Rewired (demoparty)|Rewired]]'' was planned for 2008 in [[Belgium]], but there is no link with the original ''Wired'' (a different place, different organizers and a much smaller capacity of 250 people).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7998">'''World Series of Fighting (Central America)''' formerly '''Omega MMA''' is a [[Nicaragua]]n [[Mixed Martial Arts]] promotion based out of [[Managua, Nicaragua]]. The promotion made its debut on May 3, 2013. In the Summer of 2013, ''Omega MMA'' was quietly purchased by [[World Series of Fighting|WSOF]], and was rebranded as ''World Series of Fighting: Central America''. The promotion held its first event on July 27, 2013, headlined by former boxing world champion [[Ricardo Mayorga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.mmajunkie.com/forum/threads/wsof-quietly-going-global.57010/|title=WSOF Quietly Going Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
WSOF employs the [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]] as Fighters compete in a cage.

===Rounds===
Every round in WSOF competition is contested with a five-minute time limit. Championship bouts are contested with five, five-minute rounds, and non-title bouts are contested with three, five-minute rounds. There is a one-minute rest period in between rounds.

===Match outcome===
Matches usually end via:
*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps on the mat or his opponent or verbally submits.
*'''Technical Submission''': A technical submission is achieved when the referee stops a fight due to an injury resulting from a submission hold or due to a fighter going unconscious from a choke.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue.
*'''Technical Knockout''' (TKO): If a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ended as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage: (the referee determines a fighter cannot "intelligently defend" himself; if warnings to the fighter to improve his position or defense go unanswered—generally, two warnings are given, about 5 seconds apart)
**doctor stoppage (a ringside doctor due to injury or impending injury, as when blood flows into the eyes and blinds a fighter)
**corner stoppage (a fighter's own corner-man signals defeat for their own fighter)
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)

Note: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively).

A fight can also end in a '''technical decision''', '''disqualification''', '''forfeit''', '''technical draw''', or '''no contest'''. The latter two outcomes have no winners.
