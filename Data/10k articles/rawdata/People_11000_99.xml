'''Adriaen van de Velde''' (bapt. 30 November 1636, [[Amsterdam]]{{snd}}bur. 21 January 1672, Amsterdam), was a Dutch animal and [[Landscape art|landscape painter]], son of [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and brother of [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], the marine painter.

==Life==
Adriaen did not want to become a marine painter so he was trained in the studio of [[Jan Wynants]], the landscape painter. There he made the acquaintance of [[Philip Wouwerman]], who is believed to have aided him in his studies of animals, and to have exercised a powerful and beneficial influence upon his art. Having made exceptionally rapid progress, he was soon employed by his master to introduce figures into his landscape compositions, and he rendered a similar service to [[Meindert Hobbema|Hobbema]], [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Ruisdael]], [[Adriaen Hendriksz Verboom|Verboom]] and other contemporary artists.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
According to Houbraken, he died while in collaboration with [[Jan van der Heyden]] and [[Frederik de Moucheron]], painting animals on their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0348.htm Adriaan vanden Velde biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adriaen van de Velde - Agony in the Garden - WGA24475.jpg|thumb|268px|left|Agony in the Garden]]
His favourite subjects were scenes of open pasture land, with sheep, cattle and goats, which he executed with dexterity, with much precision of touch and truth of draughtsmanship, and with clear silvery colouring. He painted a few small winter scenes with skaters, and several religious subjects, such as the ''Descent from the Cross'', for a [[Roman Catholic]] [[schuilkerk|hidden church]] in Amsterdam{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and ''The Migration of Jacob'' (1663, [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=64955 | title =Adriaen van de Velde (1636 - 1672), ''The Migration of Jacob'' | last = | first = | date =9 October 2016 | website =Wallace Collection | publisher = | access-date =9 October 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In addition to his paintings, of which nearly two hundred have been catalogued, he executed about twenty [[etching]]s, several of which appear from their dates to have been done in his fourteenth year. They are distinguished by directness of method and by delicacy and certainty of touch. Van de Velde lived in [[Kalverstraat]], near the [[Regulierspoort]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Naysmith studied with [[Harold Craxton]] and Liza Fuchsova at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], and gave a well received recital at [[Wigmore Hall]] in 1967, but experienced personal difficulties in the late 1960s and was evicted from her house in Prebend Gardens, Chiswick.&lt;ref name=TelegFeb15/&gt; Following her eviction Naymsith slept in her car for 26 years until 2002 when it was towed away following campaigning from neighbours to have it removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EI4Z9clsq4IC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=anne+naysmith&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g-bdVIXiEuqoygPIjIGICA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=anne%20naysmith&amp;f=false |title= Cheek by Jowl: A History of Neighbours |page= 196 |date= 2012 |author= Emily Cockayne |publisher= Random House |accessdate= 13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naysmith then lived in a handmade shelter next to [[Stamford Brook Underground station]].&lt;ref name=TelegFeb15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-19495579 |title= Homeless concert pianist's anger over shelter's removal |date= 5 September 2012 |accessdate= 13 February 2015 |work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">'''Barbu Bălcescu''' (1821 or 1825&amp;mdash;January 12, 1884) was a [[Wallachia]]n, later [[Romania]]n lawyer and revolutionary, the younger brother of [[Nicolae Bălcescu]].

Born in [[Bălcești]], [[Vâlcea County]], he attended the Law faculties of the [[Saint Sava College]] and of the [[University of Paris]]; his thesis was on the inalienability of property gained through dowries. During the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], the Provisional Government assigned him as commissioner of [[Buzău County]]. On 8 September, he corresponded with his brother, a leader of the revolution, and took part in the public burning of ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''. He was arrested in [[Bucharest]] and subsequently departed for Ottoman-administered [[Constanța]].&lt;ref name="Aman"/&gt;

In 1856, he was part of the Bucharest magistrates' corps. He belonged to the Bucharest Court of Appeals from 1859 to 1864, and was  alawyer in [[Craiova]] from 1864 to 1876. In 1870 he was inspector for private schools in [[Dolj County]], and he served as Mayor of Craiova in 1875. His three daughters were renowned for their beauty: Olga, married to General Petre Gigurtu and the mother of [[Ion Gigurtu]]; Ana, married to Dr. Dimitrie Culcer; and Zoe, married to judge Nicolae Mandrea. In the summer of 1878, the poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] visited his country house in [[Țânțăreni, Gorj|Florești]]. His Craiova home, built in the 19th century, still stands.&lt;ref name="Aman"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://aman.ro/betawp/wp-content/uploads/personalitati/B/balcescu%20barbu.pdf Bălcescu, Barbu] at the site of the Alexandru and Aristia Aman Dolj County Library&lt;/ref&gt; Originally interred in Craiova's [[Sineasca Cemetery]], in 2003 he was reburied near the [[Nicolae Bălcescu Memorial]] in [[Nicolae Bălcescu, Vâlcea|Nicolae Bălcescu]], Vâlcea County.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www2.gds.ro/Actualitate/2003-06-28/Barbu+Balcescu+s-a+reintors+pentru+ultima+data+acasa!

==Early life==
Palin was born on October 18, 1990, in [[Wasilla, Alaska]] to parents [[Todd Palin|Todd]] and [[Sarah Palin|Sarah (née Heath) Palin]].&lt;ref name="BristolPeople"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sandra |last=Sobieraj|url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20282000,00.html|title=Bristol Palin 'My Life Comes Second Now'|work=[[People Magazine]]|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20230644,00.html|date=September 15, 2008|title=Gov.

Palin was raised largely in Wasilla and attended [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] when her mother was governor of Alaska.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/122009/loc_537591017.shtml|title=Claims by Palin in memoir raise local questions: Officials: No record of threats on daughters Willow and Bristol|first=Pat|last=Forgey|work=Juneau Empire|date=December 20, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403225730/http://juneauempire.com/stories/122009/loc_537591017.shtml#|archive-date=April 3, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2008, she briefly lived in [[Anchorage]] with her aunt and uncle where she attended [[West Anchorage High School]]. After returning to Wasilla, she attended and then graduated from [[Wasilla High School]] in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Palin Graduates from High School |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20279197,00.html|first=Sandra Sobieraj |last=Westfall| date=May 15, 2009| work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Teen pregnancy and media attention===
Palin first became the subject of media attention when her pregnancy was announced during her mother's [[United States presidential election, 2008|unsuccessful run]] for [[Vice President (United States)|Vice President]].&lt;ref name=MTV/&gt; In February 2009, she told Fox News that abstinence is "not realistic at all," but that she would like it to become more accepted among people her age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive:A Visit With the Palins| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,494205,00.html | work=On the Record w/Greta|publisher=Fox News|format=Rush transcript from the February 16, 2009 episode of ''On the Record''|date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2010| quote=But I think abstinence is, like – like, the – I don't know how to put it – like, the main – everyone should be abstinent or whatever but it's not realistic at all.... Because it's more and more accepted now....[Y]ou should just wait 10 years and it'd just be so much easier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 18 in May 2009, Palin appeared on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show and ''[[Good Morning America]]'' in recognition of the National Day to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. She called for all teens to abstain from sex. Such observance was started by The National Campaign To Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Palin was not employed by the Campaign, nor was she a spokesperson for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Debrorah|last= Kotz| url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/on-women/2009/05/06/bristol-palin-poster-child-for-teen-pregnancy-prevention|title=Bristol Palin: Poster Child for Teen Pregnancy Prevention |work=US News &amp; World Report|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palin said that her abstinence quote of February had been "taken out of context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=7510385&amp;page=1|title=Teen Mom Bristol Palin: the New Face of Abstinence,Palin Promoting Abstinence in New Campaign, 'Regardless of What I Did Personally'|first=Sarah |last=Netter|first2=Imaeyen |last2=Ibanga|first3= Kaitlyn|last3= Folmer |publisher=ABC News|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in May 2009, Palin was named a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Ambassador for the [[Candie's Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.candiesfoundation.org/ |title=Candie's foundation |publisher=Candiesfoundation.org | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Gail Collins| first=Gail|last= Collins|title=Bristol Palin's New Gig |work=The New York Times|date=May 6, 2009 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/opinion/07collins.html|accessdate =August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a teen pregnancy prevention organization that is a division of the Candie's clothing brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=history page | publisher=[[Candie's Foundation]] | url=http://www.candiesfoundation.org/history.html | accessdate=2009-05-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326052755/http://www.candiesfoundation.org/history.html | archivedate=March 26, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her duties as a paid spokeswoman involved attending town hall meetings, talking about abstinence, public service announcements, and giving interviews on morning talk shows.

In May 2009, on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', Palin said, "Regardless of what I did personally, abstinence is the only 100% foolproof way you can prevent pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1896815,00.html |title=In Defense of Bristol Palin, Abstinence Spokeswoman|first=Nancy |last=Gibbs|date=May 8, 2009|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on ''Good Morning America'' in April 2010, she said that " 'Pause Before You Play' [a campaign of Candie's] hits a wider range of message, it can mean pause and go get a condom, it can be pause and think about your life, or it could be pause and wait until marriage."&lt;ref name="Good Morning America"&gt;{{cite web|title=GMA interview with Robin Roberts|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SDqS6cBXA|work=Good Morning America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her role as a spokesperson drew some public criticism. [[Bonnie Fuller]], former editor-in-chief of ''[[YM (magazine)|YM]]'', questioned whether the net effect of Palin's public speaking had glamorized rather than discouraged teen pregnancy, noting that the "picture perfect" imagery of a ''People'' magazine spread seemed to make her "the poster girl for teen momhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bonnie-fuller/bristol-palins-empeopleem_b_206244.html|first=Bonnie |last=Fuller|title=Bristol Palin's People Magazine Cover is a Total Promotion for Teen Pregnancy!|date=May 21, 2009|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, [[Meghan McCain]] stated her support for [[sex education]], criticizing Palin's sexual abstinence campaign, saying it was "not realistic for this generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/05/19/meghan-mccain-takes-aim-at-gop-bristol-palins-abstinence-tour/ | title=Meghan McCain takes aim at GOP, Bristol Palin's abstinence tour | last=Mooney|first=Alexander | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=May 19, 2009 | accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the media reported that Palin was paid more than $262,000 by Candie's Foundation for her work in 2009.&lt;ref name="candies"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ktiv.com/Global/story.asp?S=14387535| title=Bristol Palin earns $262K for teen pregnancy work| last=D'Oro| first=Rachel| date=April 5, 2011| publisher=Associated Press via KTIV-TV| accessdate=April 6, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408082045/http://www.ktiv.com/Global/story.asp?S=14387535| archivedate=April 8, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of compensation, which constituted 12 percent of the foundation's annual budget, was criticized by some commentators as excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/04/06/bristol-palins-big-teen-pregnancy-awareness-paycheck-raises-eyebrows.html |title=Bristol Palin's Outrageous Payday |last=Walshe |first=Shushannah |date=April 6, 2011 |publisher=The Daily Beast |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-06/gossip/29408536_1_candie-s-foundation-bristol-palin-teen-pregnancy |title=Bristol Palin faces backlash over her $262,000 paycheck for work on teen pregnancy awareness |last1=Everett |first1=Cristina |last2=Shahid |first2=Aliyah |date=April 6, 2011 |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 10, 2011, interview with [[Drew Pinsky]], Palin said she doesn't want to "be named as an abstinence preacher .... I'm not out there saying don't have sex. I hate that kind of stuff. Birth control needs to be used effectively each and every single time if you're gonna be having sex. ... I'm not advocating [abstinence] for everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Derrick|first=Lisa|title=Bristol Palin Tells Dr. Drew: "Don't Name Me an Abstinence Preacher"|url=http://lafiga.firedoglake.com/2011/07/21/dr-drew-bristol-palin-abstinence-preacher/|publisher=La Figa|accessdate=December 29, 2011|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2011, Palin had an interview with ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in which she reaffirmed her stance on abstinence. Discussing whether she still thought that abstinence was unrealistic, as she had said in 2009, she said "that quote was taken out of context. What I am trying to say is it's not realistic for everyone...but for me, my sisters, and my family, I believe that the right way." Palin still feels that abstinence is the only choice for her and her family.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Business venture===
In September 2009, Palin formed BSMP, a [[lobbying]], [[public relations]] and [[political consulting]] services firm.&lt;ref&gt;Original documentation from State of Alaska: [http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_y1obSLk0ax4/S0MTZdeC1uI/AAAAAAAAEck/QKjKboIhJjg/s1600-h/bristol+llc+2.jpg Articles of Organization LLC, page 1];   [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_y1obSLk0ax4/S0MUN1fFC6I/AAAAAAAAEcs/z8g6V8ke9ZI/s1600-h/bristol+llc+2.jpg page 1 continued];

===Paid speeches===
In May 2010 the media reported that Palin had signed with the company Single Source Speakers, asking between $15,000 and $30,000 for each appearance. She was listed on the company's website as available for conferences, fundraisers, special events and holidays, as well as women's, youth, abstinence, and pro-life programs.&lt;ref name="speakers circuit"&gt;{{cite news|first=Becky |last=Bohrer|title=Bristol Palin to Hit Speakers' Circuit: Bristol Palin hitting speakers' circuit, commanding $15,000 to $30,000 per appearance|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10672198|accessdate=August 2, 2010|publisher=ABC News|date=May 17, 2010|agency=Associated Press|location=Juneau, Alaska}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="speaker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Times Newsline staff|title=Sarah Palin's Daughter Bristol Becomes Speaker, To Earn US$30,000|url=http://www.timesnewsline.com/news/Sarah-Palins-Daughter-Bristol-Becomes-Speaker--To-Earn-US30-000-1274261608/|accessdate=August 2, 2010|newspaper=Times Newsline|date=May 19, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523112256/http://www.timesnewsline.com/news/Sarah-Palins-Daughter-Bristol-Becomes-Speaker--To-Earn-US30-000-1274261608/#|archive-date=May 23, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Palin was invited to speak by [[Washington University in St. Louis]] as the Keynote Speaker for 'Abstinence in College' at Sexual Responsibility Week. Students protested both the high fee she was to be paid out of student-generated funds and her lack of expertise on abstinence in college. Her appearance was cancelled.&lt;ref name="WashU"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_ce74697f-8e28-57b3-9af0-cc0cb4c76733.html| title=Furor at Washington U. nixes Bristol Palin appearance|last=Holland|first=Elizabethe|date=January 28, 2011|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/university-students-protest-plans-for-bristol-palin-appearance/70438/|title=University Students Protest Plans for Bristol Palin Appearance|last=Good|first=Chris|date=January 28, 2011|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===

====''Dancing with the Stars'', season 11====
Palin was a competitor on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 11)|fall 2010 season of ''Dancing with the Stars'']] (DWTS). She was partnered with professional [[Mark Ballas]], a two-time champion on the show who won with Olympic figure skater [[Kristi Yamaguchi]] in season 6, and with Olympic gymnast [[Shawn Johnson]] in season 8.&lt;ref name="dwtswomen"&gt;[http://thenewsoftoday.com/dwts-women-jennifer-grey-florence-henderson-britol-palin-brandy-and-more/1941/ "DWTS Women: Jennifer Grey, Florence Henderson, Bristol Palin, Brandy and More DWTS cast"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903183249/http://thenewsoftoday.com/dwts-women-jennifer-grey-florence-henderson-britol-palin-brandy-and-more/1941/# |date=September 3, 2010 }}, Brian Krassenstein, August 31, 2010, TheNewsofToday.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was televised from September through November 2010.

Despite getting the lowest scores from the judges for a number of weeks, Palin and Ballas avoided being eliminated during the season. That attracted media attention and speculation.&lt;ref name=Access&gt;{{cite news |title=Bristol Palin Loving Her Surprise 'Dancing' Success |agency=NBC Universal |newspaper=Access Hollywood |date=November 17, 2010 |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/bristol-palin-basking-in-her-dancing-with-the-stars-success_article_39905 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dancing success"/&gt; Questions were raised about the integrity of the public voting process&lt;ref name="dancing success"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-catlin/bristol-palins-success-co_b_782272.html "Bristol Palin's Dancing Success"], Roger Catlin, November 11, 2010, ''The Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; including allegations of fraudulent online voting using multiple e-mail addresses. Executives at ABC and the show's executive producer, [[Conrad Green]], stated that "checks and balances" in the system, including IP address verification, prevent such voting practices, and that "[t]here's nothing in the voting that looks dissimilar to previous seasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dancing with the Stars' voting system is secure against multiple votes fraud: ABC producer|author=Soraya Roberts |work=New York Daily News|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/11/18/2010-11-18_dancing_with_the_stars_voting_system_is_secure_against_multiple_votes_fraud_abc_.html?r=entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An uproar over Palin – Bristol, that is |author=Marie Elena Fernandez |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 18, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-1118-bristol-palin-20101118,0,3641255.story}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Green speculated that Palin may have received votes from her mother's fans and other supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-10/bristol-palin-remains-on-abc-s-dancing-as-fans-continue-to-muster-votes.html|title=Bristol Palin Survives `Dancing' Elimination Round With Help of Tea Party|first=Ronald|last=Grover|date=November 9, 2010| accessdate=2011-04-18|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from older viewers who had maternal feelings toward her due to her youth and lack of prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bristol Palin's 'DWTS' run fuels conspiracy theories |author=Gary Strauss |newspaper=USA Today |date=November 17, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-11-18-DWTS18_ST_N.htm|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palin credited her success to the support of her fans who were tuning in each week to see her improvement.&lt;ref name=Access/&gt;

Palin's success on the show attracted other negative attention, including death threats against her. In one instance, suspicious white powder was received by the show. The powder turned out to be harmless, but security on the show was tightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More security measures in place for dancing show after powder scare| url=http://www.9wsyr.com/entertainment/story/More-security-measures-in-place-for-dancing-show/g4g3E4CagEive6y2nfItlA.cspx|date=November 22, 2010|publisher=[[WSYR-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the final show of the season, Palin and Ballas finished in third place. Prior to that show, Palin said that winning "would be like a big middle finger out there to all the people out there who hate my mom and hate me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/11/bristol-palin-dancing-with-the-stars-middle-finger.html|title=Bristol Palin, 'the fighter,' takes third on 'Dancing With the Stars'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 24, 2010|first=Christie|last=D'Zurilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the competition, she remarked that she was happy with her third-place finish, that prayer and faith had helped her, and that she had grown as a person.&lt;ref name="dancing controversy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20445118,00.html|title=Bristol Palin: Prayer Helped Me Through Dancing Controversy|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=November 25, 2010|publisher=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Republican National Convention and pregnancy announcement===
When [[John McCain]] chose Sarah Palin to be his vice presidential [[running mate]] in late August 2008, his advisers had already been informed of her daughter Bristol's pregnancy, which they believed would be a political liability because the teen was unmarried.&lt;ref name="McCain camp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4837644.ece|title=McCain camp prays for Palin wedding: The marriage of the vice-presidential candidate's pregnant teenage daughter could lift a flagging campaign|first=Sarah |last=Baxter|date=September 28, 2008 |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, the opening day of the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], it was publicly announced that Palin was pregnant and engaged to [[Levi Johnston]], the father of her child.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; Palin's entire family, along with Johnston, appeared at the convention.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596899/20081013/story.jhtml|title=Sarah Palin's Future Son-In-Law Levi Johnston Denies He's Being Forced To Marry Bristol|author=Gil Kaufman|date=October 13, 2008|publisher=MTV|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090100710.html| title=No Surprises From Palin, McCain Team Says: Daughter's Pregnancy and Trooper Controversy Were Revealed Before Pick, According to Campaign Aide|author=Michael D.

==LGBT-related controversies==
Palin has been in the headlines on numerous occasions for making anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage comments which have often drawn intense criticism from defenders of LGBT rights:

In September 2011 she got into an argument in a bar with a man who criticized her mother; Palin accused him of being a homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gawker.com/5843298/bristol-palin-bar-fight-youre-a-homosexual-i-can-tell-you-are|title=Bristol Palin Bar Fight: &amp;#39;You&amp;#39;re a Homosexual, I Can Tell You Are&amp;#39;|last=O'Connor|first=Maureen|work=Gawker|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 she criticized Obama's decision to support gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/315409/bristol-palin-slammed-by-stars-over-anti-gay-marriage-remarks|title=Bristol Palin Slammed by Stars Over Anti-Gay-Marriage Remarks|work=E!

In December 2013 she spoke in defense of [[Duck Dynasty]] star Phil Robertson following his anti-gay comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/duck-dynasty-bristol-palin-blasts-hypocritical-gays/|title='Duck Dynasty' Flap: Bristol Palin Blasts 'Hypocritical' Gays|date=2013-12-23|work=TheWrap|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anchorage brawl==
A September 2014 Anchorage brawl was reported to have involved the Palin family, who were among an estimated 70 birthday-party attendees. Bristol Palin, described in the police report as "heavily intoxicated," was said to have struck the party host "at least six times."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/article/20140912/more-details-emerge-fight-witnesses-say-involved-palin-family Laurel Andrews, "More details emerge in fight that witnesses say involved Palin family"], ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]]'', 12 September 2014; Retrieved 26 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/article/20141021/police-photos-audio-released-scene-party-brawl-involving-palins Laurel Andrews, "Police photos audio released from scene of party brawl involving Palins"], ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]]'',  October 21, 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4250">'''Charles Benefiel''' (born 1967) is a contemporary [[United States|American]] [[outsider art]]ist  from [[California]]. As he has severe [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], almost all of his work is done via [[stippling]]. He currently lives in [[San Diego]], [[California]].

==Overview==

Born in [[Venice Beach]], California, Charles experienced a [[mental breakdown]] in 1997 and was urged by friends to go to a mental health center, where he was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His work has since been featured in various psychiatry and art magazines. His art is generally done on a large scale, some pieces being up to 5 x 8 feet in size; he does most of his work through a neurotic method of stippling, without any preliminary designs. After the stippling is complete, the works are soaked in tea and treated with chemicals to give an old look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Franklin, Deeanna|title=The Art of Charles Benefiel|publisher=Clinical Psychiatry News|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and method==

He renders his work through a process of stippling done with very precise [[rapidograph]] [[technical pen]]s; his pieces are done without any preliminary drawings, and with no lines to guide the composition. As Benefiel states, 'There was no need to stay in the lines, because there are no lines.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawvision.com/articles/charles-benefiel ''Raw Vision'', Bernard L Herman, Issue 30, 2000, pp.30-34]&lt;/ref&gt; In his representational drawings, Benefiel works from the center outward, and in his drawings of rows of numbers he stipples the characters from left to right as they would appear on a typed or printed page. As he draws, he counts the dots until a certain point, then repeats the sequence. Once the dots are complete, Benefiel tones the paper with tea, to add visual depth as well as a look of age. The idea of this method is to provide an exceptional degree of incremental control where possibilities for spontaneity and error are all but erased, to aesthetically resemble photographic grain, and to serve and complement his obsessive-compulsive disposition. He also produces pictures with figures reminiscent of a giant sized child's doll, often positioned in the centre of a piece and surround by numbers.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'' (ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, while living in New York City and New Mexico, Benefiel created the "Random Numeric Repeater" series of ink and watercolour on paper using what he described as a "dumb language", a random sequence of dots, circles, and dashes. Each symbol represents a corresponding numeral and sound that he made when creating the drawings.&lt;ref name=rnr7&gt;{{cite web|title=RANDOM NUMERIC REPEATER #7|url=http://www.folkartmuseum.org/?p=folk&amp;t=images&amp;id=4288|publisher=American Folk Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=od&gt;{{cite web|title=Obsessive Drawing|url=http://www.studio-international.co.uk/reports/obsessive_drawing.asp|publisher=Studio International|date=29 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Benefiel returned to his home state of California after residing in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] for five years. He know lives in San Diego where he is beginning to explore incorporating art back into his life.&lt;ref&gt;http://brutforce.com/accidental-magic/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christo Vladimirov Javacheff''' and '''Jeanne-Claude''' are a married couple who created environmental works of art. Christo and Jeanne-Claude were born on the same day, June 13, 1935; Christo in [[Gabrovo, Bulgaria]], and Jeanne-Claude in [[Morocco]]. They first met in [[Paris]] in October 1958 when Christo painted a portrait of Jeanne-Claude's mother. They then fell in love through creating art work together.

Their works include the wrapping of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] and the [[Pont-Neuf]] bridge in Paris, the {{convert|24|mi|km|adj=on}}-long artwork called ''[[Running Fence]]'' in [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]] and [[Marin County|Marin]] counties in [[California]], and ''[[The Gates]]'' in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]].

Credit was given to "Christo" only, until 1994, when the outdoor works and large indoor installations were retroactively credited to "Christo and Jeanne-Claude."&lt;ref name=JCNYTObit /&gt; They flew in separate planes: in case one crashed, the other could continue their work.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|author1=Miller, Stephen  |author2=Crow, Kelly|date=November 20, 2009|title=Part of a Creative Powerhouse Behind Ephemeral Artworks|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125868344992956721|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=Dow Jones|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeanne-Claude died, aged 74, on November 18, 2009, from complications of a [[brain aneurysm]].&lt;ref name=JCNYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeanne-Claude, Collaborator With Christo, Dies at 74|first=William|last=Grimes|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/arts/design/20jeanne-claude.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their work is visually impressive and often [[controversial]] as a result of its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate [[aesthetic]] impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar [[landscape]]s. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo's wrappings as a "revelation through concealment."&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, David: "Christo", Harry N. Abrams Publishers, Inc., New York City, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; To his critics Christo replies, "I am an artist, and I have to have courage&amp;nbsp;... Do you know that I don't have any artworks that exist?  They all go away when they're finished.  Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain."&lt;ref&gt;Living with Art, Mark Getlein&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Christo===
[[File:Christo by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|Christo. Photo by [[Erling Mandelmann]], ca. 1972-1987.]]
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}Christo ({{lang-bg|Христо Владимиров Явашев}}) was born in [[Gabrovo]], Bulgaria. His father, Vladimir Javacheff, was a businessman and ran a fabric factory, and his mother, Tsveta Dimitrova, was the secretary at the [[National Academy of Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Sofia]]. Professors from the Academy who visited his family observed Christo's artistic talent while he was still very young.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Christo studied art at the Sofia Academy from 1953 to 1956 and went to [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]), until 1957, when he left for the West by bribing a railway official and stowing away with several others on board a train transporting medicine and medical supplies to Austria.

Christo quickly settled in Vienna and enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. After only one semester there, he traveled to Geneva and moved to Paris in 1958. His life in Paris was characterized by financial hardship and social isolation, which was worsened by his difficulty learning French language. He earned money by painting portraits, which he likened to prostitution and signed with his family name "Javachef" while his early works were signed "Christo." In 1973, after 17 stateless years, Christo became a United States citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Randy Kennedy |title=Christo, Trump and the Art World’s Biggest Protest Yet |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=10&amp;pgtype=sectionfront|quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jeanne-Claude===
'''Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon''' came from an old French family.  She was born in [[Casablanca, Morocco]], where her father, an army officer, was stationed. Her mother, Précilda, was 17 when she married Jeanne-Claude's father, Major Léon Denat. Précilda and Léon Denat divorced shortly after Jeanne-Claude was born, and Précilda remarried three times. Jeanne-Claude earned a [[baccalauréat]] in Latin and philosophy in 1952 from the [[Tunis University|University of Tunis]].&lt;ref name=JCNYTObit/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Jeanne-Claude lived with her father's family while her mother fought in the [[French Resistance]]. In 1946, Précilda married the influential General [[Jacques de Guillebon]]. The family lived in [[Bern]]e from 1948 to 1951, then in [[Tunisia]] from 1952 to 1957, when they returned to Paris.

She was described as "extroverted" and with natural organizational abilities. Her hair was dyed red, a color she claimed was selected by her husband&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/arts/design/art-that-lets-you-walk-on-water.html|title=Next From Christo: Art That Lets You Walk on Water|first=Carol|last=Vogel|date=21 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she smoked cigarettes, and tried to quit many times until her weight would balloon. She did not enjoy cooking.&lt;ref name=Hoelterhoff&gt;{{cite news|author=Hoelterhoff, Manuela|date=November 20, 2009|title=Jeanne-Claude -- Christo’s Dynamic Muse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=agEeAUIHTR8o|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took responsibility for overseeing work crews and for raising funds.&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt; She said she became an artist out of love for Christo (if he'd been a dentist, she said she'd have become a dentist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=LXTV|date=July 26, 2007|title=The artists behind The Gates Christo and Jeanne-Claude|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bADfh_JLLo|website=YouTube|accessdate=2009-11-20|time=2:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeanne-Claude died in New York City on November 18, 2009, from complications due to a brain aneurysm. Her body was to be donated to science, one of her wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2009|title=Artist Jeanne-Claude dies aged 74|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8369993.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] described ''[[The Gates]]'' as “one of the most exciting public art projects ever put on anywhere in the world—and it would never have happened without Jeanne-Claude.”&lt;ref name=JCNYTObit/&gt; Jeanne-Claude said, "Our art has absolutely no purpose, except to be a work of art. We do not give messages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2009|title=Jeanne-Claude|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/6614804/Jeanne-Claude.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2009-11-20|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "Artists don't retire.

===Marriage===
[[File:The Gates from The Met 2007-02-18.jpg|thumb|''The Gates'' from The Met]]
Christo and Jeanne-Claude met in October 1958, when he was commissioned to paint a portrait of her mother, Précilda de Guillebon. Initially, Christo was attracted to Jeanne-Claude's half-sister, Joyce. Jeanne-Claude was engaged to Philippe Planchon. Shortly before her wedding, Jeanne-Claude became pregnant by Christo. Although she married Planchon, Jeanne-Claude left him immediately after their honeymoon. Christo and Jeanne-Claude's son, Cyril, was born 11 May 1960. Jeanne-Claude's parents were displeased with the relationship, particularly because of Christo's refugee status, and temporarily estranged themselves from their daughter.

In 1961, Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered barrels at the port of [[Cologne]], their first collaboration. In 1962, the couple tackled their first monumental project, ''Rideau de Fer'' (Iron Curtain). Without consent of authorities and as a statement against the [[Berlin Wall]], they blocked off Rue Visconti, a small street near the River [[Seine]], with oil barrels. Jeanne-Claude stalled approaching police, persuading them to allow the piece to stand for a few hours. Although he was simultaneously holding his first exhibition at a gallery, it was the Visconti project that made Christo and Jeanne-Claude known in Paris.

In February 1964, Christo and Jeanne-Claude arrived in New York City. After a brief return to Europe, they settled in the United States in September of that year. Although poor and lacking fluency in English, Christo displayed his work in several galleries, including the well-known [[Leo Castelli|Castelli Gallery]] in New York and Gallery Schmela in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany. Christo began to create storefronts, which he built to scale. Sale of the storefronts helped finance larger projects.

==Major works==
[[File:Pont Neuf emballé par Christo (1985).jpg|thumb|300px|Pont Neuf wrapped up]]
On all their projects since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer [[Wolfgang Volz]]. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by [[Albert and David Maysles]]. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals on all of their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately when we were young because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.’”&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Richard, and Susan Lewis. "Cengage Advantage Books: The Power of Art." Google 
Books. Cengage Learning, 23 Jan. 2008. Web. 04 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.

===Oil Barrels===
Jeanne-Claude was a firm believer in the aesthetic beauty of works of art; she said, “‘We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we believe it will be beautiful.’”&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2009"&gt;Grimes, William. "Jeanne-Claude, Christo’s Collaborator on Environmental Canvas, Is Dead 
at 74." ''The New York Times''. ''The New York Times'', 19 Nov. 2009. Web. 04 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that does not mean that Jeanne-Claude and Christo’s artworks were without larger political connotations. Jeanne-Claude and Christo created a piece in response to the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1962. They blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a wall of oil drums. The 4-meter-high wall built with oil barrels completely closed the street and blocked all communication between Rue Bonaparte and Rue de Seine. They said, "This 'iron curtain' can be used as a barricade during a period of public work in the street, or to transform the street into a dead end. Finally its principle can be extended to a whole area or an entire city."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|last=Baal-Teshuva|first=Jacob|publisher=Taschen|date=July 1, 2001|isbn=978-3822859964|location=|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the police approached, Jeanne-Claude firmly stood her ground and guarded the art piece, arguing for it to stay in place just for a few more hours.

===Documenta 4===
In 1968, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had the chance to participate at the [[Documenta]] 4 in [[Kassel]]. In addition to the sculpture, ''Corridor Storefronts,'' the couple wanted to build an air package with a volume of 5,600 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which would be lifted by cranes and visible from a distance of 25&amp;nbsp;km. On 24 June 1968 their first attempt to fully inflate the air package failed, as the polyethylene skin tore as it was being raised. After two more attempts and repeated repairs, and using two of the largest [[crane (machine)|cranes]] in [[Europe]], the project became a reality on 3 August 1968. The package rose to its maximum height of {{convert|280|ft|m}} tall for a total of 10 hours (from 4:00 am through 2:00 pm on 4 August), becoming the largest inflatable structure with no skeleton ever constructed.  Of the $70,000 (USD) cost of this project, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had financed all but $3,000 (USD) from the sale of preparatory drawings, collages, and a Store Front.

===''Wrapped Coast''===
At the end of 1969, Jeanne-Claude and Christo wrapped the coast of [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], in [[Sydney, Australia]], on invitation by Australian collector John Kaldor and as part of the Alcorso-Sekers Travelling Scholarship. With the support of John Kaldor, this became the first visit to Australia for international artists to make new work and the first in the series of Kaldor Public Art Projects.

100 workers and 11 volunteers devoted 17,000 work hours to the project. Christo wrapped two and a half kilometres of coast and cliffs up to 26 metres high. The project required 95,600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of synthetic fabric and 56&amp;nbsp;km of rope and was the largest single artwork ever made at this time. The artwork was larger than Mount Rushmore, and visitors took an hour to walk from one end of the work to the other. After initial resistance from the authorities and the public, reactions were largely positive, and had an enormous impact on [[art in Australia]].

===''Valley Curtain''===

I the foreground is a telephone pole and several people looking up.|''Valley Curtain'' 1972 (USA)]]
At the end of 1970, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began their preparations for the ''Valley Curtain'' project. A 400-meter-long cloth was to be stretched across Rifle Gap, a valley in the [[Rocky Mountains]] near [[Rifle, Colorado]]. The project required 14,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of cloth to be hung on four steel cables, fastened with iron bars fixed in concrete on each slope, and 200 tons of concrete.
The budget increased to $400,000, causing Christo and Jeanne-Claude additional problems with the financing. Finally enough works of art were sold to raise the money and, on 10 October 1971, the orange-coloured curtain was ready for hanging, but was torn to shreds by wind and rock. While a second curtain was being manufactured, Christo received a request from a [[Berlin]] art historian to wrap the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in response to the 1961 "Project for Wrapping a Public Building." On 10 August 1972, the second attempt to hang the cloth succeeded, but only 28 hours later it was destroyed by a storm gale in excess of 60 miles per hour.

The project was shown in the documentary film ''[[Christo's Valley Curtain]],'' by [[David and Albert Maysles]], which was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject|Best Documentary Short]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52141/Christo-s-Valley-Curtain/details |title=Christo's Valley Curtain |accessdate=2008-11-30|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Running Fence''===
{{Main|Running Fence}}
In 1972, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began preparations for ''[[Running Fence]]'': a fabric fence, supported by steel posts and steel cables, running through the landscape and leading into the sea. The fence was to be 5.5 meters high and 40 kilometers long and constructed in Sonoma and Marin Counties, California. For the project, 59 families of [[ranchers]] needed to be convinced and the permission of the authorities had to be obtained, so Christo and Jeanne-Claude hired nine lawyers. At the end of 1973, Christo and Jeanne-Claude marked the path of the fence with wooden stakes. On 29 April 1976, the work finally began after a long struggle against bureaucracy. Approximately 200,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of [[nylon]] fabric, 2050 steel posts and 145&amp;nbsp;km of steel cable were needed. On 10 September 1976 the work was completed. However, Christo and Jeanne-Claude had to pay a $60,000 fine, because they lacked permission for the coastal region. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===''Wrapped Walk Ways''===
In 1977, Christo and Jeanne-Claude were mostly paying bank loans and trying to save money. In addition, however, they continued to plan their future projects, like wrapping the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] and the [[Pont-Neuf]] in [[Paris]], as well as ''Wrapped Walk Ways'', a covering of footpaths in a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] park. In November, Christo met his parents, seeing his mother for the first time in 20 years.

With ''Wrapped Walk Ways'' Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered 4.5&amp;nbsp;km of footpaths in [[Loose Park]], a park in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Altogether it required 12,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of orange-yellow-coloured shiny nylon fabric. Pedestrians enjoyed the artwork for two weeks in October. The cost of this project amounted to $130,000.

===''Surrounded Islands''===
[[File:Agoncillo - Würth Rioja, Museo 30 - Christo.JPG|thumb|alt=Four cafe chairs and a table, a high table, and an upholstered chair are wrapped in fabric and rope.| Würth Rioja, wrapped chairs]]
Christo and Jeanne-Claude planned a project based on Jeanne-Claude's idea to surround eleven islands in Miami's [[Biscayne Bay]] with 603,850 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of pink [[polypropylene]] floating fabric. It was completed on May 7, 1983, with the aid of 430 workers and could be admired for two weeks.

On May 7, 1983, the installation of ''Surrounded Islands'' was completed. In [[Biscayne Bay]], between the municipalities of [[Miami]], [[Miami Shores, Florida|Miami Shores]], [[North Miami, Florida|North Miami]], [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]], [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]], [[Surfside, Florida|Surfside]] and [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], 11 of the islands situated in the area of [[Baker's Haulover Inlet]], [[Broad Causeway]], [[Florida State Road 934|79th Street Causeway]], [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]], and [[Venetian Causeway]] were surrounded with 603,850 square meters (6.5 million square feet) of pink woven [[polypropylene]] fabric covering the surface of the water, floating and extending out 61 meters (200&amp;nbsp;ft) from each island into the bay. The fabric was sewn into 79 patterns to follow the contours of the 11 islands.

For two weeks ''Surrounded Islands'', spreading over {{convert|11.3|km|mi|sp=us}}, was seen, approached, and enjoyed by the public, from the causeways, the land, the water, and the air. The luminous pink color of the shiny fabric was in harmony with the tropical vegetation of the uninhabited, verdant islands, the light of the Miami sky, and the colors of the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay.

Since April 1981, attorneys Joseph Z. Fleming and Joseph W. Landers, marine biologist Anitra Thorhaug, ornithologists Oscar Owre and Meri Cummings, mammal biologist Daniel Odell, marine engineer John Michel, four consulting engineers, and builder-contractor Ted Dougherty of A &amp; H Builders, Inc., had been working on the preparation of the Surrounded Islands. The marine and land crews picked up debris from the eleven islands, putting refuse in bags and carting it away after they had removed some forty tons of varied refuse: refrigerator doors, tires, kitchen sinks, mattresses, and an abandoned boat.

Permits were obtained from the following governmental agencies: The Governor of [[Florida]] and the Cabinet; the Dade County Commission; the [[Florida Department of Environmental Regulation]]; the City of Miami Commission; the City of North Miami; the Village of Miami Shores; the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]; and the Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management.

From November 1982 until April 1983, {{convert|6500000|sqft|m2}} of woven polypropylene fabric were sewn at the rented Hialeah factory, into 79 different patterns to follow the contours of the 11 islands. A flotation strip was sewn in each seam. At the [[Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport#History|Opa Locka Blimp Hangar]], the sewn sections were accordion-folded to ease their unfurling on the water.

The outer edge of the floating fabric was attached to a 30.5&amp;nbsp;centimeter (12&amp;nbsp;inch) diameter octagonal boom, in sections, of the same color as the fabric. The boom was connected to the radial anchor lines, which extended from the anchors at the island to the 610 specially made anchors, spaced at 15.3&amp;nbsp;meter (50&amp;nbsp;ft) intervals, 76&amp;nbsp;meters (250&amp;nbsp;ft) beyond the perimeter of each island, driven into the [[limestone]] at the bottom of the bay. [[Earth anchor]]s were driven into the land, near the foot of the trees, to secure the inland edge of the fabric, covering the surface of the beach and disappearing under the [[vegetation]].

The floating rafts of fabric and booms, varying from 3.7 to 6.7 meters (12 to 22 feet) in width and from 122 to 183 meters (400 to 600 feet) in length, were towed through the Bay to each island. There were 11 islands, but on two occasions two islands were surrounded together as one configuration.

As with Christo and Jeanne-Claude's previous art projects, ''Surrounded Islands'' was entirely financed by the artists through the sale by C.V.J. Corporation (Jeanne-Claude Christo-Javacheff, President) of the preparatory pastel and charcoal drawings, collages, lithographs, and early works.

On May 4, 1983, out of a total work force of 430, the unfurling crew began to blossom the pink fabric. ''Surrounded Islands'' was tended day and night by 120 monitors in inflatable boats.

''Surrounded Islands'' was a work of art which underlined the various elements and ways in which the people of Miami live, between land and water.

===Pont Neuf===

On 14 March 1984, Jeanne-Claude became a U.S. citizen; she held dual U.S. and [[French citizenship]]. In August, the couple received permission to wrap the [[Pont-Neuf]], (which had been completed in July 1607), after nine years of negotiations with the mayor of Paris, [[Jacques Chirac]], and preparations for the project began. For the wrapping of the oldest bridge in Paris, 40,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of sand-colored [[polyamide]] fabric was needed. The golden sandstone color is used to imitate the color of pavements in Paris under sunset. The wrapping began on 25 August 1985 and was completed on 22 September. On the 5th of October, the project was removed after being viewed by over three million visitors. All the expenses for ''The Pont Neuf Wrapped'' were borne by the couple themselves. Just as in all other projects, they do not take sponsorship. They usually utilize the money they make just selling the preliminary drawings of the project. 
Wrapping the Pont Neuf continued the tradition of transforming a sculptural dimension into a work of art. The fabric maintained the principal shapes of the ''Pont Neuf'' but it emphasized the details and the proportions.

=== ''The Umbrellas'', Japan–USA, 1984–1991 {{anchor|The Umbrellas}} ===
[[File:ChristoUmbrellas.jpg|left|100px|alt=Two fabric sample squares, blue on the bottom and yellow slightly overlapping it]]
[[File:Umbrella Project1991 10 27.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large field with oversized blue umbrellas at regular intervals. Mountains are barely visible in the background as fog descends.|''Umbrellas'' 1991(Japan)]]
Christo and Jeanne-Claude prepared for their next project, ''The Umbrellas''. The plan was to have yellow umbrellas set up in [[California]] and blue umbrellas in [[Japan]] at the same time. In December 1990, after much preparation, the first steel bases for the umbrellas were installed. At the bases 80&amp;nbsp;cm long anchors were fastened to the ground to withstand tensions of 1,500 [[kilogram-force|kgf]] (15 [[kilonewton|kN]]). In September 1991 the umbrellas were brought to their places by 2,000 workers. In California, some of the bases were transported to the site by helicopter. The final cost of the project totaled $26 US million, and it was completely financed by the artists themselves through sale of preparatory drawings etc; the artists do not take any form of sponsorship.

By September 7, 1,340 blue umbrellas in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] and 1,760 yellow umbrellas at the [[Tejon Ranch]] in southern California had been set up; the exhibition opened on 9 October 1991. The umbrellas were positioned closely together in the limited space of Japan, whereas in California they were placed in all directions in its vast uncultivated land. In total, three million people saw the umbrellas, each measuring 6 meters in height and 8.66 meters in diameter. On October 27, they started the removal of this project and restored the land to earlier condition. The umbrellas were taken apart and most of the elements were recycled. The umbrellas became a huge tourist attraction, finding use as everything from picnic spots to wedding altars.

On 26 October 1991, one of the umbrellas in California was toppled by high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The exhibit was ordered closed immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 28, 1991|title=Christo Umbrella Crushes Woman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/28/us/christo-umbrella-crushes-woman.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second death occurred during the removal of the umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 1, 1991|title=2d Person Is Killed In Christo Art Project|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/arts/2d-person-is-killed-in-christo-art-project.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrapped Reichstag===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reichstag building]] --&gt;
After the project ''The Umbrellas,'' Christo and Jeanne-Claude concerned themselves again with wrapping the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]]. With the support of the President of the Parliament, [[Rita Süssmuth]], Christo and Jeanne-Claude worked to convince the elected Members of Parliament, going from office to office, writing explanatory letters to each of the 662 delegates and innumerable telephone calls and negotiations. On 25 February 1995, after a 70-minute debate at the Parliament and a Roll Call vote, the [[Bundestag]] allowed the project to go ahead.

Just under 100,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of fireproof [[polypropylene]] fabric, covered by an [[aluminum]] layer, and 15&amp;nbsp;km of [[rope]] were needed. The wrapping began on 17 June 1995 and was finished on 24 June. The spectacle was seen by five million visitors before the unveiling began on 7 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/christo/reichstag.shtm|title=Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Wrapped Reichstag|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2011-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023172557/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/christo/reichstag.shtm|archivedate=2011-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Verhüllte Bäume (Wrapped Trees)''===
After 32 years of planning and preparation work, between 13 November and 14 December 1998, Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped 178 trees in the [[Beyeler Foundation]]'s "Berower Park" in the north-eastern part of [[Basel]], alongside the road and tram line from the German frontier at [[Riehen]] ([[Lörrach]]).

To wrap the trees, the couple used 55,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of silver-grey shiny polyester fabric and 23&amp;nbsp;km of rope. A pattern had to be made for each individual tree  so that the natural shape of the branches pushed the fabric outwards, creating individual shapes in the sky. The trees varied in height from 2 to 25 meters and in width from 1 to nearly 15 meters. As with their other projects, this was financed by the sale of original works. On view for three weeks, ''Wrapped Trees'' was extremely dynamic: varying silhouettes of trees moved in the wind with the skeletal framework of branches made visible when the translucent material was backlit by the winter sun. All materials used were recycled when it was taken down.

===Wrapped Snoopy House===
In 1978, [[Charles M. Schulz]] drew an episode of his comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]'' in which [[Snoopy]]'s doghouse is wrapped in fabric by Christo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peanuts|url=http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1978/11/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Christo constructed a wrapped doghouse and presented it to the [[Charles M. Schulz Museum]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schulzmuseum.org/exhibits/permanent/Christo/christo.html |title=Christo's ''Wrapped Snoopy House'' |website=Charles M.

===''The Gates''===
{{Main|The Gates}}
[[File:Gates f.jpg|thumb|right|''The Gates'']]
On 3 January 2005, work began on the installation of the couple's most protracted project, ''[[The Gates]],'' in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. The title is ''The Gates,'' ''Central Park, New York, 1979–2005'' in reference to the time that passed from their initial proposal until they were able to go ahead with it: only with the permission of the new mayor of New York, [[Michael R. Bloomberg]], were they able to proceed. After the project was completed, Bloomberg released the following statement about ''The Gates'', “Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, [...] praised The Gates as ‘one of the most exciting public art projects ever put on anywhere in the world — and it would never have happened without Jeanne-Claude.’”&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2009"/&gt;

''The Gates'' was open to the public from 12 to 27 February 2005. A total of 7,503 gates made of saffron color fabric were placed on paths in Central Park. They were five meters high and had a combined length of 37&amp;nbsp;km. Bloomberg, a fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, presented them with the "Doris C. Freedman Award for Public Art" for the work of art.&lt;ref name="ARTINFO"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=2005: Art World Year-in-Review | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= December 25, 2005| url= http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/9347/2005-art-world-year-in-review/| accessdate=2008-04-17 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christo and Jeanne-Claude often expressed satisfaction that their concept for their home town of over 30 years was finally realized.

The cost of the project was US$21 million, which was raised entirely by Christo and Jeanne-Claude selling studies, drawings, [[collage]]s, an works from the 1950s and 1960s. They did not accept any sponsorship, nor did the city of New York have to provide any money for the project. Christo and Jeanne-Claude donated all the money raised from the sale of souvenirs such as postcards, T-shirts and posters to "Nurture New York's Nature, Inc." While the engineering, manufacturing and set-up took over a year, about 750 paid employees erected the project in five days and then deployed the fabric of all the gates in half an hour. Around 600 more "gate-keepers" distributed one million free fabric samples  to visitors. The uniformed gate-keepers provided information to visitors about the project, and were responsible for unrolling the gates that had rolled over their crossbars in the high wind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} More workers uninstalled the project in one week, leaving almost no trace, and shipping all the materials for recycling.

===''Big Air Package''===
Christo filled the [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] from 16 March until 30 December 2013 with the installation ''Big Air Package''. After ''The Wall'' (1999) as the finale installation of the Emscher Park International Building Exhibition, ''Big Air Package'' was his second work of art in the Gasometer. The “''Big Air Package'' – Project for Gasometer Oberhausen, Germany“ was conceived by Christo in 2010 (for the first time without his wife Jeanne-Claude).
The sculpture was set up in the interior of the industrial monument and was made of 20,350 square metres of translucent fabric and 4,500 metres of rope. In the inflated state, the envelope, with a weight of 5.3 tons, reached a height of more than 90 metres, a diameter of 50 metres and a volume of 177,000 cubic metres. The monumental work of art was, temporarily, the largest self-supporting sculpture in the world. In the accessible interior of ''Big Air Package'', the artist generated a unique experience of space, proportions and light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/projects/big-air-package?view=info#.USTM7vLgT2s|title=Projects - Big Air Package|first=|last=NoFavorite|website=www.christojeanneclaude.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iseo Floating Piers 9.jpg|thumb|right|''The Floating Piers'']]

===''The Floating Piers''===
{{Main|The Floating Piers}}
''The Floating Piers'' were a series of walkways installed at [[Lake Iseo]] near [[Brescia]], Italy. From June 18 to July 3, 2016, visitors were able to walk just above the surface of the water from the village of [[Sulzano]] on the mainland to the islands of [[Monte Isola]] and San Paolo. The floating walkways were made of around 200,000 polyethylene cubes covered with {{convert|70000|m2|sqft}} of bright yellow fabric: {{convert|3|km|mi}} of piers moved on the water; another {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} of golden fabric continued along the pedestrian streets in Sulzano and Peschiera Maraglio. After the exhibition, all components were to be removed and recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-floating-piers?view=info#.VcIfuFMw_IU |title=Christo: The Floating Piers, Project for Lake Iseo, Italy |website=christojeanneclaude.net |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation was facilitated by the [[Beretta]] family, owners of the primary side arm supplier of the American Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/video-articoli/2016/04/05/signora-beretta-l-isola-famiglia-nell-opera-christo-15-milioni-euro/be22f6d4-fb5c-11e5-be4b-a5166aa85502.shtml?intcmp=video_wall_hp |title=Esplora il significato del termine: La signora Beretta e l’isola di famiglia nell’opera di Christo da 15 milioni di euroLa signora Beretta e l’isola di famiglia nell’opera di Christo da 15 milioni di euro |website=corriere.it |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beretta family owns the island of San Paolo, which was surrounded by ''Floating Piers'' walkways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mesco|first1=Manuela|title=Christo Walks on Water With New Italian Installation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/christo-walks-on-water-with-new-italian-installation-1466183630|accessdate=19 July 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Mastaba''===

''The Mastaba'' was a temporary floating installation exhibited from June to September 2018 on [[The Serpentine]] in [[London]]. The installation consists of 7,506 oil barrels, in the shape of a [[mastaba]], a form of [[ancient Egyptian tomb]] with a flat roof and inward sloping sides. It sits on a floating platform of [[high-density polyethylene]], held in place by 32 anchors. It is {{convert|20|m}} in height and weighs {{convert|600|tonne}}. The vertical ends have been painted in a mosaic of red, blue and mauve, whilst the sloping sides are in red with bands of white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Block |first1=India |title=Christo unveils floating Serpentine sculpture made from 7,506 barrels |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/06/18/cristo-unveils-the-london-mastaba-floating-on-serpentine-lake/ |accessdate=18 June 2018 |work=De Zeen |date=18 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618203402/https://www.dezeen.com/2018/06/18/cristo-unveils-the-london-mastaba-floating-on-serpentine-lake/ |archivedate=18 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously with the display of ''The Mastaba'', the nearby [[Serpentine Gallery]] is presenting an exhibition of the artists' work, entitled ''Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Barrels and The Mastaba 1958–2018''. The exhibition comprises sculptures, drawings, collages, scale-models and photographs from the last 60 years of the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/christo-and-jeanne-claude-barrels-and-mastaba-1958%E2%80%932018 |title=Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Barrels and ''The Mastaba 1958–2018'' |publisher=Serpentine Gallery |accessdate=22 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622180110/http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/christo-and-jeanne-claude-barrels-and-mastaba-1958%E2%80%932018 |archivedate=22 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future works==

===''Over The River''===
Christo and Jeanne-Claude announced plans &lt;!-- when?? --&gt; for a future project, titled ''Over The River'', to be constructed on the [[Arkansas River]] between [[Salida, Colorado]] and [[Cañon City, Colorado]] on the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains.  This scenic area is known as Bighorn Sheep Canyon, and is west of the well-known [[Royal Gorge]]. Plans for the project call for horizontally suspending {{convert|6.7|mi|km}} of reflective, translucent fabric panels high above the water, on steel cables anchored into the river's banks. Project plans call for its installation for two weeks during the summer of 2015, at the earliest, and for the river to remain open to recreation during the installation.

Reaction among area residents has been intense with supporters hoping for a tourist boom and opponents fearing that the project would ruin the visual appeal of the landscape and inflict damage on the river ecosystem.  One local rafting guide compared the project to "hanging pornography in a church."  The Bureau of Land Management released a Record of Decision approving the project on November 7, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_15854874 | work=Denver Post | first=Jason | last=Blevins | title=Local viewpoints wide apart on Christo's plan to drape fabric over Arkansas River | date=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575480071045889864|title = Christo vs. Colorado|work=Wall Street Journal September 10, 2010 | first=Kelly | last=Crow | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/fo/rgfo/planning/otr/otr_record_of_decision.html|title=BLM Over The River Record of Decision|work=Bureau of Land Management|date=November 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201072559/http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/fo/rgfo/planning/otr/otr_record_of_decision.html|archivedate=February 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the project cannot begin, however, until the Bureau of Land Management issues a Notice to Proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News and Events| url=http://www.roarcolorado.org/newsevents.html | work=Rags Over the Arkansas River (ROAR) | date=November 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111233556/http://www.roarcolorado.org/newsevents.html|archivedate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit against the [[Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife]] was filed on July 22, 2011, by Rags Over the Arkansas River (ROAR), a local group opposed to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_18555758|title = Foes of Christo's plan to cover Arkansas River with fabric sue state park board |work=Denver Post | date=July 27, 2011 | first=Jason |last=Blevins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit is still awaiting a court date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themountainmail.com/news/article_3b750078-049a-11e1-8ade-001a4bcf6878.html | title=OTR lawsuit awaits court date | work=The Mountain Mail | first=Kastner | last=Ericka | date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christo and Jeanne-Claude's inspiration for ''Over the River'' came in 1985 as they were wrapping the Pont-Neuf and a fabric panel was being elevated over the [[Seine]]. The artists began a three-year search for appropriate locations in 1992, considering some eighty-nine river locations. They chose the Arkansas River because its banks were high enough that recreational rafters could enjoy the river at the same time.&lt;ref name="natgeo112006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Newman |last=Cathy |title=Christo and Jeanne-Claude Unwrapped |work=National Geographic|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christo and Jeanne-Claude have already spent more than $6 million on environmental studies, design engineering, and wind-tunnel testing of fabrics. As with past projects, ''Over The River'' would be financed entirely by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, through the sale of Christo’s preparatory drawings, collages, scale models, and early works of the 1950s/1960s.  On July 16, 2010, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management released its four-volume Draft Environmental Impact Statement, which reported many potentially serious types of adverse impact but also many proposed "mitigation" options.&lt;ref name="NYTimes100717"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/us/17artist.html|title=Bureaucracy Meets Art, Delighting Christo |work=The New York Times July 17, 2010 | first=Kirk | last=Johnson | date=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, after the [[election of President Trump]], Christo cancelled the controversial project in protest of the new administration.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html Christo, Trump and the Art World’s Biggest Protest Yet] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 2017/01/25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;COREY H.

===''Mastaba'' (Al Gharbia)===

'''Collateral damage''' is the deaths, injuries, or other damage inflicted on an unintended target. In American [[military terminology]], it is used for the incidental killing or wounding of [[non-combatant]]s or damage to non-combatant property during an attack on a [[legitimate military target]].&lt;ref name=USAF /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collateral%20damage |title=collateral damage |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In US military terminology, the unintentional destruction of allied or neutral targets is called [[friendly fire]].

Critics of the term see it as a [[euphemism]] that [[dehumanization|dehumanizes]] non-combatants killed or injured during [[combat]], used to reduce the perception of [[culpability]] of military leadership in failing to prevent non-combatant [[casualties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Political Psychology of Collateral Damage|url=http://security.pr.erau.edu/read.php?kind=html&amp;article_volume=14&amp;article_issue=10&amp;article_title=%5BB%5DThe%20Political%20Psychology%20of%20Collateral%20Damage%5B%2FB%5D|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105605/http://security.pr.erau.edu/read.php?kind=html&amp;article_volume=14&amp;article_issue=10&amp;article_title=%5BB%5DThe%20Political%20Psychology%20of%20Collateral%20Damage%5B%2FB%5D|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsthoorn2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Olsthoorn|title=Military Ethics and Virtues: An Interdisciplinary Approach for the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jzZZBwAAQBAJ|date=21 September 2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-89429-9|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shabo2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Magedah Shabo|title=Techniques of Propaganda and Persuasion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDIbJUAZeuwC|year=2008|publisher=Prestwick House Inc|isbn=978-1-58049-874-6|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/21/cleansing-stock-doublespeak-people-killing|title='Cleansing the stock' and other ways governments talk about human beings|author=[[George Monbiot]]|date=22 Oct 2014|work=[[Comment is Free]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "collateral" comes from [[medieval Latin]] ''collateralis'', from ''col-'', "together with" + ''lateralis'' (from ''latus'', ''later-'', "side" ) and is otherwise mainly used as a synonym for "parallel" or "additional" in certain expressions ("collateral veins" run parallel to each other and "collateral security" means additional security to the main obligation in a contract). The first known usage of the term "collateral damage" in this context occurred in a May 1961 article written by T. C. Schelling entitled "DISPERSAL, DETERRENCE, AND DAMAGE".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/7689016/dispersal-deterrence-damage |title=Dispersal, Deterrence, And Damage - Tags: Bombers (Airplanes) War |publisher=Connection.ebscohost.com |date= |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[United States Air Force|USAF]] Intelligence Targeting Guide'' defines the term as the "unintentional damage or incidental damage affecting facilities, equipment, or personnel, occurring as a result of military actions directed against targeted enemy forces or facilities. Such damage can occur to friendly, neutral, and even enemy forces".&lt;ref name=USAF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/usaf/afpam14-210/part20.htm#page180 |title=USAF Intelligence Targeting Guide&amp;nbsp;— AIR FORCE PAMPHLET 14- 210 Intelligence |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=1 February 1998 |page= 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[United States Department of Defense]] document uses "[u]nintentional or incidental injury or damage to persons or objects that would not be lawful military targets in the circumstances ruling at the time. Such damage is not unlawful so long as it is not excessive in light of the overall military advantage anticipated from the attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|title=Joint Doctrine  Library|author=|date=|website=www.dtic.mil|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intent is the key element in understanding the military definition as it relates to target selection and prosecution. Collateral damage is damage aside from that which was intended. Since the dawn of [[precision guided munitions]], military "targeteers" and operations personnel are often alleged to have gone to great lengths to minimize collateral damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=29337 |title=Defense.gov News Article: U.S. Military Works to Avoid Civilian Deaths, Collateral Damage |publisher=Defenselink.mil |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-military uses of the phrase==
The term 'collateral damage' has also been borrowed by the [[computer|computing community]] to refer to the [[denial of service]] to legitimate users when administrators take blanket preventative measures against some individuals who are abusing systems. For example, [[DNSBL|Realtime Blackhole Lists]] used to combat [[email spam]] generally block ranges of [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) addresses rather than individual IPs associated with spam, and can deny legitimate users within those ranges the ability to send email to some domains.

The related term ''collateral mortality'' is also becoming prevalent, and probably derives from the term collateral damage. It has been applied to other spheres in addition to the original military context. An example is in fisheries where [[bycatch]] of species such as dolphins are called collateral mortality; i.e., they are species that die in pursuit of the legal death of fishery targets, such as [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;Chuenpagdee, R., Morgan, L.E., Maxwell, S.M., Norse, E.A. &amp; Pauly, D. (2003) Shifting gears: assessing collateral impacts of fishing methods in US waters. ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment'', 1, 517-524.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] states the term is used in regards to unintentional or incidental damage to non-combatant casualties and non-combatant property,&lt;ref name="USAF" /&gt; however, at least one source claims that the term "collateral damage" originated as a [[euphemism]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and can refer to [[friendly fire]], or the intentional killing of non-combatants and the destruction of their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Iraq War: Strategy, Tactics, and Military Lessons |author=Anthony H. Cordesman |year=2003 |publisher=Praeger/Greenwood |page=266 |isbn=978-0-275-98227-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dZuE9lJXkOQC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=%22Collateral+damage%22+definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 1941, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] led a sneak [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], killing almost 2,500 people and causing the American entry into [[World War II]]. The U.S. and Japan were not officially at war when the attack happened and thus it could be seen as a deliberate attack on non-combatants. However, the primary objective of the sneak attack were the battleships, aircraft, and oil facilities, not the [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[military personnel]] and [[civilian]]s, but some argued that the people themselves were also deliberate targets. During World War II, widespread [[civilian casualties]] and damage to civilian property were caused by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of enemy cities]]. If the intent of the strategic bombing was to destroy the enemy's war industry, then civilian casualties were called collateral damage. Given the low accuracy of bombing technology in World War II, it was inevitable that civilian casualties would occur. However, the Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] strategy of creating [[firestorm]]s in cities such as [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg]] or [[Bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/books/review/the-bombers-and-the-bombed-by-richard-overy.html|title='The Bombers and the Bombed,' by Richard Overy|first=Ben|last=Macintyre |date=21 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the indiscriminate attacks by the Germans on Allied cities with [[V-weapons]] fall outside the definition of collateral damage as these raids were meant to or suspected of intentionally terrorizing and killing enemy civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How the Weak Win Wars: A Theory of Asymmetric Conflict |pages=30–35|author=Ivan Arreguín-Toft |date=19 December 2005 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-54869-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How the Weak Win Wars: A Theory of Asymmetric Conflict |pages=41–42 |author=Ivan Arreguín-Toft |date=19 December 2005 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-54869-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategic Terror: The Politics and Ethics of Aerial Bombardment |pages=165–166 |author=Beau Grosscup |date=22 August 2006 |publisher=[[Zed Books]] |isbn=978-1-84277-543-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the [[1991 Gulf War]], [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition forces]] used the phrase 'collateral damage' to describe the killing of civilians in attacks on legitimate targets. According to Scottish  [[linguist]] [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]],&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cameron (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1XYsOwXSVFwC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=%22Deborah+CAMERON%22+%22To+put+the+point+in+its+most+basic+terms,+if+%27collateral+damage%27+is+a+euphemism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WBlvosZ-2_&amp;sig=pRnJdbSIUvdALAVAVf8wBsU35yo&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=31xnT8ajMaeZ2QXPpumzCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Verbal Hygiene''. 2 – Restrictive practices. The politics of style. "Collateral damage" and the politics of discourse]. [[Routledge]], p.72. {{ISBN|041510355X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "the classic [[Orwellian]] argument for finding this usage objectionable would be that
* it is jargon, and to the extent that people cannot decode it, it conceals what is actually going on;
* it is a [[euphemism]]; abstract, agentless and affectless, so that even if people succeed in associating it with a real act or event they will be insulated from any feeling of repulsion and moral outrage".

In 1999, "collateral damage" ({{lang-de|Kollateralschaden}}) was named the [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by a jury of linguistic scholars. With this choice, it was criticized that the term had been used by [[NATO]] forces to describe civilian casualties during the [[Kosovo War]], which the jury considered to be an inhuman euphemism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l32/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |work=[[Der Spiegel]]|title=Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[WikiLeaks]] released a video of a 2007 airstrike in Baghdad, they titled it ''[[Collateral Murder]]''. The [[ Dahyan air strike ]] was carried out in 2018, many children have died.

==International humanitarian law==
[[Military necessity]], along with [[distinction (law)|distinction]], and [[proportionality (international humanitarian law)|proportionality]], are three important principles of [[international humanitarian law]] governing the [[laws of war|legal use of force]] in an [[armed conflict]] and how that relates to collateral damage.

[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court|Chief Prosecutor]] at the [[International Criminal Court]], investigated allegations of [[war crime]]s during the [[the International Criminal Court and the 2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]] and he published an open letter containing his findings. A section titled "Allegations concerning War Crimes" elucidates this use of ''Military necessity'', ''distinction'' and ''proportionality'':
{{quotation|Under international humanitarian law and the [[Rome Statute]], the death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives,&lt;ref name="military objective"&gt;Article 52 of ''Additional [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]] provides a widely accepted definition of military objective: "In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage" (Source:  [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] [[#References|References]] page 5, footnote 11).&lt;/ref&gt; even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv).

Article 8(2)(b)(iv) criminalizes:&lt;br /&gt;
Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated;&lt;br /&gt;
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) draws on the principles in Article 51(5)(b) of the 1977 Additional [[Protocol I]] to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], but restricts the criminal prohibition to cases that are "''clearly''" excessive. The application of Article 8(2)(b)(iv) requires, ''[[inter alia]]'', an assessment of:&lt;br /&gt;
(a) the anticipated civilian damage or injury;&lt;br /&gt;
(b) the anticipated military advantage;&lt;br /&gt;
(c) and whether (a) was "clearly excessive" in relation to (b).|[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] [http://www2.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/F596D08D-D810-43A2-99BB-B899B9C5BCD2/277422/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf OTP letter to senders re Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327061739/http://www2.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/F596D08D-D810-43A2-99BB-B899B9C5BCD2/277422/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }} 9 February 2006.

==U.S. military approach==

The U.S. military follows a technology-based process for estimating and mitigating collateral damage. The software used is known as "FAST-CD" or "Fast Assessment Strike Tool—Collateral Damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=Graham|title=Military Turns to Software to Cut Civilian Casualties|newspaper=Washington Post|date=21 February 2003|page=A18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danny Roberts''' (born July 19, 1977; [[Rockmart, Georgia]]) is best known for appearing on ''[[The Real World: New Orleans]]'' in 2000.

==Career==
Roberts graduated from [[Rockmart High School]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;  Roberts studied foreign language education while attending the [[University of Georgia]],&lt;ref name="Camacho2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krebbs2004"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebbs|first1=Emily|title=Cast member of MTV's Real World advocates gay rights|url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/cast-member-of-mtv-s-real-world-advocates-gay-rights/article_d9038788-a3b6-5158-a105-ae4bb2e1c2b9.html|accessdate=26 July 2017|work=Collegiate Times|date=March 31, 2004|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he graduated from in 1999.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;

===''Real World''===
Prior to beginning the show, he had recently begun a relationship with Paul Dill, a [[US Army]] [[captain (army)|captain]]  stationed in [[Vicenza, Italy]]. Because of the U.S. Military "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy toward homosexuals, Paul's face was obscured on TV and much national attention was brought to the issue.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;{{citation |title=American Television, Reality Shows |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/am_tv_reality,2.html |last=Tipton |first=Nathan G. |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114205307/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/am_tv_reality%2C2.html |archivedate=2007-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2004, [[MTV]] aired a special where Paul (then out of the military) revealed his face for the first time and the policy and its effects were discussed.  In November 2006, Roberts announced in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' magazine that he and Dill had split up.&lt;ref name="Towle2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Towle|first1=Andy|title=Real World's Danny Roberts and Military Boyfriend Split - Towleroad|url=https://www.towleroad.com/2006/11/in_the_latest_i/|accessdate=26 July 2017|work=[[Towleroad]]|date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2006/11/real_worlds_danny_roberts_sing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706172214/http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2006/11/real_worlds_danny_roberts_sing.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post ''Real World''===
Roberts made a few post-''Real World'' appearances on television such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', Netflix's ''DTLA'', and hosted the DVD collection of gay-themed short films, ''Boy's Briefs''.&lt;ref name="Kramer2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Gary M.|title=Independent Queer Cinema: Reviews and Interviews|date=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781560233435|pages=110–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tiw7ET-wCWwC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110|accessdate=26 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts spoke at schools across the country on diversity in sexuality, coming out, public policy, and the military's "Don't ask, Don't tell" policy for several years after his first TV appearance in addition to other LGBTQ advocacy work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2009/4/gayrealitytvstars?page=0%2C1 Top 15 Gay REality Stars] After Elton, April 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending 10 years in New York and Seattle, Roberts returned to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where he worked in human resource recruiting for an email software company called [[MailChimp]],&lt;ref name="Pombo2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pombo|first1=James|title=Where Are The LGBT "Real World" Housemates Now?|url=http://www.newnownext.com/the-real-world-gay-lgbt-housemates/03/2016/|accessdate=26 July 2017|work=LOGO News|date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked from 2014 until 2017.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;  He previously worked as a recruiter for [[Redfin]], a residential real estate company.&lt;ref name="Camacho2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camacho|first1=Christin|title=The Real World: New Orleans' Danny Roberts: Where Is He Now?

==Personal life==
On May 23, 2013, Danny married Wes Pereria in [[Seattle, Washington]].  Together, they are the parents of an adopted daughter, Naiya Sage.&lt;ref name="Ryan2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Adrian|title=Two Men and a Little Lady|url=http://jetspacemagazine.com/two-men-and-a-little-lady/|accessdate=26 July 2017|work=Jetspace Magazine|date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Roberts revealed in an interview with [[Entertainment Weekly]] that he was [[HIV]] positive since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldblatt|first1=Henry|title=Real World star Danny Roberts opens up about living with HIV and the costar he turned to for support|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/real-world-star-danny-roberts-opens-up-about-living-with-hiv-and-the-costar-he-turned-to-for-support/ar-BBPVbdK?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=mailsignout|accessdate=21 November 2018|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its population is concentrated mainly in urban areas and is expected to exceed 28 million by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia's population to hit 28 million by 2031: report|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/7231093.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603044339/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/7231093.html|archivedate=3 June 2012|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=14 December 2010|author=Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's population has grown from an estimated population of between 300,000 and 1,000,000 at the time of British settlement in 1788 due to [[Immigration to Australia|numerous waves of immigration]] during the period since. Also due to immigration from other continents, the European component's share of the population is declining as a percentage.

Australia has an average [[population density]] of {{#expr:{{Data Australia|poptoday}} / 7682300 round 1}} persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated countries in the world]]. This is generally attributed to the [[semi-arid]] and [[Desert climate|desert]] [[Geography of Australia|geography]] of much of the interior of the country. Another factor is urbanisation, with 89% of its population living in a handful of urban areas, Australia is one of the world's [[Urbanization by country|most urbanised]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data – Australia|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/australia|work=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=24 April 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy of Australia in 1999–2001 was 79.7 years, [[List of countries by life expectancy|among the highest in the world]].

It is estimated that around 70% of the population is of European ancestry and descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~60&lt;/ref&gt; Australia generally doesn't collect data on race and ethnicity, with the exception of [[Australian Aboriginals]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].

==Indigenous population==
[[File:Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Australia by SLA - BCP field 0054 Indigenous Persons Total Persons.svg|thumb|right|Indigenous Australians as a percentage of the population as of the {{CensusAU|2011}}]]
{{Main|Indigenous Australians}}
The earliest accepted timeline for the first arrivals of [[indigenous Australians]] to the continent of Australia places this [[human migration]] to at least 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="University of Wollongong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.uow.edu.au/news/2004/0917a/index.html|title=When did Australia's earliest inhabitants arrive?|publisher=[[University of Wollongong]]|date=17 September 2004|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These first inhabitants of Australia were originally [[hunter-gatherer]]s, who over the course of many succeeding generations diversified widely throughout the continent and its nearby islands. Although their technical culture remained static—depending on wood, bone, and stone tools and weapons—their spiritual and social life was highly complex. Most spoke several languages, and confederacies sometimes linked widely scattered tribal groups. Aboriginal population density ranged from approximately one person per {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=1}} along the coasts to one person per {{convert|35|sqmi|km2|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in the arid interior. Food procurement was usually a matter for the nuclear family, requiring an estimated 3 days of work per week. There was little large game, and outside of some communities in the more fertile south-east, they had no agriculture.

Dutch navigators landed on the coasts of modern Western Australia and Queensland several times during the 17th century. Captain [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1770, the west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have been between 315,000 and 750,000,&lt;ref name=ABS2008YBindigenous&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/68AE74ED632E17A6CA2573D200110075?opendocument|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided into many tribes speaking many different languages. In the {{CensusAU|2011}}, 495,757 respondents declared they were [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]], 31,407 declared they were [[Torres Strait Islander]], and a further 21,206 declared they were both [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].&lt;ref name="ABS2011"&gt;{{Census 2011 AUS|id=0|name=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (Indigenous) Profile|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of World War II, efforts have been made both by the government and by the public to be more responsive to Aboriginal rights and needs.

Today, most of Australia's Indigenous population live on the east coast of Australia, where almost 60% of Indigenous Australians live in [[New South Wales]] (208,476) and [[Queensland]] (188,954) which roughly represents 2–5% of those state's populations. The [[Northern Territory]] has an Indigenous population of almost 70,000 and represents about 30% of the total Northern Territory population.

==Cities==
{{Main|List of cities in Australia by population}}
Australia contains five cities that consist of over one million people. Most of Australia's population live close to coastlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/beach/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226144234/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/beach/ |archivedate=26 February 2010 |title=The Beach |work=Australian Government: Culture Portal |publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Commonwealth of Australia |date=17 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population density==
The population density in Australia was last reported as {{convert|2.91|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. The density was {{convert|2.8|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2008 and {{convert|2.86|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2009. That made Australia the 3rd least densely populated country in the world, after [[Namibia]] and [[Mongolia]].

* one birth every 1 minute and 42 seconds,
* one death every 3 minutes and 16 seconds,
* one migrant person arriving to live in Australia every 1 minute and 1 second,
* one Australian resident leaving Australia to live overseas every 1 minute and 51 seconds, leading to
* an overall total population increase of one person every 1 minute and 23 seconds.

At the time of [[Federation of Australia|Australian Federation]] in 1901, the rate of [[Population growth|natural increase]] was 14.9 persons per 1,000 population. The rate increased to a peak of 17.4 per thousand population in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914. During the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]], the rate declined to a low of 7.1 per thousand population in 1934 and 1935. Immediately after World War II, the rate increased sharply as a result of the start of the [[post–World War II baby boom]] and the immigration of many young people who then had children in Australia. A rate plateau of over 13.0 persons per 1,000 population occurred for every year from 1946 to 1962.

There has been a fall in the rate of natural increase since 1962 due to falling [[fertility]]. In 1971, the rate of natural increase was 12.7 persons per 1,000 population; a decade later it had fallen to 8.5. In 1996 the rate of natural increase fell below seven for the first time, with the downward trend continuing in the late 1990s.  Population projections by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that continued low fertility, combined with the increase in deaths from an ageing population, will result in natural increase falling below zero sometime in the mid-2030s. However, in 2006 the [[total fertility rate|fertility rate]] rose to 1.81, one of the highest rates in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].

Since 1901, the crude death rate has fallen from about 12.2 deaths per 1,000 population, to 6.4 deaths per 1,000 population in 2006.&lt;ref name=ABS2008YBpopsize&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/72097B9A70C71596CA2573D20010FD0A?opendocument|title=Population Size and Growth|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestry of Australian population===
{{main|Australians}}
The earliest accepted timeline for the first arrivals of [[indigenous Australians]] to the continent of Australia places this [[human migration]] to at least 65,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weule |first1=Genelle |author2=Felicity James |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-07-20/aboriginal-shelter-pushes-human-history-back-to-65,000-years/8719314 |title=Indigenous rock shelter in Top End pushes Australia's human history back to 65,000 years |doi=10.1038/nature22968 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=20 July 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; most probably from the islands of [[Indonesia]] and [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="University of Wollongong"/&gt;

Captain [[James Cook]] claimed the east coast for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1770, the west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have been between 315,000 and 750,000,&lt;ref name="ABS2008YBindigenous"/&gt; divided into as many as 500 tribes speaking many different languages.

For generations, the vast majority of both colonial-era settlers and post-Federation immigrants came from the [[British Isles]], although the [[Gold rush#Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] also drew migrants from other countries, notably from [[China]]. Since the end of [[World War II]], Australia's population more than doubled, spurred by large-scale European immigration during the immediate post-war decades. At this time, the [[White Australia policy]] discouraged non-European immigration.

Abolition of the White Australia Policy in the mid-1970s led to a significant increase in non-European immigration, mostly from Asia.

Until the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the [[British Isles]], and a majority of Australians have some British or Irish ancestry. These Australians form an ethnic group known as [[Anglo-Celtic Australians]]. In the 2016 Australian census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~20|title=CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN AUSTRALIA, 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |date=27 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[English Australian|English]] (36.1%)
*[[Australians|Australian]] (33.5%)&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most who list "Australian" as their ancestry are part of the [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] group. {{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/49f609c83cf34d69ca2569de0025c182!OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420205113/http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs%40.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/49f609c83cf34d69ca2569de0025c182%21OpenDocument |archivedate=20 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Dutch Australian|Dutch]] (1.6%).
&lt;!-- Do not use the QuickStats data from ABS for ancestries. Use the full ancestry data series (eg from ABS Community Profiles series) as the QuickStats data shows each ancestry as a percentage of all ancestry responses (where each person can list up to two, thus a far greater number than the total population) while the full data series in the ABS Community Profiles show the percentage of people nominating a given ancestry as a percentage of the population who nominated an ancestry --&gt;

At the 2016 census, 47.3% of people had both parents born in Australia and 34.4% of people had both parents born overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/036?opendocument |title=2016 Census QuickStats: Australia |publisher=Censusdata.abs.gov.au |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Australia}}

Australia was, historically, a majority [[Protestant]] nation.&lt;ref name="pettersson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pettersson|first1=Thorleif|last2=Esmer|first2=Yilmaz R.|title=Changing Values, Persisting Cultures: Case Studies in Value Change|date=2008|publisher=Brill|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdhvC4RUDe0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=australia+historically+protestant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBv-f44JbYAhXSkOAKHTxXDbg4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=australia%20historically%20protestant&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auspolifacts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Political Facts|date=1990|publisher=Longman Chesire|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ro-6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=australia+historically+protestant&amp;dq=australia+historically+protestant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBv-f44JbYAhXSkOAKHTxXDbg4ChDoAQhIMAY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is no longer the case. Australia has become a religiously diverse country with 22% being [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], 30% having no religion and there are significant numbers of [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and others. While Australia has no official religion, the various governments of Australia refer to the [[Christian God]] in their ceremonies, as do the various Australian Courts.

In an optional question on the 2016 Census, 52.1% of the Australian population declared some variety of [[Christianity in Australia|Christianity]]. Historically the percentage has been far higher and the religious landscape of Australia is changing and diversifying.&lt;ref name="abs-2016"/&gt; Also in 2016, 30.1% of Australians stated "no religion" and a further 9.6% chose not to answer the question.&lt;ref name="abs-2016"/&gt; The remaining population is a diverse group which includes [[Islam|Muslims]] (2.6%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (2.4%), [[Hinduism in Australia|Hindus]] (1.9%), [[Sikhs]] (0.5%), and [[Jew]]s (0.4%).&lt;ref name="abs-2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia - Stories from the Census, 2016 : Religion in Australia|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Religion%20Data%20Summary~25|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=27 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020910/http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Religion%20Data%20Summary~25|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abs"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2071.0Main%20Features902012%E2%80%932013 |work = 2071.0 – Reflecting a Nation: Stories from the 2011 Census, 2012–2013 |title = Cultural diversity in Australia |date = 21 June 2012 |publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate = 2012-06-27 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160425232111/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2071.0Main%20Features902012%E2%80%932013 |archivedate = 25 April 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] 2001 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information:

''Data on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.''

As in many Western countries, the level of active participation in religious services is lower than would be indicated by the proportion of the population identifying themselves as affiliated with a religion; weekly attendance at Christian church services is about 1.5 million, or about 7.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCLS releases latest estimates of church attendance|url=http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2250&amp;track=82083|work=NCLS Research|publisher=NCLS Research|accessdate=24 April 2013|format=Media release|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools play a prominent role in welfare and education services. The [[:Category:Roman Catholic schools in Australia|Catholic education system]] is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 650,000 students (and around 21 per cent of all secondary school enrolments).

===Languages===
Although Australia has no official language, English has always been entrenched as the ''[[de facto]]'' national language.&lt;ref name=language&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/multicultural/confer/04/speech18b.htm |title=Pluralist Nations: Pluralist Language Policies? |work=1995 Global Cultural Diversity Conference Proceedings, Sydney |publisher=[[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]] |accessdate=11 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220020910/http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/multicultural/confer/04/speech18b.htm |archivedate=20 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} "English has no de jure status but it is so entrenched as the common language that it is de facto the official language as well as the national language."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian English]] is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/libraries/attachments/exhibitions/vocabulary_of_australian_english/files/5471/Vocabulary%20of%20Australian%20English.pdf |title=The Vocabulary Of Australian English |last=Moore |first=Bruce |publisher=National Museum of Australia |accessdate=5 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320004658/http://www.nma.gov.au/libraries/attachments/exhibitions/vocabulary_of_australian_english/files/5471/Vocabulary%20of%20Australian%20English.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.&lt;ref name="Fourth Edition 2005"&gt;"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Australian]] serves as the standard dialect.

According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 72.7% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~20 |title=2071.0 - Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia - Stories from the Census, 2016 |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Arabic language|Arabic]] (1.4%)
*[[Cantonese]] (1.2%)
*[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (1.2%)
*[[Italian language|Italian]] (1.2%).

A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual.

Over 250 [[Indigenous Australian languages]] are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact, of which less than 20 are still in daily use by all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2011/08/a-mission-to-save-indigenous-languages/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131224075354/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2011/08/a-mission-to-save-indigenous-languages/|archivedate= 24 December 2013| title=A mission to save indigenous languages| publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nilsr/&gt; About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people.&lt;ref name=nilsr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/nils-report-2005.pdf |title=National Indigenous Languages Survey Report 2005 |publisher=Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts |accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709141342/http://www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/national_indigenous_languages_survey_report_2005 |archivedate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4713.0 |title=4713.0 – Population Characteristics, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 2006 |last=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=4 May 2010 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |location=Canberra |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has a [[sign language]] known as [[Auslan]], which is the main language of about 5,500 deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;order=1&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;javascript=true&amp;textversion=false&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;breadcrumb=POTLD&amp;&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Language%20Spoken%20at%20Home%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;topic=Language&amp; |title=20680-Language Spoken at Home (full classification list) by Sex – Australia |last=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=27 June 2007 |work=2006 Census Tables : Australia |location=Canberra |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationality===
{{Main|Australian nationality law}}
Australian nationality law determines who is and who is not an Australian citizen. The status of Australian nationality or Australian citizenship was created by the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 (in 1973 renamed the Australian Citizenship Act 1948) which came into force on 26 January 1949. The 1948 Act was amended many times, notably in 1973, 1984, 1986 and 2002. The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 replaced the 1948 Act, commencing on 1 July 2007. Australian citizenship law is administered by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection which can issue certificates of citizenship on naturalisation or on request provide other proof or evidence of Australian citizenship. Australian passports are issued to Australian citizens by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

In Australia, the terms "nationality" and "citizenship" can be used interchangeably, but the term "citizenship" (or citizen) is more commonly used, while "nationality" is more commonly used on official documents and forms. A person may acquire citizenship automatically, "by operation of law", or by application after a period of residence in Australia. The process of acquiring citizenship by application is referred to as "naturalisation".

==Historical population==
Note that population estimates in the table below do not include the Aboriginal population before 1961. Estimates of Aboriginal population prior to European settlement range from 300,000 to one million, with archaeological finds indicating a sustainable population of around 750,000.&lt;ref name = "ABS 2002 Yr Bk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad45ff1425ca25682000192af2/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2002|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population|date=20 August 2007|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where available, actual population figures from census years are included.

Father '''Eugenio Barsanti''' (12 October 1821 – 19 April 1864), also named '''Nicolò''', was an Italian engineer, who together with [[Felice Matteucci]] of [[Florence]] invented the first version of the [[internal combustion engine]] in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's [[London Morning Journal|''Morning Journal'']] under the title "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses", as documented by the Fondazione Barsanti e Matteucci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ijYDkmZxI|title=il motore a scoppio Barsanti e Matteucci – la storia (part2)|date=18 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La documentazione essenziale per l'attribuzione della scoperta|url=http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/documentiStorici.html|quote=Another request bears the no. 700 of Volume VII of the Patent Office of the Reign of Piedmont.

This may have been either a new patent or an extension of a patent granted three days earlier, on 30 December 1857, at Turin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Barsanti was born in [[Pietrasanta]], [[Tuscany]]. Lean and short of stature, he studied in a Catholic  scientific-oriented institute near [[Lucca]], in Tuscany, and became a [[novitiate]] of the [[Piarist]] Fathers or Scolopi, who were known for being open to scientific study, in Florence in 1838.

In 1841 Barsanti began teaching in the ''Collegio San Michele'', situated in [[Volterra]]. Here, during a lecture describing the explosion of mixed [[hydrogen]] and [[air]], he realised the potential for using the energy of the expansion of combusting gases within a motor.

Subsequently, when teaching in a college level institute in Florence he met Matteucci. Matteucci appreciated the idea for the engine, and the two men worked together on it for the rest of their lives.

On 12 June 1854, they patented their invention in London, as Italian law at that time could not guarantee sufficient international protection on the patent. The construction of the prototype was later completed in the 1860s.

The main advantage of the [[Barsanti-Matteucci engine]] was the use of the return force of the piston due to the cooling of the gas.{{clarify|date=July 2015|what does this mean?}} Other approaches based on the pushing force of the explosion, like the one developed by [[France]]'s [[Etienne Lenoir]], were slower. The Barsanti-Matteucci engine was proven to be much more efficient, and won a silver medal from the institute of science of [[Lombardy]].

In 1856, Barsanti and Matteucci developed a two-cylinder 5 [[Horsepower|HP]] motor and two years later they built a counter-working two-piston engine.

Barsanti thought the new engine was a great improvement over the [[steam engine]]; it was much safer and less cumbersome and quick to operate. The main target was to provide mechanical energy in factories and for naval propulsion. It was not light enough for use as automotive engine.

After some searching, Barsanti and Matteucci selected the [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]] foundry in [[Seraing]], [[Belgium]] to mass-produce a {{convert|4|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}} engine. Orders for soon followed from many countries within [[Europe]].

Barsanti died suddenly at Seraing of [[typhoid fever]], on 30 March 1864, and Matteucci was left alone to lead the business. The development of the engine failed and Matteucci returned to his first occupation, [[hydraulics]].

When [[Nikolaus Otto]] patented his engine, Matteucci unsuccessfully argued he and his partner Barsanti were the originators.

Many documents concerning the patents of Barsanti and Matteucci’s motor are preserved in the archive of the [[Museo Galileo]] library in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://biblioteca.imss.fi.it/856/archivio_motore_barsanti_matteucci.pdf|title = Document summary concerning the new motor of Barsanti and Matteucci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gao Yaojie''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|高|耀|潔}}|p={{linktext|Gāo| Yào|jié}}}}; born 1927) is a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[gynecologist]], academic, and [[HIV/AIDS in China#Blood transfusion controversy|AIDS activist]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] province, China. Gao has been honored for her work by the [[United Nations]] and Western organizations, and had spent time under [[house arrest]]. Her split with the Chinese authority on the transmission and the seriousness of the AIDS epidemic in China hinders her further activities and resulted in her leaving for the United States in 2009. She is now living alone in uptown Manhattan, New York City.

==Biography==
Gao was born in Cao County, [[Shandong Province]] in 1927. A retired professor at the Henan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Gao is a medical doctor who specialized in [[Gynaecology|ovarian gynecology]],&lt;ref name="citation"&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationGaoYao.htm Citation for Gao Yaojie, Ramon Magsaysay Award Presentation Ceremonies]&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular gynecological tumors. She graduated from the School of Medicine at Henan University in 1954. However, because of her intellectual background Dr. Gao was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, leaving her in ill health. She worked as a gynecologist in the Henan Chinese Medicine Hospital in 1974, was promoted to professor in 1986, and retired in 1990. Dr. Gao was a member of the Henan People’s Congress.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/chinas-famous-aids-activist-arrives-in-us-25748.html], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henan was the site of the [[HIV/AIDS in China#Blood transfusion controversy|Bloodhead scandal]] which resulted in rapid spread of the [[HIV]] virus during the 1990s among the impoverished rural population who sold blood at unsanitary Henan provincial and private   [[Blood donation|collection centers]] where blood was collected from paid blood donors into a central tank, the plasma separated out, and the remainder of the blood pumped back from the central tank into the donors of the same blood type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museums.cnd.org/CND-Global/CND-Global.01-01-25.html "Revealing "Blood Wound" of Spread of HIV AIDS in Henan Province" in China News Digest, January 26, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Gao is well known in China and worldwide for her AIDS prevention work in during the HIV epidemic in Henan, and for advocating much greater attention to people suffering from AIDS and children orphaned by AIDS.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;"China Places AIDS Activist Under House Arrest" article by Jim Yardley in the [[New York Times]], February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Gao is well known for her writings and visits to Henan villages to educate people on HIV/AIDS prevention and for her work on behalf of the many children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic in Henan Province, home to 100 million people.  In 1996 Gao Yaojie started doing AIDS prevention work and treating people afflicted with AIDS in Henan's villages at her own expense. She visited over 100 Henan villages and treated over 1000 people. She self-published her book "Prevention of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases" and distributed 300,000 copies of the book.  Her newsletter "Knowledge for HIV Prevention" went to 15 issues and a total printing of 530,000 copies.  She used the $20,000 Jonathan Mann Award and $10,000 in contribution to reprint her book.  Since 2000, most of her efforts has been focused on helping "AIDS orphans" ("AIDS orphans" in Chinese refer to healthy children whose parents died of HIV.) in Henan's villages.&lt;ref&gt;PRC Central Television program on Dr. Gao Yaojie broadcast February 3, 2004  [http://www.cctv.com/news/other/20040203/101040.shtml Gao Yaojie]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life as a gynecologist and experience during the Cultural Revolution ===
{{Empty section|date=December 2012}}

=== Uncovering the epidemic after retirement ===

==== First contact with an AIDS patient ====
{{Original research|section|date=May 2014}}It was by accident that Gao embarked on the road of anti-AIDS education. On April 7, 1996, a Henan hospital received a woman patient but found it difficult to diagnose her disease. Gao was invited to attend the consultation. At last, the patient, surnamed Ba, was diagnosed with HIV due to a blood transfusion several years earlier. The patient cried and appealed to Gao, saying, "Doctor Gao, how is it that I cannot be cured, for I just took a blood transfusion?"
"I don't want to die!" Ba said. "My husband and my child can't live without me."
Ten days later, the patient died, at the age of 42. Fortunately, neither her husband nor her child was infected by HIV.

It was Gao's first time to see an AIDS patient. Ba's painful expression and heartbreaking cry deeply hurt Gao's heart. As a doctor, she could do nothing but watch the disease take the life of her patient. For several consecutive days, Gao had no appetite and slept poorly. And the worst thing was that patient's blood transfusion came from an infected blood bank, which meant she was the tip of an iceberg that had just emerged from the water and even more lives would be lost if no measures were taken to stem the spread of HIV. In the meantime, Gao also noticed that in the two years from the patient's infection to her death, none of her family was infected, proving the possibility of successful control of the spread of the disease. But the premise is that people should be aware of the urgency in AIDS prevention and grasp prevention knowledge as much as possible.

==== Commitment to AIDS prevention ====

Gao sponsored and edited a tabloid, Knowledge of AIDS Prevention, which has published 530,000 copies in 15 issues. Except for the first issue, all the following issues were funded by Gao herself, costing her 3,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan each. She also bought medicine on her own expenses for patients and sends money to them. In the autumn of 2001, Gao carried out a survey on the knowledge of AIDS prevention. Of the more than 10,000 people surveyed, less than 15 percent had a correct understanding of HIV transmission and AIDS prevention, and most of them were utterly ignorant of HIV transmission through blood.

In order to expand AIDS prevention education, Gao edited the book The Prevention of AIDS / Venereal Disease, which has been published four times for more than 300,000 copies. She spent all her $20,000 in award money from Jonathan Mann Award for Global Health and Human Rights and $10,000 in donations from the Ford Foundation in printing 150,000 copies of the book. Every day, 10 to 100 copies of the book are given free to medical staff, patients, and patients' families in rural areas. After the book's reprinting in August 2001, the Women's Federation of Henan Province, the provincial epidemic prevention station, and the provincial library were presented with some 20,000 copies each and were commissioned to transfer the books to grass-root units and individuals in rural areas. Soon, Gao received piles of letters from different places asking for the book; most of the letters came from Henan Province. Some provinces, including Hainan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Yunnan, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have used this book as the teaching material for their AIDS education classes.

== Achievements  ==
Gao’s hard work and persistence, however, have forced the government to admit that there is a problem with AIDS. In 2003, the Chinese government admitted officially that AIDS existed in China and promised funds to prevent and control the disease. In 2004 the United
Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China released a report estimating that somewhere between 850,000 and 1.5 million adults in China were infected with HIV as of 2001. In 2007, Chinese health officials estimated that only 750,000 adults were infected, but other sources
estimated that the true number was closer to 1.5 million. By October that year, China had officially recorded 183,733 HIV cases, including 12,464 deaths. Up until now, many people at risk remain untested—some are lurking in the shadows because of the stigma—and some
experts fear the actual number could be much higher.

==Awards, Harassment and Publication of Autobiography==
[[File:GaoYaojie2-70 percent.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dr. Gao Yao-Jie (Hie) (or Gao Yaojie) 80-year-old, gynecologist from Henan province（2007）]]In 2001 she was awarded the [[Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorsoftheworld.org/about/about_details.cfm?QID=1328 Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she was named Time Magazine's Asian Heroine. In 2003 she was awarded the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Public Service in Manila, Philippines.&lt;ref name="citation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Response/ResponseGaoYao.htm Gao Yaojie's acceptance speech upon receipt of the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service]&lt;/ref&gt; In both instances she was denied permission to travel outside China to accept the awards.&lt;ref name="hide"/&gt; In 2003 she was designated one of the “Ten People Who Touched China in 2003” by [[China Central Television]].

Gao was awarded the "Global Leadership Award, Women Changing Our World" by the [[Vital Voices Global Partnership]] along with three other women from China and three women from India, Guatemala, and Sudan at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] on March 14, 2007. Gao was reported in February, 2007 to have been held in [[house arrest]] and unable to travel.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt; She had been pressured by local officials to sign a statement that she is "unable to travel due to poor health." &lt;ref name="hide"&gt;"China Covers Up Detention of AIDS Doctor" reporting by Jim Yardley, [[New York Times]], February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  A report on a visit to her apartment while she was still under house arrest by Henan Province Vice Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, Henan Vice Governor Wang Jumei, and Henan Province Communist Party Organization Department head Ye Dongsong presented her flowers and best wishes from the Henan Party and Government for the Chinese New Year &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnsc.com.cn/news/2007/02/13/157865.htm Henan Daily article with photo of senior Henan leaders conveying best wishes to Dr. Gao while she was under house arrest]&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in the Henan Daily and other Chinese media.  On February 16, 2007, bowing to international pressure, the government gave her permission to travel to the United States to receive the award.&lt;ref&gt;"Detained AIDS Doctor Allowed to Visit U.S. Later, China Says", article by Jim Yardley in the [[New York Times]], February 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gao left China from Guangdong province after receiving a warm company from her supporters.Upon arriving the United States, she stayed briefly with a Chinese family and then moved to New York with a visiting fellowship from Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Juliana|title=Exiled China Aids activist mourns her former life|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-11446636|website=BBC News|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house arrest of Gao was part of a continuing pattern of harassment, especially in Henan Province, of grassroots AIDS activists in China. In 2006 [[Wan Yanhai]], another prominent activist, was detained and prevented from holding an [[AIDS]] conference in Beijing. [http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/1260580754 Gao's blog], which she updated till 2009, has become what Gao calls a "battleground" between her supporters and detractors. Gao in her blog entry of February 11 denounces a hacking saboteur of her blog and notes that one visitor left a message that people were being paid 50 RMB each to leave negative comments. Gao writes that the attacks began after she began describing many cases of people who got HIV through blood transfusions in order to show a serious problem of HIV transmission by blood transfusion continues in Henan Province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/4b22ef9201000784 Gao Yaojie Blog, blog posting of February 11, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

September 20 of 2007, [[New York Academy of Sciences]] gave her "The Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award|url=http://www.nyas.org/WhatWeDo/HumanRights/detail.aspx?cid=e05795c8-2d64-4e14-927d-0744e8811308|website=The New York Academy of Sciences|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the International Astronomical Union named asteroid No. 38980 after Dr. Gao.

In July 2008, Gao's autobiography "The Soul of Gao Yaojie" (written in Chinese) was published by [https://web.archive.org/web/20150505134406/http://books.mingpao.com/cfm/bookinfo.cfm?TitleID=4139 Ming Pao Publications Limited] (Hong Kong), and the English version, "The Soul of Gao Yaojie: A Memoir", was published in November, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.51.ca/bbs/printthread.php?threadid=180845 Interview with Dr. Gao Yaojie and discussion of her autobiography, South China Morning Post of September 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2015, Gao received the 2014 annual “Liu Binyan Conscience Award.” The award ceremony was held at Dr. Gao’s New York apartment and more than 10 jury members and guests participated. The award was named after a renewed Chinese doctor Liu Binyan and the jury consisted of well-known Chinese writers.&lt;ref name="Boxun news"&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS Doctor Gao Yaojie awarded the 2014 annual “Liu Binyan Conscience Award”|url=http://en.boxun.com/2015/02/24/aids-doctor-gao-yaojie-awarded-the-2014-annual-liu-binyan-conscience-award-video/|website=Boxun news|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gennady Andreyevich Zyuganov''' ({{lang-ru|Генна́дий Андре́евич Зюга́нов}}; born 26 June 1944) is a [[Russia]]n communist [[politician]] who has been the [[General Secretary|leader]] of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] since 1993. He has been Chairman of the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (UCP-CPSU) since 2001, a deputy in the [[State Duma]] since 1993, and a member of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]] since 1996. Zyuganov ran for President of Russia four times, most notably [[Gennady Zyuganov presidential campaign, 1996|in 1996]], when he came close to winning the election, but lost in the second round to incumbent [[Boris Yeltsin]].

==Early life and education==
Zyuganov was born in Mymrino, a farming village in [[Oryol Oblast]], on 26 June 1944. The son and grandson of schoolteachers, he followed in their footsteps. After graduating from a secondary school, his first job was working there for one year as a physics teacher in 1961.

In 1962, he enrolled into the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the [[Orel State University|Oryol Pedagogical Institute]]. From 1963 to 1966, he served in a Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Intelligence unit of the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]]. Zyuganov joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1966.

He returned to the teachers' college in 1966. Three years older than most members of his class, he was already a party member and a popular college athlete. On his return, he also married his wife, Nadezhda. He completed his degree in 1969.

==Party work==
Zyuganov taught mathematics but soon turned to party work in Oryol Oblast, beginning in 1967. He became the [[General Secretary|First Secretary]] of the local [[Komsomol]] and the regional chief for ideology and propaganda. He emerged as a popular politician in the area. Among many other functions, Zyuganov organized parties and dances as a local Komsomol leader while he was rising through the ranks of the vast network of party [[apparatchik]]s. Zyuganov rose to be second secretary, or second in command, of the party in Oryol.

He enrolled at an elite party school in Moscow, the Academy of Social Sciences in 1978, completing his [[Education in Russia#Post-graduate levels|doctor nauk]], a post-doctoral degree, in 1980. He then returned to Oryol to become regional party chief for ideology and propaganda until 1983. In 1983, he was given a high-level position in Moscow as an instructor in the Communist Party propaganda department.

Zyuganov emerged as a leading critic of Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' in the party's [[agitprop|Agitation and Propaganda division]] (later the Ideological division), a hotbed of opposition to reform.  As the party began to crumble in the late 1980s, Zyuganov took the side of hard-liners against reforms that would ultimately culminate in the end of CPSU rule and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In May 1991, he [[Architect amidst the Ruins|published a fiercely critical piece]] on [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]].

==Head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation==
Zyuganov wrote several influential papers in the early 1990s attacking [[Boris Yeltsin]] and calling for a return to the [[socialism]] of the pre-Gorbachev days. In July 1991, he signed the "[[A Word to the People]]" declaration. As the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fell into disarray, Zyuganov helped form the new [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] (CPRF), and became one of seven secretaries of the new group's Central Committee. In 1993, he became its chairman. Outside observers were surprised by the survival of Zyuganov's Communist Party into the post-Soviet era.

Zyuganov quickly emerged as post-communist Russia's leading opposition leader. He argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a decline in living standards, that economic power was left concentrated in the hands of a tiny share of the population, that violent crime increased, and that the Soviet collapse allowed ethnic groups throughout Russia to embark on campaigns, sometimes violent, to win autonomy. Many in Russia longed for a return to the days of socialism, when a strong central government promised personal and economic security. Russians who felt left behind in the new Russia emerged as Zyuganov's supporters, including a number of workers, clerks, bureaucrats, professionals, and the elderly. As Zyuganov succeeded in combining Communist ideas with Russian [[nationalism]], his new Communist Party of the Russian Federation joined hands with numerous other left-wing and right-wing nationalist forces, forming a common "national-patriotic alliance."

In the 1993 and 1995 parliamentary elections, the newly revitalized Communist Party of the Russian Federation made a strong showing, and Zyuganov emerged as a serious challenger to President Yeltsin.

===1996 presidential campaign===
{{see main|Gennady Zyuganov presidential campaign, 1996}}
[[File:Red belt in Russian 1996 presidential elections.svg|thumb|left|300px|The results of the second round of the 1996 elections. Red highlighted regions where Zyuganov won]]
Zyuganov entered the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], as the standard-bearer of the Russian Communist Party. Co-opting Russian nationalism, he attacked the infiltration of [[Western culture|Western]] ideals into Russian society and portrayed Russia as a great nation that had been dismantled from within by traitors in cahoots with Western capitalists, who sought the dissolution of Soviet power in order to exploit Russia's boundless resources.

Hungarian-American billionaire [[George Soros]], along with Russian oligarchs such as [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], [[Anatoly Chubais]], and others feared a Communist resurgence in Russia while witnessing Zyuganov present himself as a kinder, gentler Communist while attending the [[World Economic Forum]] at [[Davos]] in 1996.  Chubais recalled, stating "I saw many of my good friends, presidents of major American companies, European companies, who were simply dancing around Zyuganov, trying to catch his eye, peering at him.  These were the world's most powerful businessmen, with world famous names, who with their entire appearance demonstrated that they were seeking support of the future president of Russia, because it was clear to everyone that Zyuganov was going to be the future president of Russia, and now they needed to build a relationship with him.  So, this shook me up!"  The oligarchs set aside their differences and held several private meetings in Davos hotel rooms, where they strategized over how to defeat the perceived Zyuganov threat.  The result was the "Davos pact", an agreement between Chubais and the oligarchs that he would lead an anti-Communist campaign against Zuyganov, that they agreed to fund.  The subsequent months saw a massive media offensive as "money poured into advertising campaigns, into regional tours, into bribing journalists", all supported by the oligarchs who owned the major media.  Yeltsin's subsequent victory in that election can be traced back to the events that took place in Davos between Chubais and those Russian oligarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothkopf |first=David |date=March 3, 2009 |title=Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making  |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |page=268 |isbn=978-0374531614|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZymAEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election on June 16, Zyuganov finished second with 32%, trailing only Yeltsin, who captured 35%. Zyuganov prepared for the July 3 runoff election with confidence. He ran a campaign focusing on the president's ill health and pledged to return Russia to its Soviet days of glory. Yeltsin, however, relentlessly exploited his advantages of incumbency, patronage, and financial backing. Yeltsin gained from the elimination of the many smaller parties, as well as the support of [[Alexander Lebed]], and eventually won the two-man showdown by 53.8% against 40.7%.

It has been alleged that Yeltsin may not have legitimately won the 1996 presidential election, but instead employed electoral fraud.  Some results, largely from Russia's ethnic republics of [[Tatarstan]], [[Dagestan]] and [[Bashkortostan]], showed highly unlikely changes in voting patterns between the two rounds of voting.&lt;ref name=calmit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vote.caltech.edu/sites/default/files/vtp_wp63.pdf |title=Russian Elections: An Oxymoron of Democracy |work=[[CALTECH]]/[[MIT]] VOTING TECHNOLOGY PROJECT |date=Mar 2008 |pages=2–7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223239/http://vote.caltech.edu/sites/default/files/vtp_wp63.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lZh-YUxeldYC&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Democracy Derailed in Russia: The Failure of Open Politics |author=M.

===After 1996 election===
Political observers suggested that Zyuganov was still a force to be reckoned with in Russian politics, and that his next task would be to remake the communists into a strong opposition. But after the [[Elections in Russia#Duma 1999 elections|December 1999 parliamentary elections]], the number of Communist seats in the Duma was reduced. Communist support started to decline, given the widespread electoral support at the time for the government's invasion of [[Chechnya]] in September 1999 and the popularity of Yeltsin's new prime minister, [[Vladimir Putin]], who was widely seen as the ailing Yeltsin's heir apparent.

===2000 presidential campaign===
{{see main|Gennady Zyuganov presidential campaign, 2000}}
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
Zyuganov placed a distant second behind Vladimir Putin in the [[Russian presidential election, 2000|March 2000 presidential election]].

===After 2000 election===

Zyuganov has additionally served as the Chairman of the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (UCP-CPSU) since 2001, replacing [[Oleg Shenin]].

In November 2001, In an [[open letter]] to Putin ahead of the summit between the US and Russian presidents in the [[United States]], Zyuganov said that Russia was betraying its national interests. "It is blindly following US policy which has been characterized recently by open aggression". Zyuganov criticized Putin for his decision the previous month to close a [[Cuba]]n listening post that eavesdropped on US communications and a key naval base in Vietnam, as well as Russian support for Washington using bases in former Soviet [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] for its [[Afghan]] strikes. "Russia's national state and national interests may be betrayed" at the upcoming summit between Putin and US President [[George W. Bush]], Zyuganov warned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/rad-green/2001-November/001596.html Russian Communist leader denounces Putin for US alliance.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021124152/http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/rad-green/2001-November/001596.html |date=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Zyuganov declined to run against Putin, who secured a [[Russian presidential election, 2004|landslide reelection victory]].


===2008 presidential campaign===
{{main|Gennady Zyuganov presidential campaign, 2008}}
In October 2005, Zyuganov indicated that he would run for president in 2008, making him the second person to enter the race for the [[Kremlin]] following former Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]]. According to one report, Zyuganov pledged to quadruple pensions and state salaries, should he be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russiatoday.ru/election/news/18530|title=Communists leader to run for president|publisher=[[Russia Today]]|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=3 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218172107/http://www.russiatoday.ru/election/news/18530|archivedate=18 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] on March 2, 2008, Zyuganov garnered 17.76% of the vote and came in second to Medvedev's 70.23%.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7274001.stm|title=Medvedev 'to continue Putin work'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-2008===
On Zyuganov's 65th birthday in June 2009, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin presented him with a copy of the first Soviet edition of the [[Communist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i0U4EoFaDjnGYUD_Trgw-uMi-C8Q "Putin gives Communist leader surprise birthday gift"], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 29 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]'s birthday on 21 December 2010, Zyuganov called for the [[Stalinism|re-Stalinization]] of Russian society in an open letter to President Medvedev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/communists-lay-carnations-for-stalin/story-e6frfku0-1225974765203|title=Communists lay carnations for Stalin|publisher=AFP|date=22 December 2010|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Putin's annual address to parliament on 20 April 2011, Zyuganov criticised it as inadequate in dealing with Russia's economic decline and warned that, "If the [parliamentary and presidential] elections are as dirty as before, the situation will develop along the [[Arab Spring|North African scenario]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/todays-paper/Putin+plan+disastrous+opponents/4652279/story.html|title=Putin plan disastrous, opponents say|publisher=AFP|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=26 April 2011}}{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zyuganov denounced election irregularities in the [[Russian legislative election, 2011|Russian legislative election of 2011]] but also expressed his opposition to the organizers of the [[2011 Russian protests|mass demonstrations of December, 2011]] who he viewed as liberals who exploited unrest. The communist party played only a minor role in the protests, with one of its speakers, who called for restoration of Soviet power, being booed off the stage. Party rallies on 18 December 2011, in protest of election irregularities in Moscow and St. Petersburg were attended by only a few thousand, mostly elderly, party supporters. According to ''The New York Times'', it is questionable that Zyuganov, due to his age and association with Soviet policies, will be able to capitalize on the opportunity presented by popular disgust with the Putin regime, or mobilize mass popular support for his party.&lt;ref name=NYTCommunist&gt;{{cite news|title=Where Communists See an Opening, Many Russians See a Closed Door|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/world/europe/communists-solidify-opposition-role-in-russia.html|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 December 2011|author=David M. Herszenhorn|quote=He, [Gennadi A. Zyuganov], has joined in popular protests against Mr. Putin's government, while seeking to block the rise of the liberal reformers leading those rallies by denouncing them as a subversive threat to Russia's future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zyuganov is a harsh critic of President [[Vladimir Putin]], but his recipes for Russia's future are true to his Soviet roots. He is on record as hoping to renationalise all major industries and he believes the USSR was "the most humane state in human history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c6abd0c-5309-11e1-8aa1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2WMwq7eL5 Kremlin  has plan B for poll run-off]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 2008, in his speech before the 13th Party Congress, Zyuganov made these remarks about the state that Russia under Putin was in:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Objectively, Russia's position remains complicated, not to say dismal. The population is dying out. Thanks to the "heroic efforts" of the Yeltsinites the country has lost 5 out of the 22 million square kilometers of its historical territory. Russia has lost half of its production capacity and has yet to reach the 1990 level of output. Our country is facing three mortal dangers: de-industrialization, de-population and mental debilitation. The ruling group has neither notable successes to boast of, nor a clear plan of action. All its activities are geared to a single goal: to stay in power at all costs. Until recently it has been able to keep in power due to the "windfall" high world prices for energy. Its social support rests on the notorious "vertical power structure" which is another way of saying intimidation and blackmail of the broad social strata and the handouts that power chips off the oil and [[gas]] pie and throws out to the population in crumbs, especially on the eve of elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kprf.ru/party_live/61739.html Political Report of the CPRF Central Committee to the 13th Party Congress], by G.Zyuganov, November 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The party and Zyuganov supported a ban on the "promotion of non-traditional sexual relations to minors",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/politics/putin-law-gay-religious-457/|title=Putin signs 'gay propaganda' ban and law criminalizing insult of religious feelings|work=rt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themoscownews.com/politics/20140129/192192050-print/Russian-State-Duma-Possessed-printer-or-executor-of-the-peoples.html|title=Russian State Duma: 'Possessed printer' or executor of the people's will?|work=themoscownews.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301042652/http://themoscownews.com/politics/20140129/192192050-print/Russian-State-Duma-Possessed-printer-or-executor-of-the-peoples.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly named a ban on "homosexual propaganda to minors" in Western media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/06/11/russian-mps-vote-overwhelmingly-to-outlaw-gay-propaganda/|title=Russian MPs vote overwhelmingly to outlaw gay 'propaganda'|work=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 presidential campaign===
{{see main|Gennady Zyuganov presidential campaign, 2012}}

[[File:RIAN archive 910756 Young Pioneer induction ceremony held on Moscow's Red Square.jpg|right|thumb|Zyuganov campaigning in [[Red Square]]]]

In September 2011, Zyuganov again became the CPRF's candidate for the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]. According to Zyuganov, "a gang of folks who cannot do anything in life apart from dollars, profits and mumbling, has humiliated the country" and called for a new international alliance to "counter the aggressive policies of imperialist circles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/russia-communists-congress-zyuganov-589-307/|title=Communists pledge to stop 'dollar-lovers' experiment on Russia'|publisher=RT|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 Russian presidential election on 4 March 2012, Zyuganov once again came in second place by receiving 17% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sobesednik.ru/news/20120305-itogi-vyborov-prezidenta-2012-vladimir-putin-nabiraet-okolo-64 the results of the presidential elections in Russia 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Shot like a dog?"===
Following the [[2012 Benghazi attack|2012 U.S. consulate attacks in Benghazi]], Zyuganov generated controversy after a comment he made on [[J. Christopher Stevens|Chris Stevens]]' death at the hands of armed militants in Libya by saying that U.S. ambassador was "shot like a dog" ("был убит как последняя собака"). This caused an outrage from the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]. S. Obuhov, the press-secretary to the Russian Duma, responded: "Zyuganov meant 'the last dog' as a Russian proverb and not in the sense that it sounds in English. 'The last' represents a Russian hard-to-translate idiom, not in a negative but in a positive sense," explaining the faux pas as a colloquialism lost in translation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/politics/tomorrow-us-outraged-russian-456/ US ambassador to Libya was shot like a dog' – Zyuganov]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ukraine crisis ==
Zyuganov enthusiastically supported the annexation of Crimea by Russia as well as the pro-Russian insurgency, for which the Ukrainian public prosecutor started against him a criminal case (as well as against Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Sergey Mironov).

==Political views==
{{Main article|Political positions of Gennady Zyuganov}}
Zyuganov is a [[Christian communist]].{{Citation needed|reason=Has he identified himself as such or is this speculation?|date=November 2017}} According to Zyuganov, [[Jesus Christ]] was the first communist, claiming the Bible may be read through a socialist perspective.&lt;ref name=orthodox_communism&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20150512205651/http://argumentua.com/stati/pravoslavnyi-kommunizm-v-fashistkoi-rossii-kto-stoit-za-spinoi-putina Christian Orthodox Communism in the Fascist Russia: who stands behind the back of Putin].

The '''Greeks''' or '''Hellenes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|iː|n|z}}; {{lang-el|Έλληνες}}, ''Éllines'' {{IPA-el|ˈelines|}}) are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[Greece]], [[Greek Cypriots|Cyprus]], southern [[Greeks in Albania|Albania]], [[Greeks in Italy|Italy]], [[Greeks in Turkey#History|Turkey]], [[Greeks in Egypt|Egypt]] and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They also form a significant [[Greek diaspora|diaspora]], with Greek communities established around the world.&lt;ref name=Roberts1&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|2007|pp=171–172, 222}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Black Sea]], but the Greek people have always been centered on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] seas, where the [[Greek language]] has been spoken since the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|pp=159, 165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;{{harvnb|Sutton|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the [[Greek peninsula]], the western coast of [[Asia Minor]], the Black Sea coast, [[Cappadocia]] in central Anatolia, [[Egypt]], the [[Balkans]], Cyprus, and [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient [[Greek colonies|Greek colonization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaton|1996|pp=1–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural centers of the Greeks have included [[Athens]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Alexandria]], [[Smyrna]], and [[Constantinople]] at various periods.

Most ethnic Greeks live nowadays within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus. The [[Greek genocide]] and [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] and [[Greeks in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and in the [[Greek diaspora]] communities in a number of other countries. Today, most Greeks are officially registered as members of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;[[CIA World Factbook]] on Greece: Greek Orthodox 98%, [[Greek Muslims|Greek Muslim]] 1.3%, other 0.7%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks have greatly influenced and contributed to [[culture]], arts, exploration, [[literature]], [[philosophy]], politics, [[architecture]], [[music]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[technology]], business, cuisine, and sports, both historically and contemporarily.

The Greeks speak the [[Greek language]], which forms its own unique branch within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, the [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]].&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; They are part of a group of classical ethnicities, described by [[Anthony D. Smith]] as an "archetypal diaspora people".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guibernau|Hutchinson|2004|p=23: "Indeed, Smith emphasizes that the myth of divine election sustains the continuity of cultural identity, and, in that regard, has enabled certain pre-modern communities such as the Jews, Armenians, and Greeks to survive and persist over centuries and millennia (Smith 1993: 15–20)."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1999|p=21: "It emphasizes the role of myths, memories and symbols of ethnic chosenness, trauma, and the 'golden age' of saints, sages, and heroes in the rise of modern nationalism among the Jews, Armenians, and Greeks—the archetypal diaspora peoples."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
{{further|Proto-Greek language|List of Ancient Greek tribes}}
The Proto-Greeks probably arrived at the area now called Greece, in the southern tip of the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], at the end of the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cadogan|Langdon Caskey|1986|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Though there is a range of interpretations; [[Carl Blegen]] dates the arrival of the Greeks around 1900 BC, John Caskey believes that there were two waves of immigrants and [[Robert Drews]] places the event as late as 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2006|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1994|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of more theories has also been supported,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a general consensus that the coming of the Greek tribes occurred around 2100 BC.}} The sequence of migrations into the Greek mainland during the [[2nd millennium BC]] has to be reconstructed on the basis of the [[ancient Greek dialects]], as they presented themselves centuries later and are therefore subject to some uncertainties. There were at least two migrations, the first being the [[Ionians]] and [[Aeolians]], which resulted in [[Mycenaean Greece]] by the 16th century BC,&lt;ref name=Brit1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title = The Greeks |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=US |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chadwick |first=John |authorlink=John Chadwick |title=The Mycenaean world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;dq |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1976 |pages=1–3 |isbn=0-521-29037-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second, the [[Dorian invasion]], around the 11th century BC, displacing the [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot dialects]], which descended from the Mycenaean period. Both migrations occur at incisive periods, the Mycenaean at the transition to the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the Doric at the [[Bronze Age collapse]].

An alternative hypothesis has been put forth by linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev|Vladimir Georgiev]], who places Proto-Greek speakers in northwestern Greece by the [[Early Helladic]] period (3rd millennium BC), i.e. towards the end of the [[European Neolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir I. Georgiev]], for example, placed Proto-Greek in northwestern Greece during the Late Neolithic period. ({{harvnb|Georgiev|1981|loc=p. 192: "''Late Neolithic Period'': in northwestern Greece the Proto-Greek language had already been formed: this is the original home of the Greeks."}})&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists [[Russell Gray]] and Quentin Atkinson in a 2003 paper using computational methods on [[Swadesh list]]s have arrived at a somewhat earlier estimate, around 5000 BC for Greco-Armenian split and the emergence of Greek as a separate linguistic lineage around 4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|2003|pp=437–438}}; {{harvnb|Atkinson|Gray|2006|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mycenaean===
{{Main|Mycenaean Greece}}
In {{circa}} 1600 BC, the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the [[Minoan civilization]] its syllabic writing system (i.e. [[Linear A]]) and developed their own [[syllabic script]] known as [[Linear B]],&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Linear A and Linear B|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Linear-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing the first and oldest written evidence of [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mycenaeans quickly penetrated the [[Aegean Sea]] and, by the 15th century BC, had reached [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the shores of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2006|pp=71–72}}; {{harvnb|Panayotou|2007|pp=417–426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1200 BC, the [[Dorians]], another Greek-speaking people, followed from [[Epirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2014|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, historians have believed that the [[Dorian invasion]] caused the collapse of the [[Mycenaean civilization]], but it is likely the main attack was made by seafaring raiders ([[Sea Peoples]]) who sailed into the eastern Mediterranean around 1180 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dorian invasion]] was followed by a poorly attested period of migrations, appropriately called the [[Greek Dark Ages]], but by 800 BC the landscape of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]] was discernible.&lt;ref name=Castleden2&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2004|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Podzuweit|1982|pp=65–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Homer|Homeric Epics]] (i.e. ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the time of [[Euhemerism]] that scholars began to question Homer's historicity.&lt;ref name=Castleden2/&gt; As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]]) became major figures of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Pantheon]] of later antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Dietrich|1974|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ethnogenesis]] of the Greek nation is linked to the development of Pan-Hellenism in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burckhardt|1999|loc=p. 168: "The establishment of these Panhellenic sites, which yet remained exclusively Hellenic, was a very important element in the growth and self-consciousness of Hellenic nationalism; it was uniquely decisive in breaking down enmity between tribes, and remained the most powerful obstacle to fragmentation into mutually hostile ''poleis''."}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, the foundational event was the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in 776 BC, when the idea of a common Hellenism among the Greek tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture.&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt; The works of [[Homer]] (i.e. ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') and [[Hesiod]] (i.e. ''[[Theogony]]'') were written in the 8th century BC, becoming the basis of the national religion, ethos, history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zuwiyya|2011|pp=142–143}}; {{harvnb|Budin|2009|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pythia|Oracle of Apollo at Delphi]] was established in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1990|pp=1–25, 148–190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the [[death of Alexander the Great]], in 323 BC (some authors prefer to split this period into "Classical", from the end of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] to the end of the Peloponnesian War, and "Fourth Century", up to the death of Alexander). It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ancient Greek Civilization|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=18 February 2016|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical period is also described as the "Golden Age" of Greek civilization, and its art, philosophy, architecture and literature would be instrumental in the formation and development of Western culture.

While the Greeks of the classical era understood themselves to belong to a common Hellenic [[genos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konstan|2001|pp=29–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; their first loyalty was to their city and they saw nothing incongruous about warring, often brutally, with other Greek [[Polis|city-states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinberger|2000|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Burger|2008|pp=57–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peloponnesian War]], the large scale civil war between the two most powerful Greek city-states [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Sparta]] and [[Delian League|their]] [[Peloponnesian League|allies]], left both greatly weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burger|2008|pp=57–58: "''Poleis'' continued to go to war with each other. The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) made this painfully clear. The war (really two wars punctuated by a peace) was a duel between Greece's two leading cities, Athens and Sparta. Most other ''poleis'', however, got sucked into the conflict as allies of one side or the other&amp;nbsp;... The fact that Greeks were willing to fight for their cities against other Greeks in conflicts like the Peloponnesian War showed the limits of the pull of Hellas compared with that of the polis."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexander the Great mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander the Great]], whose conquests led to the [[Hellenistic Age]].|alt=]]

Most of the feuding Greek city-states were, in some scholars' opinions, united under the banner of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]]'s and [[Alexander the Great]]'s Pan-Hellenic ideals, though others might generally opt, rather, for an explanation of "[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] conquest for the sake of conquest" or at least conquest for the sake of riches, glory and power and view the "ideal" as useful propaganda directed towards the city-states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=Riding with Alexander|year=2004|work=Archaeology|publisher=The Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/fox.html|quote=Alexander inherited the idea of an invasion of the Persian Empire from his father Philip whose advance-force was already out in Asia in 336 BC. Philips campaign had the slogan of "freeing the Greeks" in Asia and "punishing the Persians" for their past sacrileges during their own invasion (a century and a half earlier) of Greece. No doubt, Philip wanted glory and plunder.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Alexander's toppling of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], after his victories at the battles of the [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], and his advance as far as modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[Tajikistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brice|2012|pp=281–286}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provided an important outlet for Greek culture, via the creation of colonies and trade routes along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title = Alexander the Great |encyclopedia= Columbia Encyclopedia|publisher= Columbia University Press |location=United States |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Alexandrian empire did not survive its creator's death intact, the cultural implications of the spread of Hellenism across much of the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]] were to prove long lived as Greek became the ''[[lingua franca]]'', a position it retained even in [[Roman era|Roman times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2008|p=xiii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greeks settled in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] cities like [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Seleucia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Ian|title=Growth of the Greek Colonies in the First Millennium BC|date=December 2005|work=Princeton/Stanford Working Papers in Classics|publisher=Princeton/Stanford University|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thousand years later, there are still communities in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], like the [[Kalash people|Kalash]], who claim to be descended from Greek settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2001|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hellenistic civilization]] was the next period of Greek civilization, the beginnings of which are usually placed at Alexander's death.&lt;ref name=Boardman364&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Griffin|Murray|1991|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], so called because it saw the partial [[Hellenization]] of many non-Greek cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arun|first=Neil|title=Alexander's Gulf outpost uncovered|publisher=BBC News|date=7 August 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6930285.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; lasted until the conquest of [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]] by Rome in 30 BC.&lt;ref name=Boardman364/&gt;

This age saw the Greeks move towards larger cities and a reduction in the importance of the city-state. These larger cities were parts of the still larger [[Diadochi|Kingdoms of the Diadochi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1990|loc=Introduction}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BritHel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hellenistic age|date=27 May 2015|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Hellenistic-Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks, however, remained aware of their past, chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the classical authors.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|pp=137–138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with ''[[barbarian]]'' (non-Greek) peoples, which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of the Hellenic ''[[paideia]]'' to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucore|2009|p=51: "The Hellenistic period is commonly portrayed as the great age of Greek scientific discovery, above all in mathematics and astronomy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek]] and [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] kingdoms, [[Greco-Buddhism]] was spreading and Greek missionaries would play an important role in propagating it to [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foltz|2010|pp=43–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, the Greeks of [[Alexandria Eschate]] became known to the [[Chinese people]] as the [[Dayuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burton|1993|pp=244–245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{further|Roman Greece|Greco-Roman relations|Greco-Roman mysteries}}
Between 168 BC and 30 BC, the entire Greek world was conquered by Rome, and almost all of the world's Greek speakers lived as citizens or subjects of the Roman Empire. Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became [[Greco-Roman world|heavily influenced]] by the achievements of Greek culture, hence [[Horace]]'s famous statement: ''Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit'' ("Greece, although captured, took its wild conqueror captive").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zoch|2000|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the centuries following the Roman conquest of the Greek world, the Greek and Roman cultures merged into a single [[Greco-Roman]] culture.

In the religious sphere, this was a period of profound change. The spiritual revolution that took place, saw a waning of the old Greek religion, whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East.&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt; The cults of deities like [[Isis]] and [[Mithra]] were introduced into the Greek world.&lt;ref name=BritHel/&gt;&lt;ref name=BritHelRel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hellenistic religion|date=13 May 2015|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Hellenistic-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|2003|pp=617–618}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably [[Saint Paul]]) were generally Greek-speaking,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunstan|2011|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though none were from Greece. However, Greece itself had a tendency to cling to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makrides|2009|p=206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ethnic distinctions still existed in the [[Roman Empire]], they became secondary to religious considerations and the renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and promoted a robust Roman national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaldellis|2008|pp=35–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early centuries of the [[Common Era]], the Greeks self-identified as Romans ([[Medieval Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ῥωμαῖοι}} ''Rhōmaîoi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howatson|1989|p=264: "From the fourth century AD onwards the Greeks of the eastern Roman empire called themselves Rhomaioi ('Romans')&amp;nbsp;..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the name ''Hellenes'' denoted pagans but was revived as an ethnonym in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three schools of thought regarding this Byzantine Roman identity in contemporary [[Byzantine studies|Byzantine scholarship]]: The first considers "Romanity" the mode of self-identification of the subjects of a multi-ethnic empire at least up to the 12th century, where the average subject identified as Roman; a perennialist approach, which views Romanity as the medieval expression of a continuously existing Greek nation; while a third view considers the eastern Roman identity as a pre-modern national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stouraitis|2014|pp=176, 177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Greeks' essential values were drawn from both Christianity and the Homeric tradition of ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelberg|2012|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burstein&gt;{{harvnb|Burstein|1988|pp=47–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (today conventionally named the ''Byzantine Empire'', a name not used during its own time&lt;ref name=BritByz&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=23 December 2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;) became increasingly influenced by Greek culture after the 7th century when Emperor [[Heraclius]] ({{reign}} 610–641 AD) decided to make Greek the empire's official language.&lt;ref name=Haldon50&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1997|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahid|1972|pp=295–296, 305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Catholic Church]] recognized the Eastern Empire's claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries, after [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]], king of the [[Franks]], as the "[[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]]" on 25 December 800, an act which eventually led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Latin West started to favour the Franks and began to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire largely as the ''Empire of the Greeks'' (''Imperium Graecorum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|2004|p=290 (Note #39)}}; ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'', 389: "Mense lanuario c. epiphaniam Basilii, Graecorum imperatoris, legati cum muneribus et epistolis ad Hludowicum regem Radasbonam venerunt&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fouracre|Gerberding|1996|p=345}}: "The Frankish court no longer regarded the Byzantine Empire as holding valid claims of universality; instead it was now termed the 'Empire of the Greeks'."&lt;/ref&gt; In the eastern Roman Empire the use of the Latinizing term ''Graikoí'' (Γραικοί, "Greeks") was uncommon and nonexistent in official Byzantine political correspondence, prior to the Fourth Crusade of 1204.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|2007|p=96 (including footnote #67)}}; {{harvnb|Makrides|2009|p=74}}; {{harvnb|Magdalino|1991|loc=Chapter XIV: "Hellenism and Nationalism in Byzantium", p. 10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While this Latin term for the ancient ''[[ancient Greeks|Hellenes]]'' could be used neutrally, its use by Westerners from the 9th century onwards in order to challenge Byzantine claims to [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] heritage rendered it a derogatory [[exonym]] for the Byzantines who barely used it, mostly in contexts relating to the West, such as texts relating to the [[Council of Florence]], to present the Western viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Page|2008|pp=66, 87, 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaplanis|2014|pp=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were further strengthened following the fall of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1461, after which and until the second [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]] hundreds of thousands of [[Pontic Greeks]] fled or migrated from the [[Pontic Alps]] and [[Armenian Highlands]] to southern Russia and the Russian [[South Caucasus]] (see also [[Greeks in Russia]], [[Greeks in Armenia]], [[Greeks in Georgia]], and [[Caucasian Greeks]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), and his 'Migration and Settlement in the Caucasus and Anatolia' (Variourum, 1988), and other works listed in [[Caucasian Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[Slavic people|Slavic]] world, the Byzantine Greeks contributed by the dissemination of literacy and Christianity. The most notable example of the later was the work of the two Byzantine Greek brothers, the monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] from the port city of [[Thessalonica]], capital of the [[theme of Thessalonica]], who are credited today with formalizing the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Cyril and Methodius, Saints|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius.aspx#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman Greeks}}
[[File:Basilius Bessarion - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|The Byzantine scholar [[Basilios Bessarion|Basilius Bessarion]] (1395/1403–1472) played a key role in transmitting classical knowledge to the West, contributing to the Renaissance|183x183px]]
Following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the [[Western world|West]], particularly [[Italy]], [[Central Europe]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=BritRen/&gt; Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the [[Ottoman Empire]], due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on [[Western Thrace]] and [[Greek Macedonia]], both in [[Northern Greece]], and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]]) into Ottoman service through the [[devshirme]]. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied [[Yemen]] and [[Algeria]], frequently as provincial governors.

For those that remained under the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], religion was the defining characteristic of national groups (''milletler''), so the [[exonym]] "Greeks" (''Rumlar'' from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], regardless of their language or ethnic origin.&lt;ref name=Mazower/&gt; The [[Greek language|Greek]] speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves ''Romioi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title = History of Europe, The Romans |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=United States |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (''genos'') to be Hellenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mavrocordatos|first=Nicholaos|year=1800|title=Philotheou Parerga|publisher=Grēgorios Kōnstantas (Original from Harvard University Library)|quote=Γένος μεν ημίν των άγαν Ελλήνων}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman [[millet]] system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector, the [[Russian Empire]], or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining [[crypto-Christian]]. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as [[Greek Muslims]]—excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the [[devshirme]]—were to be found in [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Turks]]), [[Greek Macedonia]] (for example among the [[Vallahades]] of western [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]), and among [[Pontic Greeks]] in the [[Pontic Alps]] and [[Armenian Highlands]]. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan [[Selim I|Selim the Grim]] ({{reign}} 1517–1520), whose mother [[Gülbahar Hatun]] was a [[Pontic Greek]].

The roots of Greek success in the Ottoman Empire can be traced to the Greek tradition of education and commerce exemplified in the [[Phanariotes]].&lt;ref name=BritB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Phanariote|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2016|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Phanariote}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821.&lt;ref name=BritMerchant/&gt; Not coincidentally, on the eve of 1821, the three most important centres of Greek learning were situated in [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] and [[Ayvalik|Aivali]], all three major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritMerchant/&gt; Greek success was also favoured by Greek domination of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] church.

===Modern===

The relationship between ethnic Greek identity and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion continued after the creation of the modern Greek nation-state in 1830. According to the second article of the first [[Constitution of Greece|Greek constitution]] of 1822, a Greek was defined as any native Christian resident of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]], a clause removed by 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Constitution of 1822 (Epidaurus)|year=1822|language=Greek|format=PDF|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/syn06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, when the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in 1923, the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange, although most of the Greeks displaced (over a million of the total 1.5 million) had already been driven out by the time the agreement was signed.&lt;ref group=note&gt;While Greek authorities signed the agreement legalizing the population exchange this was done on the insistence of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and after a million Greeks had already been expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] ({{harvnb|Gilbar|1997|p=8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barutciski|2003|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=xi–xv}}; {{harvnb|Hershlag|1980|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Özkırımlı|Sofos|2008|pp=116–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek genocide]], in particular the harsh removal of Pontian Greeks from the southern shore area of the Black Sea, contemporaneous with and following the failed Greek [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Asia Minor Campaign]], was part of this process of [[Turkification]] of the Ottoman Empire and the placement of its economy and trade, then largely in Greek hands under ethnic Turkish control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Üngör|2008|pp=15–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the establishment of the modern Greek nation-state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios. In his "Political Constitution", he addresses to the nation as "the people descendant of the Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;Feraios, Rigas. ''New Political Constitution of the Inhabitants of Rumeli, Asia Minor, the Islands of the Aegean, and the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of Modern Greece|modern Greek state]] was created in 1829, when the Greeks liberated a part of their historic homelands, [[Peloponnese]], from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koliopoulos|Veremis|2002|p=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The large [[Greek diaspora]] and merchant class were instrumental in transmitting the ideas of western [[romantic nationalism]] and [[philhellenism]],&lt;ref name=BritMerchant&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title =History of Greece, Ottoman Empire, The merchant middle class |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=United States |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; which together with the conception of Hellenism, formulated during the last centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], formed the basis of the [[Diafotismos]] and the current conception of Hellenism.&lt;ref name=BritIdent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazower/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=98: "After the Ottoman conquest in 1453, recognition by the Turks of the Greek ''millet'' under its Patriarch and Church helped to ensure the persistence of a separate ethnic identity, which, even if it did not ''produce'' a "precocious nationalism" among the Greeks, provided the later Greek enlighteners and nationalists with a cultural constituency fed by political dreams and apocalyptic prophecies of the recapture of Constantinople and the restoration of Greek Byzantium and its Orthodox emperor in all his glory."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Regions Mainland Greece.png|thumb|right|Map showing the major regions of mainland ancient Greece, and adjacent "barbarian" lands.]]

Greeks and Greek-speakers have used different names to refer to themselves collectively. The term {{em|Achaeans}} (Ἀχαιοί) is one of the [[Names of the Greeks|collective names]] for the Greeks in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' (the Homeric "long-haired Achaeans" would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from {{circa}} 1600 BC until 1100 BC). The other common names are {{em|Danaans}} (Δαναοί) and {{em|Argives}} (Ἀργεῖοι) while {{em|Panhellenes}} (Πανέλληνες) and {{em|Hellenes}} (Ἕλληνες) both [[hapax legomenon|appear only once]] in the ''Iliad'';&lt;ref&gt;See ''Iliad'', II.2.530 for "Panhellenes" and ''Iliad'' II.2.653 for "Hellenes".&lt;/ref&gt; all of these terms were used, synonymously, to denote a common Greek identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartledge|2011|loc=Chapter 4: Argos, p. 23: "The Late Bronze Age in Greece is also called conventionally 'Mycenaean', as we saw in the last chapter.

In the Iliad, the names "Achaeans" and "Danaans" and "Argives" are used synonymously in the sense of Panhellenes = "all Hellenes" = "all Greeks.""}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the historical period, Herodotus identified the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]] of the northern [[Peloponnese]] as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]].

[[Homer]] refers to the "Hellenes" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|iː|n|z}}) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic [[Phthia]], with its warriors under the command of [[Achilleus]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''[[Iliad]]'', 2.681–685&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parian Chronicle]] says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks ({{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}).&lt;ref name="Parian-Chronicle"&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004008.html The Parian Marble, Entry #6]: "From when Hellen [son of] Deuc[alion] became king of [Phthi]otis and those previously called Graekoi were named Hellenes."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[Hellen]], the patriarch of the Hellenes who ruled around Phthia, was the son of [[Pyrrha]] and [[Deucalion]], the only survivors after the [[flood myth|Great Deluge]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus.

===Continuity===
[[File:Funerary stele.jpg|thumb|Family group on a funerary [[stele]] from Athens, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], [[Athens]].]]

The most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language, which has a documented tradition from at least the 14th century BC to the present day, albeit with a break during the [[Greek Dark Ages]] (11th- 8th cent. BC, though the [[Cypriot syllabary]] was in use during this period).&lt;ref name=Adrados&gt;{{harvnb|Adrados|2005|pp=xii, 3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars compare its continuity of tradition to [[Chinese language|Chinese]] alone.&lt;ref name=Adrados/&gt;&lt;ref name="Browning"&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1983|p=vii: "The Homeric poems were first written down in more or less their present form in the seventh century B.C.

In ancient times, the trading and colonizing activities of the Greek tribes and city states spread the Greek culture, religion and language around the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins, especially in [[Magna Graecia|Sicily and southern Italy]] (also known as [[Magna Grecia]]), Spain, the [[History of Marseille|south of France]] and the [[Pontian Greeks|Black sea coasts]].&lt;ref name=Apoikiai&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1984|pp=199–289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Alexander the Great's empire and successor states, Greek and Hellenizing ruling classes were established in the [[Seleucid Kingdom|Middle East]], [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|India]] and in [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Apoikiai/&gt; The [[Hellenistic period]] is characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization that established Greek cities and kingdoms in [[Dayuan|Asia]] and [[Cyrene, Libya|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horden|Purcell|2000|pp=111, 128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Roman Empire, easier movement of people spread Greeks across the Empire and in the eastern territories, Greek became the [[lingua franca]] rather than [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=Haldon50/&gt; The modern-day [[Griko people|Griko community]] of southern Italy, numbering about 60,000,&lt;ref name="Grecia-Salentina"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bellinello/&gt; may represent a living remnant of the ancient Greek populations of Italy.

====Modern====
[[File:Distribution Of Races 1918 National Geographic.jpg|thumb|280px|Distribution of ethnic groups in 1918, National Geographic]]
During and after the [[Greek War of Independence]], Greeks of the diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state, raising funds and awareness abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calotychos|2003|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the Mediterranean (notably Marseilles in [[Greeks in France|France]], Livorno in [[Greeks in Italy|Italy]], Alexandria in [[Greeks in Egypt|Egypt]]), [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] ([[Odessa]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]), and [[British Greeks|Britain]] (London and Liverpool) from where they traded, typically in textiles and grain.&lt;ref name=Diaspora&gt;{{harvnb|McCabe|Harlaftis|2005|pp=147–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses frequently comprised the extended family, and with them they brought schools teaching Greek and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Diaspora/&gt;

As markets changed and they became more established, some families grew their operations to become [[Greek shipping|shippers]], financed through the local Greek community, notably with the aid of the [[Ralli Brothers|Ralli]] or [[Panayis Athanase Vagliano|Vagliano Brothers]].&lt;ref name=Kardasis&gt;{{harvnb|Kardasis|2001|pp=xvii–xxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With economic success, the Diaspora expanded further across the [[Greeks in Syria|Levant]], North Africa, India and the USA.&lt;ref name=Kardasis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clogg&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2000|loc="The Greeks in America"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many Greeks left their traditional homelands for economic reasons resulting in large migrations from Greece and Cyprus to the [[Greek American|United States]], Great Britain, Australia, Canada, [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]], and [[Greeks in South Africa|South Africa]], especially after the [[Second World War]] (1939–1945), the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949), and the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laliotou|2004|pp=85–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Greek language}}
[[File:NAMA Alphabet grec.jpg|thumb|right|Early Greek alphabet, c. 8th century BC]]
Most Greeks speak the [[Greek language]], an [[Hellenic languages|independent branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages]], with its closest relations possibly being [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (see [[Graeco-Armenian]]) or the [[Indo-Iranian languages]] (see [[Graeco-Aryan]]).&lt;ref name=Adrados/&gt; It has the longest documented history of any living language and [[Greek literature]] has a continuous history of over 2,500 years.&lt;ref name=BritLit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Greek-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest inscriptions in Greek are in the [[Linear B]] script, dated as far back as 1450 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aegeanscripts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:new-linear-b-tablet-found-at-iklaina&amp;catid=80&amp;Itemid=473|title=New Linear B tablet found at Iklaina|publisher=Comité International Permanent des Études Mycéniennes, UNESCO|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Greek Dark Ages]], from which written records are absent, the [[Greek alphabet]] appears in the 9th-8th century BC. The Greek alphabet derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], but is considered the first true alphabet as it is the first to have explicit symbols for vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/00438243.1986.9979978| jstor = 124703| last = Millard | first = A. R.| year = 1986| title = The Infancy of the Alphabet| journal = World Archaeology| volume = 17| issue = 3| pages = 390–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek alphabet in turn is the parent alphabet of the [[Latin]], [[Cyrillic]], and several other alphabets. The earliest Greek literary works are the [[Homer|Homeric epics]], variously dated from the 8th to the 6th century BC. Notable scientific and mathematical works include  [[Euclid's Elements]], Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], and others. The [[New Testament]] was originally written in [[Koine Greek]].

Greek demonstrates several linguistic features that are shared with other [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkan languages]], such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Eastern Romance languages]] (see [[Balkan sprachbund]]), and has absorbed many foreign words, primarily of Western European and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winford|2003|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the movements of [[Philhellenism]] and the [[Diafotismos]] in the 19th century, which emphasized the modern Greeks' ancient heritage, these foreign influences were excluded from official use via the creation of [[Katharevousa]], a somewhat artificial form of Greek purged of all foreign influence and words, as the official language of the Greek state. In 1976, however, the [[Hellenic Parliament]] voted to make the spoken [[Dimotiki]] the official language, making Katharevousa obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|1990|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern Greek]] has, in addition to Standard Modern Greek or Dimotiki, a wide [[Varieties of Modern Greek|variety of dialects]] of varying levels of mutual intelligibility, including [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot]], [[Pontic language|Pontic]], [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]], [[Griko language|Griko]] and [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] (the only surviving representative of ancient [[Doric Greek]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomić|2006|p=703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yevanic language|Yevanic]] is the language of the [[Romaniotes]], and survives in small communities in Greece, New York and Israel. In addition to Greek, many Greeks in Greece and the Diaspora are bilingual in other languages or dialects such as English, [[Arvanitika]]/[[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Slavic dialects of Greece|Macedonian Slavic]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and Turkish.&lt;ref name=Adrados/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1984|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks of the Classical and Hellenistic eras made seminal contributions to science and philosophy, laying the foundations of several western scientific traditions, such as [[Greek astronomy|astronomy]], [[geography]], [[historiography]], [[Greek mathematics|mathematics]], [[Greek medicine|medicine]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]], [[Alexandria]] and other centers of Greek learning, while Byzantine science was essentially a continuation of classical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Byzantine Medicine — Vienna Dioscurides|work=Antiqua Medicina|year=2007|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=10 May 2016|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/byzantine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in ''paideia'' (education).&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; ''Paideia'' was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the [[Fall of Constantinople|city's fall]] to the Ottomans in 1453.&lt;ref name=Bump&gt;{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Jerome|title=The Origin of Universities (University of Magnaura in Constantinople)|accessdate=19 December 2008|work=The Origin of Universities|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|deadurl=yes|archivedate=20 February 2009|url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220164836/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Constantinople]] was Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatakes|Moutafakis|2003|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students, the world's first university as well.&lt;ref name=Bump/&gt;

===Symbols===
{{See also|Flag of Greece}}
[[File:Flag of the Greek Orthodox Church.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|The flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] is based on the coat of arms of the [[Palaiologoi]], the last dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]].]]
[[File:Greek Independence 1821.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Traditional Greek flag.]]

The most widely used symbol is the [[flag of Greece]], which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto ''[[Eleftheria i Thanatos]]'' (Freedom or Death), which was the motto of the [[Greek War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papadakis|1995|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross, which represents [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodoxy]]. The Greek flag is widely used by the [[Greek Cypriots]], although [[Cyprus]] has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] minority (see [[flag of Cyprus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.gr/en/shmaia.htm |title=The Flag |accessdate=19 December 2008 |work=Law 851, Gov. Gazette 233, issue A, dated 21/22.12.1978 |publisher=Presidency of the Hellenic Republic |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015001727/http://www.presidency.gr/en/shmaia.htm |archivedate=15 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-1978 (and first) flag of Greece, which features a [[Cross|Greek cross]] (''crux immissa quadrata'') on a blue background, is widely used as an alternative to the official flag, and they are often flown together. The [[national emblem of Greece]] features a blue [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] with a white cross surrounded by two laurel branches. A common design involves the current flag of Greece and the pre-1978 flag of Greece with crossed flagpoles and the national emblem placed in front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Older Flags: 19 December 2008|work=Flags of the Greeks|publisher=Skafidas Zacharias|url=http://users.att.sch.gr/zskafid/simea5a.htm}} [Note: Website contains image of the 1665 original for the current Greek flag.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another highly recognizable and popular Greek symbol is the [[Flag of Greece#Double-headed eagle|double-headed eagle]], the imperial emblem of the last dynasty of the Eastern Roman Empire and a common symbol in [[Asia Minor]] and, later, [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grierson|Bellinger|1999|loc="Eagles", pp. 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not part of the modern Greek flag or coat-of-arms, although it is officially the insignia of the [[Greek Army]] and the flag of the [[Church of Greece]]. It had been incorporated in the Greek coat of arms between 1925 and 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Byzantine Flags|work=Byzantine Heraldry|publisher=François Velde|year=1997|accessdate=13 May 2016|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/byzantin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surnames and personal names===
{{see also|Greek name|Ancient Greek personal names}}

Greek surnames began to appear in the 9th and 10th century, at first among ruling families, eventually supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father's name as disambiguator.&lt;ref name=Wickham&gt;{{harvnb|Wickham|2005|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicon"/&gt; Nevertheless, Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics,&lt;ref name=Wickham/&gt; such those ending in the suffix ''-opoulos'' or ''-ides'', while others derive from trade professions, physical characteristics, or a location such as a town, village, or monastery.&lt;ref name="lexicon"/&gt; Commonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine [[proper nouns]] in the [[nominative case]]. Occasionally (especially in Cyprus), some surnames end in ''-ou'', indicating the [[genitive case]] of a patronymic name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fong|2004|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many surnames end in suffixes that are associated with a particular region, such as ''-akis'' (Crete), ''-eas'' or ''-akos'' ([[Mani Peninsula]]), ''-atos'' (island of [[Cephalonia]]), and so forth.&lt;ref name="lexicon"/&gt; In addition to a Greek origin, some surnames have Turkish or Latin/Italian origin, especially among Greeks from [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Ionian Islands]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koliopoulos|1987|p=xii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Female surnames end in a vowel and are usually the genitive form of the corresponding males surname, although this usage is not followed in the diaspora, where the male version of the surname is generally used.

With respect to personal names, the two main influences are Christianity and classical Hellenism; ancient Greek nomenclatures were never forgotten but have become more widely bestowed from the 18th century onwards.&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transition of Modern Greek Names|work=Lexicon of Greek Personal Names|publisher=Oxford University|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/modern.html|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in antiquity, children are customarily named after their grandparents, with the first born male child named after the paternal grandfather, the second male child after the maternal grandfather, and similarly for female children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naming practices|work=Lexicon of Greek Personal Names|publisher=Oxford University|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/practices.html|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal names are often familiarized by a diminutive suffix, such as ''-akis'' for male names and ''-itsa'' or ''-oula'' for female names.&lt;ref name="lexicon"/&gt; Greeks generally do not use middle names, instead using the genitive of the father's first name as a middle name. This usage has been passed on to the [[Russian names|Russians]] and other [[East Slavs]] ([[otchestvo]]).

===Sea===
{{Main|Greek shipping}}
[[File:Aristotle Onassis.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Aristotle Onassis]], the best known Greek shipping magnate.]]
The traditional Greek homelands have been the Greek peninsula and the Aegean Sea, [[Southern Italy]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), the [[Black Sea]], the [[Ionia|Ionian coasts]] of [[Asia Minor]] and the islands of [[Cyprus]] and [[Sicily]]. In Plato's ''[[Phaedo|Phaidon]]'', Socrates remarks, "we (Greeks) live around a sea like frogs around a pond" when describing to his friends the Greek cities of the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Phaidon'', 109c: "ὥσπερ περὶ τέλμα μύρμηκας ἢ βατράχους περὶ τὴν θάλατταν οἰκοῦντας."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harl&gt;{{harvnb|Harl|1996|p=260: "Cities employed the coins of an empire that formed a community of cities encircling the Mediterranean Sea, which Romans audaciously called "Our Sea" (''mare nostrum''). "We live around a sea like frogs around a pond" was how Socrates, so Plato tells us, described to his friends the Hellenic cities of the Aegean in the late fifth century B.C."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image is attested by the map of the Old Greek Diaspora, which corresponded to the Greek world until the creation of the [[Greece|Greek state]] in 1832. The [[sea]] and trade were natural outlets for Greeks since the Greek peninsula is rocky and does not offer good prospects for agriculture.&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt;

Notable Greek seafarers include people such as [[Pytheas]] of Marseilles, [[Scylax of Caryanda]] who sailed to Iberia and beyond, [[Nearchus]], the 6th century merchant and later monk [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] (''Cosmas who Sailed to India'') and the explorer of the Northwestern Passage, Apostolos Valerianos also known as [[Juan de Fuca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pletcher|2013}}; {{harvnb|Casson|1991|p=124}}; {{harvnb|Winstedt|1909|pp=1–3}}; {{harvnb|Withey|1989|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times, the Byzantine Greeks plied the sea-lanes of the Mediterranean and controlled trade until an embargo imposed by the [[Byzantine emperor]] on trade with the [[Caliphate]] opened the door for the later Italian pre-eminence in trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001|pp=30–32}}; {{harvnb|Postan|Miller|Postan|1987|pp=132–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek shipping tradition recovered during Ottoman rule when a substantial merchant middle class developed, which played an important part in the Greek War of Independence.&lt;ref name=BritIdent/&gt; Today, Greek shipping continues to prosper to the extent that Greece has the largest merchant fleet in the world, while many more ships under Greek ownership fly [[flags of convenience]].&lt;ref name=EconWorld/&gt; The most notable shipping [[magnate]] of the 20th century was [[Aristotle Onassis]], others being [[Yiannis Latsis]], [[George Livanos]], and [[Stavros Niarchos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blyth |first=Myrna |title=Greek Tragedy: The life of Aristotle Onassis |work=National Review Online |date=12 August 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2008 |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDRjYzJhMWI5ZjE3ZmNmOWQ0YWEyNjBkYmI1MjhiODI= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207011737/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDRjYzJhMWI5ZjE3ZmNmOWQ0YWEyNjBkYmI1MjhiODI%3D |archivedate=7 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Helena|title=Callas takes centre stage again as exhibition recalls Onassis's life|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=13 May 2016|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/06/arts.artsnews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, they also had some ancestry from the 'east', related to populations of the [[peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] and [[Iranic peoples|Iran]]" as well as "some ancestry from the "north", related to hunter-gatherers of [[eastern Europe]] and [[Siberia]] and also to the Bronze Age [[Eurasian nomads|people of the steppe]]", and argues that "some had theorized that the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations were influenced both culturally and genetically by the old civilizations of the [[Levant]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], but there is no quantifiable genetic influence".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Lindemann, [https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/dna-analysis-traces-origins-of-minoans-and-mycenaeans DNA analysis traces origins of Minoans and Mycenaeans], [[ResearchGate]], 2nd August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
A study from 2013 for prediction of hair and eye colour from DNA of the Greek people showed that the self-reported phenotype frequencies according to hair and eye colour categories was as follows: 119 individuals – hair colour, 11 [[blond]], 45 dark blond/light brown, 49 dark brown, 3 brown red/auburn and 11 had black hair; eye colour, 13 with [[blue]], 15 with intermediate (green, heterochromia) and 91 had brown eye colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2013|pp=98–115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from 2012 included 150 dental school students from the [[University of Athens]], and the results of the study showed that light hair colour (blonde/light ash brown) was predominant in 10.7% of the students. 36% had medium hair colour (light brown/medium darkest brown), 32% had darkest brown and 21% black (15.3 off black, 6% midnight black). In conclusion, the hair colour of young Greeks are mostly brown, ranging from light to dark brown with significant minorities having black and blonde hair. The same study also showed that the eye colour of the students was 14.6% blue/green, 28% medium (light brown) and 57.4% dark brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lagouvardos|Tsamali|Papadopoulou|Polyzois|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
The history of the Greek people is closely associated with the history of Greece, Cyprus, Constantinople, Asia Minor and the Black Sea. During the Ottoman rule of Greece, a number of Greek enclaves around the Mediterranean were cut off from the core, notably in Southern Italy, the Caucasus, Syria and Egypt. By the early 20th century, over half of the overall [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking population was settled in Asia Minor (now Turkey), while later that century a huge wave of migration to the United States, Australia, Canada and elsewhere created the modern Greek diaspora.

'''Hans-Joachim Roedelius''' (born 26 October 1934) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] musician. He is best known as a co-founder of the [[krautrock]] groups [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]] and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]] and for his work in the ambient jazz trio [[Aquarello]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Roedelius was born on 26 October 1934 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baden bei Wien - Stadt der Musik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=few8AQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Kral|language=German|isbn=978-3-902447-23-4|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he acted in [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] films such as  ''"Verklungene Melodie"'' (''[[Dead Melody]]'', 1938), "Es leuchten die Sterne" etc..{{Cn|date=March 2018}} He was an unwilling member of the [[Deutsches Jungvolk|German Youngsters in  the Hitler Youth]], membership being mandatory for all boys from the age of ten.

=== Kluster, Cluster and Harmonia ===
In 1968 Roedelius co-founded the music commune known as "Human Being" and co-formed [[Zodiak Free Arts Lab]], the center of Berlin's Underground Culture at the time, with conceptual artist [[Conrad Schnitzler]]. He met [[Dieter Moebius]] at the Zodiak. In 1969 Roedelius, Schnitzler and Moebius formed [[Kluster]]. In 1971 Schnitzler left the group to start a long-running solo career and Moebius and Roedelius anglicised the band's name to ''Cluster''. At first Cluster worked along the same lines as their parent group, signed first to [[Philips Records|Philips]] then to [[Brain Records|Brain]].

In 1973 Roedelius and Moebius worked with [[Neu!]] guitarist [[Michael Rother]] for the first time. Rother helped to co-produce their third album, ''[[Zuckerzeit]]'', providing his recording machinery. This album moved the band's style further from avant-garde 'noise' to a more melodic music, similar to modern-day [[Trance Music|trance]].  Roedelius, Moebius and Rother toured [[Germany]] and the [[Low Countries]] as a trio from early 1973 and decided to record an album together under the name of ''Harmonia''. ''[[Musik Von Harmonia]]'' was released on the back of a huge publicity campaign by Brain. Harmonia released one further album initially, 1975's ''[[Deluxe (Harmonia album)|Deluxe]]''. British musician [[Brian Eno]], a fan of both Cluster and Harmonia, joined them for several jams, the result of which was released in 1997 as ''[[Harmonia &amp; Eno - Tracks and Traces|Tracks &amp; Traces]]''. Rother left Harmonia to pursue his solo career and Cluster returned to the studio to record ''[[Sowiesoso]]'' which was released on [[Sky Records]]. Brian Eno, who had returned to Germany to work with [[David Bowie]], worked on two albums with Cluster: 1977's ''[[Cluster &amp; Eno]]'' and 1978's ''[[After the Heat]]'', the latter of which gained the band much attention in the British music press. A further Cluster album produced by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann ''[[Grosses Wasser|Großes Wasser]]'' extended Cluster's music into long form.

=== Solo career ===
Roedelius' solo career began with ''[[Durch die Wüste]]'' in 1978 and then ''[[Jardin Au Fou]]'' in 1979. This album laid down Roedelius' future style: melodic piano and (often faked) acoustic instruments played with a sharp tinge of electronics. The first of the lengthy ''Selbstportrait'' series was released in 1979, being material done beside  his work with Cluster and Harmonia, without the input of his collaborators. Recorded on only two tracks, the Selbstportraits make up the backbone of Roedelius' early solo recordings. Leaving Sky in 1982, his work took a more [[New-age music|new-age]] style as he signed to [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s ''Venture'' sub-label. During this period, his best selling solo album ''[[Geschenk des Augenblicks – Gift of the Moment]]'' was released.

He was dropped by Venture in 1989 and began releasing on a variety of small labels, notably ''[[Multimood Records|Multimood]]''  and ''[[Prudence (record label)|Prudence]]''. He began to venture into the newly emerging genre of [[techno]], starting with 1991's ''[[Der Ohrenspiegel]]'', whose 25-minute opener, ''Reflectorum'' displays some of the characteristics of the later ''Sinfonia Contempora'' series. By 1994 Roedelius' style was a heady mix of amateur electronics and [[ambient music|ambient]] jazz. An album from this year; ''[[Theatreworks (Roedelius album)|Theatreworks]]'', was rewarded with the title "album of the month" by experimental music magazine ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''. Arguably the biggest turning point in Roedelius' career came in 1994 as well. The release of ''[[Sinfonia Contempora No. 1: Von Zeit zu Zeit]]'' marked, in Roedelius' own words, "Since the beginning of my career nothing was more important to me than to find my own musical language. I have, so I believe, eventually found it." The album consists of mismatched tape fragments (from numerous jams ranging from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties) multitracked over the top of each other to create a disjointed but oddly musical sound.

''[[Sinfonia Contempora No. 2: La Nordica (Salz Des Nordens)]]'' was released in 1996, making for a much more sinister and mysterious sound than its predecessor. Also released in this period was ''[[Selbstportrait VI: The Diary of the Unforgotten]]'', the first of the modern ''Selbstportraits''. Now, rather than merely remastering the seventies tapes, Roedelius also played over them, the sound montage ''Homage á Forst'' samples many Harmonia and Cluster tracks into the mix.

=== Reformation of Cluster ===
In the meantime, Cluster had reformed. 1990's ''[[Apropos Cluster]]'' was an update for the band, being a work of avant-techno not dissimilar in style to ''Großes Wasser''. In 1996 Cluster embarked on two international tours, one of Japan and one of America. Both tours would be summarised on the following years live albums. The new sound of Cluster learns from the ''Sinfonia Contempora'' sound whilst adding Moebius' distinctive sound.

=== 21st century: solo work and collaborations ===
The turn of the century was Roedelius' most productive year, with no fewer than eight albums being released between 2000 and 2001. Reprising the ''Selbstportrait'' series for the seventh time in 2000, Roedelius composed entirely new tracks for the first time on ''[[Selfportrait VII: dem Wind voran – ahead of the wind]]''. The new millennium also saw Roedelius begin to work with other, usually younger, musicians than he had done since the late eighties.

Another series is ''Lieder vom Steinfeld''. Begun in 1995, Roedelius recites poems over these pieces, primarily in his native German language. In 2001 Roedelius worked with Conrad Schnitzler again for the first time since 1971. The record "Acon I"has been released in Japan by "Capt.Trip-Records ''.

Roedelius had been growing substantially in fame since Cluster began touring again in 1996. He is often cited by electronic musicians and releases several albums a year, many of which are collaborations with modern musicians who are fans. He works extensively with [[Tim Story (composer)|Tim Story]] and released [[Fibre (album)|Fibre]] recorded with Jez Coad, Martin Barker and Georg Taylor an album which has reached 13th place in "the Third Uncut Playlist of 2009" for [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut Magazine]], ahead of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[Working on a Dream]]''. In 2009 Hans Joachim Roedelius recorded "Sustanza di Cose Sperata" with the pianist and composer [[Alessandra Celletti]] for the American label [[Transparency Record]]. Together they played in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/roedelius-celle/|title=Roedelius &amp; Celletti in New York City for rare concert (in support of new Transparency Records album)|website=BrooklynVegan|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Qluster ===
In November 2010 it was announced that Cluster had split up for the third time. In the official announcement, the split up was described as [[Dieter Moebius|Moebius]] leaving the group. In the wake of this news, Roedelius announced that he was beginning a new project called Qluster, to follow on from Cluster and [[Kluster]]. The band is made up of Roedelius and accomplished electronic musician [[Onnen Bock]] with third member Armin Metz and released a trilogy consisting of "''Rufen''", "''Fragen''" and "''Antworten''" (''Calling'', ''Asking'' and ''Answering'') in 2011. The then released a recording of a live concert made at CTM-Festival in Berlin, titled "Lauschen" ( Listening ).Roedelius began to collaborate with Stefan Schneider from the groups "torococorot" and "Kreidler", with Christoph H.Mueller mastermind of the "Gotan-Project"( and recently "Plaza Francia" ), with
Christopher James Chaplin, Leon Muraglia, Lloyd Cole, Jurij Novoselic ( with whom he's doing work since the early ninentees anywayway) and lately with Arnold Kasar and Frank Wiedemann.

'''Henry Davies''' (1753 &amp;ndash; 9 May 1825) was a Welsh Baptist minister.&lt;ref name="WBO"/&gt; His family lived in the [[Letterston]] area of [[Pembrokeshire]], where he trained to work as a shoemaker. He attended services at the local chapel, and in 1775 began to preach at Letterston, before, in 1780, being ordained a joint pastor of [[Llangloffan]] (a position which he held for forty-five years). After marrying, he lived as a farmer on a farm at Pencerrig near [[Fishguard]].

Unfortunately, when the French landed near [[Fishguard]] in 1797, the invaders raided his farm, but, despite this, he was charged with ‘collaboration.’ The charge was later dropped, but his effigy was burnt by demonstrators at [[Fishguard]] Fair in February 1798.

He died in 1825, in his early seventies, and was buried in Hermon burial ground, Fishguard.&lt;ref name="WBO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Davies|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-HEN-1753.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''House of Rock''''' is a satirical [[animation]] that aired on the UK's [[Channel 4]] from 2000 to 2002. It revolved around the afterlives of some of the world's most famous dead rock stars, including [[Freddie Mercury]], [[John Denver]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Marc Bolan]]. Bolan was replaced in the second series by [[John Lennon]]. Forced to share a house in [[limbo]], they try to cope with isolation, clashing personalities and relentless boredom.

The show aired as part of Channel 4's late-night 4 Music. Often, segments of the episode would appear as links between videos, reminiscent of [[Beavis and Butthead]]. On average, each episode from the first series was 5 minutes long, while each episode from the second series was 10 minutes long.

The characters occupy a huge rundown house in a bleak, depressing landscape with nothing around seemingly for miles. Much of the comedy comes from each character's frustrations with their surroundings, associates and inability to do anything further now they're dead.

==Characters==

===Freddie Mercury===
Extremely theatrical and flamboyant, Freddie is highly strung and quick to anger. He openly despises all of his housemates, especially the Notorious B.I.G. He keeps a cat called Galileo.

===John Denver===
The group's only optimist, John is sweet and naïve, convinced there is some hope of emerging from limbo. As such he is constantly abused and berated by other more cynical housemates. His love of peace has led him to severely suppress his anger. John can often be heard using phrases used in ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', such as "jinkies!"

===Kurt Cobain===
Paranoid and depressed, Kurt is so tired of life he owns a pad of pre-printed suicide notes that he can stick anywhere like [[Post-it notes]]. Nevertheless, he is quite friendly, especially with Biggie and John. Kurt's dream is to be series champion on the UK gameshow ''[[Fifteen to One]]''.

===The Notorious B.I.G.===
Known as "Biggie" within the house, Notorious is especially depressed with limbo, since he has had to leave all the trappings of his [[Hip hop culture|hip-hop]] lifestyle behind. Sometimes his sexual frustration is so great he has to take it out on the house's postman, a constantly shuddering [[Sid Vicious]]. He cannot stand Freddie Mercury, and would have shot him long ago if his gun was capable of doing anything.

===Marc Bolan===
The house's resident [[hippie]], elfin Marc is only capable of talking in [[wiktionary:Twee|twee]] rhyming couplets in the style of his lyrics. Frustrated with his hippie sensibilities and feyness, when Satan [[Davina McCall]] demands one of their number join her in hell ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' style, the group agree on Marc. They are then horrified to discover his replacement is the peace-and-love obsessed John Lennon.

===John Lennon===
John pompous and pretentious, with a droning Scouse voice. He comes with his own Yellow Submarine, which he wears around his waist at all times.

'''Abu Musa Isa ibn al-Shaykh ibn al-Salil al-Dhuhli al-Shaybani''' (died 882/83) was an [[Arab]] leader of the [[Shayban (tribe)|Shayban]] tribe. Taking advantage of the [[Anarchy at Samarra|domestic turmoil]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], he created a semi-independent [[bedouin]] state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and southern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] in ca. 867–870, before an Abbasid army forced him to exchange his domains with the governorship of [[Arminiya|Armenia]] and [[Diyar Bakr]]. In Armenia, he struggled to contain the rising power of the Christian princes, but after failing to suppress the revolt of one of his own subordinates, he abandoned the country and returned to his native [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]]. There he spent his last years until his death in a struggle with a rival strongman, the ruler of [[Mosul]] [[Ishaq ibn Kundajiq]].

==Life==
Isa's early life is obscure. He was a member of the [[Shayban (tribe)|Shayban]] tribe from the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], but otherwise not even the exact name of his father is known, it being variously given as al-Shaykh, Ahmad or Abd al-Razzak.&lt;ref name="EI2-88"&gt;Canard (1978), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Isa first appears in 848, in the ranks of the [[Abbasid]] army under [[Bugha al-Sharabi]] that was sent against the rebel [[Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith]] in his stronghold of [[Marand]]. Muhammad and most of his followers belonged to the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribal group, the same that the Shayban were part of. Consequently Bugha employed Isa as an envoy to the rebels, and Isa managed to convince several among them to surrender.&lt;ref name="EI2-88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb38"&gt;Cobb (2001), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career in Syria and Palestine===
[[File:Syria in the 9th century.svg|thumb|250px|Map of medieval Syria (''[[Bilad al-Sham]]'') under the Abbasid Caliphate]]
It has been suggested that Isa served as governor of [[Damascus]] in 861, but according to [[Marius Canard]] this is a confusion with [[Isa ibn Muhammad al-Nawshari]]. In 865, according to [[al-Tabari]], he defeated and captured a [[Kharijite]] rebel named al-Muwaffaq.&lt;ref name="EI2-88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb38"/&gt; At the time, he held a post in [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], since al-Tabari records him asking for aid from the Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] in preparing a raid against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], including four ships to be set ready in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1978), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably already governor of [[Jund Filastin]] (Palestine) district at the time, a post which he seems to have held, according to [[Ya'qubi]], at the time of the deposition of Caliph [[al-Musta'in]] in January 866.&lt;ref name="Cobb38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EI2-89"&gt;Canard (1978), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ya'qubi, Isa was one of the governors who refused to immediately acknowledge the new Caliph, [[al-Mu'tazz]], perhaps because his old patron Bugha still remained loyal to al-Musta'in. This led al-Nawshari to campaign against him, and the two armies clashed by the [[Jordan River]]. Al-Nawshari's son was killed, but Isa was defeated and fled to Egypt with what wealth he could gather, while al-Nawshari occupied the capital of Palestine, [[Ramla]].&lt;ref name="Cobb38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt; In Egypt, Isa finally conceded the oath of loyalty (''[[bay'ah]]'') to al-Mu'tazz, while al-Nawshari in his turn fell out with the Caliph, who had not sanctioned his seizure of Ramla and dispatched an army under Muhammad ibn al-Muwallad to drive him out. Isa then returned to Palestine, bringing with him money, supplies, and possibly troops recruited in Egypt, and built a fortress called al-Husami, situated between Ramla and [[Lod|Ludd]]. From this base, he managed to withstand the repeated attacks of Ibn al-Muwallad, until—probably after a truce was agreed—both returned to the caliphal capital, [[Samarra]].&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cobb (2001), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

There, in December 866, Isa secured his re-appointment to the governorship of both Palestine and the province of Jordan (''[[Jund al-Urdunn]]''). Al-Tabari attributes this to the influence of Bugha al-Sharabi, whom he bribed with 40,000 [[gold dinar]]s, while [[al-Mas'udi]] claims that this was because of the riches he brought with him from Egypt, as well as 70 [[Alids]] who had fled from the [[Hijaz]].&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb39"&gt;Cobb (2001), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He did not immediately return to Palestine, instead sending his lieutenant Abu'l-Maghra' ibn Musa ibn Zurara there as his deputy. When he finally arrived in Ramla, Isa used the ongoing [[Anarchy at Samarra|anarchy in Iraq]] to set himself up as a virtually independent ruler. He kept the province's revenues for himself, and even intercepted the tax caravans from Egypt. He then used this money to secure the loyalty of the local Arab tribes, the Rabi'a in the north and the [[Banu Kilab]] in the south, with whom he even formed a marriage alliance, marrying a Kilabi wife. Soon, his nascent Bedouin state was strong enough that he took control of Damascus itself.&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gil300"&gt;Gil (1997), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

When Caliph [[al-Muhtadi]] ascended the throne in July 869, he offered a general amnesty, and wrote to Isa, offering a pardon in exchange for him handing over the treasure he had wrongfully appropriated, according to [[Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Kindi|al-Kindi]] amounting to a sum of 750,000 dinars. When Isa refused, the Caliph ordered the new governor of Egypt, [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], to march against him. Ibn Tulun complied, but no sooner had he reached [[Arish]] with his army orders came to turn back. In 870, the new Caliph, [[al-Mu'tamid]], again sent envoys to Isa to persuade him to return the money, but Isa again refused, and an army under the Turk [[Amajur al-Turki]], who was named governor of Damascus. Initially based in Tyre, Isa managed to push back Amajur's numerically much inferior forces—al-Tabari reports that Isa had 20,000 men while Amajur only 200–400—to Damascus, but in a battle before the city Isa's son al-Mansur fell, and he was defeated and he was forced to withdraw to Ramla. Instead of an army there came a new embassy from the Caliph (in 870 or 871), offering him the governorship of [[Arminiya|Armenia]] if he would abandon Syria. Isa agreed, and left for his new post in May 871.&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gil300"/&gt;

===In Armenia and the Jazira===
[[File:81ArabAbbasidPeriod750-885.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Transcaucasia]] under Muslim rule: the province of Armenia–Azerbaijan]]
The governorship of Armenia included not only [[Armenian Highland|Armenia proper]], but also [[Arran (Caucasus)|Azerbaijan]] and the [[Diyar Bakr]] in the Jazira,&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt; the latter being the main settlement area of the Shayban and Isa's own homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), pp. 25–26, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his appointment, Isa (called "Yise, son of Šeh" by Armenian sources) was approached by the [[Uthmanids]] and the [[Kaysites]], local dynasties of Arab emirs established around [[Lake Van]], who were threatened by the rise of the Christian Armenian ruler [[Ashot Artsruni]], prince of [[Vaspurakan]]. Ashot was preparing to besiege the Uthmanid fortress of Amiwk, when Isa assembled a league of the emirs of Armenia, and with 15,000 men came to Vaspurakan. Unable to confront these numbers, the [[Artsruni]] backed down and concluded a peace with Isa.&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Isa's situation in Armenia was precarious, however, as he was without any hope of support from the Abbasid government. Armenia was effectively left to its own devices, and the two great Christian dynasties of the Artsruni in the south and the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] in the north effectively partitioned the country and acted as independent princes. This necessitated a careful balancing act by Isa, who could not afford to alienate the various Armenian rulers, especially after his lieutenant in Azerbaijan, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahid al-Tamimi al-Yamami, rebelled in 877. Isa besieged Muhammad in the provincial capital, [[Bardha'a]], but despite receiving aid from [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot Bagratuni]] (the future [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|King of Armenia]]), after 13 months of fruitless siege he was forced to abandon it. Isa then departed Armenia altogether, returning to [[Amid]] in the Diyar Bakr. Although regarded by the Armenian and Arab historians as nominal governor of Armenia until his death in 882/3, he never again left the Jazira.&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), with its provinces, in medieval times]]
In the Jazira, he faced a major rival in the person of the Turk [[Ishaq ibn Kundajiq]], who ruled [[Mosul]] and had ambitions to govern all of the Jazira. Isa and his long-time lieutenant, Abu'l-Maghra', allied with other enemies of Ibn Kundajiq, the local Kharijites under a certain Ishaq ibn Ayyub and the [[Taghlib]]i chieftain [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]].&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt; This coalition managed to defeat Ibn Kindajiq, but the latter's position was soon bolstered by receiving appointment by the Caliph as governor of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] and Armenia (879/80), although he never seems to have exercised any authority over the latter. The Shaybanids then offered peace on the basis of maintaining the territorial ''status quo'', and in exchange for an annual tribute of 200,000 dinars.&lt;ref name="EI2-89"/&gt;

Ibn Kundajiq initially accepted, but in 880/1 the coalition against him was renewed, and open warfare broke out. This time, Ibn Kundajiq was victorious in a battle fought in April/May 881, driving his opponents before him to Amid, which he left under siege. A few inconclusive skirmishes followed, and the situation was not resolved by the time of Isa's death in 882/3, as Ibn Kundajiq became involved in the Abbasid efforts to recover Syria from the [[Tulunids]].&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1978), pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Isa was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani|Ahmad]], who ruled the Diyar Bakr as an independent prince. Ahmad expanded his territory into southern Armenia, and, after Ibn Kundajiq's death in 891/2, occupied even Mosul. In the next year, however, the resurgent Abbasids under Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] wrested the city from him, and in 899 the rest of the family's Jaziran domains from Ahmad's heir, [[Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani|Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="EI2-90"&gt;Canard (1978), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
As "rulers by usurpation" (''ʿalā sabīl al-taghallub''), Isa and his son Ahmad are judged harshly by contemporary Muslim historians, but according to Canard, "in the disturbed period in which these Mesopotamian Arabs lived, they were no worse in their behaviour than the other soldiers of fortune of the Abbasid regime".&lt;ref name="EI2-90"/&gt; Canard credits Isa in particular with a "certain reputation for magnificence and generosity",&lt;ref name="EI2-90"/&gt; and like all the Shayban, Isa and Ahmad too were esteemed for the quality of their [[Arabic poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Bianquis (1997), pp. 391–392&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11359">'''Josef Hassid''' ({{lang-pl|Józef Chasyd|links=no}}) (28 December 1923{{spaced ndash}}7 November 1950) was a Polish [[violin]]ist.

==Childhood==
Born on 28 December 1923 to Jewish parents in [[Suwałki]], Poland, as Joseph or Józef Chasyd, he was the second youngest of four children. He lost his mother when he was ten and was brought up by his father, Owsiej, who took charge of his career. After lessons with a local violin teacher he studied from 1934 at the [[Fryderyk Chopin University of Music|Chopin School of Music]] in Warsaw under Mieczysław Michałowicz (born 1872) and [[Irena Dubiska]] (1899–1989). In 1935 he entered the first [[Henryk Wieniawski International Violin Competition]] in Warsaw, but suffered a memory lapse; he received an honorary diploma.

His father arranged for him to play for fellow Pole [[Bronisław Huberman]], who was much impressed and he arranged for Hassid to study under the Hungarian virtuoso [[Carl Flesch]] at his summer course in 1937 at Spa, Belgium, where fellow students included [[Ivry Gitlis]], [[Ginette Neveu]] and [[Ida Haendel]].

==London studies and concerts==
Hassid came to London with his father in 1938 at Flesch's invitation, to continue studies with him. Flesch concentrated on his musical and interpretative development rather than technical skills. Musical celebrities who heard him play at Flesch's house and were astonished at his ability included [[Joseph Szigeti]], [[Jacques Thibaud]], [[David Oistrakh]] and [[Fritz Kreisler]]. In a passage supplementing his father's memoirs Carl F. Flesch wrote that "Hassid was no doubt one of the strongest violin talents of his time. Indeed Fritz Kreisler, after hearing him at my father's house, said: 'A fiddler like Heifetz is born every 100 years; one like Hassid every 200 years.'"&lt;ref&gt;Carl Flesch: ''Memoirs'' (1973, pp. 360–1). The violinist with whom Hassid was compared is usually cited as [[Jascha Heifetz]], but in a letter published in ''The Gramophone'' (Aug. 1987, p. 531) Brian Crimp (who contributed the booklet notes to the Testament CD) states that a witness to the original conversation assured him that Heifetz's name was not mentioned; furthermore, in a letter published in the December 1987 issue (p. 869), Artur W. Vered, the biographer of Heifetz, confirms that he can say with certainty it was not him.&lt;/ref&gt; Kreisler lent Hassid for the remainder of his career a violin of 1860 by the French maker [[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume]], which was a great improvement on the instrument he had played up until then.

He gave a private recital with the pianist [[Ivor Newton]] on 9 March 1938 as "Yossef Hassid" at the home of Mr L.L. Gildesgame, 41 Clifton Hill, South Hampstead, where the guests included Sir [[Henry Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 12 March 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After giving a private recital at the home of Sir [[Philip Sassoon]], Hassid made his public debut at a recital with [[Gerald Moore]] in the Wigmore Hall on 3 April 1940, billed as the "Polish Boy Violinist",&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Campbell: ''The Great Violinists'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; playing works by [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] (''[[La Follia]]'' variations), [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] (Sonata in G), [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] (adagio and fugue from one of [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|the unaccompanied sonatas]]), [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] (''I palpiti'') and others. The next day ''The Times'' wrote Hassid "showed imagination and musical insight" and that "his performance created a strong impression." Many years later Moore commented that Hassid was "the greatest instrumental genius I've ever partnered. I don't know how to explain his incandescence. He had technical perfection, marvellous intonation, glorious tone – but there was something above that which was quite incredible, a metaphysical quality. Sadly he had an unhappy love affair which literally drove him mad. But then maybe the unrest inside him made him play so fantastically." (Interview in ''The Gramophone'', April 1973.)

Three weeks later, on the evening of 25 April, he made his orchestral debut at the [[Queen's Hall]] in a Polish Relief Fund concert (broadcast on the BBC Home Service) playing the [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]] with the LPO under [[Grzegorz Fitelberg]] (during which he suffered a memory lapse). The concerto was preceded by two short items by [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]] and Kondracki and followed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]]. The next day ''The Times'' reported that Hassid "showed some signs of nervousness at the outset", but "the beauty of his tone was striking and the brilliance of the finale" earned him generous applause. On 9 June 1940 he appeared with [[Eileen Joyce]] as a supporting artist for [[Richard Tauber]] in a concert at the [[Colston Hall]], Bristol.

He gave a few recital broadcasts on the BBC and played the Beethoven [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] during an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall with Sir [[Adrian Boult]] conducting the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] on 5 January 1941. Three days later ''The Times'' commented of Hassid's as "a technically accomplished performance, but he has not yet attained to the purity of style, especially in the matter of sustaining an even tone throughout a phrase that the music needs."

Hassid's final concert was also at the Queen's Hall, on the afternoon of 1 March 1941, where he played the [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto]] with the Sidney Beer Symphony Orchestra of about thirty players under Sidney Beer. ''The Times'' review (4 March) noted that the concerto was "the least satisfactory part of the concert, because neither the young violinist nor the conductor seemed to have a determined view of Brahms to present to their hearers. The solo performance was scarcely more than that of a clever student who has worked hard to memorize the concerto but is still liable to be thrown off his stroke, even to the point of forgetting his notes occasionally. The rhythm throughout was indecisive and the last pages of the Finale became almost a race between soloist and orchestra."

==Illness and death==
Although originally shy and introverted, Hassid was described as a carefree, likeable young man when he first came to London, but by February 1941 it became apparent that he was suffering from a severe mental disorder characterised by violent mood swings, often becoming sullen and withdrawn, and turning against his violin, his father and his religion. An inability to recognise close friends rapidly led to complete withdrawal from the world at large. He was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and on June 19, withdrawn and uncooperative, he was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton for [[insulin coma therapy]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Hassid's agent, the impresario [[Harold Holt (impresario)|Harold Holt]], wrote to the superintendent of St Andrew's: "He is nothing short of a violinistic genius and of such exceptional quality that we want to make the greatest effort possible to cure him. I would particularly like to stress that he is ''most exceptional'', and might have – had this illness not developed – been one of the greatest figures in the violinistic world."&lt;ref name=Feinstein&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0957154X9700802904|issn=0957-154X&lt;!-- , 1740-2360--&gt;|volume=8|issue=29|pages=55–60|authorlink=Anthony Feinstein|last=Feinstein|first=Anthony|title=Psychosurgery and the child prodigy: the mental illness of violin virtuoso Josef Hassid|journal=History of Psychiatry|accessdate=31 January 2013|date=March 1997|url=http://hpy.sagepub.com/content/8/29/055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His condition improved for a time and he left the hospital on 2 May 1942, but on 9 December that year he was certified insane and admitted to Moorcroft House, a private asylum in Hillingdon, Middlesex, three days later, for further treatment. On 13 July 1943 Hassid was transferred to an asylum in Epsom ([[Long Grove Hospital]]), morose, indifferent and evasive, either silent or laughing inanely. He remained there for the rest of his life. His father died in 1949, causing his condition to deteriorate to the point that on 20 October 1950 psychosurgeons subjected him to a bilateral prefrontal leucotomy ("leucotomy" being the British English equivalent of American English "[[lobotomy]]").  Hassid developed a postoperative infection that progressed into [[meningitis]], and he died on 7 November, shortly before his twenty-seventh birthday.  Hospital records list his height as 5&amp;nbsp;ft 3¾in (162&amp;nbsp;cm) and his weight as 9 stone (126&amp;nbsp;lb, 57&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Feinstein/&gt;

==Recordings==
[[Fred Gaisberg]] of EMI arranged for a test recording of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''La Capricieuse'' (Op. 17) with accompanist [[Ivor Newton]] at the Abbey Road Studios on 9 January 1939 when Hassid had just turned 15; and then [[Walter Legge]] produced a further eight recordings on 12 and 28 June and 29 November 1940, this time accompanied by [[Gerald Moore]]. The delay was due to Hassid's agent [[Harold Holt (impresario)|Harold Holt]], who thought he should continue his studies for another year. Some who heard Hassid perform live say that the records do not show him at his best. Even so, his performances of [[Joseph Achron]]'s ''Hebrew Melody'', [[Pablo de Sarasate|Sarasate]]'s ''Zapateado'' and [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]]'s ''Caprice viennois'' in particular are superb and show virtuosity of the highest order in expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]. To quote from Bryan Crimp's note with the Testament CD: "The moment Hassid puts bow to string he beguiles the ear via a captivating and uniquely individual sound ... a peerless technique and an arresting and frequently original interpretative approach. His technical security and cleanness of attack are awesome, his tone at once vibrant, virile and indescribably pure and sweet." Hassid apparently thought that his vibrato sounded too fast on record, but this is probably just a matter of taste.

Based on notes with CD issues, Feinstein 1997, newspaper advertisements and reviews, etc.

Complete published recordings issued on CD:
*Pearl GEMMCD9939 (1992)
*Testament SBT1010 (1992)
*Symposium SYMPCD1327 (2003)
(The Testament and Symposium CDs also include the test from 1939.)

Josef Hassid was one of several prodigies whose brilliant careers were short lived. [[Bruno Monsaingeon]]'s ''The Art of Violin'' commemorates Hassid.&lt;ref&gt;Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century, Henry Roth&lt;/ref&gt;

==In exile==

She graduated from [[Rye Country Day School]] in 1988, and went on to attend a state school in [[Massachusetts]] before going on to study at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1992.

She spent most of her time commuting between her home in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and [[Paris]], where her mother was living. A onetime model for the designer [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]], she suffered from [[anorexia nervosa]], chronic low self-esteem, severe [[Clinical depression|depression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/SetarehSabety/2001/June/Leila/|title=Diana not: Serious soul-searching about our collective identity crisis |publisher=Iranian.com |last=Sabety |first=Setareh |date=2001-06-19 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries, Leila Pahlavi, Deposed Shah's Daughter, June 12, 2001.

[[File:Leila Pahlavi.jpg|thumb|Grave of Leila Pahlavi in [[Passy Cemetery]], [[Paris]], [[France]]]]

On Sunday 10 June 2001, Leila was found dead in her room in the [[Leonard Hotel]] in [[London]] just before 19:30 [[British Summer Time|BST]] by her doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1384283.stm|title=Shah's daughter found dead|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2001-06-12|accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was found to have more than five times the lethal dose of [[Seconal]], a [[barbiturate]], which is used to treat [[insomnia]], in her system, along with a nonlethal amount of [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tweedie|first=Neil|title=Shah's daughter stole to fuel her drug habit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335290/Shahs-daughter-stole-to-fuel-her-drug-habit.html|work=The Times (London)|accessdate=April 30, 2013|date=July 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was found in bed, her body emaciated by years of anorexia, bulimia,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335290/Shahs-daughter-stole-to-fuel-her-drug-habit.html|title=Shah's daughter stole to fuel her drug habit|publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk]]|last=Tweedie|first=Neil|date=2001-07-26|accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[food intolerances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134900,00.html|title=Burden of Grief|publisher=[[people.com]]|last=Hewitt|first=Bill|date=2011-07-16|accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a report on her death, which included information from an autopsy conducted by the [[Westminster Coroner's Court]], she stole the Seconal from her doctor's desk during an appointment and was addicted to the drug, typically taking 40 pills at once, rather than the prescribed two.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

On 17 June 2001, she was buried near her maternal grandmother, Farideh Ghotbi Diba, in the [[Cimetière de Passy]], [[Paris]], [[France]].

'''Louis Carl "Lou" Dobbs''' &lt;ref name="BirthRecord"/&gt; (born September 24, 1945) is an American television commentator, author, radio show host, [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]], and the anchor of ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight]]'' on [[Fox Business Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/media/lou-dobbs-fake-bombs/index.html|title=Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs peddles conspiracy theory about suspicious packages|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs started working with [[CNN]] at its inception in 1980, serving as a reporter and network vice president.  On the air, he served as host and [[managing editor]] of the network's business program, ''Moneyline'', which premiered in 1980.  The show was renamed ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'' in 2003. Dobbs resigned from CNN for a short period of time in 1999 but rejoined the network in 2001. He resigned once again in November 2009.  In 2011, he joined the Fox Business Network, resuming and anchoring his show, ''Lou Dobbs Tonight''.  He is the former host of a syndicated [[USRN|U.S. Radio Network]] program, ''Lou Dobbs Radio''.  Dobbs has authored several books since 2001.

Dobbs describes himself politically as an "independent populist". He is known for his pro-Trump coverage, anti-immigration views, promotion of Barack Obama [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther conspiracy theories]], and opposition to [[NAFTA]].

==Background and family life==
Born in [[Childress County, Texas]], Dobbs is the son of Frank Dobbs, a co-owner of a [[propane]] business, and Lydia Mae (née Hensley), a bookkeeper.&lt;ref name="BirthRecord"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=txbirthindex&amp;h=4102858&amp;ti=0&amp;indiv=try | title = Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997 (Ancestry.com database on-line) | accessdate = 2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dobbs was 12, his father's propane business failed and the family moved to [[Rupert, Idaho]].&lt;ref name="Madashell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/061204fa_fact1 |title=Mad as Hell: Lou Dobbs's populist crusade |accessdate=2007-01-17 |last=Auletta |first=Ken |date=2006-12-04 |work=[[The New Yorker]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Minico High School]] in [[Minidoka County, Idaho|Minidoka County]], where he played [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] on the [[high school football|football]] team, played the [[sousaphone]] in the band, and served as [[student body president]].&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.american.com/archive/2006/november/lou-dobbs | last = Mullins | first = Luke | date = 2006-11-28 | title = The Secret Life of Lou Dobbs | work = The American | accessdate = 2007-06-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604144247/http://www.american.com/archive/2006/november/lou-dobbs | archivedate = 2007-06-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although accepted at the [[University of Idaho]] and [[Idaho State University]], he was persuaded by the staff at Minico High to apply to [[Harvard University]], where he was accepted and later graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; While at Harvard, Dobbs lived in [[Quincy House (Harvard College)|Quincy House]] and was elected to the [[Owl Club]].

After graduating, Dobbs worked for federal [[anti-poverty program]]s in [[Boston]] and Washington, D.C., then returned to Idaho.

==Career==

=== CNN ===
Dobbs joined CNN when it launched in 1980, serving as its chief [[economics]] [[correspondent]] and as [[Host (radio)#Television presenter|host]] of the business news program ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight|Moneyline]]'' on CNN. Dobbs also served as a [[corporate executive]] for CNN, as its executive vice president and as a member of CNN's executive committee. He founded [[CNN fn]] (CNN financial news), serving as its president and anchoring the program ''Business Unusual'', which examined business creativity and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbios.com/newslum/dobbs.htm |title=Business News Luminaries |publisher=Newsbios.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure and founding of Space.com===
Dobbs repeatedly clashed with [[Rick Kaplan]], who became president of CNN in 1997. Dobbs said Kaplan, noted friend of then president [[Bill Clinton]], was "clearly partisan" and "was pushing Clinton stories", while Kaplan said Dobbs was "a very difficult person to work with".&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt;

On April 20, 1999, CNN was covering Clinton's speech in [[Littleton, Colorado]], following the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast ''Moneyline''.&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt; Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, "Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it". Dobbs announced on the air that "CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton". A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start [[Space.com]], a website devoted to [[Astronautics|astronautical]] news.&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt; Dobbs was subsequently replaced as host of ''Moneyline'' by [[Willow Bay]] and [[Stuart Varney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,667811,00.html |title=MONEYLINE Launches Bicoastal News Format |publisher=Time Warner |date=2000-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to CNN===
Kaplan left CNN in August 2000, and Dobbs returned the following year, at the behest of his friend and CNN founder [[Ted Turner]], becoming host and [[managing editor]] of the new and initially more general news program ''Lou Dobbs Reporting'', which later became ''CNN News Sunday Morning''. He also regained the helm of the newly renamed ''Lou Dobbs Moneyline'' (which became ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'' in June 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Peter | last = Johnson | title='Lou Dobbs Moneyline' gets a new moniker | date = 2003-06-09 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2003-06-09-media-mix_x.htm | work = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = 2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exit from CNN===
On the November 11, 2009 edition of his nightly broadcast ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'', Dobbs announced his immediate departure from CNN, ending a nearly thirty-year career at the network, citing plans to "pursue new opportunities".&lt;ref name="Update: Lou Dobbs to Quit CNN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/lou-dobbs-to-depart-cnn/|title=Update: Lou Dobbs to Quit CNN|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|date=2009-11-11|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-11-11|last2=Carter|first2=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNN1"&gt;{{Cite book

The controversy eventually caused CNN President [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jon Klein]] to rein Dobbs in via an internal memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ariens |first=Chris |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/jon_klein_on_birthers_it_seems_this_story_is_dead_122546.asp |title=Jon Klein on Birthers: "It Seems This Story is Dead" – mediabistro.com: TVNewser |publisher=mediabistro.com |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425075638/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/jon_klein_on_birthers_it_seems_this_story_is_dead_122546.asp |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, advocates challenged Dobbs for appearing at a conference organized by the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform.  Multiple campaigns were launched, including "Drop Dobbs" ([[New Democrat Network|NDN]], [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]), and "Basta Dobbs" ([[Presente.org]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bastadobbs.com/blog/2009/sep/16/latino-leaders-across-us-demand-cnn-drop-controver/ |title=Basta Dobbs : Latino Leaders Across U.S. Demand CNN Drop Controversial Host Lou Dobbs for Extremist Ties |publisher=BastaDobbs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaigns also attacked CNN for alleged hypocrisy towards Latinos, citing CNN's ''Latino in America'' special as incompatible with their continued support of Dobbs. The campaigns generated considerable anti-Dobbs press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impre.com/eldiariony/noticias/locales/2009/10/22/hispanos-a-cnn--eres-latino-o--155229-1.html |title=El Diario La Prensa NY – noticias de Nueva York – impre.com – Hispanos a CNN: ¿eres latino o anti-latino? |publisher=impre.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are credited by some{{Who|date=September 2010}} as pushing Dobbs out.

Dobbs was reportedly paid $8 million in severance pay when he left CNN prior to his contract being due for renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shain |first=Michael |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/source_cnn_wanted_lou_out_LOBEhi0KhBVvzqxDoxbPWI |title=Source: CNN wanted Lou out |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dobbs left CNN in 2009, he gave an interview where he did not rule out the possibility of running for [[President of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], saying the final decision would rest with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Memmot, Mark (2009-11-24) [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/11/lou_dobbs_white_house_independ.html "Lou Dobbs Hints At White House Run In 2012 As An Independent"], NPR.org.

===Radio===
From 2009 to 2012, Dobbs hosted ''Lou Dobbs Radio'' on [[United Stations Radio Networks]]. The three-hour daily show had affiliates in several major markets, including its [[flagship (radio)|flagship station]] ([[WOR (AM)|WOR]]) in New York City, [[Washington D.C.]] ([[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]]), [[Miami]] ([[WZAB]]-AM) and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[KDOW]]), as well as stations such as [[WGNY (AM)|WGNY-AM]] in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]]. The show was guest-centered and featured political discussion and listener calls. It aired from 2 to 5 p.m. Eastern, directly competing with ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''The Tom Sullivan Show'' and ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]''. Dobbs also hosts the financially themed ''Lou Dobbs Minute'' on the same network.

In June 2008, Dobbs reached an agreement with [[Business Talk Radio Network]] to carry a rebroadcast of the show from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern, displacing [[Bruce Williams (talk radio host)|Bruce Williams]]. Dobbs' show was also carried live on [[CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks]].

Dobbs was among the hosts who tried out for the position vacated by the cancellation of ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' on [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], a position that was eventually filled by ''[[Boomer and Carton in the Morning]]''. Dobbs mentioned on his radio show that he is currently seeking a position in the [[US Department of Treasury]] during the economic crisis. He stated that he believed he could "do more good than the clowns currently in position."

Dobbs also is a regular columnist in ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', and the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt;

===Current show on Fox Business Network===

On November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network announced that Dobbs would host a show on the channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/11/lou-dobbs-joining-fox-business-network.html Lou Dobbs joining Fox Business Network] ''Los Angeles Times''  November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The network announced on March 3, 2011 the start date, show title, and time slot of Dobbs' new show. Titled ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight]]'' the program debuted on March 14, 2011, airing at 7 PM Eastern. That is the same title and time slot that Dobbs' old CNN show had.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/03/lou-dobbs-fox-business-sh_n_831033.html Lou Dobbs' new Fox Business show gets a start date and a name] ''The Huffington Post''  March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===

Since 2009, Dobbs has made regular appearances to discuss issues on other news network programs including CNBC's ''[[The Kudlow Report]]'' and Fox News Channel's ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. On October 5, 2010, Dobbs made a guest appearance on an episode of ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'', entitled "Double Jeopardy",&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1632297|The Good Wife, Double Jeopardy}} October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in which he plays himself as a client in search of a new law firm to represent his legal interests.

==Political views and controversies==

Dobbs was a lifelong Republican.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he later registered as an Independent following a break with the Bush Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/lou-dobbs-says-it-may-be-time-to-declare-war-outright-against-the-deep-state/|title=Lou Dobbs Says 'It May Be Time to Declare War Outright Against the Deep State'|author=|date=|website=www.mediaite.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs is known for his anti-immigration views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/28/usa.television|title=Hispanic congressmen demand corporate action against CNN host|last=Schor|first=Elana|date=2008-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; warnings about Islamist terror, and his opposition to free trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/employment/2005-02-22-dobbs-usat_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Michael | last1=McCarthy | title=Dobbs blasts outsourcing | date=2005-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his pro-Trump coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/14/media/pro-trump-media-daca-dreamers/index.html|title=Pro-Trump media incensed over reports he struck deal with Dems on Dreamers|last=Darcy|first=Oliver|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-media-democrats-debt-deal-2017-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Right-wing media praises Trump's deal with the Democrats and rips Republican leaders|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amp.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-cherishes-lou-dobbs-so-much-he-puts-him-on-speakerphone-for-oval-office-meetings|title=Donald Trump 'Cherishes' Lou Dobbs So Much He Puts Him on Speakerphone for Oval Office Meetings|website=amp.thedailybeast.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Daily Beast'', by 2018, Dobbs had turned into a "full-on conservative nationalist-populist and culture warrior."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Birtherism===
Dobbs promoted the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|false conspiracy theory]] that [[Barack Obama]] was not born in the United States.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'', 29 July 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/29/birthers-obama-citizenship-republicans Birthers are citizens of Idiot America]&lt;/ref&gt; His willingness to raise the "[[birther]]" issue repeatedly&lt;ref&gt;"a lot of questions remaining, and seemingly the questions won't go away because they haven't been dealt with".

In a 2006 article, Dobbs expressed frustration at failed legislation to build a southern "border fence to stop the flow of illegal aliens and drugs across our borders." He argued that the "true victims of corporate America's lust for cheap labor" were "American working men and women, taxpayers all."&lt;ref name="Dobbs_CNN_2006_wall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Five-weeks off for 'do-nothing Congress' |author=Lou Dobbs |work=CNN |date=August 2, 2006 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs' show has made factually incorrect claims, such as the one that illegal immigrants were responsible for bringing 7,000 new cases of [[leprosy]] to the United States in a three-year period, where the actual timeframe was over the last thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;James L.

Dobbs has criticized local officials for their approach to border security. In October 2007 he labeled then-[[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] an "idiot" for advocating the issuance of [[driver's license]]s to illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Larry | last = McShane | title = Dobbs Shows No Love For Guv | date = 2007-10-29 | url = http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-spitzer1029.artoct29,0,2408884.story | work = courant.com | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071029211705/http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-spitzer1029.artoct29,0,2408884.story | archivedate = 2007-10-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillary Clinton]] labeled Dobbs' illegal immigration segments as having "all that hot air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=SteveK on Jan 03, 2008 03:49 PM |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/dobbs_fires_back_at_clinton_for_hot_air_comment_74182.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128141653/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/dobbs_fires_back_at_clinton_for_hot_air_comment_74182.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-28 |title=Dobbs Fires Back at Clinton For "Hot Air" Comment – mediabistro.com: TVNewser |publisher=mediabistro.com |date=2008-01-03 |accessdate=2010-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2009 interview with [[Telemundo]], Dobbs said that the U.S. needed a "rational, effective humane policy" for immigration that included enhanced border security and also "the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Angie Drobnic Holan, [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/30/lou-dobbs/did-lou-dobbs-oppose-amnesty-he-doesnt-oppose-it-n/ Did Lou Dobbs oppose amnesty?

In March 2009, Dobbs said he thought that there should not be a [[St. Patricks Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/lou-dobbs-attacks-st-patricks-day-how-about-an-american-day-e61c94b1d3aa|title=Lou Dobbs attacks St. Patrick's Day: 'How about an American day?'|date=18 March 2009|work=[[ThinkProgress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, ''[[The Nation]]'' published the results of a yearlong investigation detailing undocumented workers who had worked on Dobbs' personal properties. The labor involved upkeep of Dobbs' multimillion-dollar estates in [[New Jersey]] and [[Florida]], including the horses belonging to his daughter, Hillary, a champion show jumper. The article featured interviews with five immigrants who had worked without papers on Dobbs' properties. Dobbs and his daughter had declined to comment to ''The Nation'' as part of the story.&lt;ref name="amhypocrite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/155209/lou-dobbs-american-hypocrite?page=full|title=Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite|last=MacDonald|first=Isabel|date=2010-10-06|work=[[The Nation]]|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the [[Associated Press]], Dobbs referred to the article as "a political assault," claiming it was a lie that he hired illegal immigrants. He said: "I have never, do not now, and never will."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/07/AR2010100704043.html Report: Illegal Labor Worked at Dobbs' homes] AP via Washington Post; October 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Dobbs falsely claimed that "many" undocumented immigrants voted in the 2018 mid-term elections and that they had an "immense impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/nov/16/lou-dobbs/no-evidence-many-illegal-immigrants-voted-midterm-/|title=No evidence ‘many’ illegal immigrants voted in midterms|work=@politifact|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/16/lou-dobbs-casually-makes-up-story-that-many-illegal-immigrants-voted-midterms-had-immense-impact/|title=Lou Dobbs casually makes up story that ‘many’ illegal immigrants voted in midterms and had ‘immense impact’|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-Trump views ===
On his show ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'', Dobbs stopped short of a full endorsement of Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], saying, "Whatever you think of Trump, whatever your politics, Trump has taken on enormous risk and threats in seeking the presidency ... promised to restore the voice of the people ... and a government that will respect all that our Constitution assures."

On October 13, 2016, Dobbs publicized by [[Twitter]] a link which contained the address and phone number of a woman who was among several who had come forward with allegations of being sexually assaulted by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/fox-anchor-tweets-trump-accusers-address-and-phone-number-229738|title=Lou Dobbs tweets Trump accuser's address and phone number|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump repeatedly calls Dobbs to get his views on various policy issues.  In 2017 Trump patched Dobbs into senior-level [[Oval Office]] meetings multiple times, sometimes interrupting officials to ask for Dobbs' opinions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Dobbs is a proponent of the [[Deep state in the United States|Deep State conspiracy theory]]. In January 2018, Dobbs called for a "war" on the "Deep State", which he described as the FBI and the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/370469-lou-dobbs-its-time-to-declare-war-on-deep-state#.WmlNOdL_MzY.twitter|title=Lou Dobbs: 'May be time to declare war' on 'deep state'|last=Anapol|first=Avery|date=2018-01-24|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs said that the FBI and DOJ had destroyed evidence and that they were clandestinely working to bring down the Trump presidency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In June 2018, Dobbs promoted a conspiracy which originated on Reddit and the far-right conspiracy website Gateway Pundit that "the FBI May have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/06/politics/trump-fbi-texts-conspiracy-theory/index.html|title=From Reddit to Trump: How the President latched onto a conspiracy theory|last=CNN|first=Jeremy Herb and Manu Raju,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Dobbs promoted the unfounded conspiracy theory, Trump retweeted Dobbs' assertion and praised Dobbs for a "great interview".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In July 2018, Dobbs said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was on a "jihad" against Trump, and accused him of seeking to "subvert" and "overthrow" Trump's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/fox-host-lou-dobbs-mueller-trump-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T|title='The hell with Mueller': Fox host Lou Dobbs says the special counsel is on 'jihad' against Trump|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not investigating alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Dobbs attacked Sessions, saying that he had become physically or mentally unwell.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-host-lou-dobbs-jeff-sessions-has-fallen-ill-needs-to-resign|title=Fox News Host Lou Dobbs: Jeff Sessions Has 'Fallen Ill,' Needs to Resign|last=Tani|first=Maxwell|date=2018-03-04|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs said, "Sessions has fallen ill, he's incapacitated in some fashion, or he's been coopted or captured: to preserve any dignity, for the good of the country he needs to resign."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In July 2018, Dobbs defended the Trump administration's decision to ban a CNN reporter from a press event.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/media/398919-lou-dobbs-to-cnn-after-white-house-bans-cnn-reporter-who-the-hell-are-you|title=Lou Dobbs to CNN after White House bans reporter: 'Who the hell are you?'|last=Birnbaum|first=Emily|date=2018-07-25|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple Fox colleagues, including Fox News President Jay Wallace, had shown solidarity with CNN and called on the White House to rescind the ban.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 2012, when a ''Daily Caller'' reporter was criticized by the White House for shouting out a question during an address by Obama, Dobbs defended the reporter, saying "What is rude is a president not speaking to the American people and taking the questions of the White House press."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/jake-tapper-calls-out-foxs-lou-dobbs-for-attacking-cnns-kaitlan-collins|title=Jake Tapper Calls Out Fox’s Lou Dobbs on ‘Colbert’ for Attacking CNN’s Kaitlan Collins|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=2018-07-27|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNN''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Jake Tapper]] suggested that Dobbs was hypocritical, saying "Lou Dobbs, it might surprise you to find out, had a very different take on the situation.... Sometimes I find some people in this environment, you will be interested to know, say the exact opposite thing about President Trump than they did about President Obama."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/07/26/fox-news-tries-to-stand-in-solidarity-with-cnn-against-white-house-but-not-everyone-is-on-board/|title=Fox News tries to "stand in strong solidarity with CNN" — but not everyone is on board|date=2018-07-26|work=Salon|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Dobbs called CNN journalist [[Jim Acosta]] "delicate" and "triggered" after Acosta recorded a hostile crowd Trump supporters at a rally harassing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/jim-acosta-calls-sean-hannity-a-propagandist-for-profit-2018-8?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T|title='A propagandist for profit, peddling lies every night': CNN correspondent Jim Acosta goes in on Fox News host Sean Hannity|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2018/08/01/lou-dobbs-criticizes-jim-acosta-triggered-and-delicate-after-trump-supporters-harassed-him-rally/220883|title=Lou Dobbs criticizes Jim Acosta as "triggered" and "delicate" after Trump supporters harassed him at rally|date=2018-08-01|work=Media Matters for America|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, Dobbs ran a segment pushing unsubstantiated claims that Google was biased against Trump and that Google was promoting anti-Trump stories.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-tweet-google-censorship-e5fb9792-069b-419e-8506-03855d3bf9c7.html|title=Go deeper: Tracing Trump's Google censorship tweet|website=Axios|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/08/28/a-short-investigation-into-trumps-tweets-on-rigged-google-results-about-himself/|title=Analysis {{!}} A short investigation into Trump’s claims of ‘RIGGED’ Google results against him|last=|first=|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Dobbs' segment, Trump tweeted that Google was suppressing conservatives and he tasked economic adviser Larry Kudlow to look into regulating Google.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In September 2018, after Trump falsely claimed that the official death count from [[Hurricane Maria death toll controversy|Hurricane Maria]] in Puerto Rico were fabricated by Democrats, Dobbs defended Trump's assertion.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/406644-trump-shares-lou-dobbs-segment-doubling-down-on-his-puerto-rico|title=Trump shares Lou Dobbs segment praising his Puerto Rico claims|last=Keller|first=Megan|date=2018-09-13|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs claimed that "the numbers were inflated" and that the organizations behind the numbers "threw out science, statistics, and evidence to discredit the Trump administration."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In October 2018, when CNN and a number of prominent Democrats were targeted with bomb attempts, Dobbs described the bomb attempts as "fake news" and promoted conspiracy theories that the bomb attempts were by Democrats who sought to increase their support in the upcoming mid-term elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/lou-dobbs-tweet-conspiracy-theory-democrats-mail-bombs-2018-10?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=Lou Dobbs promotes conspiracy theory that Democrats sent explosive devices to Clinton, Obama, and Soros to improve midterm chances|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/413103-fox-business-networks-dobbs-calls-bomb-attacks-fake-bombs-in-since-deleted|title=Fox Business Network's Dobbs calls bomb attacks 'fake bombs' in since-deleted tweet|last=Nam|first=Rafael|date=2018-10-25|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Fox News employees expressed dismay over Dobbs' rhetoric, with one employee telling CNN, "It's people like Dobbs who really ruin it for all the hard working journalists at Fox."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/25/media/lou-dobbs-fake-bombs/index.html|title=Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs peddles conspiracy theory about suspicious packages|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Trump administration rescinded CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass, Dobbs supported the administration. At the same time, numerous media organizations, including Fox News, spoke out against the Trump administration's decision. When U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, temporarily restored Acosta's press pass, Dobbs described the ruling as "absurd."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/lou-dobbs-loses-his-mind-after-cnn-defeats-white-house-over-acostas-press-access|title=Lou Dobbs Loses His Mind After CNN Defeats White House Over Acosta’s Press Access|last=Melendez|first=Pilar|date=2018-11-16|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Trump administration complied with the ruling, Dobbs called on the administration to ignore the ruling and tell the "district court judge to go to hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/lou-dobbs-freaks-after-trump-surrenders-to-cnns-jim-acosta-says-president-should-tell-judge-to-go-to-hell|title=Lou Dobbs: Trump Should Tell Judge in CNN Case to ‘Go to Hell’|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=2018-11-20|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/lou-dobbs-suggests-trump-should-have-ignored-court-order-on-jim-acosta/|title=Lou Dobbs Suggests Trump Should Have Ignored Court Order on Acosta|date=2018-11-20|work=TheWrap|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Soros===
Dobbs has peddled numerous conspiracy theories about the Jewish-American philanthropist and businessman George Soros.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/28/media/lou-dobbs-fox-news-guest/index.html|title=Fox condemns rhetoric used by Lou Dobbs guest as channel's star host faces growing criticism|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs has referred to him as an "evil SOB" and insidious.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

Dobbs's Fox Business Channel shows stirred controversy in October 2018 when a guest on Dobbs' show used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was "Soros-occupied" territory (which echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a "Zionist-occupied government").&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/151926/lou-dobbs-extreme-even-fox-business-news|title=Lou Dobbs is too extreme even for Fox Business News.|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks came days after bombing attempts on Soros, and the remarks were replayed on Fox Business hours after an anti-Semitic attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue which killed 11 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/413542-fox-business-exec-condemns-rhetoric-of-guest-who-blamed-migrant-caravan-on|title=Fox Business drops guest who blamed migrant caravan on 'Soros-occupied State Department'|last=Anapol|first=Avery|date=2018-10-28|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that the guest, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch, would no longer be booked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/10/29/lou-dobbs-controversy-fox-bans-george-soros-conspiracy-theory-guest/1804634002/|title=Fox bans Lou Dobbs' guest over George Soros conspiracy theory|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Other views===
Dobbs was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Though he made a donation of $1,000 to the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|Bush-Cheney]] campaign in January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Lou_Dobbs.php | title = Lou Dobbs's Federal Campaign Contribution Report | date = 2007-02-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104180416/http://www.newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Lou_Dobbs.php | archivedate = 2006-11-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; he often has described the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and the then Republican-controlled [[United States Congress|Congress]] as "disgraceful." He has also argued that both parties are controlled by corporate interests.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Lou, (2006). War on the Middle Class. The Dobbs Group, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs is [[pro-choice]], opposes [[gun control]] and, though he is a fiscal conservative, supports some government regulations, as revealed in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/03/60minutes/main2758082_page3.shtml |title=Lou Dobbs, "Advocacy" Journalist? |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been critical of trade policies that he says encourage "sending jobs overseas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4670239/ | title = CNN's Lou Dobbs is a man on a mission | work = [[MSNBC]] | accessdate = 2007-06-03 | agency = Associated Press | date = 2004-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs' stance on trade has earned plaudits from some [[Labor unions in the United States|trade union]] activists on the traditional [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political left]], while his stance on immigration tends to appeal to the [[American conservatism|right]].&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt; In an interview with [[Larry King]], Dobbs revealed that he is now "an unaffiliated independent" owing to dissatisfaction with both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic parties]].

In June 2006, as the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] debated the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], Dobbs was critical of the action. He asserted that marriage was threatened more by financial crises perpetuated by Bush administration economic policy than by [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/06/06/dobbs.june7/index.html | title = Dobbs: Gay marriage amendment sheer nonsense | date = 2006-06-08 | accessdate = 2006-01-17 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs is the author of ''War on the Middle Class'', in which he claims that both Democrats and Republicans are harming the middle class. In it, he comes out strongly against the [[Bush tax cuts]], which he argues favor the wealthy, and argued for raising the U.S. [[minimum wage]] from what was then $5.15 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/10/Dobbs.Oct11/index.html | title = Dobbs: Middle class needs to fight back now | date = 2006-10-18 | accessdate = 2006-01-17 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Dobbs has also been criticized for his lack of [[journalistic ethics]] by liberal news journalist [[Amy Goodman]]. She accused him of flagrant errors in his reporting and his staff's association with disreputable sources, stating that "he has a special responsibility to rely on facts and to correct misstatements of fact."&lt;ref name="amy06seattlePI"&gt;{{Cite news|title=CNN's Lou Dobbs needs to follow his own advice |date=December 5, 2007 |first=AMY |last=GOODMAN|

==Awards==
Dobbs has won numerous major awards for his television journalism, most notably a [[Emmy Award|Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award]] and a [[Cable ACE Awards|Cable Ace Award]]. He received the [[Peabody Award|George Foster Peabody Award]] for his coverage of the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]]. He also has received the Luminary Award of the Business Journalism Review in 1990, the [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Horatio Alger]] Association Award for Distinguished Americans in 1999 and the National Space Club Media Award in 2000. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' has named Dobbs "TV's Premier Business News Anchorman". In 2004, Dobbs was awarded the Eugene Katz Award For Excellence in the Coverage of Immigration by the [[Center for Immigration Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cis.org/articles/Katz/katz2004.html | title = 2004 Eugene Katz Award For Excellence in the Coverage of Immigration |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803231123/http://www.cis.org/articles/Katz/katz2004.html| archivedate =August 3, 2004 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 he received the [[Alexis de Tocqueville Institution|Alexis de Tocqueville Institution's]] Statesmanship Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2005/03/07/323990/73929/en/Reporter-Analyst-Dobbs-is-AdTI-Statesman-Brown.html | title = Reporter, analyst Dobbs is AdTI Statesman | accessdate = 2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs was named "Father of the Year" by the National Father's Day Committee in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/dobbs.lou.html | work = [[CNN]] | accessdate = 2007-06-03 | title = Lou Dobbs |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070519014136/http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/dobbs.lou.html |archivedate = May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Dobbs received the American Legion Public Relations Award from the National Commander of The [[American Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lou Dobbs: PR Award Recipient, 2008|url=https://www.legion.org/prawards/2008/lou-dobbs|publisher=[[American Legion]]|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margarete Steiff''' (July 24, 1847 &amp;ndash; May 9, 1909), was a [[Sewing|seamstress]] who in 1880 founded [[Margarete Steiff GmbH]], making [[toy]] [[stuffed animal]]s.

==Biography==
Born in [[Giengen]], [[Germany]], Margarete was the daughter of building contractor Friedrich Steiff and his wife Maria Margarete, née Haehnle. At eighteen months old Margarete contracted [[polio]] and was to be affected by the illness for the rest of her life.  Both of her feet suffered paralysis and she had restricted use of her right arm. Her parents were keen for her to live a full life and investigated many medical treatments with little success.  As a small child she was moved around in a small hand-pulled cart by her sisters and other children.  In her later reminiscences she recalls 'All the children gathered round me and I organised games in which I was the centre of attention. However, the older children often ran off and then I was left babysitting the tiny tots' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Button in Ear|last=Cieslik|first=Jurgen &amp; Marianne|publisher=Marianne Cieslik Verlag|year=1989|isbn=3-921844-18-5|location=Germany|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her disabilities Margarete regularly attended school throughout her childhood and it was in the needlework classes of Frau Schelling that she learnt her future profession, even though sewing without the full use of both hands must have presented difficulties.

Later Margarete attended needlework classes at the Giengen Town Hall, and became an accomplished [[zither]] player, teaching others to play to earn some money.  Her savings allowed her to buy a sewing machine, the first owned in the town of Giengen, and this led to another opportunity to earn income.  Margarete was often working on trousseaus for the town folk and by her mid twenties was making fashionable clothes and travelling to other towns to work and visit family, sending her cart ahead of her and travelling by Post-Coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Button in ear|last=Cieslik|first=Jurgen &amp; Marianne|publisher=Marianne Cieslik Verlag|year=1989|isbn=3-921844-18-5|location=Germany|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 Margarete opened a felt store and began making felt underskirts, which had just become fashionable, for the firm of Christian Siegle in Stuttgart.  She was soon able to employ people to work for her and it became a thriving business. 'At this time I came across a pattern for a toy elephant.  Felt was the ideal material for this toy and the filling would be of the finest lambswool.  Now I could make these as gifts for the children in the family and I tried out the patterns in various sizes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Button in Ear|last=Cieslik|first=Jurgen &amp; Marianne|publisher=Marianne Cieslik Verlag|year=1989|isbn=3-921844-18-5|location=Germany|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 the US magazine Delineator published a pattern for a cloth mouse, rabbit and elephant, other animal patterns followed and the German magazine Modenwelt reproduced these patterns.  Maragrete made many of these toys and gave them as gifts to friends, and by 1880 she started to sell them in small numbers.  In the following years she widened her range of small cloth animals based on the magazine patterns, but with small alternations to the cloth used and accessories.

In 1892 her small company applied for a Patent 'for making of animals and other figures to serve as playthings', the Patent number was DRP 66996, but this was later withdrawn when contested by another German toy manufacturer. Margarete's brother Fritz realised that there was an opportunity to sell large numbers of these toy animals and he took some samples to the market in Heidenheim, coming away with many orders.Production and turnover increased each year as did the variety of toys on offer.  Pull-along and ride-on toys were also added with the development of metal frames inside the toys.  By 1889 the company moved into a larger building, which had a corner shop where the toys and fabric could be displayed for sale.  The words 'Felt-Toy-Factory' were painted in large letters on the outside wall.  Next came a printed catalogue for customers to order from and the business grew from strength to strength.

Margarete Steiff made up all the samples of any new toys herself so she could be aware of any problems that might arise in production. Between 1897 and 1899 the Steiff company was designing and making 'dancing bear' toys.  Rather than the familiar teddy bear, these were standing figures carrying sticks and with rings through their noses imitating the real life dancing bears that travelled from town to town to provide entertainment at this time, or pull-along bears on wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Button in Ear|last=Cieslik|first=Jurgen and Marianne|publisher=Marianne Cieslik Verlag|year=1989|isbn=3-921844-18-5|location=Germany|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1902-3 the soft toy bears were given movable joints and a large shipment of toys had been sent to a New York showroom, but there was not much interest in the plush toy bears that were displayed there.  In March 1903 Richard Steiff took jointed soft toy bears to a spring fair in Leipzig and they caught the eye of an American buyer, who ordered 3000.  The Steiff bear went on to become the most famous and sought after make of teddy bears growing from one woman's determination to overcome disabilities and to create a business based on her needlework skills.

Maragarete Steiff died on 9 May 1909 just before her 62nd birthday.  The flags in Giengen flew at half mast.

&lt;!--[[File:Mferguson.jpg|right|148px|thumb|Marilyn Ferguson, circa 1980.]]--&gt;
'''Marilyn Ferguson''' (April 5, 1938 in [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado]] &amp;ndash; October 19, 2008) was an American author, editor and public speaker, best known for her 1980 book ''[[The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'' and its affiliation with the [[New Age|New Age Movement]] in popular culture.

A founding member of the Association of Humanistic Psychology,{{cn|reason=The AHP was founded in 1962|date=June 2011}} Ferguson published and edited the well-regarded science newsletter ''Brain/Mind Bulletin'' from 1975 to 1996.  She eventually earned numerous honorary degrees, served on the board of directors of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and befriended such diverse figures of influence as inventor and theorist [[Buckminster Fuller]], spiritual author [[Ram Dass]], Nobel Prize-winning chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]] and billionaire [[Ted Turner]]. Ferguson's work also influenced Vice President [[Al Gore]], who participated in her informal network while a senator and later met with her in the White House.

==Youth and early writing career==
Ferguson was born Marilyn Louise Grasso in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]]. After graduation from high school she earned an associate of arts degree at Mesa College (now [[Colorado Mesa University]]) and later attended the [[University of Colorado system|University of Colorado]].  During her first marriage, to Don Renzelman, she worked as a legal secretary and became a published author of short stories and poetry in such national magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. Later she wrote freelance articles for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and other publications. After living briefly in Houston, Texas, she moved to California with her second husband, Mike Ferguson, in 1968.  That year, she published her first book, on home economics, with her husband as co-author.

==''The Brain Revolution'' and ''Brain/Mind Bulletin''==
Ferguson soon developed an enduring interest in what came to be known as the "[[Human Potential Movement|human potential]]" movement, and particularly the latest research on the potential of the human [[brain]], with its implications for learning, creativity and wellness.

This inspired her to write ''The Brain Revolution: The Frontiers of Mind Research'' (Taplinger, 1973), a successful and broadly hailed popular summary of these discoveries. Two years later Ferguson launched ''Brain/Mind Bulletin'', a newsletter that served as an ongoing forum for her interest in cutting-edge scientific ideas. At its peak in the 1980s the publication had a worldwide base of some 10,000 subscribers, ranging from academics and intellectuals to schoolteachers and storekeepers, and helped to popularize the ideas of such notables as Prigogine, neuroscientists [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] and [[Candace Pert]], physicists [[Fritjof Capra]] and [[David Bohm]], psychologist [[Jean Houston]] and many others.

{{Infobox book|name=The Aquarian Conspiracy|image=Aquarianconspiracy.jpg|caption=book cover|author=Marilyn Ferguson|cover_artist=John Brogna|publisher=[[Jeremy P. Tarcher]]|pub_date=1980|isbn=0-87477-191-9|oclc=299846396}}

==''The Aquarian Conspiracy''==
In an early commentary in the newsletter Ferguson described her first glimmers of what she called "the movement that has no name" - a loose, enthusiastic network of innovators from almost every discipline, united by their apparent desire to create real and lasting change in society and its institutions. Her attempt to compile and synthesize the patterns she was seeing eventually led her to develop a second newsletter, ''Leading Edge Bulletin'', and found its culmination in ''The Aquarian Conspiracy'' (J.P. Tarcher, 1980), the seminal work that earned her a lasting global reputation.

The book's title led to some confusion, having to do with astrology only to the extent of drawing from the popular conception of the "Age of Aquarius" succeeding a dark "Piscean" age. The word ''conspiracy'' she used in its literal sense of "breathing together," as one of her great influences, the philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], had done before her.

Unabashedly positive in its outlook, the book was praised by such diverse figures as philosophical writer [[Arthur Koestler]], who called it "stunning and provocative," commentator [[Max Lerner]], who found it "drenched in sunlight," and United Nations Assistant Secretary-General [[Robert Muller]], who described it as "remarkable" and "epoch-making."  Psychologist [[Carl Rogers]] credited her with having "etched, in unforgettable vividness, the intricate web of changes shaping the inevitable revolution in our culture," and said the book "gives the pioneering spirit the courage to go forward."

Philosopher and religious scholar [[Jacob Needleman]] predicted that the book would help to make "New Age" thinking "more understandable and less threatening" to the general public in America. This was borne out by its success, as ''The Aquarian Conspiracy'' steadily climbed to the best-seller list and its viewpoint began seeping into the popular culture.  Before long the book was being credited as "the handbook of the New Age" (''[[USA Today]]'') and a guidepost to a philosophy "working its way increasingly into the nation's cultural, religious, social, economic and political life" (''[[New York Times]]'').

Although the book was not explicitly political, it expressed early enthusiasm for the [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] perspective. In the "Right Power" chapter Ferguson writes, "Radical Center ... is not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road. From this vantage point, we can see that the various schools of thought on any one issue - political or otherwise - include valuable contributions along with error and exaggeration."&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Marilyn (1980).  ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s''.  J. P. Tarcher Inc. / Houghton Mifflin, pp. 228–29.  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-191-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was eventually translated into some 16 foreign languages, and Ferguson became a sought-after speaker across North America and around the world, eventually traveling as far as Brazil, Sweden and India to convey her hopeful message. In 1985 she was featured as a keynote speaker at the United Nations-sponsored "Spirit of Peace" conference, where she appeared along with [[Mother Teresa]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] of Tibet.

==Religious and other criticism==
Such validation did not come without a price.  Ferguson was attacked in some quarters for excessive optimism.  Others alleged that her "new" ideas were merely a repackaging of old notions of positive thinking, and some saw the "New Age" (a term Ferguson herself seldom used) as merely extending the self-absorption that had marked much of the 1970s. Most persistently, some religious groups contended that the "conspiracy" was an attempt to subvert Christian views. This view, most notably expressed by author [[Constance Cumbey]] in her 1983 book ''The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'', was restated as recently as 2007, when one online essayist wrote that the Christian church “rightly discerned the New Age movement, as outlined in Ferguson’s book, to be demonically inspired in anticipation of the ultimate unveiling of . . . the antichrist.”&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Alnor, SymphonyofScripture.com, 8/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaccurately alleged that Ferguson, herself raised and confirmed a Lutheran, had written the book at the behest of the Stanford Research Institute with the goal of overtaking western culture with Eastern mysticism.

==Impact and reissue==
Indirectly supporting both Ferguson and her critics, the New Age movement, as popularly understood, did thrive in the 1980s and into the 1990s, though this was partially through such pop-cultural manifestations as the autobiographical works of actress [[Shirley MacLaine]] and the “[[Harmonic Convergence]]” festival of 1987. While the period was marked by undeniable evolution in the fields of politics, education and medicine, many other ideas and practices were transitory. Through it all Ferguson remained an optimist, albeit one who did not ignore the depth of society's chronic problems. Commenting in advance of the 1988 presidential election, she noted that “there is no panacea for our social maladies” – but there remained the power of belief. “Our ‘foolish illusion’ that we can effect change fosters in us the capacity to act – and therefore to bring about change.” ("The Great Depression . . . The Great Schizophrenia," ''Brain/Mind Bulletin'', October 1988.)

In 1987 ''The Aquarian Conspiracy'' was reissued, featuring a new introduction by another of her allies, futurist-author [[John Naisbitt]] (''[[Megatrends]]''). While slowly developing a follow-up work, Ferguson returned her primary focus to reporting on scientific research in ''Brain-Mind Bulletin''. There she continued to explore the links between body and mind and new theoretical models in neuroscience, physics, psychology, education and health until the newsletter ceased publication in 1996.

==''Aquarius Now''==
The long-planned ''Aquarius Now'', after near-publication in several previous forms, appeared in 2005. The book, published by Red Wheel/Weiser, was well-received, though less commercially successful. Following its release Ferguson continued to develop projects, share ideas and advise other authors. In 2007 she moved to [[Banning, California]], near her son and his family.

==Death and reaction==
Ferguson died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack on October 19, 2008. Her death was widely noted in the national and international media. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described her as a "galvanizing influence,"&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Woo, Los Angeles Times B10, 11/2/08.&lt;/ref&gt; and quoted her U.S. publisher, Jeremy Tarcher, who described his own personal epiphany when he first met with Ferguson and recognized the potential of the information she had collected. The ''New York Times'' called ''The Aquarian Conspiracy'' "the Bible of the New Age," and mused that the once-radical ideas of her "benign conspiracy" may now seem commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;William Grimes, New York Times A33, Wednesday, 11/5/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offering a tribute on the website [[beliefnet.com]] (also on the [[Huffington Post]]'s website), best-selling physician-author [[Deepak Chopra]] described Ferguson as "a one-woman movement for hope." He recalled being a young doctor who was studying meditation when he came across ''The Aquarian Conspiracy'' in the early 1980s, and realized the book had instantly unified a movement that otherwise seemed to be resigned to the fringes. At her death, Chopra wrote, Ferguson could rest in the knowledge that "a watershed had been crossed," and that her "leaderless revolution" had steadily gained force around the world in the generation since the book was written.&lt;ref&gt;Deepak Chopra, [http://blog.beliefnet.com/intentchopra/2008/11/marilyn-ferguson-an-appreciati.html "Marilyn Ferguson: An Appreciation"]. [[beliefnet.com]]. November 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/marilyn-ferguson-an-appre_b_142193.html|title=Marilyn Ferguson: An Appreciation|author=Deepak Chopra|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=November 7, 2008|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Aquarian Conspiracy'' was re-issued in a "Tarcher Cornerstone" edition in August 2009, featuring a new introduction by Jeremy Tarcher.  In October 2009, Ferguson received a posthumous Distinguished Alumna award from Mesa State College.

Divorced in 1978, Ferguson was subsequently married to Ray Gottlieb from 1983 to 1991. She retained the last name of her second husband, with whom she had three children: Eric Ferguson (born 1964), Kristin Ferguson Smith (born 1967) and Lynn Ferguson Lewis (born 1969).

'''Meebo and Zuky''' is a [[comic strip]] in the British children's comic strip magazine [[The Beano]]. It was introduced as one of three new strips in the Beano's [[Comic Idol]] competition, in June 2010, where the winner gets a permanent place in the comic. It was up against [[Home Invasion]], about green aliens who want to invade Earth, and [[Uh, Oh, Si Co!]], about a boy who'd get angry at the slightest annoyance. After three weeks of voting, the winner was announced to be Meebo &amp; Zuky, so from the next week they were launched properly. It is drawn by [[Laura Howell]], who has also drawn [[Beano Manga]], [[Ratz (comic strip)|Ratz]] and [[Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green]] for The Beano.

The strip involves Meebo (a cat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beano.com/characters/meebo-zuky/cast/meebo-zuky-meebo|title=Characters - Beano|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Zuky (a dog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beano.com/characters/meebo-zuky/cast/meebo-zuky-zuky|title=Characters - Beano|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who fight like cat and dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beano.com/characters/meebo-zuky|title=Characters - Beano|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strip shares many characteristics with a number of older [[DC Thomson]] comic strips such as Kat and Kanary, from the Beano, and [[Puss 'n' Boots (Sparky comics)|Puss 'n' Boots]], from [[Sparky (comics)|the Sparky]]. The strips often involve Meebo and Zuky being cruel to one other, usually for no reason or revenge. The strips make use of [[cartoon physics|cartoon violence]] with cartoon decapitations and dismemberments being common making this strip probably the most violent one that has ever been in The Beano. There have been many complaints about a strip where Meebo kills Zuky and cleans up his remains. Zuky appeared in the next issue. The strip also occasionally parodies film genres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beano.com/characters/meebo-zuky/downloads/meebo-and-zuky-go-plane-crazy!|title=Characters - Beano|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one strip featured [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;Beano Issue 3554&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Freddie Fear]] disappeared from [[The Beano]] in 2011, Meebo and Zuky is currently the only winner of a reader vote running in the Beano. They use a number of weapons to defeat each other, such as clubs, bombs, dynamite, steamrollers, pirahnas, sharks, mutant pirahna bees, and many others. Sometimes they trick each other into defeat, i.e., in issue 3627 (March 2012) Zuky acts as an [[estate agent]] which leads Meebo to defeat. Meebo and Zuky also have an ongoing feature in the sister comic [[BeanoMAX]] called '''Meebo &amp; Zuky's History of Violence''', also drawn by Laura Howell. It shows Meebo and Zuky being cruel to one another whilst showing history. It began in [[BeanoMAX]] issue 64 (May 2012).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Badie was born on 7 August 1943  in the industrial city of [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra|Mahalla al-Kubra]].&lt;ref name=wwho&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/whos-who-in-the-muslim-brotherhood#MuhammadBadie |title=Who's Who in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood |date=September 2012 |publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a degree in veterinary medicine at Cairo in 1965.&lt;ref name="ikhwanweb.com"&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=22669 Profile of Dr Badie: A resilient leader] Ikhwan, Retrieved 25 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, he was arrested for the first time for his political activity in the Muslim Brotherhood, along with Muslim Brotherhood leader [[Sayyed Qutb]], during a nationwide roundup of activists; he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a military tribunal.&lt;ref name="ikhwanweb.com"/&gt; After 9 years, he was paroled along with almost all other Brotherhood prisoners in 1974 by the Egyptian president, [[Anwar El Sadat|Anwar al-Sadat]]. Badi'e went on to continue his studies and begin a teaching career at various Egyptian universities. He became a part-time professor of pathology at the veterinary school of [[Beni Suef]] University.

===2013 crisis, arrest, and trials===
In July 2013, Egyptian president [[Mohammed Morsi]], member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was removed by a [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|coup d'état]] after the [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|June protests]]. &lt;!-- TODO next few items hardly relevant today (July 2014) --&gt; A travel ban was put on Badie as well as Badie's deputy Khairat el-Shater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/03/egypt-teeters-on-brink-overthrow-as-army-deadline-is-set-to-expire |title=Morsi reportedly being held hours after being ousted as Egypt's president |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badie's arrest was ordered on 10 July 2013 for "inciting the violence in Cairo on Monday in which more than 50 people were killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23256937 |title=Egypt Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie arrest ordered |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 2013 Egypt's military-installed prosecutor general [[Hisham Barakat]] ordered his assets to be frozen.&lt;ref name="egypindep"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Asset freeze for Islamist leaders goes into action |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/asset-freeze-islamist-leaders-goes-action |work=Egypt Independent |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badie was arrested on 20 August 2013.&lt;ref name="19augao"&gt;{{Cite news |title=VIDEO: Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Badie arrested |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/79488.aspx |work=[[Ahram Online]] |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/08/20/Egyp-st-Muslim-Brotherhood-Supreme-Guide-Mohamed-Badie-arrested.html |title=Egypt's Brotherhood General Guide Mohammad Badie detained |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two deputies were also arrested and he was due to stand trial on 25 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/egypt-badie-muslim-brotherhood-detained |title=Egypt: Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie reported detained |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/25-egyptian-police-recruits-gunned-down-by-militants-in-sinai-mubarak-could-be-released/2013/08/19/dc77447e-08bf-11e3-8974-f97ab3b3c677_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=Egypt arrests Brotherhood spiritual leader; Mubarak could be released |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badie was succeeded as the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide by [[Mahmoud Ezzat (Muslim Brotherhood)|Mahmoud Ezzat]] on a temporary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/08/21/Mahmoud-Ezzat-named-Muslim-Brotherhood-s-new-leader.html |title=Mahmoud Ezzat named Muslim Brotherhood’s new leader |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badie then has been tried in the following cases:

* On 7 June 2014, 47 defendants (ten of them ''in absentia'') including Badie were tried at the Criminal Court of [[Shubra el-Kheima]] for inciting murder and violence, cutting off roads, threatening public order, and resisting authorities, especially referring to a demonstration in the town of [[Qalyub]] in July 2013 (notably blocking a highway),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thecairopost.com/news/108396/news/badies-qalyub-highway-case-postponed-to-may-7 |title=Badie's 'Qalyub highway' case postponed to May 7 |last= |first= |newspaper=[[The Cairo Post]] |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the course of which at least two people were killed.

* On 15 July 2013, five persons died in clashes in [[Giza]], notably in the ''Al-Bahr Al-Azam'' area near a police building.

==Statements ==

===Israel===
In a weekly [[sermon]], titled "How Islam Confronts the Oppression and Tyranny [against the Muslims]," Mohammed Badie accused the Arab and Muslim regimes of avoiding confrontation with "the [[Zionist]] entity" and the [[United States]], and also of disregarding "[[Allah|Allah's]] commandment to wage jihad for His sake with [their] money and [their] lives, so that Allah's word will reign supreme and the [[infidel]]s' word will be inferior." Badie stated that the U.S. is immoral and doomed to collapse. He accused the [[Palestinian Authority]] of "selling out" the [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] cause, adding that a third [[:wikt:intifada|intifada]] was about to erupt. Badie also stated that "Resistance is the only solution against the Zio-American arrogance and tyranny, and all we need is for the Arab and Muslim peoples to stand behind it and support it."&lt;ref name=MEMRI&gt;{{cite web |title=Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide: 'The U.S. Is Now Experiencing the Beginning of Its End'; Improvement and Change in the Muslim World 'Can Only Be Attained Through Jihad and Sacrifice' |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4650.htm |work=MEMRI |accessdate=10 July 2012 |date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel Hayom"&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood leader: Israelis are rapists of Jerusalem |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=4983 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |newspaper=Israel Hayom |date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"&gt;{{cite web |title=Terrorism: Muslim Brotherhood |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/muslimbrotherhood.html |accessdate=10 July 2012}}{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, during his weekly sermon, Mohammed Badie stated that [[Israelis]] are "rapists" of [[Jerusalem]], and called on all Muslims to "wage [[jihad]] with their money and their selves to free [[al-Quds]]." He described the creation of Israel in international law as an "alleged, illusory right."&lt;ref name="Israel Hayom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Algemeiner"&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Brotherhood Leader Calls Israelis Rapists |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/09/egypt%E2%80%99s-muslim-brotherhood-leader-calls-israelis-rapists/ |accessdate=10 July 2012 |newspaper=The Algemeiner |date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Blaze Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=Sharona |title=Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s Leader Says Jihad on Israel Is Every Muslim's Duty |url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/egyptian-muslim-brotherhood%E2%80%99s-leader-says-jihad-on-israel-is-every-muslim%E2%80%99s-duty/ |accessdate=10 July 2012 |newspaper=The Blaze |date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Badie alleged that "The Jews have dominated the land, spread corruption on earth, spilled the blood of believers and in their actions profaned holy places, including their own." As such, he demanded that the Arab world reject negotiations with Israel in favour of "holy Jihad," saying that "the Zionists only understand force" and while alleging that allowing Jews to pray on the [[Temple Mount]], Judaism's holiest site, would result in the destruction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].&lt;ref name="The Blaze Miller"&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Elhanan |title='Holy Jihad' is the only way to deal with Israel, says Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood chief |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/holy-jihad-is-the-only-way-to-deal-with-israel-says-egypts-muslim-brotherhood-chief/ |accessdate=11 October 2012 |newspaper=The Times of Israel |date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Pillar of Defense===
Badei denounced peace efforts with Israel, urging holy war against Israel, on 22 November 2012—just a day after Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi succeeded in brokering a truce to end eight days of Israel-Hamas [[fighting]]. Badei says "jihad is obligatory" for Muslims and that peace deals with Israel are a "game of grand deception." He says there's been enough negotiations, the "enemy knows nothing but the language of force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/t/story/egypt-brotherhood-leader-blasts-peace-israel-17785651 |title=Egypt Brotherhood Leader Blasts Peace with Israel |agency=Associated Press, |publisher=ABC News |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overthrow of Mohamed Morsi===
In July 2013, Badei condemned the removal of Egyptian president [[Mohamed Morsi]] by the Egyptian military stating "I swear by God that what [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|(Gen. Abdel-Fattah) al-Sissi]] did in Egypt is more criminal than if he had carried an axe and demolished the holy [[Kaaba]], stone by stone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/07/26/MB-leader-Mursi-ouster-worse-than-destroying-Islam-s-holiest-shrine-.html |title=MB leader: Mursi's ouster worse than destroying Islam's holiest shrine |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Nariman Jamshedji "Nari" Contractor''' {{audio|Nari_Contractor.ogg|pronunciation}} (born 7 March 1934, [[Godhra]], [[Gujarat]]) is a former [[cricket]] player, who was a left-handed opening [[batsman]]. His professional career finished after a serious injury.

==Cricket career==
Contractor began his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] career, playing for the [[Gujarat]]. The captain of Gujarat Phiroz Khambata saw how Nari played in the selection trial matches for [[MCA's Silver Jubilee]] matches in 1955. He did well in the trials and expected to be selected for the matches against Pakistan Services &amp; Bhawalpur Cricket Association. He got to the team because Captain Kambatha had dropped out. Contractor scored hundreds in both innings of his debut, becoming the second man after [[Arthur Morris]] to do so.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waingankar |first1=Makarand |authorlink1=Makarand Waingankar |title=Nari Contractor: The man who laughed at his own misfortune |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/new-zealand-in-india-2016/top-stories/Nari-Contractor-The-man-who-laughed-at-his-own-misfortune/articleshow/12697426.cms |website=The Times of India |date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he was chosen to play for India. Nari became an opener after one of the players [[Vinoo Mankad]] couldn't take part in a Test match against New Zealand at [[Delhi]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt; Later he became an Indian captain.

At [[Lord's]] in 1959, he broke two ribs in the first innings by [[Brian Statham]], despite which he scored 81. Later in the year, his 74 in the second innings at Kanpur was crucial in India winning its first Test against Australia. This innings ended when he pulled [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who was bowling left-arm spin at the time. [[Neil Harvey]] at short leg ducked and turned, but the ball got stuck between his legs.

==Injury and consequences==

Contractor led India to a [[English cricket team in India in 1961–62|series win against England]] in 1961–62 and captained the side to [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 1961–62|Caribbean the same season]]. There, in a tour match against [[Barbados national cricket team|Barbados]] at the [[Kensington Oval]] in [[Bridgetown]], in March 1962, he was on 2 [[not out]] while opening the batting with [[Dilip Sardesai]] during his side's first innings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Barbados v Indians, India in West Indies 1961/62 |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25347.html |website=CricketArchive |accessdate=31 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215823/http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25347.html |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when his attention was for a moment distracted as he faced [[Charlie Griffith]] in the fourth ball of the second over. He saw somebody open a window in the [[Cricket pavilion|pavilion]], and consequently was unable concentrate on the ball following its delivery by Griffith, seeing the ball "just inches away before it hit" him.&lt;ref name="ParsiKhabar"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nari Contractor: ‘I don’t mind living it all over again’ |url=http://parsikhabar.net/individuals/nari-contractor-i-dont-mind-living-it-all-over-again/1443 |website=Parsi Khabar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623100513/http://parsikhabar.net:80/individuals/nari-contractor-i-dont-mind-living-it-all-over-again/1443/ |archivedate=23 June 2010 |date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contractor took a blow at the back of his skull&lt;ref name=mid-nari&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2012/mar/200312-sports-50-years-on-Nari-recalls-near-fatal-blow.htm |author=Murzello, Clayton |title=50 years on, Nari recalls near fatal blow |work=Mid-Day |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; fracturing it. A blood clot had developed inside his skull and pressing against the brain paralyzing him from the waist down. Two surgeries were performed to remove the clot. Requiring [[blood transfusion]] for the purpose, the West Indies captain [[Frank Worrell]] donated blood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Silva |first1=A.

In a recent interview, he mentioned as his only regret that he wanted play just ''one'' Test after the injury, but people did not want him to.&lt;ref name="ParsiKhabar"/&gt;

At the time Contractor was seriously injured, cricket batsmen did not wear helmets. They do now.

During his playing days, Contractor was considered a glamour boy of Indian cricket. In an interview with [[Simi Garewal]] in 1999, former Tamil Nadu chief minister [[Jayalalithaa]] stated that as a school girl she had a crush on Contractor.

==Present time==

Contractor now lives in [[Mumbai]] where he coaches at the [[Cricket Club of India]] Academy. He received the C.K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/article2054130.ece C.K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award for Durrani] Retrieved 26 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Durousseau''' (born August 11, 1970)&lt;ref name="DOC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.state.fl.us/ActiveInmates/inmateaction.asp?DataAction=GetInmate&amp;DCNumber=J19087 |title=Inmate Population Information Detail - Paul Durousseau |publisher=[[Florida Department of Corrections]] |accessdate=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] who [[murder]]ed seven young women (including two who were [[pregnant]]) in the southeastern United States between 1997 and 2003. [[Germany|German]] authorities suspect he may have killed several local women when he was stationed there with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during the early 1990s. Typically, Durousseau would gain the victim's trust, enter the victim's home, tie their hands, [[rape]], then [[Strangling|strangle]] them to death.&lt;ref name="radford"&gt;Ferguson, George, Emily Downing, Kaylor Eutsler, &amp; David Disque.

== Personal life ==
Paul Durousseau was born in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Texas]]. In 1971, he moved in with his mother's family in [[Los Angeles]] after his father, unwed to his mother, deserted them. Little else is known publicly about Durousseau's childhood. After graduating high school, 19-year-old Durousseau found himself working as a security guard. His first offenses as an adult took place on December 18, 1991 and January 21, 1992 for [[Concealed carry in the United States|carrying a concealed firearm]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name="jacksonville.com"&gt;{{cite web | last = Chapin | first = Veronica | title = Cabdriver arrested in 6 serial killings | work = jacksonville.com | publisher = The Florida Times-Union | date = 18 June 2003 | url = http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/061803/met_12819930.shtml | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1992, Durousseau enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]&lt;ref name="jacksonville.com"/&gt; and was stationed in [[Germany]], where he met Natoca, who would later become his wife. The two married in 1995 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. In 1996, they were transferred to [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. On March 13, 1997, Durousseau was arrested for [[kidnapping]] and [[Rape|raping]] a young woman. However, in August of that year he was cleared of those charges. Soon after, he was found in possession of stolen goods. He was [[court-martial]]ed in January 1999, found guilty and [[Dishonorable discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorably discharged]] from the Army.&lt;ref name="trutv.com"&gt;{{cite web | last =Bell | first =Rachael | title =Paul Durousseau, the Jacksonville Serial Killer  | work =Crime Library | publisher =truTV | date = | url =http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/paul_durousseau/index.html | accessdate =6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

Durousseau and his wife moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], where they had two daughters. It was during that period that he committed most of the murders. He struggled to keep jobs and make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights over the issue of finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a [[restraining order]] after he allegedly slapped her in the face and grabbed her by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry when she talked about getting a [[divorce]]. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for [[Domestic violence|domestic battery]].&lt;ref name="trutv.com"/&gt;

Durousseau still managed to hold various legitimate jobs. In 2001, he was hired as a school bus driver and an animal control worker despite being a convicted felon. In 2003, he worked as a [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver and it is now accepted that this is how he first came into contact with some of his victims. It was erroneously reported that Gator City Taxi Company failed to run a background check on Durousseau;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2003/07/21/story4.html | first=Paul | last=Ivice | publisher=Jacksonville Business Journal |title=Gator City Taxi sued in 3 deaths | date=July 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the City of Jacksonville was responsible for the background check, and issued Durousseau's taxi driver permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coj.net/departments/parking-facilities-and-enforcement/motor-vehicle-inspections.aspx |title=Vehicle For Hire and Driver Certifications |website=coj.net |publisher= |accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbors and friends described Durousseau as a "lewd womanizer". He often asked young women when they planned to "make flicks" with him. A witness recalled Durousseau hitting on a girl that appeared to be around 13 or 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Treen | first = Dana | title = Accused killer was lewd, say neighbors | work = jacksonville.com | publisher = The Florida Times-Union | date = 19 June 2003 | url =http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/061903/met_12829524.shtml | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology of the murders ==
Less than one month after the [[acquittal]] over the rape charges, the nude body of 26-year-old Tracy Habersham was found on September 7, 1997 in [[Fort Benning]].&lt;ref name="news4jax.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Suspected Serial Killer Under Arrest | work = News4Jax.com | publisher = WJXT | date = 18 June 2003 | url = http://www.news4jax.com/news/2275524/detail.html | accessdate =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100714151920/http://www.news4jax.com/news/2275524/detail.html | archivedate = 14 July 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been missing for 48 hours and was last seen leaving a party. She had been [[rape]]d and [[strangulation|strangled]] to death with a cord. Durousseau was not a suspect in the murder, but [[DNA profiling|DNA]] would later tie him to the crime. He later confessed to Habersham's killing after his arrest.&lt;ref name="jacksonville.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Serial murder suspect linked to 1997 murder in Columbus, Ga. | work = First Coast News | publisher = Gannett Broadcasting | date = 19 June 2003 | url = http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/news-article.aspx?storyid=5133 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Durousseau raped and killed 24-year-old Tyresa Mack in her apartment. Witnesses saw him leave her place with a television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pysih.com/paul-durousseau/ |title=Paul Durousseau |date=June 11, 2007 |website=pysih.com |publisher= |accessdate=October 10, 2014}}{{Verify credibility|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he was arrested for raping a young woman in Jacksonville. He spent 30 days in jail and received two years' [[probation]]. On December 19, 2002, 18-year-old Nicole L. Williams' body was found wrapped in a blue blanket at the bottom of a ditch in Jacksonville. She had been reported missing two days earlier.&lt;ref name="news4jax.com"/&gt;

On January 1, 2003, family members of 19-year-old Nikia Kilpatrick went to check on her. They had not had any news from her for several days. They found her body in the bedroom of her apartment. She had been raped then killed by strangulation with a cord two days before. Her two sons, an eleven-month-old and a two-year-old, were alive but [[Malnutrition|malnourished]]. Kilpatrick was approximately six months pregnant at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="trutv.com" /&gt; Eight days later, 20-year-old [[Certified Nurse Assistant|nurse assistant]] Shawanda Denise McCalister, who was also pregnant at the time of her death, was raped and strangled in her Jacksonville apartment. The murder scene was almost identical to that of Kilpatrick. She was killed on Durousseau's first day of driving a cab for Gator City Taxi. Her body was found the following day.

The next two victims were 17-year-old Jovanna Jefferson, and 19-year-old Surita Cohen. Their bodies were found close to each other in a ditch next to a construction site on New Kings Road in Jacksonville on February 5. Police estimated that Jefferson was murdered around January 20 and Cohen was killed 10 days later. Witnesses recount having seen the two last victims with a taxi driver fitting Paul Durousseau's description on the night they disappeared.

Durousseau was arrested and charged with five counts of murder on June 17, 2003. On December 13, 2007 he was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] by [[lethal injection]] for the murder of Tyresa Mack. As of August 18, 2013, he was still a resident on Florida's death row at [[Union Correctional Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inmate Population Information Detail|url=http://www.dc.state.fl.us/activeinmates/detail.asp?Bookmark=1&amp;From=list&amp;SessionID=534230036|work=5/26/2013|publisher=Florida Department of Corrections|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Durousseau's death sentence was overturned by the [[Florida Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news4jax.com/news/florida-supreme-court-tosses-taxi-driver-killers-death-sentence&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Deunov''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|n|ɒ|v}} ({{lang-bg|Петър Дънов}}, {{IPA-bg|'pɛtər 'dɤnof|IPA}}; July 11, 1864 – December 27, 1944), also known by his spiritual name '''Beinsa Douno''' ({{lang-bg|Беинса Дуно}}, {{IPA-bg|bɛinˈsа duˈnɔ|}}), and often called the Master by his followers, was a [[Bulgaria]]n philosopher and spiritual teacher who developed a form of [[Esoteric Christianity]] known as the [[Universal White Brotherhood]]. He is widely known in Bulgaria, where he was voted second by the public in the ''Great Bulgarians'' TV show on Bulgarian National Television (2006-2007) after the [[BBC]] format.&lt;ref name=BNT-100&gt;Bulgarian National Television - "The Great Bulgarians", http://welcome.bnt.bg/movies/velikitebg.php?id=12, Accessed July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Deunov is also featured in Pantev and Gavrilov's ''The 100 Most Influential Bulgarians in Our History'' (ranked in 37th place).&lt;ref name=the-100&gt;Pantev, A.L. and Gavrilov, B.G., ''The 100 Most Influential Bulgarians in Our History'' (in Bulgarian “100-те най-влиятелни българи в нашата история”), Reporter, 1997, Bulgaria, 328 pp., {{ISBN|9548102242}}, 9789548102247&lt;/ref&gt; According to Petrov, Peter Deunov is “the most published Bulgarian author to this day.”&lt;ref name=drews-history&gt;Petrov, N., "Drew's Global Heritage: History of International Students", ''Peter Deunov: An Early Graduate from Bulgaria'', Drew Theological School, http://www.drew.edu/theological/2012/01/drews-global-heritage-history-of-international-students-at-drew-theological-school#bulgaria, Accessed 24 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Peter Deunov was born in the village of Hadardja (now Nikolaevka in [[Suvorovo Municipality]]) near [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]] on July 11, 1864, the third child of Konstantin Dunovsky and Dobra Atanasova Georgieva. His father was the first Bulgarian teacher in the region before becoming a Bulgarian [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest. He was one of the first to present the [[liturgy]] in Bulgarian, the language of the local people, rather than the traditional sacred language of Church Slavonic (Old Bulgarian).&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;Kraleva, M., ''The Master Peter Deunov: His Life and Teaching'', Kibea, 2001, Bulgaria; {{ISBN|954-47426-89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deunov attended secondary school in [[Varna]] and the American [[Methodist]] School of Theology and Science in [[Svishtov]], from which he graduated in 1886. He worked as a primary school teacher for a year before leaving for the United States, where he studied theology at [[Drew Theological Seminary]] in [[Madison, New Jersey]], from 1888 to May 1892. After graduating from Drew, in the fall of 1892 he enrolled in the [[Boston University School of Theology]] and obtained his degree in June 1893 with a thesis on "The Migration of the Germanic Tribes and Their Christianisation" (published in 2007&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;Peter Dunoff, ''The Migration of the Teutonic Tribes and Their Conversion to Christianity: Boston University School of Theology Thesis, 1893'', St. Kliment Ohridski University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-954-07-2645-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He was a regular student at the School of Medicine of [[Boston University]] for a year, before returning to Bulgaria in 1895.

=== Return to Bulgaria ===
Upon his return to Bulgaria Deunov was offered the position of a Methodist pastor in the city of [[Yambol]]. This offer was withdrawn after he stipulated he would only serve without remuneration. In 1896 he published ''Science and Education'', in which he analyzed the development of mankind into a new culture, which he thought was bound to take place during the forthcoming century. After the turn of the century, Deunov began to travel throughout Bulgaria for several years, giving talks and undertaking [[phrenology|phrenological research]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He met with a wide circle of people. Among them were his first three disciples, who had belonged to different branches of Christianity – Todor Stoimenov ([[Eastern Orthodox]]), Dr. Mirkovich ([[Catholic]]) and Penyu Kirov ([[Protestant]]). After a long correspondence, all of them met in Varna during 19–23 July 1900. It is considered the first annual convention of what later became a spiritual community that lasted until the end of Deunov's life. Deunov eventually settled in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, and began giving lectures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1914 he gave his first public lecture, ''Behold, the Man!'' (''Ecce Homo'' in Latin), published later in the series ''Power and Life''. Deunov began to give regular Sunday lectures which were based on the elaboration and explanation of a [[Biblical]] passage. 
[[File:Sofia-peter-deunov-grave-5.jpg|thumb|200px| Grave of Peter Deunov in "[[Izgrev, Sofia|Izgrev]]" estate, Sofia, Bulgaria ]]
In 1921 the community ''Izgrev'' (Sunrise) was established. A site at what were then the outskirts of Sofia, it was the gathering place in the mornings for Deunov and his disciples. Many followers started building nearby and the place eventually became the center of a large spiritual community. Deunov gave lectures in the newly constructed Lecture Hall. In 1922 he initiated two new streams of specialized lectures in addition to the Sunday lectures, and from 1930 began delivering “morning talks” on Sunday mornings before dawn. The themes of the different lecture streams were wide-ranging and encompassed, among others: [[religion]], [[music]], [[geometry]], [[astrology]], [[philosophy]] and [[esotericism|esoteric science]]. Overall, Deunov gave approximately 3700 lectures in the three decades between 1914 and 1944. His thoughts were also recorded in talks, private conversations, and early letters.&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;Kovachev, T., ''The Master Beinsa Douno: A catalog of the lectures, prayers, musical exercises, Paneurhythmy, gymnastic exercises (1896-1944)'' (in Bulgarian, “Учителя Беинса Дуно. Справочник на беседите и лекциите, молитвите, музикалните упражнения, Паневритмията, гимнастическите упражнения (1896–1944)”), 2004, Sofia, Bulgaria; {{ISBN|954-9589-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paneurhythmy ===
[[File:Panevritmia do Babreka.jpg|alt= Paneurhythmy being performed near Bubreka (Kidney) lake in Rila|thumb|Paneurhythmy near Bubreka (Kidney) lake in [[Rila]]|left|187x187px]]

In 1932, he developed Paneurhythmy exercises: a sequence of exercises performed to music, to achieve inner balance and harmonization. This practice promotes the processes of self-perfecting, expanding of the consciousness and attaining of virtues. The circle dance, is a conscious interchange between human beings and the forces of living nature. Each movement is the expression of a thought. The effect should be that the observer picks up from the movements, the thought or the idea they express. The rhythm in the movement of the physical body leads us to one in our spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rZTiZbTYeUWAN_EXBihgi4wqwFTXoXz|title=Paneurhythmy - video tutorial 2007 - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etymologically, "Pan-Eu-Rhythmy" is derived from three roots: 
*Pan - meaning Whole; Universal and Cosmic. 
*Eu - meaning True or Supreme; the essential and substantial in the world. 
*Rhythmy - meaning correctness in the movements and in every other external expression in life.

=== Late life ===
On March 22, 1939 he wrote a message to his disciples entitled "The Eternal Covenant of the Spirit." At the beginning of 1944, during the air bombardments over Sofia, he organized the evacuation to the village of [[Marchaevo]] (24&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Sofia) and settled in the home (now museum) of his pupil [[Temelko Gyorev]]. He returned to [[Izgrev, Sofia|Izgrev]] on October 19, 1944. On December 20, 1944, he delivered the lecture "The Last Word" to the Common Occult Class and passed away on 27 December.&lt;ref name="paneurhythmy"&gt;''Beinsa Douno: Paneurhythmy - Music, Ideas, Movements (step by step description)'', Bialo Bratstvo Publishers, 2004, Sofia, Bulgaria.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Several thousand of Deunov's lectures were recorded by stenographers and are documented in the form of deciphered [[stenography|stenograms]] (some modified by editing and others left intact &lt;ref name=topic2&gt;Christophorus, Answers on important topics, ''Topic 2: About the original Word of the Master Peter Deunov (Beinsa Douno)'', http://www.beinsa-douno.net/important-topics.html#topic2_original_Word, Accessed July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;). These contain the essence of Deunov's teaching. There are also a number of songs and prayers, among which ''The Good Prayer'' from 1900 is regarded as the most special.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

*[[Albert Einstein]] famously said "''The whole world bows down before me. I bow down before the master Peter Deunov''".&lt;ref name="How One Man Saved Bulgaria's Jews"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/21978/how-one-man-saved-bulgarias-jews|title=How One Man Saved Bulgaria's Jews|date=2009-06-15|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Prophet-Our-Times-Teachings-Deunov-ebook/dp/B00Z6W0BII|title=Prophet for Our Times: The Life and Teachings of Peter Deunov|last=Lorimer|first=Peter|date=2015-09-08|publisher=Hay House UK|editor-last=Lorimer|editor-first=David|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sekl Loeb Wormser''' (1768&amp;ndash;1846)&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia|title=BA'AL SHEM|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2249-ba-al-shem|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[rabbi]], [[talmudist]], [[kabbalist]],&lt;ref name=Scholem/&gt; and [[Baal Shem]] (worker of miracles through the [[Name of God in Judaism|Name of God]]).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

He was born in [[Michelstadt]]. He received his talmudic education in [[Frankfurt]], in the [[yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Nathan Adler]], and following in the latter's footsteps, accepted an [[Asceticism in Judaism|ascetic]] way of life and turned to kabbalistic studies.&lt;ref name=Scholem/&gt; He resided in Frankfurt for a duration of 6 years, during which he married his first wife.&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt; About 1790,&lt;ref name=Scholem/&gt; he returned with his wife&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt; to Michelstadt where he maintained a yeshiva for many years (serving as ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' and instructing around 70 students in [[Tanakh]], Talmud, and the works of the ''[[poskim]]'', as well as secular subjects including [[German language|German]] and [[mathematics]]&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt;) and served, at first unofficially, until 1822 as a recognized district rabbi. About 1810, after his wife's death, he lived for some time in [[Mannheim]]. For years, his "[[hasidic]]" behavior and extreme [[Jewish vegetarianism|vegetarianism]] (at age 18 he vowed to abstain from animal products; a promise he kept until his death&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt;) created tension between him and the majority of his small community, but his reputation as a Baal Shem spread rapidly&lt;ref name=Scholem/&gt; and Wormser became known throughout Germany as the Michelstadter Ba'al Shem,&lt;ref name=je/&gt; or the "Ba'al Shem of Michelstadt." He denied any such [[supernatural]] power but agreed to receive people who sought his advice and guidance, giving them [[natural remedies]] and sometimes [[Amulet#Judaism|amulets]]. (He often said that whatever he does is done naturally and ''[[b'Ezrat HaShem]]''&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt;). He became particularly known for his treatment of [[lunatic]]s. Among the Jews of southern Germany many traditions survived regarding his miraculous cures and other feats.&lt;ref name=Scholem/&gt; It was in Mannheim that he married his second wife.&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt; He studied [[German philosophy]] and was particularly attracted by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;ref name=Scholem/&gt; In 1822, he returned to Michelstadt.&lt;ref name=Illoway/&gt; In 1825, his house and large library were destroyed by fire. Of his talmudic writings, preserved by his descendants, almost nothing was published. A catalogue of his second library is preserved in Ms. Heidenheim 206, in the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich|Central Library of Zürich]].&lt;ref name=Scholem&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Scholem|first=Gershom|author-link=Gershom Scholem|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=WORMSER, SECKEL|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21110.html|access-date=March 8, 2015|year=2008|publisher=[[American–Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]]|publication-date=2013}}&lt;br/&gt;'''''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' bibliography''':

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17317">[[File:Sommelier F.I.S.A.R..jpg|thumb|A sommelier with a [[tastevin]] around his neck]]
A '''sommelier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|m|əl|j|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ʌ|m|əl|ˈ|j|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|sɔməlje}}), or '''wine steward''', is a trained and knowledgeable [[wine]] professional, normally working in fine [[restaurant]]s, who specializes in all aspects of wine service as well as [[wine and food pairing]]. The role in [[haute cuisine|fine dining]] today is much more specialized and informed than that of a wine waiter.  Sommeliers Australia states that the role is strategically on par with that of the ''[[chef de cuisine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommeliers.com.au/about.aspx?pageID=390 What is a sommelier?] Sommeliers Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Sommelier Knife2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[sommelier knife]] is an important tool of the sommelier.]]
[[Image:Tastevin.jpg|thumb|right|The [[tastevin]] vessel used by sommeliers in the past and still a symbol today]]

A sommelier may be responsible for the development of wine lists, and books&lt;ref name=OCW-sommelier&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''The Oxford Companion to Wine''|title= sommelier|url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=3001|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120130191826/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=3001|archivedate= 2012-01-30|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the delivery of wine service and training for the other restaurant staff.  Working along with the culinary team, they [[Wine and food matching|pair and suggest wines]] that will best complement each particular food menu item. This entails the need for a deep knowledge of how food and wine, beer, spirits and other beverages work in harmony. A professional sommelier also works on the floor of the restaurant and is in direct contact with restaurant [[patron]]s. The sommelier has a responsibility to work within the taste preference and budget parameters of the patron.

In modern times, a sommelier's role may be considered broader than working only with wines, and may encompass all aspects of the restaurant's service, with an enhanced focus on wines, beers, spirits, soft-drinks, cocktails, mineral waters, and tobaccos.

==Etymology==
The modern word is [[French language|French]], deriving from [[Middle French]] where it referred to a court official charged with transportation of supplies.&lt;ref name=mwsomm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sommelier|title= sommelier|accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher= The Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This use of the term dates to a period when [[pack animal]]s would be used to transport supplies.  The Middle French probably finds its origin in [[Old Provençal]] where a ''saumalier'' was a pack animal driver.&lt;ref name=mwsomm/&gt; ''Sauma'' referred to a pack animal or the load of a pack animal. In [[Late Latin]], ''sagma'' referred to a packsaddle.&lt;ref name=mwsomm/&gt;

==Education and certification==
[[File:Tecklenburg Natalie Lumpp 01.JPG|thumb|[[:de:Natalie Lumpp|Natalie Lumpp]], noted German sommelier, who came up through the hotel industry.]]
Though 'sommelier' is a job title potentially anyone may claim, becoming a professional certified sommelier often requires some combination of experience, training, formal education (a bachelor's degree is not required, but individuals may do a two-year associate degree), classes and examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Become a Sommelier – Education and Career Information|url=http://study.com/articles/Become_a_Sommelier_Education_and_Career_Information.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to become a sommelier by starting at the entry level in the hospitality or wine industry and working up, though many choose to become educated and professionally certified by one (or more) of the many certifying bodies.  Various certifications are offered by a wide range of educators. A very basic education in wine may be attained over the course of months at a cost in the hundreds of dollars, but advanced professional certification typically requires years of study, practice and experience costing thousands of dollars. It has been noted that a thorough education in wine is still less expensive than typical [[graduate school]] costs in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bianca Bosker]], ''Cork Dork'', [[Penguin Books]] 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union de la Sommellerie Française===

In [[France]], the ''Union des Sommeliers''&lt;ref name="UDSF"&gt;[http://www.sommelier-france.org/udsf/historique-de-lunion-de-la-sommellerie-francaise Union De la Sommellerie Française] - Historique (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; (UDS) was founded in 1907 to ensure social protection for its members, both sommeliers and cellar masters in [[Paris]] region. The approach and role of the association developed throughout the years as it lost its autonomy by merging with the ''Mutualité Hôtelière'' in 1959.&lt;ref name="UDSF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.champchefs.com/retrospectives/paris-a-century-of-history.html Champchefs] - Paris a century of history&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, sommeliers regained their independence as the ''Association des Sommeliers de Paris'' (ASP) was founded in 1969.&lt;ref name="UDSF" /&gt; In the same year the ''[[Association de la Sommellerie Internationale]]'' (ASI) was created and federated other organisations in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommellerie-internationale.com/en/about_asi/ Association de la Sommellerie Internationale] - About ASI&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1970 the old UDS was renamed in ''Union de la Sommellerie Française'', UDSF, which supervises today the 21 regional associations in France (including ASP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommeliers-international.com/en/udsf/French-Sommellerie.aspx www.sommmeliers-international.com] - UDSF&lt;/ref&gt; The title of ''Mention Complémentaire Sommellerie'' (MCS) and ''Brevet Professionnel de Sommelier'' (BP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommelier-france.org/metier/formations Union De la Sommellerie Française - Le Metier] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; can be achieved studying for many different approved providers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommelier-france.org/metier/les-ecoles Union De la Sommellerie Française] - Les Ecoles (in french)&lt;/ref&gt; and the final qualification of ''Maître Sommelier''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommelier-france.org/udsf/maitre-sommelier Union De la Sommellerie Française - Maitre Sommelier] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; can be achieved after an accurate career assessment, requiring at least 10 years of professional experience.

===The Court of Master Sommeliers===

The [[Court of Master Sommeliers]] (CMS), established in 1977, is an independent examining body that offers the 'Master Sommelier Diploma', the 'Advanced Sommelier Certificate', the 'Certified Sommelier Certificate', and the 'Introductory Sommelier Certificate'.

===North American Sommelier Association===

The North American Sommelier Association was founded in 2006 and is the official representative in the United States and Canada of the Worldwide Sommelier Association (WSA). Its Certified Sommelier course is divided into three phases but is offered as one entire course and includes extensive class time, lectures, educational visits to wineries, and educational dinners. Unlike other groups, NASA has only two tiers of Sommelier qualification: Silver-Pin and Gold-Pin. The Gold-Pin qualification is obtained through a series of extensive requirements and certifications (Master Wine Taster, Master Of Service...) as well as proof of experience in the industry. Aside from the Sommelier Certification, NASA also provides various smaller proprietary specialization courses , such as 'Italian Wine Specialist', 'American Wine Specialist', 'Spanish Wine Specialist' and various master-classes such as 'Master Of Terroir', 'Master of Sangiovese', 'Master of Service', and 'Master Wine Taster'.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

They offer five levels of wine certification. To earn a sommelier pin, one must complete level three certification. To earn the advanced sommelier pin, the student must complete the level four certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Guide to Wine Certifications in America: Sommelier Programs in the United States|url=http://www.somm.us/certifications/|website=Sommelier Schools and Certifications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sommelier Certification: National Wine School|url=http://www.somm.us/national-wine-school/|website=Sommelier Schools and Certifications|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commission of European Sommeliers ===
The Commission of European Sommeliers Bulgaria (CES, BG) is Eastern Europe's main wine qualification. It began in 1997 offering European and International students a more cost effective qualification comparable to the quality of other more established wine qualifications.  Their entry level qualification, ‘Certified Sommelier’  takes 10 days to complete, inclusive of two exams. The ‘Advanced Sommelier’ course and ‘Master Sommelier’ course both take an additional 8 days.  There is one Prof. and Master Sommelier conducting the courses that take place only twice annually in [[Septemvri]], [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commissionofeuropeansommeliers.bg|title=Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wangarĩ Muta Maathai''' (wà&lt;sup&gt;ŋ&lt;/sup&gt;ɡàˈɹɛ |m|ɑː|ˈ|t|aɪ; 1 April 1940&amp;nbsp;– 25 September 2011) was a Kenyan [[Natural environment|environment]]al political activist and Nobel laureate. She was educated in the United States at Mount St. Scholastica ([[Benedictine College]]) and the [[University of Pittsburgh]], as well as the [[University of Nairobi]] in Kenya.

In 1977, Maathai founded the [[Green Belt Movement]], an environmental non-governmental organization focused on the planting of trees, [[environmental conservation]], and [[women's rights]]. In 1984, she was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]], and in 2004, she became the first African woman to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for "her contribution to [[sustainable development]], democracy and peace." Maathai was an elected [[National Assembly of Kenya|member of Parliament]] and served as assistant minister for [[Natural environment|Environment]] and [[Natural resource]]s in the government of President [[Mwai Kibaki]] between January 2003 and November 2005. She was an Honorary Councillor of the [[World Future Council]]. She was affiliated to professional bodies and received several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/wangari-maathai/biography|title=Biography {{!}} The Green Belt Movement|last=http://www.cstraight.com|first=Cstraight Media -|website=www.greenbeltmovement.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Maathai died of complications from [[ovarian cancer]].

==Early life and education==
On 1 April 1940, Maathai was born in the village of Ihithe, [[Nyeri District]], in the [[Central Province (Kenya)|central highlands]] of the [[colony of Kenya]]. Her family was [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the most populous [[List of ethnic groups of Kenya|ethnic group in Kenya]], and had lived in the area for several generations.&lt;ref&gt;Wangari Maathai, ''Unbowed: A Memoir'', [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-307-26348-7}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1943, Maathai's family relocated to a White-owned farm in the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]], near the town of [[Nakuru]], where her father had found work.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1947, she returned to Ihithe with her mother, as two of her brothers were attending primary school in the village, and there was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked. Her father remained at the farm.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, at the age of eight, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School.

At age eleven, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a [[boarding school]] at the [[Nyeri#Religion|Mathari Catholic Mission]] in Nyeri.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Maathai studied at St. Cecilia's for four years. During this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism. She was involved with the [[Legion of Mary]], whose members attempted "to serve God by serving fellow human beings."&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying at St. Cecilia's, she was sheltered from the ongoing [[Mau Mau uprising]], which forced her mother to move from their homestead to an emergency village in Ihithe.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 63–69.&lt;/ref&gt; When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, [[Loreto High School, Limuru|Loreto High School]] in [[Limuru]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the end of East African colonialism approached, Kenyan politicians, such as [[Tom Mboya]], were proposing ways to make education in [[Western world#Modern definitions|Western nations]] available to promising students. [[John F. Kennedy]], then a [[United States Senator]], agreed to fund such a program through the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]], initiating what became known as [[the Kennedy Airlift]] or Airlift Africa. Maathai became one of some 300 Kenyans selected to study in the United States in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=Nothing is more beautiful than cultivating the land at dusk. At that time of day in the central highlands the air and the soil are cool, the sun is going down, the sunlight is golden against the ridges and the green of trees, and there is usually a breeze. As you remove the weeds and press the earth around the crops you feel content, and wish the light would last longer so you could cultivate more. Earth and water, air and waning fire of the sun combine to form the essential elements of life and reveal to me my kinship with the soil. When I was a child I sometimes became so absorbed working in the fields with my machete that I didn't notice the end of the day until it got so dark that I could no longer differentiate between the weeds and crops. At that point I knew it was time to go home, on the narrow paths that criss crossed the fields and rivers and woodlots.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', p. 47.}}

She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now [[Benedictine College]]), in [[Atchison, Kansas]], where she [[Academic major|majored]] in biology, with [[Academic minor|minors]] in chemistry and German.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving her bachelor of science degree in 1964, she studied at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for a master's degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the [[Africa-America Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and during her time in [[Pittsburgh]], she first experienced [[environmental restoration]], when local environmentalists pushed to rid the city of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences,&lt;ref name="UNCCD"&gt;[http://www.unccd.int/IYDD/documents/iydd_docs/WANGARIMAATHAICV.pdf UNCCD profile of Wangari Maathai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152236/http://www.unccd.int/IYDD/documents/iydd_docs/WANGARIMAATHAICV.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}. Retrieved 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed to a position as [[research assistant]] to a professor of zoology at [[University of Nairobi|University College of Nairobi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Kenya, Maathai dropped her forename, preferring to be known by her birth name, Wangarĩ Muta.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived at the university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else. Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, from the [[University of Giessen]] in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the [[microanatomy]] section of the newly established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College of Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1966, she met [[Mwangi Mathai]], another Kenyan who had studied in America, who would later become her husband.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; She also rented a small shop in the city, and established a general store, at which her sisters worked. In 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, she traveled to the [[University of Giessen]] in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the [[University of Munich]].

In the spring of 1969, she returned to [[Nairobi]] to continue studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer. In May, she and Mwangi Maathai married.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she became pregnant with her first child, and her husband campaigned for a seat in [[National Assembly of Kenya|Parliament]], narrowly losing. During the course of the election, Tom Mboya, who had been instrumental in founding the program which sent her overseas, was assassinated. This led to President Kenyatta effectually ending multi-party democracy in Kenya. Shortly after, her first son, Waweru, was born.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 109–11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, she became the first [[East Africa|Eastern African]] woman to receive a PhD, her doctorate in veterinary anatomy,&lt;ref name="UNCCD"/&gt; from the University College of Nairobi, which became the [[University of Nairobi]] the following year. She completed her dissertation on the development and differentiation of gonads in bovines.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter, Wanjira, was born in December 1971.

==1972–1977: Activism and political life==
Maathai continued to teach at Nairobi, becoming a senior lecturer in anatomy in 1975, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 1976 and associate professor in 1977. She was the first woman in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions.&lt;ref name="NobelBio"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2004/maathai-bio.html Wangari Maathai, the Nobel Peace Prize 2004] Nobel Foundation. Retrieved 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she campaigned for equal benefits for the women working on the staff of the university, going so far as trying to turn the academic staff association of the university into a union, in order to negotiate for benefits. The courts denied this bid, but many of her demands for equal benefits were later met.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 114–118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her work at the University of Nairobi, Maathai became involved in a number of civic organizations in the early 1970s. She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Kenya Red Cross Society]], becoming its director in 1973. She was a member of the Kenya Association of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations in the work of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK).&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 119–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box |quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=We hoped that these elections would provide the people of Kenya with a fairer and truer representation of their aspirations and beliefs. To our dismay and despair, however, the elections were the most disturbing and distorted in Kenya's history. The government introduced a highly controversial system of "queue" voting. Voters lined up behind their candidate and election officials counted each line and then told the people to go home. When election officials announced the winner, it was often the candidate with the shortest line of voters behind him! Since the voters were at home, there was nothing that could be done: The winner had been declared. The vote- rigging was so blatant that people who had lost their races were declared the winners in broad daylight with no embarrassment whatsoever on the part of the government…
I knew that we could not live with a political system that killed creativity, nurtured corruption, and produced people who were afraid of their own leaders. It would be only a matter of time before the government and I came in to further conflict…|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', pp. 182–183.}}

In 1974, Maathai's family expanded to include her third child, son Muta. Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament, hoping to represent the [[Langata Constituency|Lang'ata constituency]], and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in [[Karura Forest]]. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding. The project failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first [[Habitat I|UN conference on human settlements]], known as Habitat I, in June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 125–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Maathai spoke to the NCWK concerning her attendance at Habitat I. She proposed further tree planting, which the council supported. On 5 June 1977, marking World Environment Day, the NCWK marched in a procession from Kenyatta International Conference Centre in downtown Nairobi to Kamukunji Park on the outskirts of the city where they planted seven trees in honor of historical community leaders. This was the first "Green Belt" which was first known as the "Save the Land Harambee" and then became the [[Green Belt Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area. She agreed to pay the women a small stipend for each seedling which was later planted elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 134–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2010 book, ''Replenishing the Earth: Spiritual Values for Healing Ourselves and the World'', she discussed the impact of the Green Belt Movement, explaining that the group's civic and environmental seminars stressed "the importance of communities taking responsibility for their actions and mobilizing to address their local needs," and adding, "We all need to work hard to make a difference in our neighborhoods, regions, and countries, and in the world as a whole. That means making sure we work hard, collaborate with each other, and make ourselves better agents to change." &lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Laurie.

===1977–1979: Personal problems===
Maathai and her husband, Mwangi Mathai, separated in 1977. After a lengthy separation, Mwangi filed for divorce in 1979. Mwangi was said to have believed Wangari was "too strong-minded for a woman" and that he was "unable to control her". In addition to naming her as "cruel" in court filings, he publicly accused her of adultery with another Member of Parliament,&lt;ref name="NYTNairobiJournal"&gt;Perlez, Jane, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/world/nairobi-journal-skyscraper-s-enemy-draws-a-daily-dose-of-scorn.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Nairobi Journal; Skyscraper's Enemy Draws a Daily Dose of Scorn"], ''The New York Times'', 6 December 1989. Retrieved 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn was thought to cause his high blood pressure and the judge ruled in Mwangi's favor. Shortly after the trial, in an interview with Viva magazine, Maathai referred to the judge as either incompetent or corrupt.&lt;ref name="NYTNairobiJournal"/&gt; The interview later led the judge to charge Maathai with contempt of court. She was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail. After three days in Lang'ata Women's Prison in Nairobi, her lawyer formulated a statement which the court found sufficient for her release. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname. She chose to add an extra "a" instead of changing her name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7939651 "Conservation and Feminism: Africa's Greenheart."] ''The Economist'', 21 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 139–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The divorce had been costly, and with lawyers' fees and the loss of her husband's income, Maathai found it difficult to provide for herself and her children on her university wages. An opportunity arose to work for the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] through the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. As this job required extended travel throughout Africa and was based primarily in [[Lusaka, Zambia]], she was unable to bring her children with her. Maathai chose to send them to her ex-husband and take the job. While she visited them regularly, they lived with their father until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 151–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979–1982: Political problems===
In 1979, shortly after the divorce, Maathai ran for the position of chairperson of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), an [[umbrella organization]] consisting of many women's organizations in the country. The newly elected [[President of Kenya]], [[Daniel arap Moi]], tried to limit the amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organizations such as the NCWK. She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organization. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, [[Maendeleo Ya Wanawake]], a member organization which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organization every year until she retired from the position in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 156–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It soon became obvious that politics was at play again. The ruling party didn't want me in Parliament and had figured out a way to stop me from getting there. Once again, I decided to fight by taking the authorities to court and challenging their reason for disqualifying me, which I knew to be completely illegal. The court sat at nine o'clock on a Saturday morning, but I was required to present my candidacy papers by noon that same day in Nyeri, which is nearly a three-hour drive from Nairobi. Seeing that it would be impossible for me to meet the deadline if I drove, some friends had hired a plane to take me to Nyeri as soon as the court rendered its verdict. By the time the Judge made his final ruling, disqualifying me from running for parliament, it was nearly midday. Even with the plane and favorable ruling, I would have arrived in Nyeri too late. My case, like many others, demonstrated a miscarriage of justice that was frequent at that time in Kenya and that led me, later, to be involved in the pro-democracy movement. Once again, I had lost in court. I would not be able to run.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', pp. 161.}}

In 1982, the Parliamentary seat representing her home region of Nyeri was open, and Maathai decided to campaign for the seat. As required by law, she resigned her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality. {{Clarify|date=May 2013}} When she requested her job back, she was denied. As she lived in university housing and was no longer a staff member, she was evicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 160–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Belt Movement===
{{main|Green Belt Movement}}
Maathai moved into a small home she had purchased years before, and focused on the NCWK while she searched for employment. In the course of her work through the NCWK, she was approached by [[Wilhelm Elsrud]], executive director of the [[Norwegian Forestry Society]]. He wished to partner with the Green Belt Movement and offered her the position of coordinator. Employed again, Maathai poured her efforts into the Green Belt Movement. Along with the partnership for the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received "seed money" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women's husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 168–173.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=Although I was a highly educated woman, it did not seem odd to me to work with my hands, often with my knees on the ground, alongside rural woman. Some politicians and others in the 1980s and 1990s ridiculed me for doing so. But I had no problem with it, and the rural women both accepted and appreciated that I was working with them to improve their lives and the environment. After all, I was a child of the same soil. Education, if it means anything, should not take people away from land, but instill in them, even more, respect for it, because educated people are in a position to understand what is being lost. The future of the planet concerns all of us, and we should do what we can to protect it. As I told the foresters, and the women, you don't need a diploma to plant a tree.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', pp. 137–138.}}

The UN held the third global women's conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and [[Helvi Sipilä]], the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairman of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 175–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government intervention===
In the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement's positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 180–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-story Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in [[Uhuru Park]]. The complex was intended to house the headquarters of KANU, the Kenya Times newspaper, a trading center, offices, an auditorium, galleries, shopping malls, and parking space for 2,000 cars. The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel Arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the ''Kenya Times'', the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] or [[Central Park]] and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 184–188.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=When I see Uhuru Park and contemplate its meaning, I feel compelled to fight for it so that my grandchildren may share that dream and that joy of freedom as they one day walk there.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', p. 192.}}
The government refused to respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was "a crazy woman"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park would take more than a small portion of public park land; and proclaiming the project as a "fine and magnificent work of architecture" opposed by only the "ignorant few." On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members "a bunch of divorcees". They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 190–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Maathai's protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, the ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on 15 November 1989. Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out on 11 December. In his first public comments pertaining to the project, President Daniel Arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had "insects in their heads". On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government then audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down. Despite all this, her protests, the government's response – and the media coverage it garnered – led foreign investors to cancel the project in January 1990.&lt;ref name="Ecologist"&gt;''The Ecologist'' (1 April 2001).

In January 1992, it came to the attention of Maathai and other pro-democracy activists that a list of people were targeted for assassination and that a government-sponsored coup was possible. Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy–Kenya|Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organizations and eight senators (including [[Al Gore]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy]]) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 208–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1992, while released on bail, Maathai and others took part in a [[hunger strike]] in a corner of Uhuru Park, which they labeled Freedom Corner, to pressure the government to release [[political prisoner]]s. After four days of hunger strike, on 3 March 1992, the police forcibly removed the protesters.

Retrieved 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When the prisoners were not released, the protesters – mostly mothers of those in prison – moved their protest to All Saints Cathedral, the seat of the [[Anglican Church of Kenya|Anglican Archbishop in Kenya]], across from Uhuru Park. The protest there continued, with Maathai contributing frequently, until early 1993, when the prisoners were finally released.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 217–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Maathai was recognized with various awards internationally, but the Kenyan government did not appreciate her work. In 1991 she received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in San Francisco and the [[Hunger Project]]'s Africa Prize for Leadership in London. [[CNN]] aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] for the UN Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not be allowed to speak at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp.  226–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Push for democracy===
During the first multi-party [[Kenyan general election, 1992|election of Kenya, in 1992]], Maathai strove to unite the opposition and for fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into [[FORD-Kenya]] (led by [[Oginga Odinga]]) and [[FORD-Asili]] (led by [[Kenneth Matiba]]); former [[Vice-President of Kenya|vice president]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] had left the ruling [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party, and formed the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party]]. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 230–235.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It is often difficult to describe to those who live in a free society what life is like in an authoritarian regime. You don't know who to trust. You worry that you, your family, or your friends will be arrested and jailed without due process. The fear of political violence or death, whether through direct assassinations or targeted "accidents", is constant. Such was the case in Kenya, especially during the 1990s.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', p. 206.}}

The following year, ethnic clashes occurred throughout Kenya. Maathai believed they were incited by the government, who had warned of stark consequences to [[multi-party democracy]]. Maathai travelled with friends and the press to areas of violence in order to encourage them to cease fighting. With the Green Belt Movement she planted "trees of peace", but before long her actions were opposed by the government. The conflict areas were labeled as "no go zones", and in February 1993 the president claimed that Maathai had masterminded a distribution of leaflets inciting [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]] to attack [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjins]]. After her friend and supporter Dr. Makanga was kidnapped, Maathai chose to go into hiding. While in hiding, Maathai was invited to a meeting in Tokyo of the [[Green Cross International]], an environmental organization recently founded by former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When Maathai responded that she could not attend as she did not believe the government would allow her to leave the country and she was in hiding, Gorbachev pressured the government of Kenya to allow her to travel freely. President arap Moi denied limiting her travel, and she was allowed to leave the country, although too late for the meeting in Tokyo. Maathai was again recognized internationally, and she flew to [[Scotland]] to receive the Edinburgh Medal in April 1993. In May she went to Chicago to receive the [[Jane Addams]] International Women's Leadership Award, and in June she attended the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Kenyan general election, 1997|elections of 1997]], Maathai again wished to unite the opposition in order to defeat the ruling party. In November, less than two months before the election, she decided to run for parliament and for president as a candidate of the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya|Liberal Party]]. Her intentions were widely questioned in the press; many believed she should simply stick to running the Green Belt Movement and stay out of politics. On the day of the election, a rumour that Maathai had withdrawn from the election and endorsed another candidate was printed in the media. Maathai garnered few votes and lost the election.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 254–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1998, Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage.&lt;ref name="Ecologist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 261–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 270–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the government again planned to take public forest land and give it to its supporters. While protesting this and collecting [[petition]] signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near [[Mount Kenya]], Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate [[Saba Saba Day]], Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 280–284.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies|School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]]. She remained there until June 2002, teaching a course on sustainable development focused on the work of the Green Belt Movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election to parliament===
[[File:Wangari_Maathai_social_forum.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wangari Maathai speaks about deforestation]]
Upon her return to Kenya, Maathai again campaigned for parliament in the [[Kenyan general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this time as a candidate of the [[National Rainbow Coalition]], the umbrella organization which finally united the opposition. On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party [[Kenya African National Union]], and in [[Tetu Constituency]] Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', pp. 286–289.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, she was appointed Assistant Minister in the Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources and served in that capacity until November 2005.&lt;ref name="UNCCD"/&gt; She founded the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya]] in 2003 to allow candidates to run on a platform of conservation as embodied by the Green Belt Movement. It is a member of the [[Federation of Green Parties of Africa]] and the [[Global Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote= I was not prepared to learn that I had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; I wonder whether anybody ever is. The news hit me like a thunderbolt. How was I supposed to handle it? How did this happen? How did they find such a person as me? I could hardly believe it .
It was clear now why the Norwegian ambassador had called. "I am being informed that I have won the Nobel Peace Prize," I announced to myself and those around me in the car with a smile as I pulled the cell phone away from my ear and reconnected with my fellow passengers. They knew it was not a joke because happiness was written all over my face. But at the same time, tears steamed from my eyes and onto my cheeks as I turned to them. They, too, were now smiling broadly, some cheering and hugging me as if to both comfort and congratulate me, letting my tears fall on their shoulders and hiding my face from some of my staff, whom they felt shouldn't see me cry. But these were tears of great joy at an extraordinary moment!

In a 2004 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', in response to questions concerning that report, Maathai replied, "I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don't come from the moon. I have always thought that it is important to tell people the truth, but I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed," and when asked what she meant, she continued, "I'm referring to AIDS. I am sure people know where it came from. And I'm quite sure it did not come from the monkeys."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901041018-713166,00.html "10 Questions: Wangari Maathai"]. ''Time''.

On 28 March 2005, Maathai was elected the first president of the [[African Union]]'s [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council]] and was appointed a goodwill ambassador for an initiative aimed at protecting the [[Congo Basin]] Forest Ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;''Unbowed'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she was one of the eight flag-bearers at the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] [[2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony#Words and Symbols|Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony]].

In August 2006, then [[United States Senator]] [[Barack Obama]] traveled to Kenya. His father was educated in America through the same program as Maathai. She and the Senator met and planted a tree together in Uhuru Park in Nairobi. Obama called for freedom of the press to be respected, saying, "Press freedom is like tending a garden; it continually has to be nurtured and cultivated. The citizenry has to value it because it's one of those things that can slip away if we're not vigilant." He deplored global ecological losses, singling out President [[George W. Bush]]'s refusal to join the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and its subsidiary, the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130422011933/http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-08-28-obama-press-freedom-is-like-tend1ing-a-garden Obama: 'Press freedom is like tending a garden'].

'''William "Bill" Darrow''', Ph.D. is a [[Professor]] of [[Public Health]] at [[Florida International University]] (FIU) in [[Miami, Florida]].

Before accepting a position at FIU in August, 1994, Darrow served as Chief of the Behavioral and Prevention Research Branch, Division of STD/HIV Prevention, at the National Center for Prevention Services of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). Darrow has published over 100 scientific papers in professional [[academic journal|journals]], books, and research monographs.

His role in the discovery of the [[AIDS]] virus, [[HIV]], was described by [[Randy Shilts]]' 1987 book ''[[And the Band Played On]]''. Darrow also appeared in "The Zero Factor," part one of the four-part [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''A Time of AIDS'', which was shown on the [[Discovery Channel]]. 

At the CDC, Darrow's work primarily focused on the social variables of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, especially among [[homosexual]] men. In 1981, his focus shifted from [[condom]] use and diseases such as [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]] to HIV/AIDS. Since then, Darrow has devoted his study and career to finding a cure for HIV/AIDS. 

Darrow was honored with the 1992 Norwich Native Son Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.norwichrotaryevents.org/william-darrow-1992-norwich-native-son/|title=William Darrow - 1992 Norwich Native Son - Norwich Rotary Events|date=2018-10-23|work=Norwich Rotary Events|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
