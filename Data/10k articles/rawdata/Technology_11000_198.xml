The '''Asia-Oceania Top University League on Engineering''' (abbreviated '''AOTULE''', pronounced "our tool") is a league consisting of 13 engineering faculties within Asia and Oceania universities. AOTULE's mission is to improve the quality of its member's educational programs and promote research activity among members primarily through exchange of information between deans, faculty members and administration staff at its annual meeting. It also organizes graduate student exchange programs and conferences where graduate students present their latest research results in an interdisciplinary format.

== History ==

The seeds for forming AOTULE began in 2006 with discussions between senior engineering faculty at Tokyo Institute of Technology and Monash University.&lt;ref&gt;The AOTULE 5th anniversary Brochure outlines it mission to http://www.aotule.eng.titech.ac.jp/Library/AOTULE-5thAnv-brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to promote graduate engineering student mobility within Asia and Oceania universities similar to the ERASMUS+ program offered by EU universities that is funded by the European commission. AOTULE was subsequently founded in 2007 at the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]], by holding its inaugural meeting where participating Engineering Deans signed a memorandum of understanding. Each Fall since 2007, an AOTULE member has organized and hosted the annual AOTULE student conference, administration staff and Dean's meeting as noted below. 

== Deans' Meeting, Administrative Staff Meeting and Student Conference ==

The annual Deans', administrative staff meeting and student conference is held annually in October or November. Attendance at the annual conference varies between 130 - 180 participants. The Deans' meeting brings together Deans for discussions on topical educational programs related to the annual Deans meeting theme as well as joint educational programs, degree programs, accreditation, collaborations with industry and study-abroad programming. At the administration staff meeting, staff discuss issues related to administering student exchanges and share best practices. The student conference provides students an international forum to discuss their research with a multidisciplinary student audience. The 2013 AOTULE meeting and conference was held at Chulalongkorn in October 17–19, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Faculty-hosts-engineering-conference-30218091.html&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with the 100th anniversary of Chulalongkorn university. The [http://conference.seng.ust.hk/conference/index 2016 AOTULE annual meeting] and conference will be held at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in Hong Kong on Nov. 23-25, 2016. The 2017 AOTULE Deans meeting and conferences was held on Nov. 23-24, 2017 at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) in Hanoi, Vietnam&lt;ref&gt;http://htqt.hust.edu.vn/aotule2017/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Student Research Exchanges and Overseas Visits ==

To promote student mobility, AOTULE members organize intra-AOTULE student short stays and research exchanges varying in length from one week at Chulalongkorn University to three months at Tokyo Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eng.titech.ac.jp/english/international/collaborations.html&lt;/ref&gt; These exchanges facilitate global engineering, cross-cultural competencies, foreign language learning, and research experiences by students since the majority of AOTULE members' students live in countries where English is not the native language.  AOTULE members such as Tokyo Tech's School of Engineering have used AOTULE as a test bed for creating new research exchange programs that are later broaden to university-wide programs with research university partners in the USA and EU &lt;ref&gt;Overview on the ”Tokyo Institute of Technology International Research Opportunities Program (TiROP)" - Season One: 2012, Paper ID #5856, ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, June 23–26, 2013 Atlanta, Georgia. {{cite web|url=http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/20/papers/5856/view |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051427/http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/20/papers/5856/view |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Institute of Technology International Research Opportunities Program http://www.ipo.titech.ac.jp/tirop/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Like going to Mars”, a Summer Research Exchange Experience at Tokyo Institute of Technology, SEFI 2014, 42nd Annual Conference Birmingham UK Sept. 15-19, 2014, Paper 74, http://www.sefi.be/conference-2014/0074.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, there has been growing numbers of double degree graduate programs signed between AOTULE member institutions to allow participating graduate students to obtain two degrees by completing graduation requirements at two institutions. This allows double degree participants an opportunity to learn more about the host country where they are studying, undertake a research project in greater depth and establish a greater network of peers than that provided by a short term exchanges.

The terms '''atomic battery''', '''nuclear battery''', '''tritium battery''' and '''radioisotope generator''' are used to describe a device which uses energy from the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of a [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] to generate [[electricity]].  Like [[nuclear reactor]]s, they generate electricity from atomic energy, but differ in that they do not use a [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]].  Compared to other [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] they are very costly, but have an extremely long life and high [[energy density]], and so they are mainly used as power sources for equipment that must operate unattended for long periods of time, such as [[spacecraft]], [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[underwater]] systems and [[research station|automated scientific stations]] in remote parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/smaller-nuclear-battery/13076/ "A nuclear battery the size and thickness of a penny."] ''Gizmag'', 9 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8297934.stm "Tiny 'nuclear batteries' unveiled."] ''BBC News'', Thursday 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear battery technology began in 1913, when [[Henry Moseley]] first demonstrated the [[Betavoltaics|beta cell]]. The field received considerable in-depth research attention for applications requiring long-life power sources for space needs during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954 [[RCA]] researched a small atomic battery for small radio receivers and hearing aids.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Atomic Battery Converts Radioactivity Directly Into Electricity."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1954, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[RCA|RCA's]] initial research and development in the early 1950s, many types and methods have been designed to extract electrical energy from nuclear sources. The scientific principles are well known, but modern nano-scale technology and new [[wide bandgap semiconductors]] have created new devices and interesting material properties not previously available.

Batteries using the energy of [[radioisotope]] decay to provide long-lived power (10–20 years) are being developed internationally. Conversion techniques can be grouped into two types: thermal and non-thermal. The thermal converters (whose output power is a function of a temperature differential) include [[thermoelectric]] and [[thermionic]] generators. The non-thermal converters (whose output power is not a function of a temperature difference) extract a fraction of the incident energy as it is being degraded into heat rather than using thermal energy to run electrons in a cycle. Atomic batteries usually have an efficiency of 0.1&amp;ndash;5%. High efficiency [[betavoltaics]] have 6&amp;ndash;8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electronicsbus.com/atomic-batteries-nuclear-batteries/ |title=Thermoelectric Generators |website=electronicbus.com |access-date=23 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermal converters ==

===Thermionic converter=== 
A [[thermionic converter]] consists of a hot electrode which thermionically emits electrons over a space charge barrier to a cooler electrode, producing a useful power output. [[Caesium]] vapor is used to optimize the electrode [[work function]]s and provide an ion supply (by [[surface ionization]]) to neutralize the electron [[space charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/6377296 |title=Thermionic converter |last=Fitzpatrick |first=G.O |website=scitechconnect.com |access-date=23 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioisotope thermoelectric generator=== 
{{main|Radioisotope thermoelectric generator}}
[[File:HD.17.071 (11966200113).jpg|thumb|241px|Radioisotope-powered cardiac pacemaker being developed by the Atomic Energy Commission, is planned to stimulate the pulsing action of a malfunctioning heart. Circa 1967.]]
A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) uses [[thermocouple]]s. Each thermocouple is formed from two wires of different metals (or other materials).  A temperature gradient along the length of each wire produces a voltage gradient from one end of the wire to the other; but the different materials produce different voltages per degree of temperature difference.  By connecting the wires at one end, heating that end but cooling the other end, a usable, but small (millivolts), voltage is generated between the unconnected wire ends.  In practice, many are connected in series to generate a larger voltage from the same heat source, as heat flows from the hot ends to the cold ends. Metal thermocouples have low thermal-to-electrical efficiency. However, the carrier density and charge can be adjusted in semiconductor materials such as bismuth telluride and silicon germanium to achieve much higher conversion efficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/168371 |title=An overview of the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Transportation System Program |last=McCoy |first=J.C |website=scitechconnect.com |access-date=23 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermophotovoltaic cells=== 
[[Thermophotovoltaic]] cells work by the same principles as a [[photovoltaic cell]], except that they convert [[infrared]] light (rather than [[Visible spectrum|visible light]]) emitted by a hot surface, into electricity. Thermophotovoltaic cells have an efficiency slightly higher than thermoelectric couples and can be overlaid on thermoelectric couples, potentially doubling efficiency. The [[University of Houston]] [[Thermophotovoltaic|TPV]] Radioisotope Power Conversion Technology development effort is aiming at combining thermophotovoltaic cells concurrently with [[thermocouple]]s to provide a 3- to 4-fold improvement in system efficiency over current thermoelectric radioisotope generators. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Stirling radioisotope generator=== 
A [[Stirling radioisotope generator]] is a [[Stirling engine]] driven by the temperature difference produced by a radioisotope. A more efficient version, the [[advanced Stirling radioisotope generator]], was under development by [[NASA]], but was cancelled in 2013 due to large-scale cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-asrg-cancellation-in-context.html The ASRG Cancellation in Context] Future Planetary Exploration&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-thermal converters ==
Non-thermal converters extract a fraction of the [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]] as it is being degraded into heat. Their outputs are not functions of temperature differences as are thermoelectric and thermionic converters. Non-thermal generators can be grouped into three classes.

=== Direct charging generators ===
In the first type, the primary generator consists of a [[capacitor]] which is charged by the current of charged particles from a radioactive layer deposited on one of the electrodes. Spacing can be either vacuum or [[dielectric]]. Negatively charged [[beta particle]]s or positively charged [[alpha particles]], [[positron]]s or [[Fission products|fission fragments]] may be utilized. Although this form of nuclear-electric generator dates back to 1913, few applications have been found in the past for the extremely low currents and inconveniently high voltages provided by direct charging generators. Oscillator/transformer systems are employed to reduce the voltages, then rectifiers are used to transform the AC power back to direct current.

English physicist [[Henry Moseley|H.G.J. Moseley]] constructed the first of these. Moseley’s apparatus consisted of a glass globe [[silver]]ed on the inside with a radium emitter mounted on the tip of a wire at the center. The charged particles from the [[radium]] created a flow of electricity as they moved quickly from the radium to the inside surface of the sphere. As late as 1945 the Moseley model guided other efforts to build experimental batteries generating electricity from the emissions of radioactive elements.

=== Betavoltaics ===
{{main|Betavoltaics}}
[[Betavoltaics]] are generators of electric current, in effect a form of battery, which use energy from a radioactive source emitting beta particles (electrons). A common source used is the hydrogen isotope, tritium. Unlike most nuclear power sources, which use nuclear radiation to generate heat, which then generates electricity (thermoelectric and thermionic sources), betavoltaics use a non-thermal conversion process, using a [[semiconductor]] [[p-n junction]].

Betavoltaics are particularly well-suited to low-power electrical applications where long life of the energy source is needed, such as implantable medical devices or military and space applications.

===Alphavoltaics===
Alphavoltaic power sources are devices that use a semiconductor junction to produce electrical particle from energetic alpha particles.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Glenn Research Center, [http://rt.grc.nasa.gov/power-in-space-propulsion/photovoltaics-power-technologies/technology-thrusts/alpha-and-beta-voltaics/ Alpha- and Beta-voltaics] (accessed Oct. 4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheila G. Bailey, David M. Wilt, Ryne P. Raffaelle, and Stephanie L. Castro, [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/2005/RP/RPV-bailey1.html Alpha-Voltaic Power Source Designs Investigated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716172638/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/2005/RP/RPV-bailey1.html |date=16 July 2010 }}, ''Research and Technology 2005,'' NASA TM-2006-214016, (accessed Oct. 4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optoelectric ===
{{main|Optoelectric nuclear battery}}
An optolectric nuclear battery has also been proposed by researchers of the [[Kurchatov Institute]] in [[Moscow]].  A beta-emitter (such as [[technetium]]-99) would stimulate an [[excimer]] mixture, and the light would power a [[solar cell|photocell]].  The battery would consist of an excimer mixture of [[argon]]/[[xenon]] in a pressure vessel with an internal mirrored surface, finely-divided Tc-99, and an intermittent [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] stirrer, illuminating a photocell with a bandgap tuned for the excimer.  The advantage of this design is that precision electrode assemblies are not needed, and most beta particles escape the finely-divided bulk material to contribute to the battery's net power.

=== Reciprocating Electromechanical Atomic Batteries ===
{{main|Radioisotope piezoelectric generator}}
Electromechanical atomic batteries use the buildup of charge between two plates to pull one bendable plate towards the other, until the two plates touch, discharge, equalizing the electrostatic buildup, and spring back. The mechanical motion produced can be used to produce electricity through flexing of a [[piezoelectric]] material or through a linear generator. Milliwatts of power are produced in pulses depending on the charge rate, in some cases multiple times per second (35&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Radioisotopes used ==
Atomic batteries use radioisotopes that produce low energy beta particles or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. Low energy beta particles are needed to prevent the production of high energy penetrating [[Bremsstrahlung]] radiation that would require heavy shielding. Radioisotopes such as [[tritium]], [[nickel]]-63, [[promethium]]-147, and [[technetium]]-99 have been tested. [[Plutonium]]-238, [[curium]]-242, [[curium]]-244 and [[strontium]]-90 have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bindu |first=K.C. |last2=Harmon| first2=Frank |last3=Starovoitova |first3=Valeriia |last4=Stoner |first4=Jon |last5=Wells |first5=Douglas |date=2013 |title=Optimization of commercial scale photonuclear production of radioisotopes |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=1525 |issue=1 |pages=407–411|doi=10.1063/1.4802359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autonomous decentralised system architecture schematic.svg|thumb|Simplified schematic showing message passing in an autonomous decentralised system]]

An '''autonomous decentralized system''' (or '''ADS''') is a [[decentralized system]] composed of modules or components that are designed to operate independently but are capable of interacting with each other to meet the overall goal of the system. This design paradigm enables the system to continue to function in the event of component failures. It also enables maintenance and repair to be carried out while the system remains operational. Autonomous decentralized systems have a number of applications including industrial [[production line]]s, [[railway signalling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=High Integrity Software|page=105|year=2001|author1=Winter, Victor L.  |author2=Bhattacharya, Sourav |lastauthoramp=yes |ISBN=0-7923-7949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and robotics.

The ADS has been recently expanded from control applications to service application and embedded systems, thus autonomous decentralized service systems and autonomous decentralized device systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010075816/http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/02.html |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Autonomous decentralized systems were first proposed in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Service Availability: 4th International Service Availability Symposium|page=2|author=Mori, Kinji|title=Autonomous Decentralized System for Service Assurance and Its Application|year=2007|ISBN=978-3-540-72735-4|editors= Miroslaw Malek, Manfred Reitenspieß, Aad van Moorsel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADS received significant attention as such systems have been deployed in Japanese railway systems for many years safely with over 7 billion trips,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/shinkansen-bullet-trains-in-Japan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web-japan.org/niponica/niponica10/en/feature/feature03.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/isads/2013/5069/00/06513400.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hase/2001/1275/00/12750220-abs.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=503194&lt;/ref&gt; proving the value of this concept. Japan railway with ADS is considered as a smart train as it also learns.&lt;ref&gt;http://mag.uchicago.edu/law-policy-society/smart-trains&lt;/ref&gt;

To recognizing this outstanding contribution, Dr. Kinji Mori has received numerous awards including 2013 IEEE Life Fellow, 2012 Distinguished Service Award, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2012 Distinguished Specialist among 1000 in the world, Chinese Government, 2008 IEICE Fellow, 1995 IEEE Fellow 1994 Research and Development Award of Excellence Achievers, Science and Technology Agency, 1994 Ichimura Industrial Prize, 1992 Technology Achievement Award, Society of Instrument and Control Engineers, 1988 National Patent Award, Science and Technology Agency, and 1988 Mainichi Technology Prize of Excellence. Dr. Mori donated the cash from Ichimura Industrial Price to IEEE to fund the IEEE Kanai Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoni.waseda.jp/kinji.mori/prof.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, ADS has been a subject of research by many researchers in the world including US, Japan, EU particularly Germany, and China.

== ADS architecture ==

An ADS is a [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupled architecture]] where each component or subsystem communicates by [[message passing]] using shared data fields. A unique feature of the ADS is that there is no central operating system or coordinator. Instead each subsystem manages its own functionality and its coordination with other subsystems. When a subsystem needs to interact with other subsystems it broadcasts the shared data fields containing the request to all other subsystems. This broadcast does not include the identification or address of any other subsystem. Rather the other subsystems will, depending on their purpose and function, receive the broadcast message and make their own determination on what action (if any) to take.

As ADS moves into the service-oriented architecture (SOA) or ADSS (Autonomous Decentralized Service System),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/glossary/a/adss.html&lt;/ref&gt; the data transmission can be carried out by ESB (Enterprise Service Bus), and each agent can a service that receives data from the ESB and acts according to the service specification. The results are again transmitted by the ESB to other autonomous agents.

An ADS is also similar to a [[blackboard system]] used in AI where a collection of agents will act upon seeing any data change in the common blackboard.

An ADS may include human in the loop, with both human and autonomous agents both co-learn at the same time to perform the system functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/01.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010081631/http://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/story/ad/01.html |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cloud computing]] also uses autonomous computing, but its architecture and framework are different from ADS.

== Applications ==

One application of ADS is software testing, particularly combinatorial testing. A framework has been proposed based on ADS for concurrent combinatorial testing using AR and TA.

== Conferences ==

IEEE International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS) is the major conference on this topic. The Symposium is a biannual event and the first Symposium was held in 1993.

'''Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren''' (5 June 1881 – 24 November 1961) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[entrepreneur]] and one of the wealthiest men in the world during the 1930s.

== Early life ==
He was born on 5 June 1881 in [[Uddevalla]], a town on the west coast of Sweden.[http://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/founding-an-international-company-666/] He was the fourth of six children (four girls and two boys) born to Leonard and the much younger Alice Wenner-Gren (née Albin), though only three of them grew to adulthood, Axel himself, his oldest sister Anna, and his younger brother Hugo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luciak|first1=Ilja|title=The Life of Axel Wenner-Gren – An Introduction|url=http://blog.wennergren.org/2012/08/reality-and-myth-a-symposium-on-axel-wenner-gren/|journal=Wenner-Gren International Symposium - “Reality and Myth: A Symposium on Axel Wenner-Gren”|date=May 30–31, 2012|pages=13, 14|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having spent his school years in Uddevalla he moved to [[Gothenburg]] where he was employed for five years in the spice importing company of a maternal uncle. During this time, he learned English, French, and German at the local [[Berlitz school]], and music at the local YMCA [http://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/founding-an-international-company-666/].&lt;ref&gt;Luciak, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1902, at the age of 21, he left Sweden to further his studies in Germany. He first studied in the university town of [[Greifswald]] where he took some summer courses before moving on to Berlin where he studied at the Berliner Handelsakademie from which he graduated much sooner than usual.&lt;ref&gt;Luciak, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After some difficulty, he found work with the German subsidiary of Alfa Laval Separator where he developed skills as a salesman, before quitting in 1904 to work selling agricultural machinery near Stuttgart which, with financial support from his father, had become his first financial enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Luciak, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, he traveled to America where he learned about engines for agricultural use, returning to Europe the same year. While in Vienna in 1908 he saw the Santo vacuum cleaner in the shop of Gustaf Paalen who had exclusive rights to distribute them throughout Europe [http://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/founding-an-international-company-666/].&lt;ref&gt;Luciak, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; After initially failing to become a European distributor for the Santo vacuum cleaner in his own right, he entered into a partnership with Paalen, purchasing a twenty percent interest in the company.

Earlier in his life he notably collaborated with [[Fredrik Ljungström]].

Wenner-Gren amassed a fortune from his early appreciation that the industrial [[vacuum cleaner]] could be adapted for domestic use. Soon after the [[First World War]] he persuaded the Swedish lighting company [[Electrolux]], for which he then worked (securing the contract to floodlight the opening ceremony of the [[Panama Canal]], among other successes), to buy the patent to a cleaner and to pay him for sales in company stock. By the early 1930s, Wenner-Gren was the owner of Electrolux, and the firm was a leading brand in both vacuum cleaner and [[refrigerator]] technology.

Wenner-Gren also diversified his interests into the ownership of newspapers, banks and arms manufacturers, and acquired many of the holdings of the disgraced safety-match tycoon [[Ivar Kreuger]]. In Mexico in the 1930s, he was in economic alliance with [[Maximino Ávila Camacho]], strongman of the Mexican state of Puebla, whose brother [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] became [[President of Mexico]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[[Enrique Krauze]], ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', New York: Harper Collins 1997, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War 2 Blacklisting==
Wenner-Gren was reported to be a friend of [[Hermann Göring]], whose first wife was a Swede, and in the late 1930s convinced himself that he could avert the coming [[world war]] by acting as a conduit between Göring and the British and American governments. His efforts proved unsuccessful, with all parties regarding him as a self-promoting nuisance without much influence on the plans of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;Leifland, 1989; Luciak, 2012; Luciak and Daneholt, eds., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others are suspicious of his role in the war, citing how (his) original Bank of the Bahamas was used to fund the Nazis and his friendship with Göring as potential proof of his private support for the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bahamianology.com/the-original-bank-of-bahamas-was-used-to-fund-the-nazis-1939-1942/|title=The original Bank of Bahamas was used to fund the Nazis 1939-1942 · Bahamianology|date=2017-11-04|work=Bahamianology|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disconsolate Wenner-Gren retired to his estate in the [[Bahamas]], in Hog Island (now [[Paradise Island]]), where he resumed his friendship with the islands' [[Governor of the Bahamas|governor]], the [[Duke of Windsor]] and former [[King of the United Kingdom]] [[Edward VIII]]. Early in the war his rumored friendship with Göring and the suspected German sympathies of the Duke led first the Americans and, following their lead, the British, to place him on an economic [[blacklist]], enabling them to freeze his assets in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]. There proved to be little or no foundation to their suspicions that Wenner-Gren was a Nazi agent,&lt;ref&gt;Leifland, 1989; Luciak, 2012; Luciak and Daneholt, eds., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding the appearance of his [[steam yacht]] [[Rover (yacht)|''Southern Cross'']] (the world's largest at the time) along with ships from the Allied Navies at the site of the sinking of the liner ''[[SS Athenia]]'' on the first day of the war. Wenner-Gren's yacht the ''Southern Cross'' rescued over three hundred survivors of the sinking and transferred some to nearby Allied ships and others continued to the U.S.

==Other ventures==

In the 1950s, Axel Wenner-Gren also got involved in the early computer business. For a railroad project connecting California with Alaska, he got in touch with [[Glenn Hagen]], previously an engineer with [[Northrop Aircraft]], who had founded Logistics Research in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] outside Los Angeles, developing computers based on magnetic [[drum memory]]. In November 1952, Wenner-Gren helped the company to incorporate. He soon controlled the company and renamed it ALWAC (the Axel L. Wenner-Gren Automatic Computer). ALWAC I was used in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=19.

By 1956 the number of employees tripled to over 300 and the company was relocated to an industrial park in [[Hawthorne, California]].  The appearance of the [[transistor]] in the electronics industry in 1957 was a financial shock for all vacuum tube computer makers and by 1958 ALWAC in Hawthorn closed and its employees, with the help of Wenner-Gren himself, were successful hired by [[Litton Industries]] and [[Autonetics]] and several smaller electronics companies.  The follow-up ALWAC 800&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=COMPUTERS AND DATA PROCESSORS, NORTH AMERICA: 2. ALWAC, Inc., ALWAC 800, Hawthorns, Calif.|journal=Digital Computer Newsletter|date=Jul 1957|volume=9|issue=3|pages=1–3|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0694625|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a failed design that never went beyond prototype, using not only core memory but also [[magnetic logic]] (a combination of semiconductor diodes and magnetic cores, cf. [[Hewitt Crane]]), and presold contracts nearly ruined the company. Development was transferred to Sweden in 1958. The next model, named Wegematic 1000, a slight upgrade of the III-E, was shipped in 1960. Only a dozen were delivered and half of them were give-aways to universities, including one unit for the [[Weizmann Institute]] in Israel. In exchange, Wenner-Gren received several honorary titles.

Among Wenner-Gren's other interests were [[monorail]] train systems. His company, [[ALWEG]], built the original [[Disneyland Monorail System]] in 1959 and the [[Seattle Center Monorail]] in 1962. Wenner-Gren continued his fascination with speculative railway projects, as he collaborated with Canadian [[W.A.C. Bennett]] to build  a railway north from [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] into the untapped [[Peace River]], [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] and eventually [[Alaska]]. Parts of the railway were built by the [[Pacific Great Eastern Railway]] after Wenner-Gren's death, including the needless [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] branch, yet the meeting produced outcomes lasting to this day. The interest in the north spurred a spate of mega-industrial projects in the region: the [[Bennett Dam]] flooding vast valleys, gas pipelines and plants at Taylor, coal mines and pulp mills.

==Personal life==
In late 1909, while returning from a trip to America on board a trans-Atlantic liner, he met Marguerite Gauntier Liggett who had been born on 15 October 1891 in Kansas City, Missouri. She was traveling with her sister, actress [[Gene Gauntier]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sidneyolcott.com/GB_Blog_Wenner-Gren_2014_03_21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  to Europe to complete her musical training as an opera singer. After brief romance, when the ship arrived at Southampton, they travelled to London where they married on 14 December 1909&lt;ref&gt;Luciak, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; before traveling on to Berlin where she was going to complete her studies.

Wenner-Gren also founded and [[financial endowment|endowed]] The Viking Fund in 1941, an organization supporting [[anthropological]] research. In 1941, the endowment funded the Wenner-Gren Aeronautical Research Laboratory, now called the [[Wenner-Gren Laboratory]] at the [[University of Kentucky]]. The lab has since changed its focus to [[Biomedical Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbme.uky.edu/history.htm |title=University of Kentucky: Center for Biomedical Engineering |publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] |accessdate=2009-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826232429/http://www.cbme.uky.edu/history.htm |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viking fund was later renamed the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wennergren.org Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''beverage opener''' (also known as a '''multi-opener''') is a device used to open [[beverage can]]s, [[plastic bottle]]s or [[glass bottles]], which are the three most common beverage containers. 

== Types ==

Beverage openers vary in size but commonly include a [[glass bottle]] cap opener, a [[plastic bottle]] cap grip for greater twisting torque and a [[Tab (beverage can)|stay tab]] lifting mechanism for metal [[beverage can]]s. Some cans have extra conveniences built in such as magnetic backing to catch and hold metal caps or stick to a [[refrigerator]] door.

== Benefits ==
Beverage openers are useful for opening every day beverage containers for those who have limited hand strength as it eliminates the need for strong twisting or pulling motions. Plastic bottles may become stuck due to a high volume of carbonation released during shipping or overtightening. Some do not have fingernails with which to properly use a stay tab and glass bottles almost always require some sort of [[bottle opener]].

'''Bills of credit''' are documents similar to [[banknote]]s issued by a government that represent a government's indebtedness to the holder.  They are typically designed to [[circulation (currency)|circulate]] as [[currency]] or currency substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/bill-of-credit.html|title= Definition of Bills of Credit| publisher = Business Dictionary.com|access-date = 16 November 2017 | work= Web Finance Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bills of credit are mentioned in Article One, Section 10, Clause One (also known as the [[Contract Clause]]) of the [[United States Constitution]], where their issuance by state governments is prohibited.

==History==
===Use in the American Colonies (pre 1775)===
British colonies in North America would issue bills of credit in order to deal with fiscal crises, although doing so without receiving them as revenue in like amounts would increase the money supply, resulting in price [[inflation]] and a drop in value relative to the [[pound sterling]].  The documents would circulate as if they were currency, and colonial governments would accept them as payment for debts like taxes.  They were not always considered legal tender for private debts.

Colonial decisions on the issuance of bills of credit were also frequently the subject of disputes between differing factions within the colony, and with royally appointed governors.  Between 1690 and 1750 the matter was regularly debated in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], where merchants and lenders stood to lose value when new bills were issued, and borrowers stood to gain, because they could repay their debts with depreciated bills.  The Massachusetts bills were finally retired in 1749 when the province received a large payment in [[coin]] for its financial contributions to the 1745 [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Siege of Louisbourg]].  The [[Province of New Jersey]] issued bills of credit beginning in the 1710s, but successfully managed to avoid significant inflationary effects.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insertion in the United States Constitution===
Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 prohibits the states from issuing Bills of Credit.  The prohibition of states issuing Bills of Credit came in direct response to how states managed their financial policy during the era of the Articles of Confederation.  While all states in theory recognized the [[Early American currency#Continental currency|American Continental]] as their official currency, in reality, nearly every state issued its own Bills of credit, which further devalued the Continental and led to its eventual collapse as a currency.

The painful experience of the runaway inflation and collapse of the Continental dollar prompted the delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] to include the Contract Clause into the United States Constitution, so that the individual states could not issue bills of credit or "make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts."&lt;ref&gt;U.S Constitution, Article 1, Section 10&lt;/ref&gt;  This restriction of bills of credit was extended to the Federal government, as the power to "emit bills" from the Articles of Confederation was abolished, leaving Congress with the power "to borrow money on credit."&lt;ref&gt;U.S Constitution, Article 1, Section 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage throughout history==
The United States Government has, at numerous times throughout American History, issued Bills of Credit to utilize in place of paper currency.  Most instances of this have occurred during wartime.

===18th century===
====American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)====
During the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Congress]] frequently issued bills of credit referred to as Continentals.  Because of inflation they rapidly declined in value, leading to the unfavorable comparison that something was "not worth a Continental".

===19th century===
====United States Notes====
In 1862, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] began to issue [[United States Note]]s as obligations of the United States.  United States Notes are examples of Bills of Credit as they used to be inserted by the Treasury into circulation free of interest (production of these notes was halted in 1971 during termination of the [[Bretton Woods system]], yet Congress retains the power to put more into circulation at any time, and $300 million remain in circulation still).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedberg| first1= Arthur L.|first2= Ira |last2= S. |year= 2006 |title= Paper Money of the United States |edition=18th |location= Clifton, NJ |publisher= The Coin &amp; Currency Institute, Inc. |ISBN=0-87184-518-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interest-bearing notes====
Interest-bearing notes are a grouping of [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era bills of credit-related emissions of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]].  The grouping includes the one- and two-year notes authorized by the Act of March 3, 1863, which bore [[interest]] at five percent annually, were a [[legal tender]] at face value, and were issued in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hessler |first1= Gene |last2= Chambliss |first2= Carlson |year=2006 |title=The Comprehensive Catalog of U.S. Paper Money|edition= 7th|location= [[Port Clinton, Ohio]]| publisher=BNR Press |ISBN=0-931960-66-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compound interest treasury notes====
[[Image:US-$20-CITN-1864-Fr-191a.jpg|thumb|250px|Two-year $20 1864 compound interest treasury note]]

Compound interest treasury notes were emissions of the [[United States Treasury Department]] authorized in 1863 and 1864 with aspects of both [[paper money]] and debt. They were issued in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. While they were legal tender at face value, they were redeemable after three years with six percent annual [[interest]] compounded semi-annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hessler |first1= Gene | last2= Chambliss |first2=Carlson |year=2006 |title=''The Comprehensive Catalog of U.S. Paper Money''|edition= 7th | location= [[Port Clinton, Ohio]] |publisher= BNR Press |ISBN=0-931960-66-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of efficient [[investment bank]]s, the hybrid nature of these instruments allowed the government to directly distribute debt by paying the notes out to creditors as legal tender, and then relying on interest-seeking parties to eventually remove them from circulation in order to redeem them with interest at maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Backus|first= Charles K. |year=1878 |title= ''The Contraction of the Currency''|location= [[Chicago, Illinois]] |publisher=Honest Money League of the Northwest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Refunding Certificate====
The Refunding Certificate was a type of [[interest]]-bearing [[banknote]] that the United States Treasury issued in 1879. They issued it only in the [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10]] denomination, depicting [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Their issuance reflects the end of a coin-hoarding period that began during the [[American Civil War]], and represented a return to public confidence in paper money.

===20th century===
====Federal Reserve Bank Notes====
Federal Reserve Bank Notes, issued between 1915 and 1934, are bills of credit that are [[legal tender]] in the United States.  They had the same value as other kinds of notes of similar face value. Federal Reserve Bank Notes differ from Federal Reserve Notes in that they are backed by one of the twelve [[Federal Reserve]] Banks, rather than by all collectively. They were backed in a similar way to National Bank Notes, using U.S. bonds, but issued by Federal Reserve banks instead of by chartered National banks. Federal Reserve Bank Notes are no longer issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/currency/pages/legal-tender.aspx|title=Legal Tender Status|publisher=United States Treasury Department |access-date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion with paper money==
Legal writers—as opposed to economic historians—incorrectly assume that the constitutional phrase "Bills of Credit" was simply a synonym for paper money{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, but it only refers to one, though very important, type of paper currency.&lt;ref&gt;Natelson, Robert G. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140530000354/http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/31-3/Natelson%20Online%20-%20Paper%20Money.pdf Paper Money and the Original Understanding of the Coinage Clause], ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy'', vol. 31,  pp. 1044–45&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution explicitly prohibits the states from issuing bills of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and coining money. States are only permitted to make gold and silver coin [[legal tender]].

An '''automatic channel memory system''' ('''ACMS''') is a system in which a digitally controlled [[radio tuner]] such as a [[TV set]] or [[VCR]] could search and memorize [[TV channel]]s automatically.  While more common in [[television]], it can also be used to store [[wikt:preset|preset]]s for [[radio station]]s.  This is often called a '''channel scan''', though that may also refer to a "[[Preview (computing)|preview]]" mode which plays each station it finds for a few seconds and then moves on to the next, without affecting [[computer memory|memory]].

A typical TV device allows an automatic channel scan to be performed from a [[menu (computing)|menu]] accessed by a button on the TV set, or sometimes only on the [[remote control]].  This applied first to [[analog TV]] sets — sometimes those with digital [[LED display]]s, or later always those with [[on-screen display]]s.  These simply searched for the video [[carrier wave|carrier]] signal on every channel.  (Before the advent of ACMS, many sets would search for the next channel every time it was changed.)

It now also applies to [[digital TV]], which must not only find the signal itself, but also decode its [[metadata]] enough to [[virtual channel|remap channel number]]s to their proper locations.  In the case of the American [[ATSC]] system, the [[ATSC tuner]] uses [[PSIP]] metadata to do this.  The internal '''channel map''' for digital [[TV station]]s is different from the presets or "[[favorites]]" that the user has programmed.  Just as with analog TV (which worked ''only'' by turning a preset on or off for each station/channel), users of [[digital television adapter]]s and other similar tuners can choose to ignore channels that are still in the channel map.  

Analog station presets and digital channel maps are normally deleted when a new scan is started.  On some tuners, digital channel maps can be added-to with an "easy-add" channel scan, which is useful for finding new stations without losing old ones that may be [[radio propagation|weak]] or currently [[off-air]], or not aimed-at with an [[antenna rotator]] or other set-top [[TV antenna]] adjustment.  If a station adds a [[digital subchannel]], most digital TV tuners will find it automatically as soon as the user turns to another channel that is carried by that station, adding it to the channel map.  

Many will also automatically add a new digital station's subchannels by tuning manually to the station's physical channel, though if this conflicts with the virtual channel number of another station, a complete re-scan may be the only solution.  (Choosing an unused subchannel number [i.e. 30.99] on that major channel number [i.e. 30] may avoid the remap on existing subchannels [i.e. 30.1] and force the tuner to listen on that physical channel.)  This has often happened in the U.S., where stations (especially [[LPTV]]) find it easiest to place their digital operations on a vacated analog channel.  

The same problem also occurs when the same station moves its digital transmission back to its old analog channel.  There is no way to delete a station from the internal channel map, and a re-scan may be needed; or if the new physical channel is found, it may leave the old mapping in place, causing duplicate channels that cannot be accessed through [[direct tuning|direct entry]] of the numbers without also pressing the channel-up/down buttons.

Many modern TV sets do an ACMS scan automatically as part of the setup process the user is guided through when the device is initially plugged-in.  While early sets often lost their memory in a [[power outage]] or by otherwise being disconnected from [[mains electricity]], all of them now have [[non-volatile RAM]] or a backup of some sort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13811">'''Dilution of precision''' ('''DOP'''), or '''geometric dilution of precision''' ('''GDOP'''), is a term used in [[satellite navigation]] and [[geomatics engineering]] to specify the additional multiplicative effect of navigation satellite geometry on positional measurement precision.

[[Image:Geometric Dilution Of Precision.svg|right|thumb|Understanding the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) with a simple example. In '''A''' someone has measured the distance to two landmarks, and plotted their point as the intersection of two circles with the measured radius. In '''B''' the measurement has some error bounds, and their true location will lie anywhere in the green area. In '''C''' the measurement error is the same, but the error on their position has grown considerably due to the arrangement of the landmarks.]]

==Introduction==
The concept of dilution of precision (DOP) originated with users of the [[LORAN|Loran-C navigation system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Geometric DOP is to state how errors in the measurement will affect the final state estimation. This can be defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Conceptually you can geometrically imagine errors on a measurement resulting in the &lt;math&gt;\Delta ( {\rm Measured \ Data} )&lt;/math&gt; term changing. Ideally small changes in the measured data will not result in large changes in output location, as such a result would indicate the solution is very sensitive to errors. The interpretation of this formula is shown in the figure to the right, showing two possible scenarios with acceptable and poor GDOP.

More recently, the term has come into much wider usage with the development and adoption of GPS. Neglecting ionospheric &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tropospheric&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trimble.com/gps_tutorial/howgps-error.aspx GPS errors (Trimble tutorial)]&lt;/ref&gt; effects, the signal from navigation satellites has a fixed precision. Therefore, the relative satellite-receiver geometry plays a major role in determining the precision of estimated positions and times.  Due to the relative geometry of any given satellite to a receiver, the precision in the [[pseudorange]] of the satellite translates to a corresponding component in each of the four dimensions of position measured by the receiver (i.e., &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).  The precision of multiple satellites in view of a receiver combine according to the relative position of the satellites to determine the level of precision in each dimension of the receiver measurement.  When visible navigation satellites are close together in the sky, the geometry is said to be weak and the DOP value is high; when far apart, the geometry is strong and the DOP value is low.  Consider two overlapping rings, or [[annulus (mathematics)|annuli]], of different centres.  If they overlap at right angles, the greatest extent of the overlap is much smaller than if they overlap in near parallel. Thus a low DOP value represents a better positional precision due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate a unit's position.  Other factors that can increase the effective DOP are obstructions such as nearby mountains or buildings.

DOP can be expressed as a number of separate measurements:
* HDOP – horizontal dilution of precision
* VDOP – vertical dilution of precision
* PDOP – position (3D) dilution of precision
* TDOP – time dilution of precision
* GDOP – geometric dilution of precision
These values follow mathematically from the positions of the usable satellites. Signal receivers allow the display of these positions (''skyplot'') as well as the DOP values.

The term can also be applied to other location systems that employ several geographical spaced sites.  It can occur in electronic-counter-counter-measures (electronic warfare) when computing the location of enemy emitters (radar jammers and radio communications devices).  Using such an [[interferometry]] technique can provide certain geometric layout where there are degrees of freedom that cannot be accounted for due to inadequate configurations.

The effect of geometry of the satellites on position error is called geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and it is roughly interpreted as ratio of position error to the range error.  Imagine that a [[square pyramid]] is formed by lines joining four satellites with the receiver at the tip of the pyramid.  The larger the volume of the pyramid, the better (lower) the value of GDOP; the smaller its volume, the worse (higher) the value of GDOP will be.  Similarly, the greater the number of satellites, the better the value of GDOP.

The DOP factors are functions of the diagonal elements of the [[covariance matrix]] of the parameters, expressed either in a global or a local geodetic frame.

==Computation of DOP Values==
As a first step in computing DOP, consider the unit vectors from the receiver to satellite i: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {(x_i-x)} {R_i}, \frac {(y_i-y)} {R_i}, \frac {(z_i-z)} {R_i}\right)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R_i= \sqrt{(x_i- x)^2 + (y_i-y)^2 + (z_i-z)^2}&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denote the position of the receiver and &lt;math&gt;x_i, y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the position of satellite i. Formulate the matrix, A, which (for 4 range measurement residual equations) is:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {(x_1- x)} {R_1} &amp; \frac {(y_1-y)} {R_1} &amp; \frac {(z_1-z)} {R_1} &amp; -1 \\
\frac {(x_2- x)} {R_2} &amp; \frac {(y_2-y)} {R_2} &amp; \frac {(z_2-z)} {R_2} &amp; -1 \\
\frac {(x_3- x)} {R_3} &amp; \frac {(y_3-y)} {R_3} &amp; \frac {(z_3-z)} {R_3} &amp; -1 \\
\frac {(x_4- x)} {R_4} &amp; \frac {(y_4-y)} {R_4} &amp; \frac {(z_4-z)} {R_4} &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The first three elements of each row of ''A'' are the components of a unit vector from the receiver to the indicated satellite.  If the elements in the fourth column are ''c'' which denotes the [[speed of light]] then the &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; factor (time dilution) is always 1. If the elements in the fourth column are ''-1'' then the &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; factor is calculated properly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gif/gdop.gif&lt;/ref&gt;  Formulate the matrix, ''Q'', as:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \left (A^T A \right )^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

In general: &lt;math&gt; Q=(J_x^T(J_d C_d J_d^T)^{-1}J_x)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J_x&lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the sensor measurement residual equations &lt;math&gt;f_i(\underline{x},\underline{d})=0&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the unknowns, &lt;math&gt;\underline{x}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;J_d&lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the sensor measurement residual equations with respect to the measured quantities &lt;math&gt;\underline{d}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; is the correlation matrix for noise in the measured quantities.  For the preceding case of 4 range measurement residual equations: &lt;math&gt;\underline{x}=(x,y,z,\tau)^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\underline{d}=(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3,\tau_4)^T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau=c t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_i=c t_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_i=|\tau_i-\tau|=\sqrt{(\tau_i-\tau)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; f_i(\underline{x},\underline{d})=\sqrt{(x_i - x)^2 + (y_i - y)^2 +(z_i - z)^2}-\sqrt{(\tau_i-\tau)^2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_x=A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_d=-I&lt;/math&gt; and the measurement noises for the different &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; have been assumed to be independent which makes &lt;math&gt;C_d=I&lt;/math&gt;.  This formula for Q arises from applying Best Linear Unbiased Estimation to a linearized version of the sensor measurement residual equations about the current solution &lt;math&gt;\Delta\underline{x}=-Q*(J_x(J_d C_d J_d^T)^{-1} f)&lt;/math&gt;, except in the case of B.L.U.E. &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; is a noise covariance matrix rather than the noise correlation matrix used in DOP, and the reason DOP makes this substitution is to obtain a relative error.  When &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; is a noise covariance matrix, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is an estimate of the matrix of covariance of noise in the unknowns due to the noise in the measured quantities.  It is the estimate obtained by the First Order second Moment (F.OR.M.) uncertainty quantification technique which was state of the art in the 1980s. In order for the F.OR.M. theory to be strictly applicable, either the input noise distributions need to be Gaussian or the measurement noise standard deviations need to be small relative to rate of change in the output near the solution.  In this context, the second criteria is typically the one that is satisfied.

This (i.e. for the 4 range measurement residual equations) computation is in accordance with &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap1/142.htm |title=Section 1.4.2 of ''Principles of Satellite Positioning'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201060630/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap1/142.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the weighting matrix, &lt;math&gt;P=(J_d C_d J_d^T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, has been set to the identity matrix.

The elements of ''Q'' are designated as:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_x^2    &amp; \sigma_{xy}   &amp; \sigma_{xz}   &amp; \sigma_{xt}   \\
\sigma_{xy}   &amp; \sigma_{y}^2  &amp; \sigma_{yz}   &amp; \sigma_{yt}   \\
\sigma_{xz}   &amp; \sigma_{yz}   &amp; \sigma_{z}^2  &amp; \sigma_{zt}   \\
\sigma_{xt}   &amp; \sigma_{yt}   &amp; \sigma_{zt}   &amp; \sigma_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
PDOP, TDOP and GDOP are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
PDOP &amp;= \sqrt{\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + \sigma_z^2}\\
TDOP &amp;= \sqrt{\sigma_{t}^2}\\
GDOP &amp;= \sqrt{PDOP^2 + TDOP^2}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

in agreement with [https://web.archive.org/web/20141122153439/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap1/149.htm Section 1.4.9 of ''Principles of Satellite Positioning'']. More generally, GDOP is the square root of the trace of the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; matrix.

The horizontal dilution of precision, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle HDOP = \sqrt{\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the vertical dilution of precision, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \ VDOP = \sqrt{\sigma_{z}^2} &lt;/math&gt;, are both dependent on the coordinate system used.  To correspond to the local horizon plane and the local vertical, ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' should denote positions in either a north, east, down coordinate system or an east, north, up coordinate system.

'''Directional Boring''', often undifferentiated from Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD), is a minimal impact [[trenchless]] method of installing [[underground pipe]], [[Electrical conduit|conduit]], or [[Telecommunications cable|cables]] in a relatively shallow arc or radius along a prescribed underground bore path by using a surface-launched [[drilling]] rig. With respect to the pipeline/utility industry, the term "Directional Boring" or "Bore" is generally reserved for mini/small sized drilling rigs, small diameter bores, and crossing lengths in terms of hundreds of feet. Generally, the term Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) is intended to describe large/maxi sized drilling rigs, large diameter bores, and crossing lengths in terms of thousand of feet. Directional Boring and HDD, while similar in process to each other, are markedly different from directional drilling associated with the oil industry. The methods offer significant advantages over traditional cut and cover pipeline/utility installations and are routinely used when trenching or [[Digging|excavating]] is not practical. Boring/HDD can be utilized with various pipe materials such as [[PVC]], [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[ductile iron]], and [[steel]] as long as the pipe is sized appropriately to withstand installation stresses imparted during pullback. 

Directional Boring/HDD is generally accomplished in three principle phases. First, a small diameter pilot hole is drilled along a directional path from one surface point to another. Next, the bore created during pilot hole drilling is enlarged to a diameter that will facilitate installation of a pipeline. Lastly, the pipeline is pulled into the enlarge hole, thus creating a continuous segment of pipe underground and exposed only at the two initial end points.

Directional Boring/HDD is suitable for a variety of soil conditions and obstacles including road, landscape, wetland/marshes, and [[tunnel|river crossing]]s. Problematic soil conditions most often encountered in evaluating the feasibility of an HDD installation is large grain content in the form of gravel, cobbles, and boulders. Other subsurface conditions which can impact the feasibility of an HDD installation include excessive rock strength and abrasivity, poor rock quality, and solution cavities in karst formations.

==Equipment==
[[File:Drilling Rig 1.jpg|thumb|Maxi Sized Drilling Rig]]
The equipment used in horizontal directional drilling depends on the outer diameter of the pipe, length of the run, ground conditions and the surroundings above ground. 

For larger bores, directional drills equipped with as much as 600 [[tonnes]] {{nowrap|1 320 000 lb}} (or more) of thrust/pullback (Vermeer D1320x900) is used in conjunction with a mud reclaimer, excavator, and multiple pumps and hoses to supply the drilling fluid to the drillstem. Directional drilling stems are made from heat-treated high-carbon steel in diameters of {{nowrap|8 - 15 cm.}} Drill stem sections are manufactured in 3.0, 4.6, and 9.1 meter lengths with male and female threading on opposite ends. It is common for a directional drill to carry as much as {{nowrap|305 m}} of drilling stems. Drilling heads are available for different types of rock or soil. The drilling head has multiple water ports to allow removal of material. A [[talon bit]] head uses carbide-tipped blades to cut through material while steered by the operator. Another type of head is a [[Mud_motor|mud-motor]] that is used in rocky landscapes. Supporting equipment is often required, and may include a [[drilling mud recycling system|drilling fluid (mud) recycling system]], [[shale shaker]], mud cleaner, [[centrifugal pump]], and [[mud tank]]s.

For smaller bores, portable equipment is under development for drilling from a house basement to a shared water pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.tu.no/artikler/kandidat-4-hawle-techni-og-basum-gravefri-tilkobling-av-hus-til-hovedvannledning/409344 |title=Fant ny løsning som gir gravefri tilkobling av hus til hovedvannledning |publisher=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=18 October 2017 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==

Directional boring is used for installing [[infrastructure]] such as telecommunications and power cable conduits, water lines, sewer lines, gas lines, oil lines, product pipelines, and [[environmental remediation]] casings. It is used for crossing waterways, roadways, shore approaches, congested areas, environmentally sensitive areas, and areas where other methods are costlier or not possible. It is used instead of other techniques to provide less traffic disruption, lower cost, deeper and/or longer installation, no access pit, shorter completion times, directional capabilities, and environmental safety.

The technique has extensive use in urban areas for developing subsurface utilities as it helps in avoiding extensive open cut trenches. The use requires that the operator have complete information about existing utilities so that they can plan the alignment to avoid damaging those utilities. Since uncontrolled drilling can lead to damage, different agencies/government authorities owning the urban [[Right of way (public throughway)|''right-of-way'']] or the utilities have rules for safe work execution. For standardization of the techniques, different [[trenchless]] technology promoting organizations have developed guidelines for this technique.

==Process==
[[Image:Horizontal Drilling 2.JPG|thumb|Starting pit with pilot hole and some drilling fluid in the pit]]

The process starts with the receiving hole and entrance pits. These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to reduce costs and prevent waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path, and the second stage (reaming) enlarges the hole by passing a larger cutting tool known as the [[back reamer]]. The reamer's diameter depends on the size of the pipe to be pulled back through the bore hole. The driller increases the diameter according to the outer diameter or the conduit and to achieve optimal production. The third stage places the product or casing pipe in the enlarged hole by way of the drill stem; it is pulled behind the reamer to allow centering of the pipe in the newly reamed path.

Horizontal directional drilling is done with the help of a [[viscous]] fluid known as [[drilling fluid]]. It is a mixture of water and, usually, [[bentonite]] or [[polymer]] continuously pumped to the cutting head or drill bit to facilitate the removal of cuttings, stabilize the bore hole, cool the cutting head, and lubricate the passage of the product pipe. The drilling fluid is sent into a machine called a reclaimer which removes the drill cuttings and maintains the proper viscosity of the fluid. Drilling fluid holds the cuttings in suspension to prevent them from clogging the bore. A clogged bore creates back pressure on the cutting head, slowing production.

==Locating and guidance==

[[Image:Horizontal Drilling 5.JPG|thumb|Empty conduits laid by directional boring]]

Location and guidance of the drilling head is an important part of the drilling operation, as the drilling head is under the ground while drilling and, in most cases, not visible from the ground surface. Uncontrolled or unguided drilling can lead to substantial destruction, which can be eliminated by properly locating and guiding the drill head.

There are three types of locating equipment for locating the bore head: the ''walk-over'' locating system, the ''wire-line'' locating system and the gyro guided drilling, where a full inertial navigation system is located close to the drill head.

* Walk-over locating system — A sonde, or transmitter, behind the bore head registers angle, rotation, direction, and temperature data. This information is encoded into an electromagnetic signal and transmitted through the ground to the surface in a walk-over system. At the surface a receiver (usually a hand-held ''locator'') is manually positioned over the sonde, the signal is decoded and steering directions are relayed to the bore machine operator.
* Wire-line locating system — The wire-line system is a magnetic guidance system. With a magnetic guidance system (MGS), the tool reads inclination and azimuth. The MGS, also has a secondary means of location verification utilizing wire grids laid on the ground surface. It is the only system that has the capability of verifying the location. This information is transmitted through the wire-line fitted within the drill string. At the surface, the navigator in the drill cab performs the necessary calculations to confirm the parameters have been met. The MGS, even without the use of the wire grid, has been accurate to over 2&amp;nbsp;km with an accuracy of 2% at depth. The operator of the MGS communicates with the driller and guides him towards a predetermined engineered drill path.
* Gyro-based locating system — The gyro based system is fully autonomous and therefore one of the most accurate systems where sufficient diameter {{nowrap|(200 mm)}} is available and where long distances {{nowrap|(up to 2 km)}} have to be traversed with minimal deviation (less than {{nowrap|1 m}} position error). Currently the actual depth is not verifiable without the use of surface coils, a near surface transponder or sonde used in walkover systems. 

All three systems have their own merits, and a particular system is chosen depending upon the site requirements.

{{refimprove|date=August 2010}}
The '''earthquake bomb''', or '''seismic bomb''', was a concept that was invented by the British aeronautical engineer [[Barnes Wallis]] early in [[World War II]] and subsequently developed and used during the war against strategic targets in Europe.&lt;ref name="Operation Chastise"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dildy|first=Doug|title=Dambusters – Operation Chastise 1943|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-kgNMBRjNYC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=earthquake+bomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=suzdUO_sF-SA0AHknoDwAQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw |year=2012 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=1780964625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A seismic bomb differs somewhat in concept from traditional bombs, which usually explode at or near the surface, and destroy their target directly by explosive force. In contrast, a seismic bomb is dropped from high altitude to attain very high speed as it falls and upon impact, penetrates and explodes deep underground, causing massive caverns or craters known as ''[[camouflet]]s'', as well as intense [[shockwave]]s. In this way, the seismic bomb can affect targets that are too massive to be affected by a conventional bomb, as well as damage or destroy difficult targets such as [[bridge]]s and [[viaduct]]s.

Earthquake bombs were used towards the end of World War II on massively reinforced installations, such as [[submarine pen]]s with concrete walls several metres thick, underground caverns, buried tunnels, and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;"Dam Busters, Paul Brickhill.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and  mechanism of damage==
During development [[Barnes Wallis]] theorised that a highly aerodynamic, very heavy bomb with a delayed detonation would cause damage to a target through shock waves travelling through the ground, hence the nickname '''earthquake bombs'''.

The airmen who dropped the bombs reported that the target structures stood undamaged by the detonation; "But then the crater collapsed, the ground shifted and the target collapsed". Later computer simulations reached the same conclusions; the significant part of the damage was done by generating a cavity in the ground, and that cavity collapsing in on itself causing the ground to shift and the target's foundation to shift or break causing catastrophic structural damage to the target supported by said foundation. The shifting ground caused any larger structure to become severely damaged, even if the bomb missed the target but created a crater near it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwiiequipment.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=112:12000lb-tallboy-bomb&amp;catid=43:bombs&amp;Itemid=60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F16gb5h1sQ&lt;/ref&gt;

They were not true '''seismic''' weapons, but effective '''cratering''' weapons.

==Development==
{{Main|Tallboy bomb|Grand Slam (bomb)}}
[[File:seismic bomb.gif|thumb|An American [[T-12 Cloudmaker]] seismic bomb]]
An explosion in air does not transfer much energy into a solid, as their differing [[acoustic impedance]]s makes an [[impedance matching|impedance mismatch]] that reflects most of the energy. Due to the lack of accuracy of bombing in the face of anti-aircraft defences, air forces used [[area bombardment]], dropping large numbers of bombs so that it would be likely that the target would be hit. Although a direct hit from a light bomb would destroy an unprotected target, it was comparatively easy to armour ground targets with many yards of concrete, and thus render critical installations such as bunkers essentially bombproof. If the bomb could be designed to explode in water, soil, or other less compressible materials, the explosive force would be transmitted more efficiently to the target.

Barnes Wallis' idea was to drop a large, heavy bomb with a hard armoured tip at supersonic speed (as fast as an artillery shell) so that it penetrated the ground&amp;nbsp;like a ten-ton bullet being fired straight down.  It was then set to explode underground, ideally to the side of, or underneath, a hardened target.  The resulting shock wave would produce the equivalent of a 3.6 magnitude earthquake{{clarify|date=April 2014}}, destroying any nearby structures such as dams, railways, viaducts, etc. Any concrete reinforcement of the target would probably serve to enclose the force better.

Wallis also argued that, if the bomb penetrated deep enough, the explosion would not breach the surface of the ground and would thus produce an underground cavern (a ''[[camouflet]]'') which would remove the structure's underground support, thus causing it to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brickhill, Paul]], ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'', [[Evans Brothers]], London, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; The process was graphically described as a "trapdoor effect" or "hangman's drop".

Wallis foresaw that disrupting German industry would remove its ability to fight, and also understood that [[precision bombing]] was virtually impossible in the late 1930s. The technology for precision aiming was developed during World War II, and Barnes Wallis' ideas were then shown  to be superbly successful (see for example the [[Grand Slam (bomb)#Bielefeld raid|Bielefeld raid]] 14 March 1945), considering the standards at the time.

Wallis' first concept was for a ten-ton bomb that would explode some {{convert|130|ft}} underground. To achieve this, the bomb would have had to be dropped from {{convert|40000|ft|km}}. The RAF had no aircraft at the time capable of carrying a ten-ton bomb load aloft, let alone lifting it to such a height. Wallis designed a six-engine aeroplane for the task, called the "[[Victory Bomber]]", but he was not taken seriously by the military hierarchy of the day.

Wallis then took a different line in developing a means to destroy Germany's industrial structure with attacks on its supply of hydroelectric power. After he had developed the [[bouncing bomb]] and shown its possibilities, however, [[RAF Bomber Command]] were prepared to listen to his other ideas, even though they often thought them strange. The officer classes of the RAF at that time were often trained not in science or engineering, but in [[Classics|the classics]], Roman and Greek history and language.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} They provided enough support to let him continue his research.

Later in the war, Barnes Wallis made bombs based on the "earthquake bomb concept", such as the 6-ton [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] and then the 10-ton [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]], although these were never dropped from more than about {{convert|25000|ft|km}}. Even from this relatively low altitude, the earthquake bomb had the ability to disrupt German industry while causing minimum civilian casualties. It was used to disable the [[V-2 rocket|V2]] factory, bury the [[V-3 cannon|V3 guns]], sink the [[battleship]] [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and damage the [[U-boat]]s' protective pens at [[St. Nazaire]], as well as to attack many other targets which had been impossible to damage before. One of the most spectacular attacks was shortly after [[D-Day]], when the Tallboy was used to prevent German tank reinforcements from moving by train. Rather than blow up the tracks — which would have been repaired in a day or so — the bombs were targeted on a tunnel near [[Saumur#History|Saumur]] which carried the line under a mountain. Twenty-five Lancasters dropped the first Tallboys on the mountain, penetrating straight through the rock, and one of them exploded in the tunnel below. As a result, the entire rail line remained unusable until the end of the war.

After World War II, the United States developed the {{convert|43000|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[T-12 Cloudmaker|T12]] demolition bomb, which was designed to create an earthquake effect. Given the availability of [[nuclear weapons]] with [[surface burst|surface]] detonating [[laydown delivery]], however, there was little or no development of conventional deep penetrating bombs until the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. During the Gulf War, the need for a conventional deep penetrator became clear. In three weeks, a cooperative effort directed by the Armament Systems Division at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida developed the {{convert|5000|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[GBU-28]] that was used successfully by [[F-111F]]s against a deep underground complex not far from [[Baghdad]] just before the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The United States has developed a {{convert|30000|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Massive Ordnance Penetrator]], designed to attack very deeply buried targets without the use of nuclear weapons with the inherent huge levels of radioactive pollution and their attendant risk of retaliation in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Capaccio, Tony. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-14/30-000-pound-bunker-buster-bomb-now-ready.html "30,000-Pound Bunker Buster Bomb Now Ready"] ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 14 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Anglo-American bomb tests (Project Ruby) on the comparative effectiveness of large bombs against reinforced concrete structures were carried out in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a065940.pdf Comparative Test of the Effectiveness of Large Bombs Against Large Reinforced Concrete Structures, AAF Proving Ground, [[Eglin Field]], Florida, US, 31 October 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EasyGo''' is a [[joint venture]] between [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Austria]], that enables use of a single [[Electronic toll collection|electronic toll tag]] on [[Toll road|toll roads]], [[ferries]] and [[bridges]] in all the member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autopass.no/en/easygo|title=EasyGo - AutoPASS|last=Enonic|website=www.autopass.no|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of EasyGo is to enable the use of one [[Transponder#Road|OBE]] for payment when driving through any toll facility one might encounter on the way through [[Northern Europe]] and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://easygo.com/en/about-easygo/about-easygo|title=About EasyGo {{!}} EasyGo|website=easygo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EasyGo is based on DSRC 5.8 GHz [[microwave]] technology and there are major differences between the operators. The toll stations have different design and there is no common EasyGo signage, although there are some common features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.vegvesen.no/_attachment/283048/binary/499922&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
EasyGo was [[Europe's]] first [[Commerce|commercial]] cross-border toll collection service. Initial discussions began in 2004 when the [[Svinesund Bridge]] between Norway and Sweden was being built. The [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]] and the [[Swedish Transport Agency]] together with Sund &amp; Bælt (operator of the [[Great Belt Fixed Link]]) and Øresundsbro Konsortiet (Danish/Swedish joint venture, operator of the [[Øresund Bridge]]) established EasyGo in 2007.

Austrian [[ASFiNAG]] joined the partnership in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brobizz.com/en/node/3157|title=EasyGo: 10 år med grænseoverskridende betalingsløsninger|last=Thomsen|first=Lene Gebauer|date=2017-03-01|work=BroBizz®|access-date=2018-01-28|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All existing systems implemented in the [[Nordic countries]] by 2007 ([[Autopass|AutoPASS]] and [[BroBizz]]) are included, and no revision of the [[Law|laws]] in the countries was required. EasyGo countries have four different [[Currency|currencies]] and variable [[Value-added tax|VAT levels]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== EasyGo Basic ==
The EasyGo Basic service is for vehicles only travelling in [[Scandinavia]] or has a maximum allowable weight of 3.5 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://easygo.com/en/services/easygo-basic-0|title=EasyGo Basic {{!}} EasyGo|website=easygo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EasyGo+ ==
EasyGo+ is a cross-border toll collection service allowing drivers of vehicles over 3.5 tons to pay tolls in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, using only one OBE in all four countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://easygo.com/en/services/easygo-0|title=EasyGo+ {{!}} EasyGo|website=easygo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service Providers ==
There are several Service providers that provide the EasyGo services. However, some of Service Providers only supply OBEs for one of the services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://easygo.com/en/services/service-providers|title=Service Providers {{!}} EasyGo|website=easygo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many electronic paper technologies hold static text and images indefinitely without electricity. Flexible electronic paper uses plastic substrates and [[plastic electronics]] for the display backplane. There is ongoing competition among manufacturers to provide full-color ability.

==Technologies==

===Gyricon===
Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at [[Xerox]]'s [[Xerox PARC|Palo Alto Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Genuth|first1=Iddo|title=The Future of Electronic Paper|url=http://thefutureofthings.com/3081-the-future-of-electronic-paper/|publisher=The Future Of Things|accessdate=2 March 2015|ref=tfot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electronic paper, called [[Gyricon]], consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a [[janus particle]] composed of negatively charged black plastic on one side and positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a [[dipole]]).&lt;ref name="gyroid_dipole"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crowley |first1=Joseph M. |last2=Sheridon |first2=Nicholas K. |last3=Romano |first3=Linda |title=Dipole moments of gyricon balls |journal=Journal of Electrostatics |volume=55 |issue=3–4 |pages=247–259 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438860100208X |accessdate=20 November 2011 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3886(01)00208-X|year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.&lt;ref name="newscientist_1"&gt;{{citation |last=Daviss |first=Bennett |title=Paper goes electric |date=15 May 1999 |magazine=New Scientist |publisher= Reed Business Information |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16221864.700-paper-goes-electric.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the FPD 2008 exhibition, Japanese company Soken demonstrated a wall with electronic wall-paper using this technology.&lt;ref name="Soken"&gt;Techon [http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20081104/160670/ Soken electronic wall-paper]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Estonian company Visitret Displays was developing this kind of display using [[Polyvinylidene fluoride|polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)]] as the material for the spheres, dramatically improving the video speed and decreasing the control voltage.&lt;ref name="Liiv"&gt;J. Liiv. [https://www.scholars-press.com/catalog/details/store/us/book/978-3-639-51567-1/pvdf-as-material-for-active-element-of-twisting-ball-displays?search=liiv PVDF as material for active element of twisting-ball displays]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrophoretic ===
[[Image:E-ink.svg|thumb|500px|Appearance of pixels]]
In the simplest implementation of an electrophoretic display, [[titanium dioxide]] (titania) particles approximately one micrometer in diameter are dispersed in a hydrocarbon oil.  A dark-colored dye is also added to the oil, along with [[surfactant]]s and [[charging agent]]s that cause the particles to take on an electric charge.  This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 [[micrometre]]s.  When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate [[electrophoresis|electrophoretically]] to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles.  When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index titania particles.  When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye.  If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements ([[pixel]]s), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.

Electrophoretic displays are considered prime examples of the electronic paper category, because of their paper-like appearance and low power consumption.

Examples of commercial electrophoretic displays include the high-resolution [[active matrix]] displays used in the [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], [[Sony Librie]], [[Sony Reader]], [[Kobo eReader]] and [[iRex iLiad]] e-readers. These displays are constructed from an electrophoretic imaging film manufactured by [[E Ink Corporation]]. A mobile phone that used the technology is the [[Motorola Fone]].

Electrophoretic Display technology has also been developed by [[Sipix]] and [[Bridgestone]]/Delta.
SiPix is now part of E Ink. The Sipix design uses a flexible 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm Microcup architecture, instead of E Ink's 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm diameter microcapsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ink-info.com/introduction|title=E-Paper (E Ink) introduction and basic e-paper information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epapercentral.com/epaper-technologies-guide |title=Epaper technologies guide |publisher=epapercentral |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919211056/https://www.epapercentral.com/epaper-technologies-guide |archivedate=2012-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bridgestone]] Corp.'s Advanced Materials Division cooperated with Delta Optoelectronics Inc. in developing the [[Quick Response Liquid Powder Display]] (QR-LPD) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.bridgestone-dp.jp/global/adv-materials/QR-LPD/|title=製品情報（タイヤ/化工品/スポーツ用品/自転車） - 株式会社ブリヂストン|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecoolgadgets.com/bridgestone-flexible-epaper-quick-response-liquid-powder-technology/|title=BridgeStone Flexible ePaper – Quick Response Liquid Powder Technology - The Cool Gadgets - Quest for The Coolest Gadgets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrophoretic displays can be manufactured using the [[EPLaR|Electronics on Plastic by Laser Release (EPLaR)]] process developed by [[Philips|Philips Research]] to enable existing [[AM-LCD]] manufacturing plants to create flexible plastic displays.

An '''electrophoretic display''' forms images by rearranging charged pigment particles with an applied [[electric field]].

In the 1990s another type of electronic ink based on a microencapsulated electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped by a team of undergraduates at MIT&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A New Printing Technology Sets Off a High-Stakes Race|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB946939872703897050|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-27|issn = 0099-9660|first = Alec Klein Staff Reporter of The Wall Street|last = Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described in their Nature paper.&lt;ref name="e_ink_nature" /&gt;  J.D. Albert, [[Barrett Comiskey]], Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded [[E Ink Corporation]] in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with [[Philips|Philips Components]] two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to [[Prime View International]].  &lt;blockquote&gt;"It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 μm), quite distinct from the  molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-[[Lambertian reflectance|lambertian]] viewing characteristic, result in an 'ink on paper' look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6690/abs/394253a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1998-07-16|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 253–255|volume = 394|issue = 6690|doi = 10.1038/28349|first = Barrett|last = Comiskey|first2 = J.

This used tiny microcapsules filled with electrically charged white [[molecules|particle]]s suspended in a colored [[Mineral oil|oil]].&lt;ref name="e_ink_nature"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Comiskey | first1 = B. | last2 = Albert | first2 = J.

This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.
One early version of electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white [[titanium dioxide]] particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively [[electric charge|charged]], and each one is naturally white.&lt;ref name="newscientist_1" /&gt;
The screen holds microcapsules in a layer of [[liquid]] [[polymer]], sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.
The network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |newspaper=New Scientist |title=Roll The Presses |date=24 April 2001 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn659-roll-the-presses.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John A |last1=Rogers |first2=Zhenan |last2=Bao |first3=Kirk |last3=Baldwin |first4=Ananth |last4=Dodabalapur |first5=Brian |last5=Crone |first6=V R |last6=Raju |first7=Valerie |last7=Kuck |first8=Howard |last8=Katz |first9=Karl |last9=Amundson |first10=Jay |last10=Ewing |first11=Paul |last11=Drzaic |title=Paper-like electronic displays: Large-area rubber-stamped plastic sheets of electronics and microencapsulated electrophoretic inks |date=24 April 2001 |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=4835–4840 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4835.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.091588098 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |pmid=11320233 |pmc=33123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are commercially referred to as: Active Matrix Electrophoretic Displays (AMEPD).

===Electrowetting===
{{Main|Electrowetting}}
Electro-wetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.

Displays based on [[Electrowetting|electro-wetting]] provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=26 July 2010 |title=Oil-based color pixels could let you watch videos on e-paper |url=http://www.physorg.com/news199330889.html |newspaper=PhysOrg |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a low-power and low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;LiquaVista electrowetting display technologies http://www.liquavista.com&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using red, green and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electro-wetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.

This results in the availability of two thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.

The colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing for example. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |date=October 2, 2003 |title=The Hindu: Technology for reflective full-color display |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309052402/http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |archive-date=2011-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of commercial electrowetting displays include [[Liquavista]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liquavista.com|title=Home - Liquavista - Electrowetting based low power, always viewable color video displays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITRI]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itri.org.tw/eng/news-and-events/feature-story-detail.asp?RootNodeId=050&amp;NodeId=0502&amp;FocusNewsNBR=52] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ADT (company)|ADT]].&lt;ref&gt;Blankenbach K, Schmoll A, Bitman A, Bartels F and Jerosch D 2008 Novel highly reflective and bistable electrowetting displays SID J. 16 237–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iop.org/Select/article/0960-1317/19/6/065029/jmm9_6_065029.pdf?request-id=37ba45f3-e740-4c0d-8c35-dcf2d9af1f10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrofluidic====
[[Electrofluidic display]]s are a variation of an electrowetting display. Electrofluidic displays place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir.  The reservoir comprises &lt;5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamma Dynamic Technology|url=http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|publisher=Gamma Dynamics|accessdate=1 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303154148/http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|archive-date=3 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate.  As a result, the display takes on color and brightness similar to that of conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir.  As reported in the May 2009 Issue of Nature Photonics{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, the technology can potentially provide &gt;85 % white state reflectance for electronic paper.

The core technology was invented at the Novel Devices Laboratory at the [[University of Cincinnati]].  The technology is currently being commercialized by Gamma Dynamics.

===Interferometric modulator (Mirasol)===
{{Main|Interferometric modulator display}}

Technology used in [[electronic visual display]]s that can create various colors via [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of reflected light. The color is selected with an electrically switched light [[modulator]] comprising a [[micromachinery|microscopic cavity]] that is switched on and off using [[driver circuit|driver]] [[integrated circuit]]s similar to those used to address [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCD).

=== Plasmonic electronic display ===
Plasmonic nanostructures with conductive polymers have also been suggested as one kind of electronic paper.&lt;ref&gt;Xiong, Kunli; Emilsson, Gustav; Maziz, Ali. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201603358/abstract Plasmonic Metasurfaces with Conjugated Polymers for Flexible Electronic Paper in Color]"Advanced Materials: sid. n/a–n/a. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201603358/full doi:10.1002/adma.201603358]. ISSN 1521-4095. Last 28 oktober 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on the thickness of the insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (&gt;50 %), strong contrast (&gt;30 %), fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (&lt; 0.5&amp;nbsp;mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (&gt;10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent.Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.

The array of pixels is divided into [[Triad (monitors)|triad]]s, typically consisting of the standard cyan, magenta and yellow, in the same way as [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors (although using subtractive primary colors as opposed to additive primary colors).

==Disadvantages==
Electronic paper technologies have a very low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCDs. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard [[mobile device]]s. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.

[[Image:e-ink ghost.jpg|thumb|right|An e-ink screen showing the "ghost" of a prior image]]

Another limit is that a shadow of an image may be visible after refreshing parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed "ghost images", and the effect is termed "ghosting". This effect is reminiscent of [[screen burn-in]] but, unlike screen burn-in, is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology "flash" the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

E Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. released the first colored e-ink displays to be used in a marketed product.

[[File:EInk Refresh.gif|thumb|An e-paper display on a watch refreshes to remove ghosts.]]
Several companies are simultaneously developing electronic paper and ink.  While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:

* A method for encapsulation
* An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation
* Electronics to activate the ink

Electronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials.  For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets.  Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.

There are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic]] displays, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch A Sketch]] at Kyushu University.  Advantages of electronic paper includes low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays.  Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts.  The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop [[rollable display]]s for electronic devices.

In 2004 [[Sony]] released the [[Sony LIBRIé EBR-1000EP|Librié]] in Japan, the first e-book reader with an electronic paper [[E Ink]] display. In September 2006, Sony released the PRS-500 [[Sony Reader]] e-book reader in the USA. On October 2, 2007, Sony announced the PRS-505, an updated version of the Reader. In November 2008, Sony released the PRS-700BC, which incorporated a backlight and a touchscreen.

In late 2007, Amazon began producing and marketing the [[Amazon Kindle]], an e-book reader with an e-paper display. In February 2009, Amazon released the [[Kindle 2]] and in May 2009 the larger [[Kindle DX]] was announced. In July 2010 the third generation Kindle was announced, with notable design changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1453463&amp;highlight=|title=Amazon Media Room: Press Releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fourth generation of Kindle, called Touch, was announced in September 2011 that was the Kindle's first departure from keyboards and page turn buttons in favor of touchscreens.  In September 2012, Amazon announced the fifth generation of the Kindle called the Paperwhite, which incorporates a LED frontlight and a higher contrast display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3296627/amazon-new-kindle-paperwhite-announcement | title=Kindle Paperwhite e-reader announced, $119 Wi-Fi and $179 3G models ship October 1st | accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
In February 2006, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] daily ''[[De Tijd]]'' distributed an electronic version of the paper to select subscribers in a limited marketing study, using a pre-release version of the [[iRex iLiad]].  This was the first recorded application of electronic ink to newspaper publishing.

The [[French language|French]] daily ''[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]'' announced the official launch of an electronic version of the paper on a subscription basis, in September 2007. Two offers were available, combining a one-year subscription and a reading device. The offer included either a light (176g) reading device (adapted for Les Echos by Ganaxa) or the [[iRex iLiad]]. Two different processing platforms were used to deliver readable information of the daily, one based on the newly developed GPP electronic ink platform from ''[[Ganaxa]]'', and the other one developed internally by Les Echos.

===Displays embedded in smart cards===
Flexible display cards enable financial payment cardholders to generate a [[one-time password]] to reduce [[online banking]] and transaction fraud. Electronic paper offers a flat and thin alternative to existing [[key fob]] tokens for data security. The world's first ISO compliant [[smart card]] with an embedded display was developed by Innovative Card Technologies and nCryptone in 2005. The cards were manufactured by Nagra ID.

===Status displays===
[[Image:Lexar Jumpdrive Secure II Plus.jpg|thumb|USB flash drive with E Ink-implemented capacity meter of available flash memory]]
Some devices, like [[USB flash drive]]s, have used electronic paper to display status information, such as available storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEXAR ADDS INNOVATIVE STORAGE CAPACITY METER WITH ELECTRONIC PAPER DISPLAY FROM E INK |url=http://www.eink.com/press_releases/lexar_usb_drive_using_e_ink_010306.html |publisher=Eink - Press Release |accessdate=1 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014111900/http://www.eink.com/press_releases/lexar_usb_drive_using_e_ink_010306.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the image on the electronic paper has been set, it requires no power to maintain, so the readout can be seen even when the flash drive is not plugged in.

===Mobile phones===
Motorola's low-cost mobile phone, the [[Motorola FONE F3|Motorola F3]], uses an alphanumeric black-and-white electrophoretic display.

The [[Samsung SCH-U750|Samsung Alias 2]] mobile phone incorporates electronic ink from E Ink into the keypad, which allows the keypad to change character sets and orientation while in different display modes.

On December 12, 2012, [[Yota|Yota Devices]] announced the first "YotaPhone" prototype and was later released in December 2013, a unique double-display smartphone. It has a 4.3-inch, HD LCD on the front and an e-ink display on the back with smart battery usage.
Yota has updated its range with the [[Yotaphone 2]] and the [[YOTA 3]].

In December 2015, [[CRBT Siam]] launched the [[Siam 7X]], a dual-screen Android phone.
The [[Siam Duo]] is an updated model.&lt;ref name="Duo"&gt;[https://www.siamsmartphone.com/dual-screen-phone-duo.html Dual screen phone Duo].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic shelf labels===
{{main|Electronic shelf label}}
E-Paper based [[electronic shelf label]]s (ESL) are used to digitally display the prices of goods at retail stores. Electronic paper based labels are updated via two-way infrared or radio technology.

===Digital signage===
{{main|Digital signage}}
Because of its energy-saving properties, electronic paper has proved a technology suited to digital signage applications.

===Other===
Other proposed applications include clothes, digital photo frames, information boards and keyboards. Keyboards with dynamically changeable keys are useful for less represented languages, non-standard keyboard layouts such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]], or for special non-alphabetical applications such as video editing or games.
The [[reMarkable]] is a writer tablet for reading and note taking.

'''Energy and environmental engineering''' is a branch of [[engineering]] which seeks to efficiently use energy and to maintain the environment. Energy engineers require knowledge across many disciplines. Careers include work in the built environment, renewable and traditional energy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htm |title=Energy and Environmental Engineering - BEng/BEng(Hons) at Edinburgh Napier University |publisher=Courses.napier.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090442/http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htm |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this area, solar radiation is important and must be understood. Solar radiation affects the Earth's weather and daylight available. This affects not only the Earth's environment but also the smaller internal environments which we create.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Radiation and Daylight Models, 2nd edition, T Muneer, Elsevier, Butterworth and Heinman, London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy engineering requires at least an understanding of [[mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[materials science|materials]], [[stoichiometry]], [[electrical machines]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturing processes]] and energy systems.

Environmental engineering can be branched into two main areas: internal environments and outdoor environments.

Internal environments may consist of housing or offices or other commercial properties. In this area, the environmental engineering sometimes stands for the designing of building services to condition the internal environment to a comfortable state or the removal of excess pollutants such as carbon dioxide or other harmful substances.&lt;ref&gt;Air Conditioning Engineering, Jones and Arnold, London 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

External environments may be water courses, [[air]], [[land]] or [[sea]]s, and may require new strategies for harnessing energy or the creation of treatment facilities for polluting technologies.

This broad degree area covers many areas but is mainly mechanically and electrically biased. It seeks to explore cleaner, more efficient ways of using [[fossil fuels]], while investigating and developing systems using renewable and sustainable resources, such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind power|wind]] and [[wave power|wave]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htmvv ]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brown eye shadow palette.jpg|thumb|A palette of brown shades of powder eyeshadow.]]
'''Eye shadow''' is a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] that is applied on the [[eyelid]]s and under the [[eyebrow]]s. It is commonly used to make the wearer's eyes stand out or look more attractive. 

Eye shadow can add depth and dimension to one's eyes, complement the eye color, make one's eyes appear larger, or simply draw attention to the eyes. Eye shadow comes in many different colors and textures. It is usually made from a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] and [[mica]], but can also be found in [[liquid]], [[pencil]], cream or mousse form.
 
Civilizations across the world use eye shadow predominantly on females but also occasionally on males. In Western society, it is seen as a feminine cosmetic, even when used by men. In [[Gothic fashion]], black or similarly dark-colored eye shadow and other types of eye makeup are popular among both sexes.

Many people use eye shadow simply to improve their appearance, but it is also commonly used in theatre and other plays, to create a memorable look, with bright, bold colors. Depending on skin tone and experience, the effect of eye shadow usually brings out glamour and gains attention. The use of eye shadow attempts to replicate the natural eye shadow that some women exhibit due to a natural contrasting pigmentation on their eyelids.  Natural eye shadow can range anywhere from a glossy shine to one's eyelids, to a pinkish tone, or even a silver look.

==Use==
[[File:A woman wearing Eye Shadow.jpg|thumb|right|Eyes with heavy gold eye shadow]]
[[File:Eyeshadow.webm|thumb|Video demonstrating application of eye shadow.]]
Eye shadow can be applied in a wide variety of ways depending upon the desired look and formulation. Typically application is done using fingers or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eye shadow, and makeup in general, is blending well. However, you must not forget to include a primer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Eye Shadow Primer|url=http://www.notanothercovergirl.com/best-eyeshadow-primer/|website=Not Another CoverGirl|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to limit the chances of creases in your eye shadow later.
 
To remove eye shadow, a commercial eye makeup remover can be utilized, though a rich face wash will usually remove all traces of color. Generally it is easy to remove, and simple water and soap can be used. Eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara may also be removed using [[baby oil]]. There are also makeup wipes that can be used.

==History==
Cosmetics have been used for as long as there have been people to use them. Face painting is mentioned in the Old Testament ([[Book of Ezekiel]] 23:40), and eye shadow was used in Egyptian burials dating back to 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.aol.com/vanishwood/guild/cosmetic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021019044814/http://users.aol.com/vanishwood/guild/cosmetic.htm |archivedate=2002-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=March 2017}} The word "cosmetae" was first used to describe Roman slaves whose duty was to bathe men and women in perfume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.healthy.net/scr/article.aspx?ID=1712|title= A History of Fragrance|author= Kathi Keville &amp; Mindy Green |publisher= HealthWorld Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=March 2017}}

===Egypt===
[[File:Nefertiti 30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Nefertiti]] bust with eye shadow applied]]
As early as 10,000 BC, men and women used scented oils and ointments to clean and soften their skin and mask body odor. Dyes and paints were used to color the skin, body and hair. They [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]]d their lips and cheeks, stained their nails with [[henna]], and lined their eyes and eyebrows heavily with [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]. Kohl was a dark-colored powder made of crushed [[antimony]], burnt [[almond]]s, [[lead]], [[oxidize]]d [[copper]], [[ochre]], ash, [[malachite]], and [[chrysocolla]] (a blue-green copper ore) or any combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/hsc01b.htm|title=Smith College Museum of Ancient Inventions: Cosmetics and Perfumes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was applied with a small stick. The upper and lower eyelids were painted in a line that extended to the sides of the face for an almond effect. In addition to reducing sun glare, it was believed that kohl eyeliner could restore good eyesight and reduce eye infection.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20030529074319/http://www.courses.dsu.edu/ed370/crispage.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Kohl was kept in a small, flat-bottomed pot with a wide, tiny rim and a flat, disk-shaped lid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981203120352/http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/tours/egypt/dailylife.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to images of the time, the use of makeup was not limited to women.  Highly polished silver and copper mirrors aided the application of makeup.

===Greece ===
In Greece, precious oils, perfumes, cosmetic powders, eye shadows, skin glosses, paints, beauty unguents, and hair dyes were in universal use. Export and sale of these items formed an important part of [[Ancient Mediterranean trade|trade around the Mediterranean]]. During the 7th and 8th centuries BC, [[Corinth]]ian, [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] and East Greek traders dominated markets in perfume flasks and cosmetic containers. The containers included [[aryballoi]], [[alabastra]], [[pyxides]] and other small specialized shapes.

===Rome ===
Men and women in the Near East painted their faces with kohl just like the Egyptians did. This was to protect them from the ‘[[evil eye]].’ After the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|defeat of the Greeks by the Romans]], the Romans adapted the Egyptian custom, albeit with different ends. To the Romans, applying eye shadow became a matter of fashion and esthetics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Other cosmetics took on a medicinal application in Rome. Plagues were so rampant throughout Rome that aromatic gums and resins were burned to repel demons and bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinelodge.net/webdoc26.htm|title=Unknown|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
Common ingredients in eye shadows consist of [[talc]], [[mica]], [[sericite]], [[magnesium stearate]], colorants, and preservatives. Fillers in eye shadows are primarily talc. The liquid binders are typically a silicone and the dry binders are typically magnesium stearate. In order to make an eye shadow, there has to be a balance between the fillers, dry binders as well as liquid binders.

A '''feedlot''' or '''feed yard''' is a type of [[animal feeding operation]] (AFO) which is used in [[intensive animal farming]] for finishing livestock, notably [[beef]] [[cattle]], but also swine, horses, sheep, turkeys, chickens or ducks, prior to slaughter.  Large beef feedlots are called [[concentrated animal feeding operations]] (CAFO) in the United States&lt;ref name="cafo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Feeding Operations|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=7|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=20 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608194023/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=7|archivedate=8 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intensive livestock operations (ILOs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=98892fe8-ed63-4840-a7ba-5045d33bd0c5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428094049/http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=98892fe8-ed63-4840-a7ba-5045d33bd0c5 |archivedate=2012-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or confined feeding operations (CFO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/epw2069|title=The Application of the Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) for Siting Confined Feeding Operations in Alberta|first=Government of Alberta, Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, Intergovernmental Relations, Trade and Environment Division, Environmental Stewardship Branch, Environmental Extension and Programming Section, AOPA / CFO Extension|last=Unit|date=|website=www1.agric.gov.ab.ca|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada.  They may contain thousands of animals in an array of [[Pen (enclosure)|pens]].

==Purpose and regulation==
The basic principle of the feedlot is to increase the amount of meat each animal produces as quickly as possible; if animals are kept in confined quarters rather than being allowed to range freely over grassland, they will put on weight more quickly. 
 	
Most feedlots require some type of governmental permit and must have plans in place to deal with the large amount of waste that is generated.  The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has authority under the [[Clean Water Act]] to regulate all animal feeding operations in the United States.  This authority is delegated to individual states in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Final CAFO Rule, USEPA, Office of Water, 2009.  {{cite web |url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/cafofinalrule.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617232539/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/cafofinalrule.cfm |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, regulation of feedlots is shared between all levels of government, while in Australia  this role is handled by the National Feedlot Accreditation Scheme (NFAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/20/pid/7084.htm ''Beef Cattle Production and Trade''] |editor1=Cottle, David|editor2=Kahn, Lewis|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9780643109889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling and diet==
Prior to entering a feedlot, cattle spend most of their life grazing on [[rangeland]] or on immature fields of [[cereal|grain]] such as green wheat [[pasture]]. Once cattle obtain an entry-level weight, about {{convert|650|to|700|lb}}, typically at about a year old, they are transferred to a feedlot for the next six to eight months to be fed to gain weight for eventual slaughter.  They eat a specialized [[animal feed]] which consists of corn, corn byproducts (some of which is derived from ethanol and [[high fructose corn syrup]] production), milo, barley, and other grains as well as roughage which may consist of alfalfa, corn stalks, sorghum, or other hay, [[cottonseed meal]], and premixes composed of microingredients such as vitamins, minerals, chemical preservatives, [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotics]], fermentation products, and other essential ingredients that are purchased from premix companies, usually in sacked form, for blending into commercial rations. Because of the availability of these products, a farmer who uses his own grain can formulate his own rations and be assured his animals are getting the recommended levels of minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Zinn University of California, Davis  [http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/faculty/zinn/pdf/04.pdf A Guide to Feed Mixing]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the American northwest and Canada, barley, low grade durum wheat, chick peas (garbanzo beans), oats and occasionally potatoes are used as feed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In a typical feedlot, a cow's diet is roughly 62% roughage, 31% grain, 5% supplements (minerals and vitamins), and 2% premix.  High-grain diets lower the pH in the animals' [[rumen]].  Due to the stressors of these conditions, and due to some illnesses, it may be necessary to give the animals antibiotics on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Catherine. The Compassionate Carnivore: Or, How to Keep Animals Happy, save Old MacDonald's Farm, Reduce Your Hoofprint, and Still Eat Meat. Philadelphia, PA: Da Capo Lifelong, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedlot diets are high in protein, to encourage growth of muscle mass and the deposition of some fat (known as [[Marbled meat|marbling]] in butchered meat). The marbling is desirable to consumers, as it contributes to flavor and tenderness. The animal may gain an additional 400 pounds (180&amp;nbsp;kg) during its approximate 200 days in the feedlot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306001926/http://www.harrisranchbeef.com/about_feeding.html|title=Harris Feeding Company|author=|date=6 March 2005|website=archive.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once cattle are fattened up to their finished weight, the [[fed cattle]] are transported to a [[slaughterhouse]].

==Waste recycling==
Increasing numbers of cattle feedlots are utilizing [[out-wintering pads]] made of timber residue bedding in their operations.&lt;ref&gt;Augustenborg, C.A.; O.T. Carton; R.P.O. Schulte; and I. H. Suffet (2008)'Silage Dry-Matter Yield and Nitrogen Response following Land Application of Spent Timber Residue from Out-Wintering Pads to Irish Grassland',Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis,39:7,1122—1137. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103620801925711]&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients are retained in the waste timber and livestock effluent and can be recycled within the farm system after use.

==History==
The beef industry today is highly dependent upon technology, but this has not always been true.  In the early 20th century, feeder operations were separate from all other related operations and feedlots were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Georgia and Jaime Malaga. 2005. “West Texas Feedlots: Reality and Perspectives”. Texas Tech University.&lt;/ref&gt;  They appeared in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of hybrid grains and irrigation techniques; the ensuing larger grain crops led to abundant grain harvests. However, the first known feedlot was designed and built by Gustavus Swift in 1876 on the south side of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Philip D. Hubbs, M.A., The Origins and Consequences of the American Feedlot, Baylor University, History Department. August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was suddenly possible to feed large numbers of cattle in one location and so, to cut transportation costs, grain farm and feedlot locations merged.  Cattle were no longer sent from all across the southern states to places like California, where large slaughter houses were located.  In the 1980s, meat packers followed the path of feedlots and are now located close by them as well.

==Marketing==

There are many methods used to sell cattle to meat packers.  Spot, or cash, marketing is the traditional and most commonly used method.  Prices are influenced by current demand and are determined by live weight or per head.  Similar to this is [[forward contract]]ing, in which prices are determined the same way but are not directly influenced by market demand fluctuations.  Forward contracts determine the selling price between the two parties negotiating for a set amount of time.  However, this method is the least used because it requires some knowledge of production costs and the willingness of both sides to take a risk in the futures market.  Another method, formula pricing, is becoming the most popular process, as it more accurately represents the value of meat received by the packer.  This requires trust between the packers and feedlots though, and is under criticism from the feedlots because the amount paid to the feedlots is determined by the packers’ assessment of the meat received.  Finally, live- or carcass-weight based formula pricing is most common.  Other types include grid pricing and boxed beef pricing.  The most controversial marketing method stems from the vertical integration of packer-owned feedlots, which still represents less than 10% of all methods, but has been growing over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Clement. 2005. “Captive Supply Price Relationships and Impacts.” Oklahoma State University Oklahoma Extension Service. Bull. No. F-598.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and alternatives==
The practice of feeding cattle largely in feedlots has been widely criticized by [[animal welfare]] organizations. One concern is that as ruminants, cattle are suited to eating grass, not grain. Consequently, cattle may have issues such as bloating, diarrhea and digestive discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;"Farm Animal Welfare," Vancouver Humane Society website, May 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns with water contamination from feedlot runoff.  It is not only the animals who are concentrated; it is also their waste. Whereas manure is dispersed over a wide area when cattle graze freely and may have some benefits for the soil depending on climate and topography, the density of manure mixed with the soil in a concentrated operation poses potential health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramos|first=Athena|last2=Carlo|first2=Gustavo|last3=Grant|first3=Kathleen|last4=Bendixsen|first4=Casper|last5=Fuentes|first5=Axel|last6=Gamboa|first6=Rodrigo|last7=Ramos|first7=Athena K.|last8=Carlo|first8=Gustavo|last9=Grant|first9=Kathleen M.|date=2018-09-02|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Immigrant Cattle Feedyard Worker Perspectives on Job-Related Safety Training|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2313-576X/4/3/37|journal=Safety|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=37|doi=10.3390/safety4030037}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The alternative to feedlots is to allow cattle to graze on grass throughout their lives. Though controlled grazing methods of this sort necessitate higher beef prices, controlled grazing has benefits for the environment and for the cattle themselves. Controlled grazing provides a fresher and more natural diet, lower stress and their manure can be used to fertilize the land.&lt;ref&gt;"Organic Beef," Sunworks Farm website, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8589">'''GS1 EDI''' is a set of global electronic messaging [[Technical standard|standards]] for business documents used in [[Electronic data interchange|Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI). The standards are developed and maintained by [[GS1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/ GS1 Official website]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hQeGW8M5?url=http://www.gs1.org/ |date=2009-06-10 }} Retrieved on 2015-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; GS1 EDI is part of the overall GS1 system, fully integrated with other GS1 standards, increasing the speed and accuracy of the supply chain.
Examples of GS1 EDI standards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/edi GS1 EDI] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandfield.co.nz/Services/EDI-Services/GS1 “GS1 EDI standards”, Sandfield] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; include messages such as: Order, Despatch Advice (Shipping Notice), Invoice, Transport Instruction, etc. 
The development and maintenance of all GS1 standards is based on a rigorous process called the Global Standard Management Process (GSMP). GS1 develops its global [[supply chain]] standards in partnership with the industries using them. Any organization can submit a request to modify the standard. Maintenance releases of GS1 EDI standards are typically published every two years, while code lists can be updated up to 4 times a year.

==Standards==

GS1 developed the following sets of complementary EDI standards:

*'''GS1 EANCOM'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/eancom GS1 EANCOM] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edi-plus.com/resources/message-formats/eancom/ “What is EANCOM”, EDI Plus] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prozeus.de/eBusiness/standards/transaktion/eancom/index.html eBusiness-Praxis für den Mittelstand. EANCOM, Prozeus] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; - a subset of [[EDIFACT|UN/EDIFACT]], which comprises a set of internationally agreed UN standards, directories and guidelines for EDI. EANCOM is fully compliant to UN/EDIFACT.
*'''GS1 XML'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/ecom-xml GS1 XML] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prozeus.de/eBusiness/standards/transaktion/eancom/index.html eBusiness-Praxis für den Mittelstand. GS1 XML, Prozeus] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrieanzeiger.de/home/-/article/26441625/26750549/Forum-eStandards-empfiehlt-GS1-XML/art_co_INSTANCE_0000/maximized/industrieanzeigermarktaktuell “Forum eStandard empfiehlt GS1-XML”, Industrie Anzeiger] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; - a GS1 set of electronic messages developed using XML, a language designed for information exchange over internet. GS1 XML is based on UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification (CCTS) and UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology (UMM).
*'''GS1 UN/XML'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/gs1-un-cefact-xml/2012 GS1 UN/XML] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt; - GS1 has also developed its own profiles of four UN/CEFACT XML standards (Cross Industry Order, Order Response, Invoice and Despatch Advice), which are fully compliant with UN/XML.

These groups of standards are being implemented in parallel by various users, GS1 supports and maintains all of them.
GS1 EDI standards are designed to work together with other GS1 standards for the identification and labeling of goods, locations, parties and packages. This means that the information and product flows can be combined to provide business with tool enabling traceability, visibility and safety.
In EDI, it is essential to unambiguously identify products, services and parties involved in the transaction. In GS1 EDI standard messages, each product, party and location is identified by a unique GS1 identification key,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/id-keys GS1 Identification Keys] Retrieved on 2015-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.:

*products  by [[Global Trade Item Number|Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)]]
*parties, such as buyer, seller, and any third parties involved in the transaction as well as locations by [[Global Location Number|Global Location Number (GLN)]]
*logistic units by [[Serial shipping container code|Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)]]
*other GS1 ID keys, used e.g. for shipment and consignment identification

Using the GS1 ID Keys enables master data alignment between trading partners before any trading transaction takes place. This ensures data quality, eliminates errors and removes the need to send redundant information in electronic messages (such as product specifications, party addresses, etc.).

==Collaboration with other global standard organizations and industry associations==

GS1 EDI standards are developed based on other global standards, such as:

*[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] – e.g. code lists re-use
*[[UN/CEFACT]] – global methodologies applied, EDIFACT is a base for GS1 EANCOM standard
*[[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] – XML syntax

User companies are involved in the development of GS1 standards, either directly or via industry associations, such as The [[Consumer Goods Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/partners-and-sponsors/our-strategic-alliances "Our Strategic Alliances”, The Consumer Goods Forum (TCGF)] Retrieved on 2015-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation of GS1 EDI standards==

GS1 EDI standards are globally used by companies and organizations from different sectors and applied in various processes like Retail Up- and Downstream,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.nu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Standarder_2014-05.pdf Sammanställning av standarder och tillämpning för elektroniska affärer, Nätverket för Elektroniska Affärer] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Transport and Warehouse Management,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.logistiekprofs.nl/nieuws/philips-voorloper-in-standaardisatie-logistieke-interfaces Philips voorloper in standaardisatie logistieke interfaces", LogistiekProfs] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handelszeitung.ch/unternehmen/ikea-spart-kosten-ein “Ikea spart Kosten ein.

'''Greater Noida City''' is a north [[India]]n city with a population in excess of 100,000, located in the [[Gautam Budh Nagar district]] of the northern state of [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="census-report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/109-greater-noida-city.html|title=City Population Census 2011 -|work=census2011.co.in|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was created under the ''UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is a part of the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR) of India. Situated 30&amp;nbsp;km south-east of capital city of [[New Delhi]], it takes around 30 minutes to travel between the cities via the [[Noida-Greater Noida Expressway]].

==History==
In the early 1980s, the [[government of India]] realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos, so they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida City, there were two areas that had been developed—[[Gurgaon]], across the border from [[Haryana]], and [[Noida]], across the border with Uttar Pradesh.

Greater Noida Notified Area - 38000 Ha Comprising 124 villages (308&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
Noida's infrastructure was carefully laid out, but the 1990s saw huge growth in the [[Indian economy]]. Migration to cities like Delhi, [[Mumbai]], Kolkata, [[Chennai]], Hyderabad and Bangalore exceeded planning estimates. Noida was developed to accommodate population growth for 20–25 years. The massive population influx from [[Delhi]], however, caused it to overload in a mere 15 years, although [[infill|intake]] is not complete and illegal mining remains a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police, mining mafia exchange fire in Noida|date=1 May 2014|newspaper=the Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Police-mining-mafia-exchange-fire-in-Noida/articleshow/34472318.cms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502054509/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Police-mining-mafia-exchange-fire-in-Noida/articleshow/34472318.cms|archivedate=2 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bismil Park2811.JPEG|thumb|left|200px|[[Ram Prasad Bismil|Shaheed Bismil Park]], Sector-Beta 1 in Greater Noida City]]

The [[government of Uttar Pradesh]] decided to develop another city as an extension to Noida with better [[Urban planning|planning]]. The idea was to create a world-class city approximately 25&amp;nbsp;km from Noida. A railway station near [[Boraki Railway Station|Boraki]] and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.

During the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of [[Gautam Buddh Nagar]]) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The development of the city is managed by the Greater NOIDA Authority. Greater Noida is connected to [[Agra]] by the six-lane [[Yamuna Expressway]]. The annual [[Indian Grand Prix]] is held at the [[Buddh International Circuit]]. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma&amp;nbsp;II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]] lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the [[Mainpuri]] conspiracy. A park has been named "Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan" by the Uttar Pradesh Government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |title=वतन की ख्वाहिशों पे जिंदगानी कुर्बान(en:Sacrifice of life for homeland) |first= |last= |newspaper= ''Dainik Jagran'' ([[Hindi]] Jagran City-Greater Noida) [[New Delhi]]|page=24 |date=12 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th, 14th and 16th [[Auto Expo]]s (The Motor Show) were held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, in February 2014, 2016 and 2018 respectively.
In 2018, Gamma was officially declared as the capital of Greater noida.

Planners intended the area to provide [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]] region housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-15/noida/33862299_1_noida-extension-greater-noida-land-acquisition-row In 2018, Gamma was officially declared as the capital of Greater noida.|title=Noida Extension to now be called Greater Noida (West)|work=Times of India|author=Vandana Keelor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Harry Ralph Ricardo''' (26 January 1885 – 18 May 1974) was one of the foremost [[engine]] [[designer]]s and researchers in the early years of the development of the [[internal combustion engine]].

Among his many other works, he improved the engines that were used in the first [[tank]]s, oversaw the research into the physics of internal combustion that led to the use of [[octane rating]]s, was instrumental in development of the [[sleeve valve]] engine design, and invented the Diesel "Comet" [[Indirect injection#Swirl chamber|Swirl chamber]] that made high-speed [[diesel engine]]s economically feasible.

==Early life==
[[File:Harry Ricardo 13 Bedford Square blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 13 Bedford Square, London]]
Harry Ricardo was born at 13 Bedford Square, [[London]] in 1885, the eldest of three children, and only son of [[Halsey Ricardo]], the architect, and his wife Catherine Jane, daughter of Sir [[Alexander Meadows Rendel]], a civil engineer.  Ricardo was descended from a brother of the famous political economist [[David Ricardo]], a [[Sephardic Jewish|Sephardi Jew]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] origin. He was one of the first people in England to see an automobile when his grandfather purchased one in 1898. He was from a relatively wealthy family and educated at [[Rugby School]]. In October 1903 he joined [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] as a civil engineering student. Ricardo had been using tools and building engines since the age of ten.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite journal | first1=W.| last1=Hawthorne| title = Ricardo, Sir Harry Ralph (1885–1974)| journal = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/31599 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
In 1911 Ricardo married Beatrice Bertha Hale, an art student at the [[Slade School of Art]], in London. Her father, Charles Bowdich Hale, was the Ricardos' family doctor. They had three daughters, and lived most of their married life at [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]] and [[Edburton]] in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

==Car engines==
In 1904, at the end of his first year at Cambridge, he decided to enter the University Automobile Club's event, which was a competition to design a machine that could travel the furthest on {{convert|1|impqt|l|2|abbr=on}} of petrol. His engine had a single cylinder, and was the heaviest entered, but his motorcycle design won the competition, having covered a distance of {{convert|40|mi}}. He was then persuaded to join the Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics, [[Bertram Hopkinson]], working on research into engine performance. He graduated with a degree in 1906 and spent another year researching at [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

Ricardo is said by Percy Kidner, then Co-managing director of Vauxhall, to have had a hand in the design of the Vauxhall engine designed by [[Laurence Pomeroy]] for the RAC {{convert|2000|mi}} trial of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;T.R. Nicholson, ''Sprint – Speed Hillclimbs and Speed Trials in Britain: 1899–1925'', David &amp; Charles, 1969, Page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before graduation, Ricardo had designed a [[two-stroke]] motorcycle engine to study the effect of mixture strength upon the combustion process. When he graduated, the small firm of Messrs Lloyd and Plaister expressed interest in making the engine. Ricardo produced designs for two sizes, and the smaller one sold about 50 engines until 1914, when the war halted production.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/ricardo/textpage.htm#'DOLPHIN' Full Text&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 he designed a two-stroke 3.3-litre engine, for his cousin Ralph Ricardo, who had established a small car manufacturing company, "Two Stroke Engine Company", at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]]. The engine was to be used in the ''Dolphin'' car.&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', October 1968, Page 911.&lt;/ref&gt; The cars were well made, but it became apparent that they cost more to make than the selling price. The company fared better making two-stroke engines for fishing boats. In 1911 the firm collapsed and Ralph departed for [[India]]. Ricardo continued to design engines for small electric lighting sets; these were produced by two companies until 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Tank engines==
In 1915 Ricardo set up a new company, "Engine Patents Ltd.", which developed the engine that would eventually be used in the first successful [[tank]] design, the British [[Mark V tank|Mark V]]. The Daimler sleeve-valve engine used in the Mark I created copious amounts of smoke, which easily gave away its position. Ricardo was asked to look at the problem of reducing smoky exhaust gases and decided that a new engine was needed. Existing companies were able to undertake construction of such an engine but not the design, so Ricardo designed it himself. As well as having reduced smoke emissions, the new engine was much more powerful than the existing ones. The new six-cylinder engine produced {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, compared with {{convert|105|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and later modifications produced {{convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|hp|kW|abbr=on}} By April 1917 one hundred engines were being produced a week. A total of over 8,000 of his tank engines were put into military service, making it the first British-designed engine to be produced in large numbers. The [[Mark IX tank|Mark IX]] tank, as well as the British version of the [[Mark VIII (tank)|Mark VIII]], also used a Ricardo engine. In addition to being fitted to tanks, several hundred of the {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engines were used in France for providing power and light to base workshops, hospitals, camps, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/ricardo/#4.%20FIRST The Ricardo Exhibition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft engines==
In 1917 his old mentor, [[Bertram Hopkinson]], who was now Technical Director at the [[Air Ministry]], invited him to join the new engine research facility at the Department of Military Aeronautics, later to become the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]]. In 1918 Hopkinson was killed while flying a [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]], and Ricardo took over his position. From that point on the department produced a string of experimental engines and research reports that constantly drove the British, and world, engine industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/1900-1925/ricardo5.html Harry Ricardo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his first major research projects was on the problems of [[engine knocking|irregular combustion]], known as ''knocking'' or ''pinging''. To study the problem he built a unique [[Compression ratio|variable-compression]] test engine. This led to the development of an [[octane rating]] system for fuels, and considerable investment into octane improving additives and refining systems. The dramatic reduction in fuel use as a result of higher-octane fuel was directly responsible for allowing [[Alcock and Brown]] to fly the Atlantic in their [[Vickers Vimy]] bombers adapted with his modifications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advances in engine design==
[[File:Side valve engine with Ricardo's turbulent head 02.png|thumb|[[Flathead engine|Side valve engine]] with Ricardo's "Turbulent Head"]]
In 1919 Ricardo was studying the phenomena affecting the combustion within the [[petrol engine]] and the [[diesel engine]]. He realised that [[turbulence]] within the [[combustion chamber]] increased flame speed, and that he could achieve this by offsetting the [[cylinder head]]. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce the distance that the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined [[Inlet manifold|ports]] and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/ricardo/ The Ricardo Exhibition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The compression swirl chamber design was called a "Comet" design (patented in 1931) and was subsequently licensed to a large number of companies for use in trucks, buses, tractors and cranes, as well as private cars and taxis. A Comet combustion chamber was used in the first [[Associated Equipment Company]] (AEC) diesel buses operated in 1931 by [[London General Omnibus Company|London General Omnibus Co]], later part of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]]/[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]. A later development of it featured in the world's first volume production diesel passenger car, the 1934 [[Citroën Rosalie]]. This meant that Britain led the world in the field of high-speed diesels for road transport at that time. This advantage was lost to the United Kingdom as a result of the heavy tax imposed on diesel fuel in the budget of 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Ricardo designed the 1921 T.T. Vauxhall engine which was described by Cecil Clutton in ''Motor Sport'' as a ''tour de force''&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', April 1942, Page 77. See also: ''Motor Sport'', April 1969, Page 350; ''Motor Sport'', July 1969, Page 747.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1922 RAC T. T. O Payne in the Ricardo Vauxhall came 3rd, Jean Chassagne on a [[Grand Prix Sunbeams 1921, 1922 TT|1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam]] winning outright.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Robert (1966). T. T. Pioneers. The Manx Experience. P.166&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was later developed by [[Raymond Mays|Mays]] and [[Amherst Villiers|Villiers]], who fitted a supercharger, and was still a winner fifteen years later.&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Cummings won the [[Brighton Speed Trials]] in the Vauxhall-Villiers in 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 and 1923 Ricardo published a two-volume work "The Internal Combustion Engine".&lt;ref&gt;''The internal-combustion engine'' by Harry Ralph Ricardo, Blackie and Son Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 he formed [[Ricardo Consulting Engineers]] (now known as Ricardo plc) in [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], which has become one of the foremost automotive consulting firms worldwide and is [[Listing (finance)|publicly listed]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]].

Although Ricardo did not invent the [[sleeve valve]], in 1927, he produced a seminal research paper that outlined the advantages of the [[sleeve valve]], and suggested that [[poppet valve]] engines would not be able to offer power outputs much beyond 1500&amp;nbsp;hp (1,100&amp;nbsp;kW).  A number of sleeve valve aircraft engines were developed following this paper, notably by [[Napier Lion|Napier]], [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] and [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]. Bristol produced the [[Bristol Perseus|Perseus]], [[Bristol Hercules|Hercules]], [[Bristol Taurus|Taurus]] and the [[Bristol Centaurus|Centaurus]], Napier produced the [[Napier Sabre]], and Rolls-Royce produced the [[Rolls-Royce Eagle|Eagle]] and [[Rolls-Royce Crecy|Crecy]], all using sleeve valves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/ricardo/#9.%20SLEEVE The Ricardo Exhibition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 Ricardo was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

==World War II==
Ricardo's work on the sleeve valve affected the development of British aircraft engines in the thirties and during the war. He even enhanced the famous [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine in the [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] by giving it an oxygen enrichment system to improve its performance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5183 Blue Plaque for Mechanical Engineer Sir Harry Ricardo: Blue Plaques News: Blue Plaques: Research &amp; Conservation: English Heritage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricardo's work exerted influence all around the world. While his work guaranteed England a supply of fuels of ever-increasing power during the 1930s, it also helped Germany to develop synthetic high-octane aviation fuel, for example for the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] which inflicted heavy losses among the RAF's [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in 1942. Likewise, Ricardo's research on the detonation-inhibiting qualities of [[Water injection (engines)|water injection]] was exploited by German engineers ([[MW 50]]) to provide their aero-engines with a particularly powerful special emergency power rating.

During 1941–1945 Ricardo was a member of the War Cabinet engineering advisory committee.

Ricardo also assisted in the design of the combustion chambers and fuel control system of Sir [[Frank Whittle]]'s jet engine.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Post war period==
In 1944 Ricardo was elected president of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]. In 1945 he and his wife moved from Shoreham-by-Sea to [[Graffham]], also in [[West Sussex]]. In 1948 Ricardo was knighted in recognition for his work in the field of internal combustion engineering.

In 1964 Ricardo retired from active work in Ricardo Consulting Engineers but kept in touch with various engineers within the company.

In 1974, at the age of 89, Ricardo suffered a pelvic injury in a fall. He died six weeks later, on 18 May.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 21 May 1974, Obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue plaque Harry Ricardo.jpg|right|thumb|Blue plaque on 13 Bedford Square, London]]
On 16 June 2005 a [[blue plaque]] was placed outside the house where he was born in [[Bedford Square]], London. On 1 July 2010, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers bestowed an Engineering Heritage Award on Sir Harry Ricardo in recognition of his life and work as one of the foremost engineers of the twentieth century.  The first internal combustion engine which Harry Ricardo designed and built as a schoolboy currently displays this Engineering Heritage plaque in the Ricardo plc company exhibition area.

During the 1960s a second round of development of the Comet system was started, the company now armed with considerably more powerful test apparatus. The refined design was immediately used in many diverse applications, including cars, taxis, buses, trucks, industrial engines, earth-moving equipment, cranes and marine &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=John|title=Engines &amp; Enterprise|date=2008|publisher=Haynes Publishing|isbn=978 1 84425 516 0|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; before eventually being superseded by more efficient direct injection systems which are now used in the majority of diesel engines.

In 1978 the US [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] hired Ricardo Consulting to research the [[Stirling engine]] as a car engine. A series of engines, eventually forty-five in total, were built to test this system and showed very low emissions, but the efficiency was compromised by the need to operate under transient conditions—the design was best running at a single speed, making it less feasible as a car engine.

In 1986, the [[Rutan Voyager|Voyager]] was the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop and without refuelling. Ricardo Consulting redesigned the otherwise "stock" Teledyne [[Continental engine]] to incorporate a highly efficient combustion system and water cooling, thereby dramatically reducing drag and improving fuel economy.

Ricardo worked on spark-ignition engines throughout his career, including pioneering work on direct injection gasoline engines for aircraft engines in the 1930s, but his best-known work was in the development of high-speed diesel engines, in particular for cars. He was responsible for designing the combustion-chamber for the first diesel car engines produced in quantity for the Citroën Rosalie in the mid-thirties. Later, various versions of Ricardo's Comet pre-combustion chamber were deployed in almost all car diesel engines over six decades, up to the mid 1990s, and the Comet remains one of Ricardo's best-known personal achievements in automobile engineering.

Today several [[stratified charge engine]]s are in use in the automobile market. Stratified charge is a technology that has come of age relatively recently, as a result of advances in manufacturing and electronics, but it was a feature of the first engine that Harry Ricardo built, while still in his teens, in the early years of the 20th century.

A '''hellbox''' is a receptacle where cast metal ''[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]'' are thrown after printing. The job of sorting the type from the hellbox and putting it back into the [[Movable type|job case]] was given to the apprentice, known as a [[printer's devil]]. Later, when continuous casting or [[hot metal typesetting]] machines such as the [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] and [[Monotype System|Monotype]] became popular, the hellbox was used for storing discarded or broken type that were melted down and recast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46818">'''Human–computer interaction''' ('''HCI''') researches the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people ([[user (computing)|users]]) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. 
As a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of [[computer science]], [[behavioral sciences]], [[design]], [[media studies]], and [[Outline of human–computer interaction#Related fields|several other fields of study]]. The term was popularized by [[Stuart K. Card]], [[Allen Newell]], and [[Thomas P. Moran]] in their seminal 1983 book, ''The Psychology of Human–Computer Interaction'', although the authors first used the term in 1980&lt;ref name="The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems"/&gt; and the first known use was in 1975.&lt;ref name="Evaluating the impact of office automation on top management communication"/&gt; The term connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses (such as a hammer, useful for driving nails but not much else), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open-ended dialog between the user and the computer. The notion of dialog likens human–computer interaction to human-to-human interaction, an analogy which is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suchman|first1=Lucy|title=Plans and Situated Action.

==Introduction==
Humans interact with computers in many ways; the interface between humans and computers is crucial to facilitating this [[interaction]]. Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent [[graphical user interface]]s (GUI) of today.&lt;ref name="ACM SIGCHI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewett|last2=Baecker|last3=Card|last4=Carey|last5=Gasen|last6=Mantei|last7=Perlman|last8=Strong|last9=Verplank|title=ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human–Computer Interaction|url=http://old.sigchi.org/cdg/cdg2.html#2_1|publisher=ACM SIGCHI|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voice user interface]]s (VUI) are used for [[speech recognition]] and synthesizing systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage with [[Embodied agent|embodied character agents]] in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms. The growth in human–computer interaction field has been in quality of interaction, and in different branching in its history. Instead of designing regular interfaces, the different research branches have had a different focus on the concepts of multimodality rather than unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces rather than command/action based ones, and finally active rather than passive interfaces.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) defines human–computer interaction as "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them".&lt;ref name="ACM SIGCHI"/&gt; An important facet of HCI is user satisfaction (or simply End User Computing Satisfaction).
"Because human–computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in [[computer graphics]], [[operating system]]s, [[programming language]]s, and development environments are relevant. On the human side, [[communication theory]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[industrial design]] disciplines, [[linguistics]], [[social science]]s, [[cognitive psychology]], [[social psychology]], and [[human factors]] such as [[computer user satisfaction]] are relevant. And, of course, engineering and design methods are relevant."&lt;ref name="ACM SIGCHI"/&gt; Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success. HCI is also sometimes termed ''human–machine interaction'' (HMI), ''man-machine interaction'' (MMI) or ''computer-human interaction'' (CHI).

Poorly designed [[human-machine interface]]s can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example is the [[Three Mile Island accident]], a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster.&lt;ref name="What is Cognitive Ergonomics?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC: Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island Accident"/&gt;&lt;ref name="threemileisland"/&gt; Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard [[Flight instruments#Layout|flight instrument]] or throttle quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the "standard" layout and thus the conceptually good idea actually had undesirable results.

==Goals for computers==
Human–computer interaction studies the ways in which humans make, or do not make, use of computational artifacts, systems and infrastructures. In doing so, much of the research in the field seeks to ''improve'' human–computer interaction by improving the ''usability'' of computer interfaces.&lt;ref name=Grudin1992usability&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grudin|first1=Jonathan|title=Utility and usability: research issues and development contexts|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=1992|volume=4|issue=2|pages=209–217|url=http://iwc.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/2/209.short|accessdate=7 March 2015|doi=10.1016/0953-5438(92)90005-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; How usability is to be precisely understood, how it relates to other social and cultural values and when it is, and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=Matthew|last2=Galani|first2=Areti|title=Seamful interweaving: heterogeneity in the theory and design of interactive systems|journal=Procee

Much of the research in the field of human–computer interaction takes an interest in:

* Methods for designing new computer interfaces, thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability or efficiency of use.
* Methods for implementing interfaces, e.g., by means of [[library (computing)|software libraries]].
* Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties.
* Methods for studying human computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly.
* Methods for determining whether or not the user is human or computer.
* Models and theories of human computer use as well as conceptual frameworks for the design of computer interfaces, such as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] user models, [[Activity Theory]] or [[ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] accounts of human computer use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Yvonne|title=HCI Theory: Classical, Modern, and Contemporary|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Human-Centered Informatics|date=2012|doi=10.2200/S00418ED1V01Y201205HCI014|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perspectives that critically reflect upon the values that underlie computational design, computer use and HCI research practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sengers|first1=Phoebe|last2=Boehner|first2=Kirsten|last3=David|first3=Shay|last4=Joseph|first4=Kaye|title=Reflective Design|journal=CC '05 Proceedings of the 4th Decennial Conference on Critical Computing: Between Sense and Sensibility|volume=5|pages=49–58|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094569|accessdate=7 March 2015|doi=10.1145/1094562.1094569|year=2005|isbn=978-1595932037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve vary. When pursuing a cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities. When pursuing a [[post-cognitivist]] perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values.

Researchers in HCI are interested in developing design methodologies, experimenting with devices, prototyping software and hardware systems, exploring interaction paradigms, and developing models and theories of interaction.

==Differences with related fields==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
HCI differs from [[human factors and ergonomics]] as HCI focuses more on users working specifically with computers, rather than other kinds of machines or designed artifacts. There is also a focus in HCI on how to implement the computer software and hardware mechanisms to support human–computer interaction. Thus, ''human factors'' is a broader term; HCI could be described as the human factors of computers – although some experts try to differentiate these areas. 

HCI also differs from human factors in that there is less of a focus on repetitive work-oriented tasks and procedures, and much less emphasis on physical stress and the physical form or [[industrial design]] of the user interface, such as [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse devices]].

Three areas of study have substantial overlap with HCI even as the focus of inquiry shifts. [[Personal information management]] (PIM) studies how people acquire and use personal information (computer based and other) to complete tasks. In [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW), emphasis is placed on the use of computing systems in support of the collaborative work. The principles of [[human interaction management]] (HIM) extend the scope of CSCW to an organizational level and can be implemented without use of computers.

==Design==

===Principles===
[[File:Linux kernel INPUT OUPUT evdev gem USB framebuffer.svg|thumb|300px|The user interacts directly with hardware for the human ''input'' and ''output'' such as [[History of display technology|display]]s, e.g. through a [[graphical user interface]]. The user interacts with the computer over this software interface using the given [[Input/output|input and output]] (''I/O'') hardware.
&lt;br/&gt;
Software and hardware must be matched, so that the processing of the user input is fast enough, the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the computer output is not disruptive to the [[workflow]].]]
When evaluating a current [[user interface]], or designing a new user interface, it is important to keep in mind the following experimental design principles:
* Early focus on user(s) and task(s): Establish how many users are needed to perform the task(s) and determine who the appropriate users should be; someone who has never used the interface, and will not use the interface in the future, is most likely not a valid user. In addition, define the task(s) the users will be performing and how often the task(s) need to be performed.
* [[Empirical]] measurement: Test the interface early on with real users who come in contact with the interface on a daily basis. Keep in mind that results may vary with the performance level of the user and may not accurately depict the typical human–computer interaction. Establish quantitative [[usability]] specifics such as: the number of users performing the task(s), the time to complete the task(s), and the number of errors made during the task(s).
* [[Iterative design]]: After determining the users, tasks, and empirical measurements to include, perform the following iterative design steps:
*# Design the user interface
*# Test
*# Analyze results
*# Repeat
Repeat the iterative design process until a sensible, user-friendly interface is created.&lt;ref name="engineering"/&gt;

===Methodologies===
A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer [[interaction design]] have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. Early methodologies, for example, treated users' cognitive processes as predictable and quantifiable and encouraged design practitioners to look to cognitive science results in areas such as memory and attention when designing user interfaces. Modern models tend to focus on a constant feedback and conversation between users, designers, and engineers and push for technical systems to be wrapped around the types of experiences users want to have, rather than wrapping [[user experience]] around a completed system.

* [[Activity theory]]: used in HCI to define and study the context in which human interactions with computers take place. Activity theory provides a framework to reason about actions in these contexts, analytical tools with the format of checklists of items that researchers should consider, and informs [[Interaction design|design of interaction]]s from an activity-centric perspective.&lt;ref name="interaction-design"/&gt;
* [[User-centered design]]: user-centered design (UCD) is a modern, widely practiced design philosophy rooted in the idea that users must take center-stage in the design of any computer system. Users, designers and technical practitioners work together to articulate the needs and limitations of the user and create a system that addresses these elements. Often, user-centered design projects are informed by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of the environments in which users will be interacting with the system. This practice is similar to [[participatory design]], which emphasizes the possibility for end-users to contribute actively through shared design sessions and workshops.
* [[Principles of user interface design]]: these principles may be considered at any time during the [[User interface design|design of a user interface]] in any order: tolerance, simplicity, visibility, affordance, consistency, structure and feedback.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;
* [[Value sensitive design]] (VSD): a method for building technology that account for the values of the people who use the technology directly, as well as those who the technology affects, either directly or indirectly. VSD uses an iterative design process that involves three types of investigations: conceptual, empirical and technical. Conceptual investigations aim at understanding and articulating the various stakeholders of the technology, as well as their values and any values conflicts that might arise for these stakeholders through the use of the technology. Empirical investigations are qualitative or quantitative design research studies used to inform the designers' understanding of the users' values, needs, and practices. Technical investigations can involve either analysis of how people use related technologies, or the design of systems to support values identified in the conceptual and empirical investigations.&lt;ref name="value sensitive design"/&gt;

==Display designs==
Displays are human-made artifacts designed to support the perception of relevant system variables and to facilitate further processing of that information. Before a display is designed, the task that the display is intended to support must be defined (e.g. navigating, controlling, decision making, learning, entertaining, etc.). A user or operator must be able to process whatever information that a system generates and displays; therefore, the information must be displayed according to principles in a manner that will support perception, situation awareness, and understanding.

===Thirteen principles of display design===

Christopher Wickens et al. defined 13 principles of display design in their book ''An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering''.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;

These principles of human perception and information processing can be utilized to create an effective display design. A reduction in errors, a reduction in required training time, an increase in efficiency, and an increase in user satisfaction are a few of the many potential benefits that can be achieved through utilization of these principles.

Certain principles may not be applicable to different displays or situations. Some principles may seem to be conflicting, and there is no simple solution to say that one principle is more important than another. The principles may be tailored to a specific design or situation. Striking a functional balance among the principles is critical for an effective design.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

====Perceptual principles====

''1.	Make displays legible (or audible)''. A display's legibility is critical and necessary for designing a usable display. If the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible, then the operator cannot effectively make use of them.

''2.	Avoid absolute judgment limits''. Do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable on the basis of a single sensory variable (e.g. colour, size, loudness). These sensory variables can contain many possible levels.

''3.	Top-down processing''. Signals are likely perceived and interpreted in accordance with what is expected based on a user's experience. If a signal is presented contrary to the user's expectation, more physical evidence of that signal may need to be presented to assure that it is understood correctly.

''4.	Redundancy gain''. If a signal is presented more than once, it is more likely that it will be understood correctly. This can be done by presenting the signal in alternative physical forms (e.g. colour and shape, voice and print, etc.), as redundancy does not imply repetition. A traffic light is a good example of redundancy, as colour and position are redundant.

''5.	Similarity causes confusion: Use distinguishable elements''. Signals that appear to be similar will likely be confused. The ratio of similar features to different features causes signals to be similar. For example, A423B9 is more similar to A423B8 than 92 is to 93. Unnecessarily similar features should be removed and dissimilar features should be highlighted.

====Mental model principles====

''6.	Principle of pictorial realism''. A display should look like the variable that it represents (e.g. high temperature on a thermometer shown as a higher vertical level). If there are multiple elements, they can be configured in a manner that looks like it would in the represented environment.

''7.	Principle of the moving part''. Moving elements should move in a pattern and direction compatible with the user's mental model of how it actually moves in the system. For example, the moving element on an altimeter should move upward with increasing altitude.

====Principles based on attention====

''8.	Minimizing information access cost'' or [[interaction cost]]. When the user's attention is diverted from one location to another to access necessary information, there is an associated cost in time or effort. A display design should minimize this cost by allowing for frequently accessed sources to be located at the nearest possible position. However, adequate legibility should not be sacrificed to reduce this cost.

''9.	Proximity compatibility principle''. Divided attention between two information sources may be necessary for the completion of one task. These sources must be mentally integrated and are defined to have close mental proximity. Information access costs should be low, which can be achieved in many ways (e.g. proximity, linkage by common colours, patterns, shapes, etc.). However, close display proximity can be harmful by causing too much clutter.

''10.	Principle of multiple resources''. A user can more easily process information across different resources. For example, visual and auditory information can be presented simultaneously rather than presenting all visual or all auditory information.

====Memory principles====

''11.	Replace memory with visual information: knowledge in the world''. A user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or retrieve it from long-term memory. A menu, checklist, or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory. However, the use of memory may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some type of knowledge in the world (e.g., an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual). The use of knowledge in a user's head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design.

''12.	Principle of predictive aiding''. Proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions. A display should attempt to eliminate resource-demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the use of the user's mental resources. This will allow the user to focus on current conditions, and to consider possible future conditions. An example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance to a certain destination.

''13.	Principle of consistency''. Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support processing of new displays if they are designed consistently. A user's long-term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate. A design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays.

==Human–computer interface==
{{main article|User interface}}
The human–computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer. The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the ''loop of interaction''. The loop of interaction has several aspects to it, including:

* Visual Based :The visual based human computer inter-action is probably the most widespread area in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research.
* Audio Based : The audio based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of in HCI systems. This area deals with information acquired by different audio signals.
* ''Task environment'': The conditions and goals set upon the user.
* ''Machine environment'': The environment that the computer is connected to, e.g. a laptop in a college student's dorm room.
* ''Areas of the interface'': Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer not pertaining to their interaction. Meanwhile, the overlapping areas only concern themselves with the processes pertaining to their interaction.
* ''Input flow'': The flow of information that begins in the task environment, when the user has some task that requires using their computer.
* ''Output'': The flow of information that originates in the machine environment.
* ''Feedback'': Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back.
* ''Fit'': This is the match between the computer design, the user and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task.

==Current research==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Topics in human-computer interaction include:

===User customization===
[[End-user development]] studies how ordinary users could routinely tailor applications to their own needs and to invent new applications based on their understanding of their own domains. With their deeper knowledge, users could increasingly be important sources of new applications at the expense of generic programmers with systems expertise but low domain expertise.

===Embedded computation===
Computation is passing beyond computers into every object for which uses can be found. Embedded systems make the environment alive with little computations and automated processes, from computerized cooking appliances to lighting and plumbing fixtures to window blinds to automobile braking systems to greeting cards. The expected difference in the future is the addition of networked communications that will allow many of these embedded computations to coordinate with each other and with the user. [[Human interface device|Human interfaces]] to these embedded devices will in many cases be disparate from those appropriate to workstations.

===Augmented reality===
{{Main article|Augmented reality}}
Augmented reality refers to the notion of layering relevant information into our vision of the world. Existing projects show real-time statistics to users performing difficult tasks, such as manufacturing. Future work might include augmenting our social interactions by providing additional information about those we converse with.

===Social computing===
In recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis. Much of this research draws from psychology, social psychology, and sociology. For example, one study found out that people expected a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a woman's name.&lt;ref name=posard2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posard|first1=Marek|title=Status processes in human–computer interactions: Does gender matter?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2014|issue=37|pages=189–195|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002349|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.025|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more positively than humans, despite behaving the same way towards these machines.&lt;ref name=posardrinderknecht2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posard|first1=Marek|last2=Rinderknecht|first2=R.

===Knowledge-driven human–computer interaction===
In human and computer interactions, a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors. [[Ontology (information science)]], as a formal representation of domain-specific knowledge, can be used to address this problem, through solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong|first1=Hai|last2=Hussain|first2=Farookh|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Chang|title=A human-centered semantic service platform for the digital ecosystems environment|journal=World Wide Web|volume=13|issue=1–2|pages=75–103|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220301904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions and human-computer interaction ===
In the interaction of humans and computers, research has studied how computers can detect, process and react to human emotions to develop emotionally intelligent information systems. Researchers have suggested several 'affect-detection channels'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvo, R., &amp; D'Mello S.|first=|date=2010|title=Affect detection: An interdisciplinary review of models, methods, and their applications|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of telling human emotions in an automated and digital fashion lies in improvements to the effectiveness of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowie, R., Douglas-Cowie, E., Tsapatsoulis, N., Votsis, G., Kollias, S., Fellenz, W., &amp; Taylor, J. G.|first=|date=2001|title=Emotion recognition in human-computer interaction|url=|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine|volume=18|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of emotions in human-computer interaction has been studied in fields such as financial decision making using [[Ecg|ECG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astor|first=Philipp J.|last2=Adam|first2=Marc T.

===Brain–computer interfaces===
{{main|Brain–computer interface}}

==Factors of change==
Traditionally, computer use was modeled as a human–computer dyad in which the two were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel, such as text-based terminals. Much work has been done to make the interaction between a computing system and a human more reflective of the multidimensional nature of everyday communication. Because of potential issues, human–computer interaction shifted focus beyond the interface to respond to observations as articulated by D. Engelbart: "If ease of use was the only valid criterion, people would stick to tricycles and never try bicycles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fischer|first=Gerhard|date=1 May 2000 |title=User Modeling in Human–Computer Interaction |journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages= 65–86 |doi=10.1023/A:1011145532042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The means by which humans interact with computers continues to evolve rapidly. Human–computer interaction is affected by developments in computing. These forces include:

* Decreasing hardware costs leading to larger memory and faster systems
* Miniaturization of hardware leading to portability
* Reduction in power requirements leading to portability
* New display technologies leading to the packaging of computational devices in new forms
* Specialized hardware leading to new functions
* Increased development of network communication and distributed computing
* Increasingly widespread use of computers, especially by people who are outside of the computing profession
* Increasing innovation in input techniques (e.g., voice, [[gesture recognition|gesture]], pen), combined with lowering cost, leading to rapid computerization by people formerly left out of the ''computer revolution''.
* Wider social concerns leading to improved access to computers by currently disadvantaged groups

{{Asof|2010}} the future for HCI is expected&lt;ref&gt;SINHA, Gaurav; SHAHI, Rahul; SHANKAR, Mani. Human Computer Interaction. In: Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology (ICETET), 2010 3rd International Conference on. IEEE, 2010. p. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; to include the following characteristics:

* ''[[Ubiquitous computing]] and communication''. Computers are expected to communicate through high speed local networks, nationally over wide-area networks, and portably via infrared, ultrasonic, cellular, and other technologies. Data and computational services will be portably accessible from many if not most locations to which a user travels.
* ''High-functionality systems''. Systems can have large numbers of functions associated with them. There are so many systems that most users, technical or non-technical, do not have time to learn them in the traditional way (e.g., through thick manuals).
* ''Mass availability of computer graphics''. Computer graphics capabilities such as image processing, graphics transformations, rendering, and interactive animation are becoming widespread as inexpensive chips become available for inclusion in general workstations and mobile devices.
* ''Mixed media''. Commercial systems can handle images, voice, sounds, video, text, formatted data. These are exchangeable over communication links among users. The separate fields of consumer electronics (e.g., stereo sets, VCRs, televisions) and computers are merging partly. Computer and print fields are expected to cross-assimilate.
* ''High-[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] interaction''. The rate at which humans and machines interact is expected to increase substantially due to the changes in speed, computer graphics, new media, and new input/output devices. This can lead to some qualitatively different interfaces, such as [[virtual reality]] or computational video.
* ''Large and thin [[displays]]''. New display technologies are maturing, enabling very large displays and displays that are thin, lightweight, and low in power use. This is having large effects on portability and will likely enable developing paper-like, pen-based computer interaction systems very different in feel from present desktop workstations.
* ''Information utilities''. Public information utilities (such as home banking and shopping) and specialized industry services (e.g., weather for pilots) are expected to proliferate. The rate of proliferation can accelerate with the introduction of high-bandwidth interaction and the improvement in quality of interfaces.

==Scientific conferences==
One of the main conferences for new research in human–computer interaction is the annually held [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s (ACM) ''[[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]]'', usually referred to by its short name CHI (pronounced ''kai'', or ''khai''). CHI is organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction ([[SIGCHI]]). CHI is a large conference, with thousands of attendants, and is quite broad in scope. It is attended by academics, practitioners and industry people, with company sponsors such as Google, Microsoft, and PayPal.

There are also dozens of other smaller, regional or specialized HCI-related conferences held around the world each year, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confsearch.org/confsearch/faces/pages/topic.jsp?topic=hci&amp;sortMode=1&amp;graphicView=true|title=Conference Search: hci|website=www.confsearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infant massage''' is a type of [[complementary and alternative medicine|complementary and alternative treatment]] that uses [[massage therapy]] for babies. Evidence is insufficient to support its use in either full term or preterm babies.&lt;ref name=Cat2013/&gt;&lt;ref name = Vickers/&gt;

==History==
[[Ayurvedic medicine]] in [[History of India|ancient India]] taught the use of infant massage.&lt;ref&gt;Johari H. (1996). Ayurvedic Massage: Traditional Indian Techniques for Balancing Body and Mind. Inner Traditions Bear and Company. {{ISBN|978-0-89281-489-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also has been encouraged in [[China]] during the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Furth C. (1987). Concepts of Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Infancy in Ch'ing Dynasty China. Journal of Asian Studies,  46:7-35. {{JSTOR|2056664}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present it is part of traditional childcare in South Asia and elsewhere where daily massage by mothers is seen as "instilling fearlessness, hardening bone structure, enhancing movement and limb coordination, and increasing weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reissland | first1 = N | last2 = Burghart | first2 = R | title = The role of massage in south Asia: child health and development. | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–9 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3629298 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(87)90226-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas where infant massage is regularly used are African countries and areas in the former [[Soviet Union]].  In Western culture, infant massage has been increasingly used in [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s for pre-term infants who are in stressful environments and have limited [[Touch|tactile]] stimulation.&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt;

==Research==

A 2013 [[Cochrane review]] of massage therapy for babies less than 6 months of age who were born at term found that the evidence was insufficient to support its use.&lt;ref name=Cat2013&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Cathy|last2=Underdown|first2=Angela|last3=Barlow|first3=Jane|date=2013-04-30|title=Massage for promoting mental and physical health in typically developing infants under the age of six months|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD005038|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005038.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23633323}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 Cochrane review looking at massage therapy for pre-term and low birth weight was insufficient to justify its use.&lt;ref name = Vickers&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vickers A, Ohlsson A, Lacy JB, Horsley A |title=Massage for promoting growth and development of preterm and/or low birth-weight infants |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000390 |year=2004 |pmid=15106151 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000390.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Vickers |editor1-first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms==

Various mechanisms have been proposed as to suggest how massage therapy might benefit infants.  For pre-term infants, it has been suggested that any weight gain may be due to improved metabolic efficiency or by reducing the adverse reaction of stress through decreasing stress behavior or stress hormones.&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt;  Other possible mechanisms include increased [[vagal]] activity and secretion of [[insulin]] and [[gastrin]] as well as improved parent-infant relationships.&lt;ref name=Cat2013 /&gt;

==Safety==

Reviews of the literature have found no significant risks for adverse events with massage theory with either full term or pre-term infants.&lt;ref name=Cat2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt;  One study found that the use of certain oils in traditional societies such as [[mustard oil]] or [[olive oil]] might adversely affect pre-term newborn [[human skin|skin]] barrier function, while integrity and permeability while other oils that are [[linoleate]]-enriched such as [[sunflower seed oil]] may improve them.&lt;ref name=Cat2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullany | first1 = LC | last2 = Darmstadt | first2 = GL | last3 = Khatry | first3 = SK | last4 = Tielsch | first4 = JM | title = Traditional Massage of Newborns in Nepal: Implications for Trials of Improved Practice | journal = Journal of tropical pediatrics | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 82–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15677372 | pmc = 1317296 | doi = 10.1093/tropej/fmh083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Information science}}
'''Information management''' ('''IM''') concerns a cycle of organizational activity: the acquisition of [[information]] from one or more sources, the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it, and its ultimate [[disposition]] through [[archiving]] or deletion.

This cycle of organisational involvement with information involves a variety of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, including those who are responsible for assuring the [[quality (business)|quality]], [[accessibility]] and [[utility]] of acquired information; those who are responsible for its safe [[Data storage device|storage]] and [[:wikt:disposal|disposal]]; and those who need it for [[decision making]]. Stakeholders might have rights to originate, change, distribute or delete information according to organisational information management [[policies]].

Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management, including the [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], structuring, [[Business process|process]]ing, [[Internal control|control]]ling, [[evaluation]] and [[Data reporting|reporting]] of information activities, all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information. These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people. After individuals are able to put that information to use, it then gains more value.

Information management is closely related to, and overlaps with, the management of ''[[data]]'', ''[[system]]s'', ''[[technology]]'', ''[[Business process|process]]es'' and – where the availability of information is critical to organisational success – ''[[strategy]]''. This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier, more traditional view, that the [[Project life cycle|life cycle]] of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures, organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a [[product (business)|product]] or a service.

==History==

===Emergent ideas out of data management===
In the 1970s, the management of information largely concerned matters closer to what would now be called [[data management]]: [[punched cards]], [[magnetic tape]]s and other record-keeping [[Digital media|media]], involving a life cycle of such formats requiring origination, distribution, backup, maintenance and disposal. At this time the huge potential of [[information technology]] began to be recognised: for example a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] storing a whole [[book]], or [[electronic mail]] moving messages instantly around the world, remarkable ideas at the time.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, C., 1979. ''The Mighty Micro'', London: Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt; With the proliferation of information technology and the extending reach of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Venkat0"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87&lt;/ref&gt; information management took on a new form. Progressive businesses such as [[British Petroleum]] transformed the vocabulary of what was then "[[IT management]]", so that “[[systems analyst]]s” became “[[business analyst]]s”, “monopoly supply” became a mixture of “[[insourcing]]” and “[[outsourcing]]”, and the large IT function was transformed into “lean teams” that began to allow some agility in the processes that harness information for [[business benefit]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl"&gt;Cross, J. &amp; Earl, M., 1997. Transformation of the IT function at British Petroleum. ''MIS Quarterly'', 21(4), page 403&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of [[senior management]] interest in information at British Petroleum extended from the creation of value through improved [[business process]]es, based upon the effective management of information, permitting the implementation of appropriate information systems (or “[[application software|applications]]”) that were operated on [[IT infrastructure]] that was [[outsource]]d.&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl" /&gt; In this way, information management was no longer a simple job that could be performed by anyone who had nothing else to do, it became highly strategic and a matter for [[senior management]] attention. An understanding of the technologies involved, an ability to manage information systems [[project]]s and [[business change]] well, and a willingness to align technology and business strategies all became necessary.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning information management in the bigger picture===
In the transitional period leading up to the strategic view of information management, Venkatraman (a strong advocate of this transition and transformation,&lt;ref name="Venkat2"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87.&lt;/ref&gt; proffered a simple arrangement of ideas that succinctly brought together the  managements [[Data management|of data]], information, and [[knowledge management|knowledge]] (see the figure)) argued that:

* Data that is maintained in IT infrastructure has to be ''interpreted'' in order to render information.
* The information in our information systems has to be ''understood'' in order to emerge as knowledge.
* Knowledge allows managers to ''take effective decisions''.
* Effective decisions have to lead to ''appropriate actions''. 
* Appropriate actions are expected to deliver ''meaningful results''.

[[File:DIKAR model.jpg|thumb|This simple model summarises a presentation by Venkatraman in 1996, as reported by Ward and Peppard (2002, page 207).&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;]]
This is often referred to as the [[DIKAR]] model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result,&lt;ref name="Venkat1"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1996. Managing IT resources as a value center, ''IS Executive Seminar Series, Cranfield School of Management''&lt;/ref&gt; it gives a strong clue as to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management.  The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision-making for their success.&lt;ref name="Bytheway"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge], Geneva: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical background==

===Behavioural and organisational theories===
It is commonly believed that good information management is crucial to the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted [[theory]] of information management ''per se'', behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the [[behavioural science]] theory of management, mainly developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and prominently supported by March and Simon,&lt;ref name="March and Simon" /&gt; most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual's ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person's age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand – all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of [[system]] that it enables, especially as the [[social web]] emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon &lt;ref name="March and Simon"&gt;March, J.G. &amp; Simon, H.A., 1958. ''Organizations'', Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; argued that organizations have to be considered as [[cooperative systems]], with a high level of information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the "[[economic man]]", as advocated in classical theory &lt;ref name="Opp"&gt;see Opp, K.-D., 1985. Sociology and economic man. ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft/Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'', pp.213–243&lt;/ref&gt; they proposed "[[administrative man]]" as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of [[satisficing]], which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;Winter, S.G., 2000. The satisficing principle in capability learning. ''Strategic Management Journal'', 21(10-11), pp.981–996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theory===
In addition to the organisational factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are other issues that stem from economic and environmental dynamics. There is the cost of collecting and evaluating the information needed to take a decision, including the time and effort required.&lt;ref name="Hedberg"&gt;Hedberg, Bo (1981), "How organizations learn and unlearn", in: Nyström, P.C. &amp; Starbuck, W.H., ''Handbook of Organizational Design'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transaction cost]] associated with information processes can be high. In particular, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, leading to sub-optimum outcomes 
.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;Mackenzie K.D. (1978), ''Organizational Structures'', AHM Publishing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullins"&gt;Mullins, L.J (1993), ''Management and Organizational Behaviours'', 3rd ed., Pitman Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue that has been presented as a major problem with bureaucratic organizations that lose the economies of strategic change because of entrenched attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wigand"&gt;Wigand, Rolf T., Picot, Arnold and Reichwald, Ralf (1997), ''Information, Organization and Management: Expanding Markets and Corporate Boundaries'', Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic information management==

===Background===
According to the Carnegie Mellon School an organization's ability to process information is at the core of organizational and managerial [[competence (human resources)|competency]], and an organization's strategies must be designed to improve information processing capability &lt;ref name="Cyert"&gt;Cyert, R.M. &amp; March, J.G., 1959. A behavioural theory of organizational objectives. ''Modern Organization Theory'', Wiley, New York, pp.76–90&lt;/ref&gt; and as information systems that provide that capability became formalised and automated, competencies were severely tested at many levels.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, M.S.S., 1991. ''The corporation of the 1990s: Information technology and organizational transformation'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that organisations needed to be able to learn and adapt in ways that were never so evident before &lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;Senge, P.M., 1990. ''The fifth discipline'', Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; and academics began to organise and publish definitive works concerning the strategic management of information, and information systems.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earl"&gt;Earl, M.J., 1989. ''Management Strategies for Information Technology'', Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the ideas of [[business process]] management &lt;ref name="Hammer and Champy"&gt;Hammer, M. &amp; Champy, J., 2009. ''Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution'', A, Zondervan&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]] &lt;ref name="Nonaka and Takeuchi"&gt;Nonaka, I. &amp; Takeuchi, H., 1995. ''The knowledge creating company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation'', New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although much of the optimistic early thinking about [[business process redesign]] has since been discredited in the information management literature.&lt;ref name="Belmiro"&gt;Belmiro, T., Gardiner, P. &amp; Simmons, J., 1997. Business process re-engineering—A discredited vocabulary? ''International Journal of Information Management'', 17(1), pp.21–33&lt;/ref&gt; In the strategic studies field, it is considered of the highest priority the understanding of the information environment, conceived as the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are the physical, informational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aligning technology and business strategy with information management===

Venkatraman has provided a simple view of the requisite capabilities of an organisation that wants to manage information well – the [[DIKAR]] model (see above). He also worked with others to understand how technology and business strategies could be appropriately aligned in order to identify specific capabilities that are needed.&lt;ref name="Henderson and Venkat"&gt;Henderson, J.C. &amp; Venkatraman, N., 1993. Strategic alignment: leveraging information technology for transforming organizations. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 32(1), pp.4–16&lt;/ref&gt; This work was paralleled by other writers in the world of consulting,&lt;ref name="Zachman"&gt;Zachman, J. A. (1987). A framework for information systems architecture. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 26(3), 590–616&lt;/ref&gt; practice &lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, J., 1995. IT outsourcing : British Petroleum’s competitive approach. ''Harvard Business Review'', 73(3), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; and academia.&lt;ref name="Ward2"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Daniel, E., 2005. ''Benefits Management: Delivering Value from IS and IT Investments'', Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contemporary portfolio model for information===
Bytheway has collected and organised basic tools and techniques for information management in a single volume.&lt;ref name="Bytheway" /&gt;  At the heart of his view of information management is a portfolio model that takes account of the surging interest in external sources of information and the need to organise un-structured information external so as to make it useful (see the figure).

[[File:An Information Portfolio.jpg|thumb|This portfolio model organizes issues of internal and external sourcing and management of information, that may be either structured or unstructured.]]

Such an information portfolio as this shows how information can be gathered and usefully organised, in four stages:

'''Stage 1''': Taking advantage of [[public information]]: recognise and adopt well-structured external schemes of reference data, such as post codes, weather data, GPS positioning data and travel timetables, exemplified in the personal computing press.&lt;ref name="Ashbrook"&gt;Ashbrook, D. &amp; Starner, T., 2003. Using GPS to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', 7(5), pp.275–286&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 2''': Tagging the noise on the [[world wide web]]: use existing schemes such as [[post code]]s and [[GPS]] data or more typically by adding “tags”, or construct a formal [[ontology]] that provides structure. Shirky provides an overview of these two approaches.&lt;ref name="Shirky"&gt;Shirky, C., 2005. Shirky: Ontology is Overrated -- Categories, Links, and Tags. ''Clay Shirky’s Writings About the Internet''. Available at: http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html [Accessed May 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 3''': Sifting and analysing: in the wider world the generalised ontologies that are under development extend to hundreds of entities and hundreds of relations between them and provide the means to elicit meaning from large volumes of data. Structured data in databases works best when that structure reflects a higher-level information model – an ontology, or an [[entity-relationship model]].&lt;ref name="Noy"&gt;Noy, N.F., McGuinness, D.L. &amp; others, 2001. Ontology development 101: A guide to creating your first ontology, ''Stanford knowledge systems laboratory technical report KSL-01-05 and Stanford medical informatics technical report SMI-2001-0880''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 4''': Structuring and archiving: with the large volume of data available from sources such as the [[social web]] and from the miniature [[telemetry]] systems used in personal [[health management]], new ways to archive and then trawl data for meaningful information. [[Map-reduce]] methods, originating from [[functional programming]], are a more recent way of eliciting information from large archival [[dataset]]s that is becoming interesting to regular businesses that have very large data resources to work with, but it requires advanced multi-processor resources.&lt;ref name="Chu"&gt;Chu, C. et al., 2007. Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore. ''Advances in neural information processing systems'', 19, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competencies to manage information well===
The [[Information Management Body of Knowledge]] was made available on the world wide web in 2004 &lt;ref name="IMBOK"&gt;IMBOK, 2004. ''The Information Management Body of Knowledge''. Available at: http://www.imbok.org [Accessed May 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and sets out to show that the required management competencies to derive real benefits from an investment in information are complex and multi-layered. The framework model that is the basis for understanding competencies comprises six “knowledge” areas and four “process” areas:

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|This framework is the basis of organising the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004. This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]
;The information management knowledge areas
The IMBOK is based on the argument that there are six areas of required management competency, two of which (“business process management” and “business information management”) are very closely related.&lt;ref name="Bytheway2"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information:  the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p29&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Information technology''': The pace of change of [[technology]] and the pressure to constantly acquire the newest technological products can undermine the stability of the [[infrastructure]] that supports systems, and thereby optimises [[business process]]es and delivers benefits. It is necessary to manage the “[[supply side]]” and recognise that technology is, increasingly, becoming a [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, N., 2003. IT doesn’t matter. In ''Wringing real value from IT''. HBR OnPoint, pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Information system''': While historically information systems were developed [[in-house]], over the years it has become possible to acquire most of the software systems that an organisation needs from the [[Application software|software package]] industry. However, there is still the potential for [[competitive advantage]] from the implementation of new systems ideas that deliver to the strategic intentions of organisations.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;
* '''Business processes and Business information''': [[Information system]]s are applied to [[business process]]es in order to improve them, and they bring data to the business that becomes useful as [[business information]]. [[Business process management]] is still seen as a relatively new idea because it is not universally adopted, and it has been difficult in many cases; business ''information'' management is even more of a challenge.&lt;ref name="Belmiro0"&gt;Belmiro, T.R. et al., 2000. Are BPR practitioners really addressing business processes? ''International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management'', 20(10), pp.1183–1203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;Davenport, T.H. &amp; Short, J., 2003. Information technology and business process redesign. ''Operations management: critical perspectives on business and management'', 1, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business benefit''': What are the benefits that we are seeking? It is necessary not only to be brutally honest about what ''can'' be achieved, but also to ensure the active management and assessment of benefit delivery. Since the emergence and popularisation of the [[Balanced scorecard]] &lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton"&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Norton, D., 1996. ''The balanced scorecard - translating stragegy into action'', Boston MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; there has been huge interest in business performance management but not much serious effort has been made to relate business performance management to the benefits of information technology investments and the introduction of new [[information system]]s until the turn of the [[millennium]].&lt;ref name="Ward2" /&gt;
* '''Business strategy''': Although a long way from the workaday issues of managing information in organisations, [[strategy]] in most organisations simply has to be informed by information technology and information systems opportunities, whether to address poor performance or to improve differentiation and [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]]. Strategic analysis tools such as the [[value chain]] and [[critical success factor]] analysis are directly dependent on proper attention to the information that is (or could be) managed &lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;

;The information management processes
Even with full capability and competency within the six knowledge areas, it is argued that things can still go wrong. The problem lies in the migration of ideas and information management value from one area of competency to another. Summarising what Bytheway explains in some detail (and supported by selected secondary references):&lt;ref name="Bytheway3"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p31&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Projects''': Information technology is without value until it is engineered into information systems that meet the needs of the business by means of good [[project management]].&lt;ref name="Schwalbe"&gt;Schwalbe, K., 2013. ''Information technology project management'', Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business change''': The best information systems succeed in delivering benefits through the achievement of change within the business systems, but people do not appreciate change that makes new demands upon their skills in the ways that new information systems often do. Contrary to common expectations, there is some evidence that the [[public sector]] has succeeded with information technology induced [[business change]].&lt;ref name="Scholl"&gt;Scholl, H.J., 2005. E-government-induced business process change (BPC): An empirical study of current practices. ''International Journal of Electronic Government Research'' (IJEGR), 1(2), pp.27–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business operations''': With new systems in place, with [[business process]]es and [[business information]] improved, and with staff finally ready and able to work with new processes, then the business can get to work, even when new systems extend far beyond the boundaries of a single business.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Saeed, K.A., Malhotra, M.K. &amp; Grover, V., 2005. Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems on Process Efficiency and Sourcing Leverage in Buyer–Supplier Dyads. ''Decision Sciences'', 36(3), pp.365–396&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Performance management''': [[Investment]]s are no longer solely about financial results, financial success must be balanced with internal efficiency, [[customer satisfaction]], and with [[organisational learning]] and development.&lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton" /&gt;

===Summary===
There are always many ways to see a business, and the information management viewpoint is only one way. It is important to remember that other areas of business activity will also contribute to strategy – it is not only good information management that moves a business forwards. [[Corporate governance]], [[human resource management]], [[product development]] and [[marketing]] will all have an important role to play in strategic ways, and we must not see one domain of activity alone as the sole source of strategic success. On the other hand, corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing are all dependent on effective information management, and so in the final analysis our competency to manage information well, on the broad basis that is offered here, can be said to be predominant.

==Operationalising information management==

===Managing requisite change===
Organizations are often confronted with many information management challenges and issues at the [[operational level]], especially when [[organisational change]] is engendered. The novelty of new [[systems architecture]]s and a lack of experience with new styles of information management requires a level of organisational [[change management]] that is notoriously difficult to deliver. As a result of a general organisational reluctance to change, to enable new forms of information management, there might be (for example): a shortfall in the requisite resources, a failure to acknowledge new classes of information and the new procedures that use them, a lack of support from senior management leading to a loss of strategic vision, and even political manoeuvring that undermines the operation of the whole organisation.&lt;ref name="Knights and Murray"&gt;Knights, D. &amp; Murray, F., 1994. ''Managers Divided'', Chichester: John Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; However, the implementation of new forms of information management should normally lead to operational benefits.

===The early work of Galbraith===
In early work, taking an information processing view of organisation design, Jay [[Galbraith]] has identified five tactical areas to increase information processing capacity and reduce the need for information processing.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Galbraith, J.R., 1977. ''Organization design'', Addison Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;

* Developing, implementing, and monitoring all aspects of the “environment” of an organization.
* Creation of slack resources so as to decrease the load on the overall [[hierarchy]] of resources and to reduce information processing relating to overload.
* Creation of self-contained tasks with defined boundaries and that can achieve proper closure, and with all the [[resource]]s at hand required to perform the task.
* Recognition of lateral relations that cut across functional units, so as to move decision power to the [[Business process|process]] instead of fragmenting it within the [[hierarchy]].
* Investment in vertical information systems that route [[information flow]]s for a specific task (or set of tasks) in accordance to the applied [[business logic]].

===The matrix organisation===
The lateral relations concept leads to an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchy, the “[[matrix organization]]”.  This brings together the vertical (hierarchical) view of an organisation and the horizontal (product or project) view of the work that it does visible to the outside world. The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of external demand, avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.

The '''Institute for Food Safety and Health''' ('''IFSH''') is a research consortium consisting of the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]]’s [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (FDA CFSAN), [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT) and the food industry. Under the cooperative agreement, the Institute was established by IIT to bring together the food safety and technology expertise of academia, industry and government as a [[consortium]] in the common goal of enhancing and improving the safety of food for U.S. consumers.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iit.edu/ifsh/about |title=About |accessdate=21 March 2014 |publisher=Illinois Institute of Technology |website=IIT IFSH |deadurl=no |archivedate=28 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628055230/http://www.iit.edu/ifsh/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Institute was established as the National Center for Food Safety and Technology (NCFST) in 1988 with a $6.9 million donation of seven buildings and grounds by [[Corn Products International]] to IIT in 1988, located in the IIT [[Moffett Campus]].  The Moffett Technical Center consists of office, laboratory and pilot plant space located in [[Bedford Park, IL]] in the near west suburbs of Chicago. It was built in 1948-49 and named in honor of George M. Moffett, then-president of Corn Products Refining Co.

The main building features bas relief murals created by architectural sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]], who is best known for the ''[[Atlas statue (New York City)|Atlas]]'' statue in front of New York City’s [[Rockefeller Center]]. The panels depict various scenes of the history of corn and corn production in the Americas, including a buffalo hunt showing primitive corn grass, Native Americans cultivating and harvesting corn, and American corn milling and processing. One panel, labeled "Argo," appears to be symbolic of the Moffett Technical Center itself, showing an engineer working in the pilot plant, a chemist with retorts and test tubes, and a scientist at a microscope.

In 2011, the NCFST was rebranded as the Institute for Food Safety and Health. The NCFST now operates as a center within the institute, along with new platforms such as the Center for Nutrition Research, Center for Processing Innovation, and the Center for Specialty Programs. IFSH has FDA personnel, IIT faculty and students, and more than 50 food industry-related partner companies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=14 April 2011 | url=http://www.foodproductdesign.com/news/2011/04/iit-opens-institute-for-food-safety-and-health.aspx | title=IIT Opens Institute for Food Safety and Health | accessdate=21 March 2014 | work=Food Product Design }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute is currently located in Bedford Park, IL, although it formerly identified as being located in [[Summit, IL]].

The Moffett campus contains [[food microbiology]], [[food chemistry]] and packaging, [[food processing|food process engineering]], methods validation, and proficiency testing laboratories. The institute also contains a [[BSL-3]] laboratory and biocontainment pilot plant, which is the only BSL-3 biocontainment plant in the United States. 

The Department of Food Science and Nutrition offers certification in several topics, a doctorate degree, and masters degrees.

[[Image:kcspclimber.jpg|thumb|The Kansas City Space Pirates 2006 climber going up the ribbon]]

The '''KC Space Pirates''' is a team that competed in the 2006, 2007, and 2009 [[Space Elevator]] Games beamed energy climber competition and is planning to enter in the [[Elevator:2010]] climber competition. The team is affiliated with, but is not sponsored by, the KC Robotics Society.

The competition is put on by the Spaceward Foundation. The goal of the competition is to encourage universities and groups to research and create designs for beaming power to distant objects, but for the competition Spaceward has used the [[Space Elevator]] concept to make it more challenging and to show how beamed power could work. [[NASA]] has put up the top prize of up to {{US$}}2,000,000 ($900,000 for the 2 meters/second category and $1,100,000 for the 5 meters/second category) for the 2009 competition.  The 2 meters/second prize was won during the 2009 competition so only the 5 meters/second category remains for 2010.

The competition is in the form of a race, 1&amp;nbsp;km (3,281&amp;nbsp;ft) straight up. The climbers are unmanned, have a maximum allowed weight of 25&amp;nbsp;kg (55&amp;nbsp;lbs), and may use no fuel or batteries to climb—they must only be powered by beamed energy. So far, the top designs have been reflected sunlight and laser. The KC Space Pirates used sunlight reflected off of a large array of mirrors concentrated onto a highly efficient array of solar cells in 2006 and 2007.  They switched to using an infrared laser for the 2009 competition and will continue to do so in 2010.

The KC Space Pirates was the only 2009 team to have a fully automated laser tracking system.  They did well in each competition but fell short of the money.

''TechCrunch'', 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt; The key components of the LPD technology are its TD2 tiles, its image processor and its backing frame that supports LPD tile arrays.&lt;ref name="clancy-2013-12-19"/&gt; The company unveiled the LPD in January 2010.&lt;ref name="greene-2010-01-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physorg-2010-06-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clancy-2013-12-19"/&gt; 

==Operation principles==

The concept behind the LPD technology is quite simple. LPD uses a set of movable mirrors to direct several beams of light from several ultra-violet lasers onto a screen made of a plastic-glass hybrid material coated with color phosphor stripes. The laser draws an image onto the screen by scanning line by line from top to bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, Wade. [http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2010/01/13/prysm-hopes-laser-driven-screens-will-outshine-lcd-led-displays/ "Prysm Hopes Laser-Driven Screens Will Outshine LCD, LED Displays"]. ''Xconomy'', 2010-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; The energy from the lasers' light activates the phosphors, which emit photons, producing an image.&lt;ref name="greene-2010-01-20"&gt;Greene, Kate. [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/417162/a-new-breed-of-laser-tv/ "A New Breed of Laser TV"]. ''MIT Technology Review'', 2010-01-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ayala-2010-01-15"&gt;Ayala, David.

''Phys.org'', 2010-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The building blocks of every Prysm video wall are the Laser Phosphor Display (LPD) tiles called the TD2. Video walls are implemented using this new generation LPD TD2 tile, a virtually seamless, bezel-free building block. TD2, launched at InfoComm 2013, features increased resolution, brightness and enhanced uniformity. A variable number of TD2 tiles can be arranged in arbitrary configurations to form [[Video wall|videowalls]] in various sizes and shapes.&lt;ref name="td1-spec-sheet"&gt;[http://www.prysm.com/assets/uploadedFiles/prysm-td1-tile-spec-sheet-552-00002-00.pdf TD1 Tile Product Specification Sheet]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

''AV Magazine'', 2014-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

The main difference between the LPD and CRT technologies is that the first relies on [[laser]] whereas the second uses an electron gun to activate the [[Phosphorescence| phosphorescent]] substance that creates images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=Laser+Phosphor+Display&amp;i=61655,00.asp "Definition of: Laser Phosphor Display"]. ''PCMag.com''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another competitor, [[plasma display]] technology, consists of small cells of ionized gases that emit light–a process that requires a relatively large amount of power. And a conventional laser television, such as the LaserVue, made by Mitsubishi, uses red, blue, and green lasers and a micromirror device that combines and directs the light. This is essentially a rear-projection display that wasn't popular due to cost.&lt;ref name="rogers-2013-12-04"&gt;Clancy, Heather. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2013/12/04/roger-hajjars-prysm-wants-to-bring-eco-friendly-life-size-video-to-your-home/#136772bb2b86 "Roger Hajjar's Prysm Wants to Bring Eco-Friendly, Life-Size Video To Your Home"]. ''Forbes (magazine)'', 2013-12-04&lt;/ref&gt;

LPD requires less electricity than competing technologies including LCD and [[Light-emitting diode|light-emitting diode (LED)]].&lt;ref name="xconomy1"&gt;Roush, Wade. [http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2010/12/08/at-american-eagle-prysms-laser-displays-banish-the-bezel-startup-to-present-at-tonights-5x5-event/ "At American Eagle, Prysm's Laser Displays Banish the Bezel; Startup to Present at Tonight's 5×5 Event"]. ''Xconomy'', 2010-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;IAC reported a 70% reduction in power by switching to LPD,&lt;ref&gt;Brousell, Lauren. [http://www.cio-digital.com/ciodigital/20121115?pg=35#pg35 "Great Wall of Video"]. ''CIO'', 2012-11-15&lt;/ref&gt; and Prysm says LPD uses up to 75 percent less power than most other display technologies on the market.&lt;ref name="hall-2010-06-21" /&gt;  An LPD device differs significantly from LCD in that more than 90 percent of the original light is lost in the latter process. 

The TD2, building block of a video wall, does not suffer the problem of low brightness, contains  no toxic component, has no consumables, and generates little heat. Its displays  are highly configurable and can be stacked seamlessly to create supersized high-resolution video walls of almost any size or shape.&lt;ref name="physorg-2010-06-01"/&gt; 

According to Prysm, the LPD technology has other advantages including great black levels, a wide 180-degree viewing angle, a 65,000-hour panel life with no burn-in issues, completely recyclable components, and their production process is mercury free.[*]

LPD competes with [[Liquid crystal display|liquid crystal display (LCD)]], [[Plasma display|plasma display panel (PDP)]], [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|surface electron display (SED)]] and other large-format display technologies.&lt;ref name="ayala-2010-01-15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmarais, Martin. [http://www.indusbusinessjournal.com/me2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=Archive&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=5E7D673DCDF4470BA10995F015AE9425 "Picture Perfect"]. ''IndUS Business Journal'', 2010-09-03&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of LPD is that the displays are deeper than some competing technologies,&lt;ref&gt;Taub, Eric A. [http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/is-lpd-the-next-lcd/ "Is LPD the Next LCD?"]. ''The New York Times'', 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt; ''each TD1 Tile including all peripherals measures almost 17 inches deep''.&lt;ref name="td1-spec-sheet" /&gt; Depending on the frame type, the total installed depth varies between 24 and 30 inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prysm.com/assets/uploadedFiles/StandardFrame/Prysm_Spec_Sheet_Standard_Frame.pdf Standard Frame Product Specification Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144158/http://www.prysm.com/assets/uploadedFiles/StandardFrame/Prysm_Spec_Sheet_Standard_Frame.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">A '''linjesender''' (English: "'''line transmitter'''") was a low-power [[longwave]] [[transmitter]] system used for broadcasting in [[Norway]]. It consisted of a [[power line communication]] system, which fed the radio programme on a frequency in the longwave broadcasting range into domestic powerlines.

The last linjesender in Norway was closed in 1987 although the Swiss counterpart survived another ten years.

==Features==
The typical powers used by linjesenders were between 250 watts and 2 kW. Most systems used frequencies in the [[longwave]] band or in between the LW and MW band although some used [[medium wave]] or frequencies below the standard LW band which required special receivers.

Wired broadcasting had several advantages over conventional broadcasting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Drahtfunk / Telephon Rundspruch |work= Buizenradio en zo... / De afstemschaal |language= Dutch |url= http://buizenradio.verdijk.info/afstemschaal/drahtfunk.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402205230/http://buizenradio.verdijk.info/afstemschaal/drahtfunk.html |archivedate= 2 April 2007 |accessdate= 22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Less susceptible to interference
# Potentially greater number of programmes (as overcrowding on the frequency bands was less of a problem)
# Potentially greater audio quality as wired transmissions were not subject to the same restrictions on bandwidth as terrestrial AM broadcasts.
#  In a mountainous country like [[Switzerland]] it was difficult to obtain satisfactory national coverage with conventional transmitters, particularly in the 1930s when transmissions were typically less powerful than today.

On the other hand there were practical and economic difficulties in extending such services to remote or thinly populated regions. Wired broadcasting could also be used by governments as a tool of [[censorship]] through promoting ownership of wire-only receivers which could not receive foreign stations.

==Similar systems==
Similar systems were used in [[Germany]], where it was called "[[Drahtfunk]]" ("wire radio") and in [[Switzerland]], where it was called "[[Telefonrundspruch]]" ("telephone broadcast"), both of these systems used domestic [[telephone]] lines. In some countries occupied by Germany during the [[Second World War]] these systems entirely replaced conventional broadcasting. In the [[Netherlands]] all standard receivers were confiscated and replaced with wire-only sets as these could receive local and German broadcasts but not enemy stations such as the BBC.

In the 1930s some towns in [[Great Britain]] used wire broadcasting experimentally either over dedicated cables (sometimes as [[baseband]] audio) or through power lines. However as the coverage of conventional broadcast stations improved the popularity of these "radio relay" or "rediffusion" systems waned and local councils were often hostile to their installation.

;[[Microburst]]
: The microburst was first discovered and identified as a small scale [[downburst]] affecting an area 4 km (2.5 mi) in diameter or less by [[Ted Fujita]] in 1974. Microbursts are recognized as capable of generating wind speeds higher than 270 km/h (170 mph). In addition, Fujita also discovered [[macroburst]]s and classified them as downbursts larger than 4 km (2.5 mi).&lt;ref name="Brittanica T. Theodore Fujita" /&gt;

;[[Aikido]]
: Aikido was created and developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] in first half of the 20th century.

;[[Jujutsu]]
: Jujutsu, the "way of yielding", is a collective name for Japanese martial art styles including unarmed and armed techniques. Jujutsu evolved among the samurai of feudal Japan as a method for defeating an armed and armored opponent without weapons. Due to the ineffectiveness of striking against an armored opponent, the most efficient methods for neutralizing an enemy took the form of pins, joint locks, and throws. These techniques were developed around the principle of using an attacker's energy against him, rather than directly opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

;[[Karate]]
: It began as a common fighting system known as "''[[Okinawan martial arts|ti]]''" (or "''te''")  among the [[pechin]] class of the [[Ryukyuans]]. There were few formal styles of ''ti'', but rather many practitioners with their own methods. One surviving example is the [[Motobu-ryū]] school passed down from the Motobu family by Seikichi Uehara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |page = 154 }} Motobu-ryū &amp; Seikichi Uehara&lt;/ref&gt; Early styles of karate are often generalized as [[Shuri-te]], [[Naha-te]], and [[Tomari-te]], named after the three cities from which they emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Higaonna |first = Morio |title = Traditional Karatedo Vol. 1 Fundamental Techniques |year = 1985 |isbn =0-87040-595-0 |page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Ninjutsu]]
: Developed by groups of people mainly from the [[Iga Province]] and [[Kōka, Shiga]] of [[Japan]]. Throughout history, many different schools (''[[Ryū (school)|ryū]]'') have taught their unique versions of ''ninjutsu''. An example of these is the [[Togakure-ryū]]. This ''ryū'' was developed after a defeated samurai warrior called Daisuke Togakure escaped to the region of Iga. Later he came in contact with the warrior-monk Kain Doshi who taught him a new way of viewing life and the means of survival (''ninjutsu'').&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Stephen. “The Ninja and Their Secret Fighting Art.” {{ISBN|0-8048-1656-5}}, Tuttle Publishing, 1990: 18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Konami]]'s ''[[Beatmania]]'' sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan. The company's music division, [[Bemani]], released a number of music games over the next several years.

===Chindōgu===
{{main|Chindōgu}}

Chindōgu is the Japanese art of inventing ingenious everyday [[gadget]]s that, on the face of it, seem like an ideal solution to a particular problem. However, Chindōgu has a distinctive feature: anyone actually attempting to use one of these inventions would find that it causes so many new problems, or such significant social [[embarrassment]], that effectively it has no [[utility]] whatsoever. Thus, Chindōgu are sometimes described as "unuseless" – that is, they cannot be regarded as 'useless' in an absolute sense, since they do actually solve a problem; however, in practical terms, they cannot positively be called "useful." The term "Chindōgu" was coined by [[Kenji Kawakami]].

A '''mill town''', also known as '''[[factory]] town''' or '''mill village''', is typically a settlement that developed around one or more mills or factories, usually [[cotton mill]]s or factories producing textiles.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the term "mill town" usually refers to the 19th century [[textile manufacturing]] towns of [[northern England]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]], particularly those in [[Lancashire]] ([[cotton]]) and [[Yorkshire]] ([[wool]]).

Some former mill towns have a symbol of the textile industry in their town badge. Some towns may have statues dedicated to textile workers (e.g. Colne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/6241179.stm|title=Steel statue tribute of mill girl|date=24 July 2018|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or have a symbol in the badge of local schools (e.g. [[Ossett School]]).

On his tour of [[northern England]] in 1849, irish

Scottish publisher Angus Reach said:

{{quote|In general, these towns wear a monotonous sameness of aspect, physical and moral... In fact, the social condition of the different town populations is almost as much alike as the material appearance of the tall chimneys under which they live. Here and there the height of the latter may differ by a few rounds of brick, but in all essential respects, a description of one is a description of all.&lt;ref name="Powell1986"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Wake of King Cotton|last=Powell|first=Rob|date=1986|publisher=Rochdale Art Gallery|isbn=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Angus Reach|''[[Morning Chronicle]]'', 1849}}

[[File:Zyrardow panorama01.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Winter panorama of main square]]

===Zyrardow===

The town grew out of a textile factory founded in 1833 by the sons of [[Feliks Lubienski]], who owned the land where it was built. They brought in a specialist from [[France]] and his newly designed machines. He was French inventor, [[Philippe de Girard]] from [[Lourmarin]]. He became a director of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Girard, Philippe Henri de". Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The factory town developed during the 19th century into a significant [[textile]] mill town in Poland.
In honour of Girard, 'Ruda Guzowska' as the original estate was called, was renamed [[Zyrardow|Żyrardów]], a toponym derived of the [[Polish language|polonised]] spelling of Girard's name.

Most of Żyrardów's monuments are located in the manufacturing area which dates from the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is widely believed that Żyrardów's textile settlement is the only entire urban industrial complex from the 19th-century to be preserved in Europe.

===New England===
[[File:Berlin Panoramic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Androscoggin River]] at [[Berlin, New Hampshire]]]]

Beginning with [[Samuel Slater]] and technological information smuggled out of England by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]], large mills were established in [[New England]] in the early to mid 19th century.  Mill towns, sometimes planned, built and owned as a [[company town]], grew in the shadow of the industries. The region became a manufacturing powerhouse along rivers like the [[Housatonic River|Housatonic]], [[Quinebaug River|Quinebaug]], [[Shetucket River|Shetucket]], [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone]], [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]], [[Nashua River|Nashua]], [[Cochecho River|Cocheco]], [[Saco River|Saco]], [[Androscoggin River|Androscoggin]], [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] or [[Winooski River|Winooski]].

In the 20th century, alternatives to water power were developed, and it became more profitable for companies to manufacture [[textiles]] in southern states where [[cotton]] was grown and winters did not require significant heating costs.  Finally, the [[Great Depression]] acted as a catalyst that sent several struggling New England firms into [[bankruptcy]].

[[File:Monome-family-stretta-20110321.jpg|thumb|alt=Monome device family|Monome 64 and arc2 (foreground), Monome 512 and arc4 (background).]]
'''Monome''' is a family of [[Interface (computing)|interface]] devices for computers made by an [[Upstate New York]] company of the same name.  Brian Crabtree and his partner Kelli Cain are credited for Monome's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = On arcs and monomes, a Loyal Community Makes Music Together | work = Create Digital Music | author = Peter Kirn | date = March 7, 2011 | url = http://createdigitalmusic.com/2011/03/on-arcs-and-monomes-a-loyal-community-makes-music-together/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

The Monome has a [[minimalist]] design, and has been complimented for its [[interface design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = SoundSquare standoff: Monome vs. Tenori-On | work = CNet News | author = Donald Bell | date = 2007-08-23 | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9765246-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a box with a grid of back-lit buttons, with no labels or icons. No screws are visible on any surface of the Monome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome: Music with Buttons | work = Analogik.com | date =March 29, 2011 | url = http://analogik.com/articles/15399/monome}}&lt;/ref&gt; The box that holds the Monome is made entirely of wood, usually [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]], with a clear aluminum top plate. There are three different size options for the Monome: sixteen by sixteen, sixteen by eight, and eight by eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome: Music with Buttons | work = Analogik.com | date = 2011-03-29 | url = http://analogik.com/articles/15399/monome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==

Monome devices do not produce any sound on their own; they must be connected to a computer via USB, in which an app affords use to the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome: Music with Buttons | work = Analogik.com | date = 2011-03-29 | url = http://analogik.com/articles/15399/monome}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of Monome said: "The wonderful thing about this device is that is doesn't do anything really... It wasn't intended for any specific application. We'll make several applications, and others will make more. We hope to share as many of these as possible." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Music Thing: Monome Controller | work = Engadget | author = Ryan Block | date =April 14, 2006| url = https://www.engadget.com/2006/04/14/music-thing-monome-controller/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core design principle of the Monome is that it is not intended for any one specific application — the function of each button and the decision as to which lights are lit are completely up to the software communicating with the device over the [[Open Sound Control]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Music Thing: Monome Controller | work = Engadget | author = Ryan Block | date =April 14, 2006| url = https://www.engadget.com/2006/04/14/music-thing-monome-controller/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monome is not strictly a musical device. Depending the software used, the Monome can function as anything from a sample cutter to a math machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome: Music with Buttons | work = Analogik.com | date =March 29, 2011| url = http://analogik.com/articles/15399/monome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==

Since 2006, several models have been produced, with typical sizes ranging from 64 to 256 buttons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = A Brief History of monome Production | work = The Stretta Procedure | date =March 2, 2010 | url = http://stretta.blogspot.com/2010/03/brief-history-of-monome-production.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— plus a very limited run of 512-button devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome 512 Available Via Limited Auction | work = Sonic State | author = James Lewin | date =May 4, 2010 | url = http://www.sonicstate.com/news/2010/04/05/monome-512-available-via-limited-auction/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the first non-grid controller in the Monome family was introduced, the Monome Arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome Arc OSC controller is simple, elegant, and expensive | work = Engadget | author = Joseph L. Flatley | date =January 24, 2011 | url = https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/24/monome-arc-osc-controller-is-simple-elegant-and-expensive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monome Arc consists of two aluminum knobs mounted on a rectangular [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] box. Each knob is surrounded by a ring of 64 LED lights, and similarly to the Monome, affords function only by USB connection to an application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome Arc OSC controller is simple, elegant, and expensive | work = Engadget | author = Joseph L. Flatley | date =January 24, 2011 | url = https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/24/monome-arc-osc-controller-is-simple-elegant-and-expensive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of the Arc have said it should be positioned as a complement to the Monome rather than a "complete control paradigm" that can stand alone, and that its overly-simplistic design can be seen as a limiting factor for independent use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = On arcs and monomes, a Loyal Community Makes Music Together | work = Create Digital Music | author = Peter Kirn | date =March 7, 2011 | url = http://createdigitalmusic.com/2011/03/on-arcs-and-monomes-a-loyal-community-makes-music-together/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Monome introduced another open-sourced controller, Aleph. Aleph was designed and engineered by original Monome creator Brian Crabtree and Ezra Buchla, musician and son of [[Don Buchla]]. The Aleph differs greatly from the minimalist Monome and Arc machines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundctrl.com/blog/aleph-monomes-adaptable-soundcomputer/&lt;/ref&gt;  Aleph contains four digital inputs and outputs, four control voltage inputs and outputs, multiple optical encoders, a display screen and USB - all of which can be completely reprogrammed at the software level. Full release and distribution was planned for late Fall 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome readies Aleph | work = Resident Advisor | author = Jordan Rothlein | date =September 27, 2013 | url = http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=21262/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Several applications provide [[Sampling (music)|sample]] [[Music sequencer|sequencing]] capabilities.  One such application is MLR, an application that allows for live sequencing and re-cutting of samples.  There are also many applications that allow for synthesis either via their own internal [[synthesizer]]s or by sending [[MIDI]]/[[Open Sound Control|OSC]] messages to external synthesizers.

== Impact ==

Despite being produced irregularly in small quantities since its introduction in 2006, the Monome button-grid controller has had a significant impact on electronic music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = On arcs and monomes, a Loyal Community Makes Music Together | work = Create Digital Music | author = Peter Kirn | date =March 7, 2011| url = http://createdigitalmusic.com/2011/03/on-arcs-and-monomes-a-loyal-community-makes-music-together/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Monome: Music with Buttons | work = Analogik.com | date = March 29, 2011 | url = http://analogik.com/articles/15399/monome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the physically similar [[Yamaha]] [[Tenori-On]], which was released a year later in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = SoundSquare standoff: Monome vs. Tenori-On | work = CNet News | author = Donald Bell | date = August 23, 2007 | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9765246-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Monome inspired interest in minimalist, grid-based music controllers throughout the industry.  That interest spawned hobbyist projects like the [[Arduinome]] and commercial products like the [[Akai]] APC40,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Did The Monome Just Become Irrelevant? | work = Synthopia | date = June 13, 2009 | url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2009/06/13/monomulator-monome/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Novation Digital Music Systems|Novation]] Launchpad,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = First Hands-on: Novation’s New $199 Launchpad Grid Controller for Ableton Live | work = Create Digital Music | author = Peter Kirn | date = October 1, 2009 | url = http://createdigitalmusic.com/2009/10/first-hands-on-novations-new-199-launchpad-grid-controller-for-ableton-live/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Livid Instruments]] Block and Ohm64. GridFest, a festival for Monome enthusiasts, took place in New Mexico in May 2011, following the release of the Monome Arc earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = On arcs and monomes, a Loyal Community Makes Music Together | work = Create Digital Music | author = Peter Kirn | date = March 7, 2011 | url = http://createdigitalmusic.com/2011/03/on-arcs-and-monomes-a-loyal-community-makes-music-together/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alaska Pipeline Bridge.jpg|thumb|A pipeline bridge carrying the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Trans-Alaska Pipeline]]]]
A '''pipeline bridge''' is a bridge for running a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] over a [[river]] or another obstacle. Pipeline bridges for [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es are, as a rule, only built when it is not possible to run the pipeline on a conventional bridge or under the river. However, as it is more common to run pipelines for [[District heating|centralized heating systems]] overhead, for this application even small pipeline bridges are common.

==Types==
As there is normally a steady flow in pipelines, they can be designed as [[suspension bridge]]s.

==Walkways==
A pipeline bridge may be equipped with a [[walkway]] for maintenance purposes but, in most cases, this is not open for public access for safety and security reasons.

'''QCT''' is a provider of [[data center]] [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Cloud computing|cloud]] [[solution]]s that are used by [[hyperscale]] data center operators, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Rackspace]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Kovar, Joseph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judge, Peter&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with its parent company, [[Quanta Computer]], QCT sells approximately one out of every seven [[server (computing)|server]] manufactured in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Timothy Prickett,  "Taiwanese"&lt;/ref&gt;

QCT is an early contributor to the [[Open Compute Project]], a non-profit organization launched by Facebook engineers to open source the designs of data center products. QCT manufactured the Facebook servers that were among the first designs under the project.

In addition to its headquarters in Taoyuan, Taiwan, QCT has offices in San Jose, Seattle, Beijing, Hangzhou and Tokyo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13049">During the 1850s and 1860s, engineers carried out a piecemeal raising of the level of central [[Chicago]]. Streets, sidewalks, and buildings were physically raised on hydraulic jacks or [[Jack (device)#House jack|jackscrews]]. The work was funded by private property owners and public funds.

== Background ==

[[File:Ad with typos.jpg|thumb|392px|right|Advertisement in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m01_d29 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 29, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the 19th century, the elevation of the Chicago area was not much higher than the shorelines of [[Lake Michigan]], so for many years there was little or no naturally occurring drainage from the city surface. The lack of drainage caused unpleasant living conditions, and standing water harbored pathogens that caused numerous epidemics. Epidemics including [[typhoid fever]] and [[dysentery]] blighted Chicago six years in a row culminating in the 1854 outbreak of [[cholera]] that killed six percent of the city’s population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1854_m07_d12 Chicago Daily Tribune, July 12, 1854]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#putnam_y1856_m06 Putnam’s Monthly Magazine, volume seven. (June 1856), page 610.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmett Dedmon. Fabulous Chicago. Random House. 1953. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Louise Pierce, As Others See Chicago; Impressions of Visitors. University of Chicago Press. 1933, reprinted 2004. Page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis forced the city's engineers and [[aldermen]] to take the drainage problem seriously and after many heated discussions&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1855_m05_d31 Chicago Daily Tribune, May 31, 1855]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1857_m04_d09_entry00 Chicago Daily Tribune, April 9, 1857]&lt;/ref&gt;—and following at least one false start—a solution eventually materialized. In 1856, engineer [[Ellis S. Chesbrough]] drafted a plan for the installation of a citywide sewerage system and submitted it to the Common Council, which adopted the plan. Workers then laid drains, covered and refinished roads and sidewalks with several feet of soil, and raised most buildings to the new grade with hydraulic jacks.

== Earliest raising of a brick building ==

In January 1858, the first [[masonry]] building in Chicago to be thus raised—a four-story, {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} long, 750-ton brick structure situated at the north-east corner of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] and Dearborn Street—was lifted on two hundred [[jackscrew]]s to its new grade, which was {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m}} higher than the old one, “without the slightest injury to the building.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m01_d26 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 26, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of more than fifty comparably large masonry buildings to be raised that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1859_m01_d01 Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, January 1, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; The contractor was Bostonian engineer, James Brown, who went on to partner with longtime Chicago engineer James Hollingsworth; Brown and Hollingsworth became the first and, it seems, the busiest building raising partnership in the city. Before the year was out, they were lifting brick buildings more than {{convert|100|ft|m}} long,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m10_d04 Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, October 4, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt; and the following spring they took the contract to raise a brick block more than twice that length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1859_m05_d05 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), May 5, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Row on Lake Street ==
[[File:Street Raising on Lake Street.jpg|thumb|right|392px|Raising a block of buildings on Lake Street]]

By 1860, confidence was sufficiently high that a consortium of no fewer than six engineers—including Brown, Hollingsworth and [[George Pullman]]—took on one of the most impressive locations in the city and hoisted it up complete and in one go. They lifted half a city block on [[Lake Street (Chicago)|Lake Street]], between [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]] and [[LaSalle Street]]; a solid masonry row of shops, offices, printeries, etc., {{convert|320|ft|m}} long, comprising brick and stone buildings, some four stories high, some five, having a footprint taking up almost {{convert|1|acre|m2|spell=in}} of space, and an estimated all in weight including hanging sidewalks of thirty five thousand tons. Businesses operating out of these premises were not closed down for the lifting; as the buildings were being raised, people came, went, shopped and worked in them as if nothing out of the ordinary were happening. In five days the entire assembly was elevated {{convert|4|ft|8|in|m}} in the air by a team consisting of six hundred men using six thousand jackscrews, ready for new [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] walls to be built underneath. The spectacle drew crowds of thousands, who were on the final day permitted to walk at the old ground level, among the jacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d09 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), March 9, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d26 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), March 26, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d29 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), March 29, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m04_d02 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), April 2, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Tremont House ==

The following year a team led by Ely, Smith, and Pullman raised the [[Tremont House (Chicago)|Tremont House]] hotel on the south-east corner of Lake Street and Dearborn Street. This building was luxuriously appointed, was of brick construction, was six stories high, and had a footprint taking up over {{convert|1|acre|m2}} of space. Once again business as usual was maintained as this vast hotel parted from the ground it was standing on, and indeed some of the guests staying there at the time—among whose number were several [[Very Important Person|VIP]]s and a [[United States Senate|US Senator]]—were completely oblivious to the feat as the five hundred men operating their five thousand jackscrews worked under covered trenches. One patron was puzzled to note that the front steps leading from the street into the hotel were becoming steeper every day and that when he checked out, the windows were several feet above his head, whereas before they had been at eye level. This huge hotel, which until just the previous year had been the tallest building in Chicago, was in fact raised fully {{convert|6|ft|m}} without a hitch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m01_d22 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 22, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m01_d24 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 24, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d12 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 12, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d25 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 25, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d26_entry00 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 26, 1861 (01)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d26_entry01 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 26, 1861 (02)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d27 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 27, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m03_d15 Chicago Daily Tribune, March 15, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m07_d26 Chicago Daily Tribune, July 26, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Macrae, The Americans at Home: Pen-and-Ink Sketches of American Men, Manners and Institutions, Volume Two (of two), Edmonston &amp; Douglas, 1870, pages 190-193, and reprinted by Lost Cause Press, Louisville, 1964.[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#macrae_tremont]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Robbins Building ==

Another notable feat was the raising of the Robbins Building, an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron building]] {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide and five stories high, located at the corner of South Water Street and Wells Street. This was a very heavy building; its ornate iron frame, its twelve-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) thick masonry wall filling, and its “floors filled with heavy goods” made for a weight estimated at 27,000 tons, a large load to raise over a relatively small area. Hollingsworth and Coughlin took the contract and in November 1865 lifted not only the building but also the {{convert|230|ft|m}} of stone [[sidewalk]] outside it. The complete mass of iron and masonry was raised {{convert|27.5|in|m}}, “without the slightest crack or damage.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m10_d31 Chicago Tribune, October 31, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m11_d14 Chicago Tribune, November 14, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m11_d17 Chicago Tribune, November 17, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m11_d20 Chicago Tribune, November 20, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m12_d12 The Times (London), December 12, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydraulic raising of the Franklin House ==

There is evidence in primary document sources that at least one building in Chicago, the Franklin House on Franklin Street, was raised [[Hydraulics|hydraulically]] by the engineer John C. Lane,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m04_d30 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), April 30, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Lane and Stratton partnership. The team had apparently been using this method of lifting buildings in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] since 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1859_m07_d14 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), July 14, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relocated buildings ==
[[File:Briggs house.jpg|thumb|right|392px|The Briggs House&amp;mdash;a brick hotel&amp;mdash;raised, probably in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1866_m02_d07 Chicago Tribune, February 7, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many of central Chicago’s hurriedly-erected wooden [[Framing (construction)|frame buildings]] were now considered wholly inappropriate to the burgeoning and increasingly wealthy city. Rather than raise them several feet, proprietors often preferred to [[Structure relocation|relocate]] these old frame buildings, replacing them with new masonry blocks built to the latest grade. Consequently, the practice of putting the old multi-story, intact and furnished wooden buildings—sometimes entire rows of them ''en bloc''—on rollers and moving them to the outskirts of town or to the suburbs was so common as to be considered nothing more than routine traffic. Traveller David Macrae wrote incredulously, “Never a day passed during my stay in the city that I did not meet one or more houses shifting their quarters. One day I met nine. Going out [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Great Madison Street]] in the horse cars we had to stop twice to let houses get across.” As discussed above, business did not suffer; shop owners would keep their shops open, even as people had to climb in through a moving front door.&lt;ref&gt;David Macrae, The Americans at Home: Pen-and-Ink Sketches of American Men, Manners and Institutions, Volume Two (of two), Edmonston &amp; Douglas, 1870, pages 190-193, and reprinted by Lost Cause Press, Louisville, 1964.[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#macrae]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1856_m04_d18 Chicago Daily Tribune, April 18, 1856]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m12_d20 Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, December 20, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d09_rotten_row Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, March 9, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m04_d12 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), April 12, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt; Brick buildings also were moved from one location to another, and in 1866, the first of these—a building of two and a half stories—made the short move from Madison Street out to Monroe Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1866_m08_d09 Chicago Tribune, August 9, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, many other brick buildings were rolled much greater distances across Chicago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6911">The '''Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) radar''' is a [[MIMO|multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO)]] radar system designed by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] to detect landmines and [[Improvised explosive device|improvised explosive devices (IEDs)]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ojowu|first=Ode|date=April 30, 2013|title=SIRE: A MIMO Radar for Landmine/IED Detection|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA618058|journal=Howard University|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a low frequency, impulse-based [[Ultra-wideband|ultra-wideband (UWB)]] radar that uses 16 receivers with 2 transmitters at the ends of the 2 meter-wide receive array that send alternating, orthogonal waveforms into the ground and return signals reflected from targets in a given area. The SIRE radar system comes mounted on top of a vehicle and receives signals that form images that uncover up to 33 meters in the direction that the transmitters are facing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ressler|first=Marc|last2=Nguyen|first2=Lam|last3=Koenig|first3=Francois|last4=Wong|first4=David|last5=Smith|first5=Gregory|date=2007|title=The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) synchronous impulse reconstruction (SIRE) forward-looking radar|url=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/6561/1/The-Army-Research-Laboratory-ARL-synchronous-impulse-reconstruction-SIRE-forward/10.1117/12.719688.full?SSO=1|journal=Unmanned Systems Technology IX|volume=6561|pages=|via=SPIE.

Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Operation ==
The SIRE radar functions primarily as a method of assessing the surrounding environment and determining whether the path being traversed is safe for vehicular navigation. In general, radar systems have an advantage over optical or laser sensor system because they are not hindered by the presence of fog or dust blocking their line of sight. However, most radar systems use high-frequency microwave radiation, which have difficulty penetrating grass and other foliage. In contrast, the SIRE radar can penetrate foliage, various media, and even the ground to detect hidden or buried IEDs due to its use of low-frequency microwave radiation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The data acquisition cycle for the SIRE radar consist of the following steps:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

# The central computer sends commands to the timing and control board in the SIRE circuit to emit radar pulses from the left transmitter.
# The receiver array picks up the returning radar signals, which are then digitized by the [[Field-programmable gate array|field-programmable gate array (FPGA)]] acquisition module and sent to the central computer along with the time tag information from the GPS receiver.
# The data is integrated, scaled, and converted to frequency domain before being sent to the graphical user interface to be displayed.
# The data acquisition cycle repeats with the right transmitter.

=== Transmitter ===
The transmitters used in the SIRE radar are transversal electromagnetic (TEM) horns that generate short, 1 nanosecond-long radar pulses with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 MHz and a frequency band from 300 to 2500 MHz.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dogaru|first=Traian|date=August 2015|title=A Huygens Surface Approach to Antenna Implementation in Near-Field Radar Imaging System Simulations|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2015/technical-report.cfm?id=7438|journal=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak power output for the transmitter is 6 watts, while the average power is 5 watts to reduce interference potential. The TEM horns can handle a 200 ohm characteristic impedance and were chosen since they provide good pulse fidelity and low reflected power. The two transmitters alternate in activity with each cycle of the data acquisition process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Receiver ===
The receivers used in the SIRE radar are Vivaldi notch antennas which are arranged in a uniform linear array that span the width of the vehicle. Each receiver is connected to a separate receiver channel. The imaging method relies on the back-projection algorithm, where the data from all 16 receiver channels are integrated at successive ranges as the vehicle moves forwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Radio-Frequency Interference Suppression ===
In order to prevent radio-frequency interference (RFI) from outside sources, such as radio, TV and wireless communication signals, in the radio frequency band, the SIRE radar employs several techniques to suppress or extract these signals from the UWB radar data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead of conventional methods of screening like the notch filtering approach, the SIRE radar narrowband and wideband RFI screening process involve averaging repeated measurements from the same range-profile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Modes ==
The mounted SIRE radar system comes in two modes depending on its orientation on top of the vehicle. The most commonly used mode is the forward-looking mode, where the radar faces towards the front of the vehicle in the direction it is traveling. An alternative is the side-looking mode, where the antenna frame that supports the SIRE radar system is rotated 90 degrees and the direction of the radar is perpendicular to the path of the vehicle. The side-looking mode is designed to survey the area behind walls and map the interior of enclosed buildings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Solar power''' is the [[energy transformation|conversion of energy]] from [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]], or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use [[lens (optics)|lens]]es or [[mirrors]] and [[solar tracking|tracking systems]] to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an [[electric current]] using the [[photovoltaic effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414081047/http://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of [[electricity]] for small and medium-sized applications, from the [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|calculator]] powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an [[off-grid]] rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility|Ivanpah]] installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world, located in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[California]].

As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected [[solar PV systems]] has [[Growth of photovoltaics|grown into the millions]] and utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness [[renewable energy]] from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the 850&amp;nbsp;MW [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park, in [[Qinghai]], [[China]].

The [[International Energy Agency]] projected in 2014 that under its "high renewables" scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the [[worldwide electricity consumption]], and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in India|India]].&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt; In 2017, solar power provided 1.7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing at 35% per annum.&lt;ref name=bp2018&gt;[https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html BP Global: Solar energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mainstream technologies ==

Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to [[conventional energy]] sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels ''(see [[solar power by country]])''. Long distance transmission allows remote [[renewable energy]] resources to displace fossil fuel consumption. Solar power plants use one of two technologies:
* [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) [[Photovoltaic systems|systems]] use [[solar panel]]s, either on [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftops]] or in ground-mounted [[solar farm]]s, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
* [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use [[solar thermal energy]] to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.

=== Photovoltaics ===
{{Main|Photovoltaics}}
[[File:PV-system-schematics-residential-Eng.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Schematics of a grid-connected residential [[PV power system]]&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2"&gt;Solar Cells and their Applications Second Edition, Lewis Fraas, Larry Partain, Wiley, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-470-44633-1}} , Section10.2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A [[solar cell]], or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the [[photovoltaic effect]]. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The German industrialist [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power|journal=Popular Science |date = June 1931|accessdate=19 April 2011|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[silicon]] solar cell in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These early solar cells cost 286&amp;nbsp;USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29–30, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The array of a [[photovoltaic power system]], or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. 
For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), through the use of [[Solar inverter|inverters]].&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2" /&gt; 
Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. 
Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2" /&gt;

Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets.&lt;ref name="IEAPVPS2009_Fig3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=432 | title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications Survey report of selected IEA countries between 1992 and 2009, IEA-PVPS | accessdate=8 November 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165534/http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=432 | archivedate=25 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In these [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected PV systems]], use of energy storage is optional. 
In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such [[stand-alone power system]]s permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.

=== Concentrated solar power ===
{{Main|Concentrated solar power}}
[[File:Parabolic trough.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|A [[parabolic trough|parabolic collector]] concentrates sunlight onto a tube in its focal point.]]

Concentrated solar power (CSP), also called "concentrated solar thermal", uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to concentrate sunlight, then use the resulting heat to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines.

A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: among the best known are the [[parabolic trough]], the [[compact linear Fresnel reflector]], the [[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Stirling dish]] and the [[solar power tower]]. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|title=Spanish CSP Plant with Storage Produces Electricity for 24 Hours Straight|author=Stephen Lacey|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012112224/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''parabolic trough'' consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned along the focal points of the linear parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | title=Concentrated Solar Thermal Power – Now | accessdate=19 August 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052050/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | archivedate=10 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS]] plants in California and Acciona's [[Nevada Solar One]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]] are representatives of this technology.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UNLV Solar Site |publisher = University of Las Vegas |url = http://www.solar.unlv.edu/projects/eldorado.php |accessdate = 2 July 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20060903112910/http://www.solar.unlv.edu/projects/eldorado.php |archivedate = 3 September 2006 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors'' are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html |title = Compact CLFR |publisher = Physics.usyd.edu.au |date = 12 June 2002 |accessdate = 19 April 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110412235037/http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html |archivedate = 12 April 2011 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf |title=Ausra compact CLFR introducing cost-saving solar rotation features |format=PDF |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721150750/http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Stirling solar dish'' combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a [[Stirling engine]] which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime.
Parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = An Assessment of Solar Energy Conversion Technologies and Research Opportunities |publisher = Stanford University – Global Climate Change &amp; Energy Project |url = http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf |accessdate = 2 July 2008 |format = PDF |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509182125/http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf |archivedate = 9 May 2008 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 50&amp;nbsp;kW [[The Big Dish (solar thermal)|Big Dish]] in [[Canberra]], Australia is an example of this technology.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentrating Solar Power in 2001 – An IEA/SolarPACES Summary of Present Status and Future Prospects |publisher=International Energy Agency – SolarPACES |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/Library/docs/CSP_Brochure_2001.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052052/http://www.solarpaces.org/Library/docs/CSP_Brochure_2001.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''solar power tower'' uses an array of tracking reflectors ([[heliostat]]s) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers can achieve higher (thermal-to-electricity conversion) efficiency than linear tracking CSP schemes and better energy storage capability than dish stirling technologies.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"/&gt; The [[PS10 Solar Power Plant]] and [[PS20 solar power plant]] are examples of this technology.

=== Hybrid systems ===

A hybrid system combines (C)PV and CSP with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and [[biogas]]. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.

; CPV/CSP system
: A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system has been proposed, combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-PV technology of concentrated solar power, or also known as concentrated solar thermal.&lt;ref&gt;Phys.org [http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system proposed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822040505/http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html |date=22 August 2015 }}, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Combined cycle#Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)|ISCC]] system
: The [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station|Hassi R'Mel power station]] in Algeria, is an example of combining CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-[[parabolic trough]] array supplements a much larger 130&amp;nbsp;MW [[combined cycle|combined cycle gas turbine plant]]. Another example is the [[Yazd integrated solar combined cycle power station|Yazd power station]] in Iran.
; [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|PVT system]]
: Hybrid PV/T), also known as ''photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors'' convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. Such a system combines a solar (PV) module with a [[solar thermal collector]] in a complementary way.
; [[Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal|CPVT system]]
: A concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid (CPVT) system is similar to a PVT system. It uses [[concentrated photovoltaic]]s (CPV) instead of conventional PV technology, and combines it with a solar thermal collector.
; [[PV diesel system]]

: Thermoelectric, or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current. Solar cells use only the high frequency part of the radiation, while the low frequency heat energy is wasted. Several patents about the use of thermoelectric devices in tandem with solar cells have been filed.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{citation

The idea is to increase the efficiency of the combined solar/thermoelectric system to convert the solar radiation into useful electricity.

=== Early days ===

The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. [[Charles Fritts]] installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1%-efficient [[selenium]] cells, on a New York City roof in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/|title=Photovoltaic Dreaming 1875--1905: First Attempts At Commercializing PV - CleanTechnica|author=|date=|website=cleantechnica.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525170459/https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 63, 77, 101&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems.&lt;ref&gt;"The Solar Energy Book-Once More." ''[[Mother Earth News]]'' 31:16–17, Jan. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653–673&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and Germany ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer–ISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft | publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft | url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp | accessdate=4 November 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212091650/http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp | archivedate=12 December 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the [[growth of photovoltaics]] from 1984 to 1996.

=== Mid-1990s to early 2010s ===

In the mid-1990s, development of both, residential and commercial [[rooftop solar]] as well as utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, [[Kyoto Protocol|global warming concerns]], and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php Solar: photovoltaic: Lighting Up The World] retrieved 19 May 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813163816/http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php |date=13 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the adoption of [[feed-in tariff]]s—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—led to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.

=== Current status ===
For several years, worldwide growth of solar PV was driven by [[Solar power in the European Union|European deployment]], but has since shifted to Asia, especially [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world, including, but not limited to, [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in Canada|Canada]], [[Solar power in Chile|Chile]], [[Solar power in India|India]], [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]], [[Solar power in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Solar power in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Energy in South Korea|South Korea]], [[Solar power in Thailand|Thailand]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]].

Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40% per year from 2000 to 2013&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and total installed capacity reached 303&amp;nbsp;GW at the end of 2016 with [[Solar power in China|China]] having the most cumulative installations (78&amp;nbsp;GW)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|title=2016 Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets|last=|first=|date=2017|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827050437/http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Renewable energy in Honduras|Honduras]] having the highest theoretical percentage of annual electricity usage which could be generated by solar PV (12.5%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-installed-pv-in-2013/150/452/75985/|title=Photovoltaics: Overview of installed PV in 2013|publisher=Renewables International|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330022600/http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-installed-pv-in-2013/150/452/75985/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest manufacturers are located in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/45754|title=Top-10 solar cell producers in 2016|first=Finlay|last=Colville|work=PV-Tech|date=30 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054912/http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/45754|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Executive-Summary-The-New-Solar-System-1.pdf|title=The New Solar System - Executive Summary|last=Ball|first=Jeffrey|last2=et al|date=2017-03-21|website=Stanford University Law School, Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance|access-date=2017-06-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420151310/https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Executive-Summary-The-New-Solar-System-1.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrated solar power (CSP) also started to grow rapidly, increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar PV.&lt;ref name="ren21-gsr-2014"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |year=2014 
 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} 
As of the end of 2013, [[Concentrated solar power#Deployment around the world|worldwide cumulative CSP-capacity]] reached 3,425&amp;nbsp;MW.

=== Forecasts ===

In 2010, the [[International Energy Agency]] predicted that global solar PV capacity could reach 3,000 GW or 11% of projected global electricity generation by 2050—enough to generate 4,500&amp;nbsp;[[terawatt-hour|TWh]] of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/pv_roadmap_foldout.pdf |title=Solar photovoltaic roadmap |publisher=International Energy Agency |date=2010 |accessdate=18 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042430/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/pv_roadmap_foldout.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Four years later, in 2014, the agency projected that, under its "high renewables" scenario, solar power could supply 27% of global electricity generation by 2050 (16% from PV and 11% from CSP).&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt;

=== Photovoltaic power stations ===
{{Main|List of photovoltaic power stations}}

The [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] is a 550&amp;nbsp;MW power plant in [[Riverside County, California]], that uses [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film]] [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe-modules]] made by [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects |date=30 September 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111021243/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt [[Topaz Solar Farm]] was the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW [[Solar Star]] complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park, in [[Gonghe County]], [[Qinghai]], [[China]].

Commercial concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, also called "solar thermal power stations", were first developed in the 1980s. The 377&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world’s largest solar thermal power plant project. Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), and [[Extresol Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5&amp;nbsp;pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;hours of thermal storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand What is peak demand?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811072202/http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand |date=11 August 2012 }}, Energex.com.au website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical cost factors for solar power include the [[Swanson's law|costs of the modules]], the frame to hold them, wiring, inverters, labour cost, any land that might be required, the grid connection, maintenance and the solar insolation that location will receive. Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|title=Musk vs. Buffett: The Billionaire Battle to Own the Sun|work=Bloomberg.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216024255/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palo Alto]] California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. And in sunny [[Dubai]] large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt-hour – "competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity — and cheaper than most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular%7Ctitle=These|title=These 4 solar-power stocks will leave fossil fuels in the dust|first=Garvin|last=Jabusch|date=|website=marketwatch.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819230343/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular%7Ctitle=These|archivedate=19 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm Levelized Cost and Levelized Avoided Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027231537/http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm |date=27 October 2015 }}, 17 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as [[feed-in tariff|feed-in tariff programs]]. Also, [[Renewable portfolio standard]]s impose a government mandate &lt;!-- Without any discussion of how these mandates impact the economics of solar power, these two sentences discussing RSPs look out of place in this subsection --&gt; that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, [[landfill gas]], ocean, geothermal, [[municipal solid waste]], hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies.&lt;ref name="ajelp.com"&gt;Robert Glennon and Andrew M. Reeves, Solar Energy's Cloudy Future, 1 Ariz. J. Evtl. L. &amp; Pol'y, 91, 106 (2010) available at {{cite web|url=http://ajelp.com/documents/GlennonFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811064518/http://ajelp.com/documents/GlennonFinal.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Levelized cost of electricity ====

The PV industry is beginning to adopt [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of [[kilowatt-hour]]s (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local [[insolation]], 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a [[capacity factor]] of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by [[European Photovoltaic Industry Association|EPIA]], has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org |title=3rd International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments |publisher=Pvinvestmentconference.org |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114036/http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org/ |archivedate=3 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term [[power purchase agreement]]. Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | title=Solar Power Services: How PPAs are Changing the PV Value Chain | date=11 February 2008 | accessdate=21 May 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510082253/http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | archivedate=10 May 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi Zhengrong]] has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. He said "We are at a tipping point. No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich. They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies". "Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |title=China’s visible solar power success |author=Mark Clifford |date=8 February 2012 |work=MarketWatch |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801064435/http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Current installation prices ====

In its 2014 edition of the ''Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy'' report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale [[PV system]]s for eight major markets as of 2013 ''(see table below)''.&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt; However, DOE's [[SVTC Technologies#The SunShot Initiative|SunShot Initiative]] has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt.&lt;ref name="sunshot-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |title=Photovoltaic System Pricing Trends – Historical, Recent, and Near-Term Projections, 2014 Edition |publisher=NREL |page=4 |date=22 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XOoaSCpl?url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;GreenTechMedia.com [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 Solar PV Pricing Continues to Fall During a Record-Breaking 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165540/https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 |date=25 May 2017 }}, 13 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=Photovoltaik-Preisindex |trans-title=Solar PV price index |publisher=PhotovoltaikGuide |quote=Turnkey net-prices for a solar PV system of up to 100 kWp amounted to Euro 1,240 per kWp. |access-date=30 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020014/http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |archivedate=10 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt.

=== Grid parity ===
{{main|Grid parity}}

Grid parity, the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of [[Mains electricity|grid power]], is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in [[California]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 Going for grid parity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081013/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |date=8 June 2011 }} 2005 article&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the [[OECD]] countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the [[OECD]] and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of [[power purchase agreement]]s (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, [[grid operator]]s and [[wind turbine manufacturer]]s.&lt;ref name=truecost /&gt;{{dead link|date = June 2015}}

Grid parity was first reached in [[Spain]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2012/12/26/solar-grid-parity-comes-to-spain/ | title=Solar Grid Parity Comes to Spain | work=Forbes | first=Peter | last=Kelly-Detwiler | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102125458/http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2012/12/26/solar-grid-parity-comes-to-spain/ | archivedate=2 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaii]] and other islands that otherwise use [[fossil fuel]] ([[diesel fuel]]) to produce electricity, and most of the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9019305&amp;contentId=7035199|title=Gaining on the grid|publisher=BP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081020/http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9019305&amp;contentId=7035199|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date = June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bp.com/popupimage.do?img_path=liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/frontiers/STAGING/local_assets/images/fr19solar_parity570x417.jpg%20&amp;alt_tag=Graphic%20about%20grid%20parity,%20when%20the%20cost%20of%20solar%20energy%20equals%20that%20of%20grid%20electricity |title=The Path to Grid Parity |publisher=BP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191313/http://www.bp.com/popupimage.do?img_path=liveassets%2Fbp_internet%2Fglobalbp%2Fglobalbp_uk_english%2Freports_and_publications%2Ffrontiers%2FSTAGING%2Flocal_assets%2Fimages%2Ffr19solar_parity570x417.jpg%20&amp;alt_tag=Graphic%20about%20grid%20parity%2C%20when%20the%20cost%20of%20solar%20energy%20equals%20that%20of%20grid%20electricity |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}{{failed verification|date = June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[General Electric]]'s Chief Engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015; other companies predicted an earlier date:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1878986220071019|title=Solar power edges towards boom time|author=Reuters Editorial|date=19 October 2007|work=Reuters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722210645/http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1878986220071019|archivedate=22 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10% of commercial customers in the [[OECD]], as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010.&lt;ref name=truecost&gt;[http://www.photon-consulting.com/en/true_cost_2007/summary.htm The True Cost of Solar Power] retrieved 22 October 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908113041/http://www.photon-consulting.com/en/true_cost_2007/summary.htm |date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity by location===
{{see also|Solar irradiance}}
The productivity of solar power in a region depends on [[solar irradiance]], which varies through the day and is influenced by [[latitude]] and [[climate]].

The locations with highest annual solar irradiance lie in the arid tropics and subtropics. Deserts lying in low latitudes usually have few clouds, and can receive sunshine for more than ten hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822174443/http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg |archivedate=22 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233148/http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These hot deserts form the ''Global Sun Belt'' circling the world.

=== Self consumption ===

In cases of self consumption of the solar energy, the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and [[insolation]] of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&amp;output=html|title=Money saved by producing electricity from PV and Years for payback|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228114744/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&amp;output=html|archivedate=28 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"&gt;{{cite report |title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2014 |publisher=IEA-PVPS |date=2014 |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165925/http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"/&gt; Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stetz |first=T |last2=Marten |first2=F |last3=Braun |first3=M |title=Improved Low Voltage Grid-Integration of Photovoltaic Systems in Germany |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy |date=2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=534–542 |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2198925|bibcode=2013ITSE....4..534S }}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salpakari |first=Jyri |last2=Lund |first2=Peter |title=Optimal and rule-based control strategies for energy flexibility in buildings with PV |journal=Applied Energy |date=2016 |volume=161 |pages=425–436 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good match between generation and consumption is key for high self consumption, and should be considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"/&gt; However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase.&lt;ref name="rmi-battery-2015"&gt;{{cite report |last=Fiztgerald |first=Garrett |last2=Mandel |first2=James |last3=Morris |first3=Jesse |last4=Touati |first4=Hervé |title=The Economics of Battery Energy Storage |publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute |date=2015 |url=http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/RMI-TheEconomicsOfBatteryEnergyStorage-FullReport-FINAL.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130145345/http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/RMI-TheEconomicsOfBatteryEnergyStorage-FullReport-FINAL.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot water storage tank]]s with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"/&gt; Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"/&gt;

=== Energy pricing and incentives ===
{{Main|PV financial incentives}}

The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] (SRECs)

==== Rebates ====

With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as [[Austin Energy]] in [[Texas]], which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm Solar Rebate Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725015516/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm |date=25 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Net metering ====
[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Net metering]], unlike a [[feed-in tariff]], requires only one meter, but it must be bi-directional.]]

In [[net metering]] the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard [[electricity meter]]s, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 Net Metering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172839/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 |date=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|title=Net Metering and Interconnection - NJ OCE Web Site|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512060609/http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|archivedate=12 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feed-in tariffs (FIT) ====
{{update section|date=August 2018}}
With [[feed-in tariff]]s, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.

The complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}} In some countries, additional incentives are offered for [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|BIPV]] compared to stand alone PV.
* France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)
* Italy + EUR 0.04–0.09 kWh
* Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)

==== Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) ====

Alternatively, [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate|SRECs]] allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity. In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.

Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in China|China]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 China Racing Ahead of America in the Drive to Go Solar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 |date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]],&lt;ref name="German PV market"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|title=Power &amp; Energy Technology - IHS Technology|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102171748/http://solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|archivedate=2 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved — Feed-in tariff in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195611/http://eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and even across states within the US.

The Japanese government through its [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1&amp;nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the [[German Renewable Energy Act]], which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.

Subsequently, [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]], [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]]—that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs—and [[Solar power in France|France]] introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30–50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic "solar roof" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW) has internal rates of return of 10–15% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax free.

In 2006 [[Solar power in California|California]] approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate "EPBB" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.

At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]], and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10&amp;nbsp;MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.

The overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and [[wind power]] are [[variable renewable energy]], meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to ''where it can be used now''. Since solar energy is not available at night, [[energy storage|storing its energy]] is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future [[100% renewable energy]] scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1976), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. In [[winter peak]] utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their [[capacity factor]]s.

In an electricity system without [[grid energy storage]], generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity (see [[load following power plant]]). While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s like solar tend to require investment in some combination of [[Super grid|grid interconnections]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] or [[Energy demand management|demand side management]]. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing [[baseload]] generation contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|title=California produced so much solar power, electricity prices just turned negative|author=|date=11 April 2017|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211175722/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|archivedate=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|title=3 Reasons Hawaii Put the Brakes on Solar--and Why the Same Won't Happen in Your State|first=Robert|last=Fares|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920121552/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydro Storage  |publisher=Electricity Storage Association  |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |accessdate=31 July 2008  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |archivedate=21 June 2008  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.

[[Concentrated solar power]] plants may use [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the [[The Solar Project|Solar Two]] power station, allowing it to store 1.44&amp;nbsp;[[Terajoules|TJ]] in its 68&amp;nbsp;m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Advantages of Using Molten Salt |publisher = Sandia National Laboratory |url = http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |accessdate = 29 September 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605094349/http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |archivedate = 5 June 2011 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Photovoltaic system#Standalone system|stand alone PV systems]] [[rechargeable batteries|batteries]] are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system]], excess electricity can be sent to the [[electrical grid]]. [[Net metering]] and [[feed-in tariff]] programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PV Systems and Net Metering |publisher=Department of Energy |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |archivedate=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|Batteries used for grid-storage]] stabilize the [[electrical grid]] by [[Grid energy storage#Load leveling|leveling out peak loads]] usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.

Although not permitted under the US National Electric Code, it is technically possible to have a “[[plug and play]]” PV microinverter.

Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]]– a modified version of the conventional [[lead–acid battery]], [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to [[economies of scale]] provided by large production facilities such as the [[Gigafactory 1]]. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in [[electric car]]s may serve as a future storage devices in a [[vehicle-to-grid]] system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for [[distributed energy storage system|distributed]] PV systems include, [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium–sulfur]] and [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium redox]] batteries, two prominent types of a [[Molten salt battery|molten salt]] and a [[Flow battery|flow]] battery, respectively.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ETH Zürich, Harvard University |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264239770_The_Economic_Viability_of_Battery_Storage_for_Residential_Solar_Photovoltaic_Systems_-_A_Review_and_a_Simulation_Model |title=The Economic Viability of Battery Storage for Residential Solar Photovoltaic Systems - A Review and a Simulation Model |author1=Joern Hoppmann |author2=Jonas Volland |author3=Tobias S.

The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such [[solar hybrid power systems]] is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf|title=Seasonal Energy Storage in a Renewable Energy System|author=|date=|website=semanticscholar.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170317/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html |title = The Combined Power Plant: the first stage in providing 100% power from renewable energy |date = January 2008 |accessdate = 10 October 2008 |publisher = SolarServer |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081014054221/http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html |archivedate = 14 October 2008 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is also undertaken in this field of [[artificial photosynthesis]]. It involves the use of [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce [[hydrogen fuel]] or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as [[methanol]]. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Collings AF, Critchley C.

== Environmental impacts ==
[[File:Blick vom aussichtsturm hörlitz4.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Senftenberg Solarpark]], a solar [[photovoltaic]] power plant located on former open-pit mining areas close to the city of [[Senftenberg]], in Eastern Germany. The 78 MW Phase 1 of the plant was completed within three months.]]

Unlike [[fossil fuel]] based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution.

=== Greenhouse gases ===

The [[life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar power]] are in the range of 22 to 46&amp;nbsp;gram (g) per [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) depending on if solar thermal or solar PV is being analyzed, respectively. With this potentially being decreased to 15&amp;nbsp;g/kWh in the future.&lt;ref name="ECN2006"&gt;Alsema, E.A.; Wild – Scholten, M.J. de; Fthenakis, V.M.

The life cycle emission intensity of [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]], [[wind]] and [[nuclear power]] are lower than solar's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]]. Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to [[low carbon power]] in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex (one in Maryland, the other in Virginia) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly.&lt;ref name="Solar Energy Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portablesolarpanels-forsale.com/solar-energy-facts|title=Portable Solar Panels|work=Portable Solar Panels for Sale|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726034440/http://www.portablesolarpanels-forsale.com/solar-energy-facts/|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([[NREL]]), in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions for solar PV, found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site: GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation.&lt;ref&gt;NREL, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57187.pdf Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328212706/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57187.pdf |date=28 March 2015 }}, NREL/FS-6A20-57187, Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45&amp;nbsp;g{{CO2}}e/kWh. Using the same assumptions, at Phoenix, USA, with insolation of 2400&amp;nbsp;kWh/m2/year, the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32&amp;nbsp;g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;David D.

The [[New Zealand]] [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]] found that the solar PV would have little impact on the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pce.parliament.nz/our-work/news-insights/electric-cars-not-solar-panels-says-environment-commissioner |title= Electric cars not solar panels, says Environment Commissioner |publisher= Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date= 22 March 2016 |accessdate= 23 March 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160403033039/http://www.pce.parliament.nz/our-work/news-insights/electric-cars-not-solar-panels-says-environment-commissioner |archivedate= 3 April 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy payback ===

The [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|energy payback time]] (EPBT) of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system. Due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Photovoltaics Report  |url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf  |publisher=Fraunhofer ISE  |pages=28–32  |accessdate=31 August 2014  |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SFRTUaBS?url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf  |archivedate=31 August 2014  |date=28 July 2014  |deadurl=no  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blakers and Klaus Weber, [http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm "The Energy Intensity of Photovoltaic Systems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717213134/http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm |date=17 July 2012 }}, Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Australian National University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for [[crystalline silicon]] PV systems&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; and 1–1.5 years for thin film technologies (S. Europe).&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; These figures fell to 0.75–3.5 years in 2013, with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jinqing Peng, Lin Lu, Hongxing Yang, ''Review on lifecycle assessment of energy payback and greenhouse gas emission of solar photovoltaic systems''.

Another economic measure, closely related to the energy payback time, is the [[EROEI|energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) or [[EROEI|energy return on investment]] (EROI),&lt;ref&gt;C. Reich-Weiser, D. Dornfeld, and S. Horne.

===Water use===
Solar power includes plants with among the lowest water consumption per unit of electricity (photovoltaic), and also power plants with among the highest water consumption (concentrating solar power with wet-cooling systems).

Photovoltaic power plants use very little water for operations. Life-cycle water consumption for utility-scale operations is estimated to be 12 gallons per megawatt-hour for flat-panel PV solar. Only wind power, which consumes essentially no water during operations, has a lower water consumption intensity.&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"&gt;Meldrum and others, [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/015031;jsessionid=2D46F22833C30A3DBC1482DA94361DAE.c1 "Life cycle water use for electricity generation: a review and harmonization of literature estimates,"] ''Environmental Research Letters'', 2013, v.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems, on the other hand, have the highest water-consumption intensities of any conventional type of electric power plant; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Bracken and others, Concentrating Solar Power and Water Issues in the U.S. Southwest, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A50-61376, March 2015, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210).&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt; A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000614/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf |date=6 April 2015 }}, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt; The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.&lt;ref&gt;Utility-Scale Solar Power: Responsible Water Resource Management, Solar Energy Industries Association, 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of water consumption is heightened because CSP plants are often located in arid environments where water is scarce.

In 2007, the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf Concentrating Solar Power Commercial Application Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226021735/https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf |date=26 December 2017 }}, US Department of Energy, 20 Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 4 used dry cooling systems. The four dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] near [[Barstow, California]], and the [[Genesis Solar Energy Project]] in [[Riverside County, California]]. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 were wet systems, 7 were dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.

Although many older thermoelectric power plants with once-through cooling or cooling ponds ''use'' more water than CSP, meaning that more water passes through their systems, most of the cooling water returns to the water body available for other uses, and they ''consume'' less water by evaporation. For instance, the median coal power plant in the US with once-through cooling uses 36,350 gal/MWhr, but only 250 gal/MWhr (less than one percent) is lost through evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809222054/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf |date=9 August 2017 }}, NREL, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, the majority of US power plants have used recirculating systems such as cooling towers rather than once-through systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971 Many newer power plants have cooling systems that Reuse Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020936/https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971 |date=26 December 2017 }}, US EIA, 11 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other issues ===
One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of [[cadmium]] (Cd), a [[toxic heavy metal]] that has the tendency to [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in ecological [[food chain]]s. It is used as semiconductor component in [[cadmium telluride solar cell|CdTe solar cells]] and as buffer layer for certain [[CIGS cell]]s in the form of [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]].&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Werner  |first1=Jürgen H.  |title=Toxic Substances In Photovoltaic Modules  |url=http://www.postfreemarket.net/pdf/japan1.pdf  |website=postfreemarket.net  |publisher=Institute of Photovoltaics, University of Stuttgart, Germany - The 21st International Photovoltaic Science and Engineering Conference 2011 Fukuoka, Japan  |accessdate=23 September 2014  |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6So1l9Oko?url=http://www.postfreemarket.net/pdf/japan1.pdf  |archivedate=23 September 2014  |page=2  |format=PDF  |date=2 November 2011  |deadurl=yes  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The amount of cadmium used in [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film PV modules]] is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 [[microgram]]/kWh over the whole life-cycle.&lt;ref name="ECN2006" /&gt; Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and [[lignite]] combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and [[natural gas]] 0.2 microgram/kWh.

In a [[life-cycle analysis]] it has been noted, that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf|title=CdTe PV: Real and Perceived EHS Risks|author=|date=|website=bnl.gov|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627012102/https://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf|archivedate=27 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[crystalline silicon]] modules, the [[solder]] material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of [[lead]] (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy.&lt;ref name="werner" /&gt;

A 2014-published life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that the large-scale implementation of solar and wind potentially reduces pollution-related
environmental impacts. The study found that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility-scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;Hertwich and others, [http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf "Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123154831/http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf |date=23 November 2015 }}, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 19 May 2015, v.112 n.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concentrator photovoltaics ===
[[File:3 MW CPV project in Golmud, China.jpg|thumb|[[Concentrator photovoltaics|CPV modules]] on dual axis [[solar tracker]]s in Golmud, China]]

[[Concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of [[electrical power production]]. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[curved mirror]]s to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, [[multi-junction solar cells]]. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a [[solar tracker]] in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;MSU-CSET Participation Archive with notation in the Murray Ledger &amp; Times&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luminescent solar concentrator]]s (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Layton |first = Julia |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm |title = What is a luminescent solar concentrator? |publisher = Science.howstuffworks.com |date = 5 November 2008 |accessdate = 19 April 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100310165608/http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm |archivedate = 10 March 2010 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, most [[solar panels on spacecraft]] are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in the [[inner Solar System]].

=== Floatovoltaics ===

[[Floatovoltaics]] are an emerging form of PV systems that float on the surface of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SolarServer.com |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |title=Kyocera, partners announce construction of the world's largest floating solar PV Plant in Hyogo prefecture, Japan |date=4 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104333/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=EnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/11/running-out-of-precious-land-floating-solar-pv-systems-may-be-a-solution |title=Running Out of Precious Land?

'''Synergistic gardening''' is a system of [[organic gardening]], developed by [[Emilia Hazelip]]. The system is strongly influenced by [[permaculture]], as well as the work of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] and [[Marc Bonfils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Synergistic Garden |url=http://www.seedballs.com/hazelip.html |work=Excerpt from Permaculture Magazine |series=Issue 19 |date=Spring 1999 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316085845/http://www.seedballs.com/hazelip.html |archivedate=March 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing the [[garden]], there is no further digging, ploughing or tilling, and no use of external inputs such as [[manure]]s and other [[fertilizer]]s, or [[pesticide]]s. [[Soil health]] is maintained by the selection of [[plant]]s, [[mulch]]ing, and recycling of plant residues.&lt;ref name="Emilia emails"/&gt;

==Company history==
Telligent was founded by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]] in 2004. Howard was previously a founding member of Microsoft's [[ASP.NET]] team and helped build and run the Microsoft ASP.NET community. 

Telligent introduced its first product, [[Telligent Community|Community Server]], in the fall of 2004. Community Server was an integrated community platform that brought together blogs, wikis, forums, user profiles, etc. Community Server was based on the work done by Rob Howard on the ASP.NET Forums, Jason Alexander on nGallery, and Scott Watermasysk on .Text.

Dell and MySpace both became Telligent customers in 2006. Dell started a blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/Direct2Dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2006/07/11/real-people-are-here-and-we-re-listening.aspx|title=Real People are Here and We're Listening|publisher=Lionel Menchaca|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Telligent's platform in response to [[Jeff Jarvis]]' post about his dissatisfaction with a Dell laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/10/18/dell-hell-the-end/|title=Dell Hell:The end?|publisher=BuzzMachine|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2007 Telligent introduced a [[social analytics]] tool called [[Telligent Analytics|Harvest Reporting Server]].

In 2008, [[Intel Capital]] became Telligent's first capital partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/capital/news/releases/080922.htm|title=Intel Capital to Acquire $20 Million Stake in Telligent |publisher=Intel|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Telligent's products are built on the [[Microsoft .NET]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. They are primarily used as on-premises, white label software solutions.

===Telligent Community ===
[[Telligent Community]] (formerly Community Server), built on the Telligent Evolution platform, is Telligent's flagship product. It was first introduced in 2004 and the most recent version is 5.6 as of October 2010.

Telligent Community is designed to support external facing communities and the primary use cases are: digital marketing, support communities, and networking.

===Telligent Enterprise ===
Telligent Enterprise, built on the Telligent Evolution platform, was first introduced in 2008 in response to users of Telligent Community asking Telligent to provide an employee-focused solution. Telligent Enterprise version 2.6 was released October 2010.

Telligent Enterprise is designed to support enterprise 2.0 / internal communities, private business-to-business communities, and private networking communities. An emphasis on integration with enterprise email systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, and enterprise identity management systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory, are examples of how Telligent Enterprise differs from Telligent Community.

=== Telligent Analytics ===
Telligent introduced Telligent Analytics in 2007 as Harvest Reporting Server. Telligent Analytics is designed to analyze people and information created within the Telligent Evolution platform. This includes both Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise. It additionally includes any data created on applications that run on the Telligent Evolution platform.
