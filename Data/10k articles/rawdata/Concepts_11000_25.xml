      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">An '''antecedent''' is a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] that cues an [[organism]] to perform a [[learned behaviors|learned behavior]].  When an organism perceives an antecedent stimulus, it behaves in a way that maximizes reinforcing [[Operant_conditioning#Tools_and_procedures_of_operant_conditioning|consequences]] and minimizes punishing consequences. This might be part of complex, interpersonal communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4574">'''Barrier analysis''' is a rapid assessment tool used in [[behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] projects. The purpose of barrier analysis is to identify behavioral determinants, so that more effective behavior change, communication messages, strategies, and supporting activities can be developed. Barrier analysis is a relatively easy approach that can be conducted in a short period of time, allowing implementers to quickly make decisions based on the findings. This method has been used in 38 countries by 34 organizations. The training manual is available in English, Spanish, French, and Arabic.

== History ==
Barrier analysis was developed in 1990 by Tom Davis, MPH (an independent consultant formerly with [[Food for the Hungry]]) based on the [[health belief model]] and the [[theory of reasoned action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Tom|title=FH Tools for PM2A Projects: Barrier Analysis|url=http://caregroupinfo.org/vids/bavid/player.html|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been adopted by at least 34 organizations working in 45 countries around the world to study determinants of behaviors related to child survival, food security, sexual and reproductive health, city planning, and other areas. The methodology has continued to evolve as it has been tested in different settings. It has primarily been used for international development, although it has also been used and taught in the developed world as well (e.g. by the Baltimore City Government for analysis of trash can use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rockoff|first=Jonathan D.|title=City launches initiative to boost trash-can use|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-06-12/news/0506120110_1_plastic-trash-bags-trash-cans-dump-trash|accessdate=15 December 2012|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=12 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feed the Children &lt;ref&gt;http://www.feedthechildren.org&lt;/ref&gt; and Hunger Free NYC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hungerfreeamerica.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Summer%20Meals%20Barrier%20Analysis%202016_online_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to look at participation in the USDA summer meals program, and the Honey Bee Health Coalition&lt;ref&gt;http://honeybeehealthcoalition.org&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Usage ==
Barrier analysis can be used at the start of a behavior change program to determine key messages and activities for intervention. It can also be used in an ongoing program, focusing on behaviors that have not changed in order to understand what is stopping a it from happening.

== Methodology ==
The purpose of barrier analysis is to identify determinants of behavior change among a specific target audience. The four most commonly found determinants are self-efficacy, social norms, positive consequences, and negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrieranalysis.fhi.net/|title=Barrier Analysis|publisher=Food for the Hungry|date=November 2004|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically researchers interview 45 "Doers" (people who already practice the behavior) and 45 "Non-doers" (people who do not practice the behavior) and compare the responses. A difference of 15% or greater between the two interviewee categories is considered statistically significant.  Such ["statistically significant"] determinants have a less than 5% probability of being due to chance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The '''consistent life ethic''', or the '''consistent ethic of life''' is an ideology that opposes [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], [[assisted suicide]], and [[euthanasia]]. Adherents are opposed, at the very least, to [[Just War|unjust war]], while some adherents also profess [[pacifism]], or opposition to all war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/opinion/sunday/catholics-and-the-power-of-political-communion.html?_r=1 | work=New York Times | title=The Power of Political Communion | date=15 September 2012 | accessdate=18 September 2012 | first1=Molly | last1=Worthen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in 1983 by the Catholic Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] to express an ideology based on the premise that all [[Sanctity of life|human life is sacred]] and should be protected by law.&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988"&gt;Bernardin, Joseph. ''Consistent ethics of life'' 1988, Sheed and Ward&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The phrase "consistent ethic of life" was used as far back as a 1971 speech delivered by then-Archbishop [[Humberto Medeiros]] of Boston.&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;{{cite news | last=Gregg | first=Samuel | title=The Consistent—and Not So Seamless—Ethic of Life | website=Catholic World Report | date=13 August 2015 | url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/4098/the_consistentand_not_so_seamlessethic_of_life.aspx | ref=harv | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eileen Egan ===

In 1971, [[Roman Catholic]] [[pacifist]] [[Eileen Egan]] coined the phrase "seamless garment" to describe a holistic reverence for life.&lt;ref name="Dear 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/soul-seeing/cardinal-bernardin's-gift-fits-all-sizes |last=Leach |first=Michael |title=Cardinal Bernardin's gift fits all sizes |work=National Catholic Reporter |date=6 November 2012 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is a [[Bible]] reference from John 19:23 to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]], which his executioners did not tear apart. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life. "The protection of life", said Egan, "is a seamless garment. You can't protect some life and not others."  Her words were meant to challenge those members of the [[pro-life]] movement who were in favor of capital punishment.

=== Joseph Cardinal Bernardin ===
Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Chicago]] helped publicize the consistent life ethic idea in 1983.{{sfn|Bernardin|1988|p=v}}{{nonspecific|date=July 2017}}  Initially, Bernardin spoke out against nuclear war and abortion. However, he quickly expanded the scope of his view to include all aspects of human life. In one of the first speeches given on the topic at Fordham University, Bernardin said: "The spectrum of life cuts across the issues of genetics, abortion, capital punishment, modern warfare and the care of the terminally ill."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Overberg, Kenneth R. S.J.:"A Consistent Ethic of Life", Catholic Update, St. Anthony's Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernardin said that although each of the issues was distinct, nevertheless the issues were linked since the valuing and defending of (human) life were, he believed, at the center of both issues. Bernardin told an audience in Portland, Oregon: "When human life is considered 'cheap' or easily expendable in one area, eventually nothing is held as sacred and all lives are in jeopardy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Bernardin drew his stance from New Testament principles, specifically of forgiveness and reconciliation, yet he argued that neither the themes nor the content generated from those themes were specifically Christian.&lt;ref name="Walter, James J 2005"&gt;Walter, James J. and Shannon, Thomas A.: ''Contemporary Issues in Bioethics: A Catholic perspective'', Rowan and Littlefeild Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this, Bernardin attempted to create a dialogue with others who were not necessarily aligned with Christianity.

Bernardin and other advocates of this ethic sought to form a consistent policy that would link abortion, capital punishment, economic injustice, euthanasia, and unjust war.&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988" /&gt; Bernardin sought to unify conservative Catholics (who opposed abortion) and liberal Catholics (who opposed capital punishment) in the United States. By relying on fundamental principles, Bernardin also sought to coordinate work on several different spheres of Catholic [[moral theology]]. In addition, Bernardin argued that since the 1950s the church had moved against its own historical, [[casuistry|casuistic]] exceptions to the protection of life. "To summarize the shift succinctly, the presumption against taking human life has been strengthened and the exceptions made ever more restrictive."&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988" /&gt;

=== Other supporters ===
[[File:Hentoff bio.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Consistent Life Ethic has spread from Catholic theology to supporters such as [[Nat Hentoff]]]]
The non-profit organization Consistent Life Network, founded in 1987 as the Seamless Garment Network, promotes adherence to the ethic through education and non-violent action.  Individual endorsers belonging to the Consistent Life Network organization include Father [[Daniel Berrigan]], theologian [[Harvey Cox]], ''Village Voice'' columnist [[Nat Hentoff]], Father [[Theodore Hesburgh]], actress [[Patricia Heaton]], ''[[L'Arche]]'' founder [[Jean Vanier]], death penalty activist Sister [[Helen Prejean]], pro-life activist [[Abby Johnson (activist)|Abby Johnson]], author [[Ken Kesey]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]] and Nobel Peace Prize laureates [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]] and [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]].&lt;ref name="endorsers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consistent Life Individual Endorsers As of January 9, 2017|url=http://www.consistent-life.org/clsigners.pdf|website=Consistent Life Network|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel MacNair]], for ten years (1994–2004) President of [[Feminists for Life]], a pro-life organization,&lt;ref&gt;MacNair, R.M.

In the US, several groups have promoted the "consistent ethic of life" approach, including the [[USCCB|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [[Democrats for Life of America]], and the [[American Solidarity Party]], a [[Christian Democratic]] political organization.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite news| last=Hughes | first=Mariann | title=The search for a third way in U.S. politics | work=Our Sunday Visitor | date=30 October 2016 | url=https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/20947/The-search-for-a-third-way-in-US-politics.aspx | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Complete Platform | website=American Solidarity Party | url=http://www.solidarity-party.org/complete-platform | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups without a religious orientation that support the ideology include Democrats for Life of America, the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians (PLAGAL), and All Our Lives (a pro-contraception feminist group), all of which are members of the Consistent Life Network. Other secular groups supporting a consistent ethic of life position include Rehumanize International (formerly known as Life Matters Journal)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehumanizeintl.org/ http://www.rehumanizeintl.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/cover_story/2016/10/the_future_of_the_pro_life_movement.html|title=The New Culture of Life|last=Graham|first=Ruth|date=11 October 2016|work=Slate|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Wave Feminists]].&lt;ref name="Halper 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Halper | first=Daniel | title=WH Denies Endorsement Will Intimidate FBI Investigators | work=Weekly Standard | date=9 June 2016 | url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/wh-denies-endorsement-will-intimidate-fbi-investigators/article/2002757 | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About | website=New Wave Feminists | url=https://www.newwavefeminists.com/about | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent authors who have written in support of the consistent life ethic include [[Frank Pavone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pavone |first=Frank |url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/columns/4378-the-consistent-ethic-of-life-myths-and-realities |title=The Consistent Ethic of Life: Myths and Realities |website=Priests for Life |date=1 January 1999 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Martin (priest, born 1960)|James Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/gun-control-pro-life-issue Gun Control is a Pro-Life Issue, America, 17 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dear]],&lt;ref name="Dear 2008"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dear | first=John | title=The Consistent Ethic of Life | website=FatherJohnDear.org | date=15 July 2008 | url=http://www.fatherjohndear.org/articles/the_consistent_ethic.html | archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131019001027/http://www.fatherjohndear.org/articles/the_consistent_ethic.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=19 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dear 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dear | first=J. | title=The God of Peace: Toward A Theology of Nonviolence | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-59752-112-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE5LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 | accessdate=9 March 2017 | p=158ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsers-web"&gt;{{cite web | title=Consistent Life Network Endorsers | website=Consistent Life Network | url=http://www.consistentlifenetwork.org/endorsers | accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Sider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sider|first1=Ron|title=Completely Pro-Life|date=1987|publisher=Intervarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1706-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Campolo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campolo|first1=Tony|title=Who is Really Pro-Life?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-campolo/who-is-really-prolife_b_31947.html|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=18 October 2006}} (revised 25 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Jonathan|title=Tony Campolo hits hard on abortion, gay marriage, Israel and more|url=http://religionnews.com/2013/12/17/tony-campolo-hits-hard-hot-button-issues/|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Religion News Service|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pally" /&gt; [[Joel Hunter]],&lt;ref name="Pally"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pally|first1=Marcia|title=The New Evangelicals: How Christians are rethinking Abortion and Gay Marriage|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2011/12/28/3399068.htm|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wendell Berry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |last=Berry |first=Wendell |date=22 June 1986 |subject=The consequences of treating a fetus as a human being: Reader survey on abortion |work=Whole Earth Review |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/nvp/consistent/whole-earth.html |access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berry |first=Wendell |title=The failure of war}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsers-web" /&gt; and [[Shane Claiborne]].&lt;ref name="Pally" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claiborne|first1=Shane|title=A Dialogue on What it Means to be Pro-Life|url=https://www.redletterchristians.org/a-dialogue-on-what-it-means-to-be-pro-life/|website=Red Letter Christians|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claiborne|first1=Shane|title=The Irresistible Revolution|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Michael Leach, "If one contends, as we do, that the right of every fetus to be born should be protected by civil law and supported by civil consensus, then our moral, political and economic responsibilities do not stop at the moment of birth."&lt;ref name=Leach /&gt; This viewpoint was emphasized by Pope John Paul II in his 1995 encyclical, ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'' (Gospel of Life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=John Paul II |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html |title=Evangelium Vitae |location=Vatican City |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book-length document outlined the Pope's emphasis on fostering a [[culture of life]] based on the New Testament and the life of Jesus. Specifically, he emphasized the value and inviolability of human life, from conception until natural death.

=== Abortion ===
{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}

Rather than "thinking of a pregnant women and her fetus as being adversaries battling over exclusive rights, the right of a woman to control her body versus the right of the fetus to live long enough to control hers", a consistent life ethic would view both as valuable and important, and seek to provide both all the support they needed to live and live well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=The consequences of treating a fetus as a human being |work=Whole Earth Review |date=22 June 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capital punishment ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and capital punishment}}
Traditionally, arguments for the death penalty focus on the idea that it: 1) deters further violence; 2) enacts just retribution on the criminal, effectively gaining a sense of justice for society and those affected by the crime; 3) seeks to reform other criminals with the threat of such severe punishment and; 4) protects society from those criminals which the government has deemed to be the most heinous.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Bernardin and some other consistent life ethic advocates recognize the right of the state to use capital punishment. However, they reject the necessity of this type of punishment for many reasons, arguing that there are more appropriate and effective ways for the state to defend its people.  Many consistent life ethic advocates call for a total abolition of the death penalty.  The consistent ethic's opposition to capital punishment is rooted in the conviction that an atmosphere of respect for life must pervade a society, and resorting to the death penalty does not support this attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph A.: ''The Seamless Garment: Writings on the Consistent Ethic of Life'' Orbis Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argue that the result of the death penalty&amp;nbsp;– removing the criminal from society, enacting justice on the criminal, and bringing about feelings of revenge for those affected and the greater society&amp;nbsp;– do not necessarily have to be accomplished by taking a life.

One out-spoken anti-death penalty activist is Sister [[Helen Prejean]]. Her books ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'' and ''The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account to Wrongful Executions'' are autobiographical accounts of the time she spent ministering to death row inmates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rachel MacNair|MacNair, Rachel M.]], and Zunes, Stephen: ''Consistently Opposing Killing: from abortion to assisted suicide, the death penalty and war'', pages 58–60. Praeger Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable independent Catholic anti-death penalty organization is [[Priests for Life]].

=== Health care ===
Bernardin understood the consistent life ethic as implying a societal responsibility to provide adequate health care for all, especially the poor.{{sfn|Bernardin|1985}}{{sfn|Bernardin|1986}}{{sfn|Bernardin|1986}}

According to Ron Hamel,&lt;blockquote&gt;...a moral vision constituted by the consistent ethic of life sensitizes one to procedures, technological developments, and aspects of the health care system that fail to promote or do not adequately promote human dignity and do not sufficiently enhance human life. ...it is not sufficient to only oppose euthanasia, but one must also be concerned about and address those factors that give rise to euthanasia and find ever better ways to care for the dying and ensure the dying the opportunity to forgo treatment and to live their lives fully while dying.&lt;ref name=Hamel&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.chausa.org/publications/health-progress/article/november-december-2008/twenty-five-years-later-cardinal-bernardin's-consistent-ethic-of-life |last=Hamel |first=Ron |title=Twenty-Five Years Later: Cardinal Bernardin's Consistent Ethic of Life |work=Health Progress |date=November 2008 |p=56-59 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, appeals to the consistent life ethic have been made in support of universal health care.&lt;ref name="LIC-2009"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On health care, a consistent ethic of life | work=The Long Island Catholic | volume=48 | issue=23 | date=30 September 2009 | url=http://www.newspaper.licatholic.org/editorial/health-care-consistent-ethic-life | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Refugees ===
The consistent life ethic has been invoked to include care for immigrants and refugees.&lt;ref name="Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Scribner | first=Todd | title=The Gospel of Life and the Catholic approach to the refugee crisis | website=Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good | date=31 July 2014 | url=http://www.catholicsinalliance.org/refugeecrisis | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIC-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web | last=Adkins | first=Jason | title=Catholic Spirit: Border children and a consistent ethic of life | website=Minnesota Catholic Conference | date=13 August 2014 | url=https://mncatholic.org/catholic-spirit-border-children-consistent-ethic-life/ | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kangas 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kangas | first=Billy | title=Keeping "Pro-Life" Consistent | website=The Orant | date=22 January 2015 | url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/billykangas/2015/01/keeping-pro-life-consistent.html | accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly appealing to the consistent life ethic, other Catholics have sought to apply the "pro-life" ethic to the issue of immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Snyder |first=L. |display-authors=etal|title=Catholic Leaders to Congress: Immigration Reform is a Pro-Life Issue |date=20 January 2015 |publisher=Faith in Public Life |url=http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/immigrationlife/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329173750/http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/immigrationlife/ |archive-date=29 March 2016 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen 2014"&gt;{{cite news | last=Allen | first=John L.

== Criticisms ==
One criticism made of the consistent life ethic position is that it inadvertently helped provide "cover" or support for politicians who supported legalized abortion or wanted to minimize this issue, a circumstance that Bernardin himself both recognized and deplored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronald N.|last=Neff|url=http://www.sobran.com/columns/2005/050816.shtml |title=The "Seamless Garment" Revisited |work=Sobran's |date=16 August 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregg /&gt;
A critic of [[Joseph Bernardin]], [[George Weigel]] rejected the claims that the consistent life ethic had been created to cover up for abortion rights, saying that Bernardin was "a committed pro-lifer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Weigel |first=George |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2011/02/the-end-of-the-bernardin-era |title=The End of the Bernardin Era: The rise, dominance, and decline of a culturally accommodating Catholicism |work=First Things |date=February 2011 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[José Horacio Gómez|José Gómez]] of Los Angeles criticized the "seamless garment" approach in 2016 because in his view it results in "a mistaken idea that all issues are morally equivalent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff Reporter | title=Archbishop Gomez: The Root Violence in Our Society Is the Violence Against the Most Vulnerable | work=National Catholic Register | date=4 February 2016 | url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/archbishop-gomez-the-root-violence-in-our-society-is-the-violence-against-t | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eli"&gt;{{cite news | last=Eli | first=Bradley| title=Abp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">A '''critical vocabulary''' is a formal [[terminology]] related to one or more branches of [[critical theory]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Although it may be considered a type of [[jargon]], it is predominantly used by [[academic]]s {{Who|date=February 2018}} and is not [[slang]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  The word "critical", as used in the term ''critical vocabulary'', takes on two meanings: "of essential importance" and "of or pertaining to [[critic]]s or [[criticism]]."{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Thus, the vocabulary is of essential importance to the critical theory that employs it and is used by that critical theory in order to produce [[criticism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Usage==
Unlike the term ''jargon'', the term ''critical vocabulary'' is seldom used as a [[collective noun]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  It is typically preceded by the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  When speaking about more than one critical theory, it is used in the plural (i.e. "the critical vocabularies of postmodern studies").{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Criticism==
Several people have criticized critical vocabularies as tools of alienation or obfuscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.www.tuftsdaily.com/media/storage/paper856/news/2005/04/22/Features/Has-Academic.Jargon.Finally.Gone.Too.Far-1490971.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110807012651/http://media.www.tuftsdaily.com/media/storage/paper856/news/2005/04/22/Features/Has-Academic.Jargon.Finally.Gone.Too.Far-1490971.shtml |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.case.edu/webdev/2006/03/23/beware_of_your_vocabulary |title=Beware of your vocabulary: Web Development Blog: Creative Services: Marketing and Communications: Case Western Reserve University |publisher=Blog.case.edu |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} Also there have been assertions that the relatively recent proliferation of critical vocabularies has resulted in redundancy of both terms and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans|first1=William W.|year=1977|title=Language and the lay linguist|journal=American Speech|volume=52|issue=1/2|pages=134–145 |doi=10.2307/454728 |last2=Newman |first2=Edwin |last3=Mueller |first3=Robert K.|jstor=454728}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} See the Pitfalls section under [[jargon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">'''Curriculum-based measurement''', or '''CBM''', is also referred to as a general outcomes measures (GOMs) of a student's performance in either basic skills or content knowledge.

==Early history==
CBM began in the mid 1970s with research headed by [[Stan Deno]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Deno, S.L. (1985). Curriculum-based measurement: The emerging alternative. ''Exceptional Children'', 52(3), 219–32&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of 10 years, this work led to the establishment of measurement systems in reading, writing, and spelling that were: (a) easy to construct, (b) brief in administration and scoring, (c) had technical adequacy (reliability and various types of validity evidence for use in making educational decisions), and (d) provided alternate forms to allow time series data to be collected on student progress.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Neddenriep, Bradley-Klug &amp; Ziemann (2002) Advances in Curriculum-Based Measurement: Alternative Rate Measures for Assessing Reading Skills in Pre- and Advanced Readers. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(3), 270–83 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; This focus in the three language arts areas eventually was expanded to include mathematics, though the technical research in this area continues to lag that published in the language arts areas. An even later development was the application of CBM to middle-secondary areas: Espin and colleagues at the University of Minnesota developed a line of research addressing vocabulary and comprehension (with the maze) and by Tindal and colleagues at the [[University of Oregon]] developed a line of research on concept-based teaching and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Espin, C. &amp; Tindal, G. (1998). Curriculum-based measurement for secondary students (pp. 214–53). In M.R. Shinn (Ed.), ''Advanced applications of curriculum-based measurement''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing importance==
Early research on the CBM quickly moved from monitoring student progress to its use in screening, normative decision-making, and finally benchmarking. Indeed, with the implementation of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] in 2001, and its focus on large-scale testing and accountability, CBM has become increasingly important as a form of standardized measurement that is highly related to and relevant for understanding student's progress toward and achievement of state standards.

==Key feature==
Probably the key feature of CBM is its accessibility for classroom application and implementation. It was designed to provide an experimental analysis of the effects from interventions, which includes both instruction and curriculum. This is one of the most important conundrums to surface on CBM: To evaluate the effects of a curriculum, a measurement system needs to provide an independent "audit" and not be biased to only that which is taught. The early struggles in this arena referred to this difference as mastery monitoring (curriculum-based which was embedded in the curriculum and therefore forced the metric to be the number (and rate) of units traversed in learning) versus experimental analysis which relied on metrics like oral reading fluency (words read correctly per minute) and correct word or letter sequences per minute (in writing or spelling), both of which can serve as GOMs. In mathematics, the metric is often digits correct per minute. N.B. The metric of CBM is typically rate-based to focus on "automaticity" in learning basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, A.D.; Skinner, C.H.; Williams, J.; Hawkins, R.; Neddenriep, C.E. &amp; Dizer, J. (2007). Comparing Comprehension Following Silent and Aloud Reading across Elementary and Secondary Students: Implication for Curriculum-Based Measurement. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(1), 9–23. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent advancements==
The most recent advancements of CBM have occurred in three areas. First, they have been applied to students with low incidence disabilities. This work is best represented by Zigmond in the Pennsylvania Alternate Assessment and Tindal in the Oregon and Alaska Alternate Assessments. The second advancement is the use of generalizability theory with CBM, best represented by the work of John Hintze, in which the focus is parceling the error term into components of time, grade, setting, task, etc. Finally, Yovanoff, Tindal, and colleagues at the University of Oregon have applied Item Response Theory (IRT) to the development of statistically calibrated equivalent forms in their progress monitoring system.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel M. Stewart, Ronald C. Martella, Nancy E. Marchand-Martella and Gregory J. Benner (2005): Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior. ''JEIBI'', 2(3), 115–24. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Curriculum-based measurement emerged from behavioral psychology and yet several [[behaviorists]] have become disenchanted with the lack of the dynamics of the process.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R.L.; Skinner, C.H. &amp; Jaspers, K. (2008). Extending Research on the Validity of Brief Reading Comprehension Rate and Level Measures to College Course Success. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(2), 163–74.

'''De-escalation''' refers to behavior that is intended to escape [[Conflict escalation|escalations]] of [[Conflict (process)|conflicts]]. It may also refer to approaches in [[conflict resolution]]. [[Escalation of commitment|Escalations of commitment]] are often hard from spiraling out of proportions without specific measures being taken.

==Verbal De-escalation in Psychiatric Settings==
De-escalation is aimed at calmly communicating with an agitated client in order to understand, manage and resolve their concerns. Ultimately, these actions should help reduce the client’s agitation and potential for future aggression or violence. An inadequate intervention, or one occurring too late, may leave staff needing to utilize coercive measures to manage an aggressive or violent client.

Their review settled on eight goals, seven elements, 15 general techniques and 15 other techniques divided into three subheadings. Furthermore, a valiant attempt to synthesize the various models and definitions was conducted by Price &amp; Baker (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Owen|last2=Baker|first2=John|date=2012-08-01|title=Key components of de-escalation techniques: A thematic synthesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00793.x/abstract|journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=310–319|doi=10.1111/j.1447-0349.2011.00793.x|issn=1447-0349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic analysis of 11 eligible studies converged on seven themes: three related to staff skills (e.g. empathetic concern, calm appearance and gentle tone of voice) and four related to the process of intervening (e.g. establish rapport, maintain safety, problem solve and set limits). The available literature provides clinical descriptions of effective de-escalation based on qualitative data and professional observations. However, these thematic analyses need to be supported by more objective data; one hallmark of such objectivity would be an empirical scale or quantitative measure of de-escalation.

==English Modified version of the ‘De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale’ (EMDABS)==

1. '''Valuing the client:''' Provides genuine acknowledgement that the client’s concerns are valid, important and will be addressed in a meaningful way.

2. '''Reducing fear:''' Listens actively to the client and offers genuine empathy while suggesting that the client’s situation has the potential for positive future change.

3. '''Inquiring about client’s queries and anxiety:''' Can communicate a thorough understanding of the client’s concerns, and works to uncover
the root of the issue.

4. '''Providing guidance to the client:''' Suggests multiple ways to the help the client with their current concerns and recommends preventative measures.

5. '''Working out possible agreements:''' Takes responsibility for the client’s care and concludes the encounter with an agreed-upon short-term solution and a long-term action plan.

6. '''Remaining calm:''' Maintains a calm tone of voice and steady pace that is appropriate to the client’s feelings and behaviour.

7. '''Risky:''' Maintains a moderate distance from the client to ensure safety, but does not appear guarded and fearful.

This often involves techniques such as taking a [[Child time-out|time-out]], and deflecting the conversation to individuals in the group who are less passionately involved. This is commonly used by Fee Team in [[mental health nursing]] practice. It is also used as an anger management tool to remove tension between two participants in a conflictual relationship or intervention.

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

[[File:Usmcmessnight.jpg|right|thumb|Mess Night at Camp Lejeune]]
[[File:Dining-in.jpg|right|thumb|Dining in at Fort Dix, New Jersey]]
'''Dining in''' is a formal [[military]] ceremony for members of a [[Company (military unit)|company]] or other [[Military organization|unit]], which includes a dinner, drinking, and other events to foster [[camaraderie]] and ''[[Morale|esprit de corps]]''.

The [[United States Army]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the [[United States Air Force]] refer to this event as a '''dining in''' or '''dining-in.''' The [[United States Marine Corps]] refers to it as '''mess night'''. Other names include '''regimental dinner''', '''guest night''', '''formal mess dinner''', and '''band night'''.&lt;ref name=MCO_P5060.20_ch24&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=
|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%203.aspx 
|chapter=Chapter 24: Mess Night
|title=Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual |series=MCO P5060.20
|publisher=United States Marine Corps
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dining in is a formal event for all unit members, male and female; though some specialized mess nights can be officer- or enlisted-only. The unit [[chaplain]] is usually also invited, if an [[invocation]] is needed. A unit's dining-in consists of only the members of the unit, with the possible exception of the guest(s) of honor. An optional formal dinner, known as the '''dining-out''' may include spouses and other guests. The dining-out follows the same basic rules of the dining-in, but is often tailored to minimize some of the military traditions and be more approachable to civilian guests.

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The practice of dining in is thought to have formally begun in 16th-century [[England]], in [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[University|universities]]; though some records indicate that militaries have held formal dinners as far back as the [[Roman Legion]]s. The [[Viking]]s held formal ceremonies to honor and celebrate battles and heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%204.aspx 
|series=MCO P5060.20
|title=Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual
|chapter=Appendix D: History, Customs and Courtesies, and Traditions of the Mess Night
}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the [[British Army]] incorporated the practice of formal dining into their [[regiment]]al mess system. Customs and rules of the mess were soon institutionalized rules, known as the "[[Queen's Regulations]]". The mess night or "Dining in" became a tradition in all British regiments. The Americans, taking many of their traditions from the British military, held mess nights in the 18th and 19th century, but the tradition waned after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Dining in took a temporary halt in the Navy and Marine Corps when [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Josephus Daniels]] imposed prohibition of alcoholic drink, but soon the tradition was restored.  During [[World War II]], the custom was revived in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]], initially in the  [[US Army Air Forces]] [[8th Air Force]], which was based in Britain.  [[US Army Air Forces|AAF]]Officers were invited to participate in British military hosted Mess Nights and then were obligated to reciprocate.

==British traditions==

===Formal Functions===
A Formal function is one at which all mess members may be required to attend and Service Personnel are on official duty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = JSP 456 Part 2 Volume 1 Chapter 6 Food Service Management|last = |first = |publisher = Ministry of Defence|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entitlements for official functions are as follows:

=== Officers' Mess ===
12 Formal Functions per annum. Generally these are 2 x seasonal balls and 10 x other functions (e.g. Mess Dinners) as agreed by mess committees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Warrant Officers’ &amp; Senior Rates/Sergeants’ Mess ===
6 Formal Functions per annum. Generally these are 2 x seasonal balls and 4 x other functions (e.g. Mess Dinners) as agreed by mess committees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Loyal Toast ===
The [[Port wine|port]]
decanters are to be placed at pre-determined places and in front of the President and Vice President. The President and Vice President will remove the stoppers simultaneously and pass the decanters in a clockwise direction/to the left. Wine stewards are to follow the decanters round the table with a jug of water, filling the glass of any diner who declines port or madeira. The glasses of the President and Vice President will be filled last, after which they are to re-stop the decanters. All stewards may then be required to leave the dining room before the President calls upon the Vice President to propose the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]]. It should be remembered that whilst the Army and RAF stand for the Loyal Toast, the RN remain seated. Also, whilst passing the port, the RN would ensure the decanter does not leave the table whilst in the RAF; it is passed from hand to hand without touching the table. In the Army, it will depend on the traditions of the Regiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Army===
By the late 18th century, the British Army's "mess night" developed formal rules, as a result of troops being stationed in remote areas. Officers elected mess committees to conduct their meals. Towards the latter part of the 19th century, attending officers were expected to adhere to the rigid etiquette of  [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] society.

In modern times it is sometimes known as a "regimental dinner".

===Royal Navy and Royal Marines===
[[Royal Navy]] officers have the privilege of remaining seated when toasting the Sovereign. Some sources state that this privilege was granted by [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. A popular story states that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was on board his namesake ship [[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|''Royal Charles'']] and had bumped his head on the low overhead of the [[wardroom]] when he stood up to reply a toast that had been drunk to him. He stated that henceforth, naval officers would never again rise to toast a British sovereign. In 1964, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] extended the privilege to the [[Royal Marines]] in honour of their 300th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connell|first1=Royal W.|last2=Mack|first2=William P.|title=Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvKiBiWKrzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=105–6|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|year=2004|location=[[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]|isbn=9781557503305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of "dining in" to welcome new officers and "dining out" to farewell retiring officers originated with the British, although the term came about much later. It has been discontinued in some countries such as the United States but is still practised by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibowicz|first=Charles J.|title=Mess Night Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Vo62GFJlpoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=22–23|year=2007|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|isbn=9781425984465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Toasts at Sea ====
The traditional toasts after dinner for ships at sea are shown below. On certain days, an alternative toast is available but the first one is most usual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sunday ‘Absent friends’ or ‘Absent friends and those at sea’ 

Monday ‘Our ship at sea’ or ‘Our native land’ 

Tuesday ‘Our Sailors’ 

Wednesday ‘Ourselves’ (as no one is likely to concern themselves with our welfare)’ or ‘Ourselves – Our swords’ 

Thursday ‘A bloody war or a sickly season’ 

Friday ‘A willing foe and sea room’ ‘Fox hunting and old port’ 

Saturday ‘Our Families’

==== Trafalgar Night ====
For [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] Night Mess Dinners, the routine varies slightly from a normal dinner night. When the main course is about to be served, the Baron of Beef is first paraded around the table behind a drummer. Similarly, before commencing the service of the sweet, the Ships of the Line are also paraded around the table in a similar fashion to the Beef. The toasts used at dinner on Trafalgar Night are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen]].
# The immortal memory of Admiral/[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] and his comrades.
# Our distinguished guests (if appropriate).

===Royal Air Force===
The [[Royal Air Force]] inherited many mess traditions from the [[British Army]] as a former corps. These customs were notably passed on the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]] as British and American crew served alongside one another in close quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wing dining out: History, heritage, tradition, legacy vital to Air Force way of life|url=http://www.warren.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123095990|publisher=[[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base|warren.af.mil]]|date=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. traditions==
Portions of the event tend to become quite humorous in nature, while others remain somber. [[Etiquette]] requires a diner to know what is appropriate at any given time.

The dining in follows established protocols. After a brief cocktail period of 30 to 45 minutes, the presiding officer, known as the "President of the Mess", announces, "Please be seated." The group will then retire to the dining area to be seated.

After tasting the [[meat]] (usually [[beef]]), the President will declare it "tasty and fit for human consumption", after which the meal will be served to the diners. After the [[dessert]] is finished, the President will invite the chief steward to bring forth [[wine]] and/or [[Punch (drink)|punch]] to be served, and [[Toast (honor)|toasting]] will begin. After the toasts have concluded, the floor will be opened to the levying of fines. The president and the guest of honor will have the opportunity to speak if they so desire. After this, the mess is often then returned to an open cocktail hour, and then the evening concludes with final honors.

==Formal toasts==
[[File:Navy-invite.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy Mess Night Invitation, 1986]]
Formal toasts are the heart of the formal dining in. A junior officer, known as  "Mr/Madam Vice",  proposes a toast to the guests, at which the guests remain seated. After this, various parties will offer toasts to the [[Commander in Chief]], to the heads of state of a visiting or host nations, to their branch of service, to the units, and to the fallen members of the military.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Notice that the United States does not have a king, queen, or Prime Minister, and that the commander in chief and President are the same person.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final and most solemn toast is always to fallen comrades. Often this tribute is marked with a [[Missing man table|table setting dedicated to those military members killed, captured, or missing in action]].&lt;ref name=ALMAR020-07&gt;The Marine Corps mandates a tribute to fallen Marines: {{cite web|accessdate=

Some unusual forms of toasting are common to the U.S. and Canadian traditions. In the [[Toronto Scottish Regiment]], for example, a [[loyal toast]] to the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief (Currently the Prince of Wales) is performed standing with one foot on the chair and one foot on the dining table, facing a portrait of the C-in-C and drinking after the piper has played.&lt;ref name=Russell1980 /&gt; Others, particularly Scottish regiments,&lt;ref name=Lang1996 /&gt; perform toasts in the same way with one foot on a chair and one on the table.&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt; This is a frequent form of toasting in the United States Marine Corps as well.&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt; In the Scottish form, the glass is raised, lowered, brought out, and brought in, as the words of the toast, usually including some form of "Up", "Down", "To you", "To me", are recited, and finally drunk to the cry "Drink it up!" or similar.&lt;ref name=Lang1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt;

=== Violations of etiquette and other traditions ===
Violations of the formal [[etiquette]] of the dining in are "punished", generally with fines. The following are examples of what could be considered "Violations of the Mess": 
* untimely arrival at proceedings
* smoking at the table before the lighting of the [[smoking lamp]]
* haggling over date of rank
* improper wear of uniform
** inverted [[cummerbund]] (Note that U.S. Army regulation ''requires'' that cummerbunds be worn ''upside down'': i.e. pleats down.)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dep't of Army, Reg. 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia para 24-10b (3 Feb. 2005). “The cummerbund is worn … with pleats facing down.”&lt;/ref&gt;
** wearing a clip-on bow tie at an obvious [[List (watercraft)|list]]
* [[Error#Gaff|gaffes]]
** loud and obtrusive remarks in a foreign language
** [[foul language]]
** discussion on a controversial topic (politics, religion, and women are commonly forbidden topics)
* improper toasting procedure
** toasting with an uncharged (''empty'') glass
** rising to applaud particularly witty, succinct, sarcastic, or relevant toasts, unless following the example of the President
* leaving the dining room without permission from the President of the Mess
* carrying cocktails into the dining area before the conclusion of dinner
* haggling over penalties or fines imposed
* drawing a sword except in ceremony &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

At some mess nights, violators of the mess are obliged to publicly drink from a [[grog]] bowl in front of the mess attendees. The grog is sometimes contained in a [[toilet]] bowl, consisting of various alcoholic beverages mixed together. As a more disgusting effect, the grog may also contain floating solids, such as meatballs, raw [[oysters]], or [[Tootsie Rolls]]. The tradition of drinking grog originated with the British Navy. [[Grog]] consisted of the regulation rum ration diluted with water to discourage binge drinking. In modern times, grog comes in two varieties: alcoholic and non-alcoholic, the latter of which may contain anything that will make it less appealing to the taste, including hot sauce. For additional effect, the drinker may be required to [[drinking from shoes|drink from a boot]].

In addition to visiting the grog bowl and paying fines, violators may be sentenced to sing songs, tell jokes, do pushups, or perform menial tasks to entertain the mess. In most cases, when a violator has been identified, he or she is given the opportunity to provide a rebuttal or defense for the violation, which rarely results in the violator being excused for the offense, and usually only results in more punishment.

Traditionally, all fines collected throughout the night are split amongst the stewards that served the attendees as a token of appreciation for their efforts. The fines can also be used to pay for the drinks consumed, while some units have used the Mess Night as a fund raiser (often to pay for a ball).

Members of the mess may also be singled out for some good-natured ribbing and teasing. In some units, members go out of their way to be picked on, often wearing obvious uniform violations, such as crowns, tiaras, eye-patches, bowties and cummerbunds of the wrong color, and other items that have no place on any military uniform (although it is common for US Artillerymen to wear red socks, suspenders and even bowties, in a nod to tradition at the expense of uniform regulations). Some will attempt to leave sabotaging evidence on or around others they wish to see fined, so care must be taken to not be the butt of a joke.

Navy and Marine traditions also include that no diner may leave the hall to use the restroom without permission until Mr. Vice suggests that the company "shed a tear for [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Admiral Nelson]]", a reference to the fact that his body was preserved in a barrel of [[brandy]] after his death at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].

Most Messes attempt to furnish the night with military music and marches, with live bands if possible, or recorded music. Depending on how formal the ceremony is, the diners may be required to march to their seats.

In recent times, Marines have established a variant of the mess in a "field environment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmc1.us/usmc_mess_night.html |title=USMC Customs and Traditions: Marine Corps Mess Night |last=Bartlett |first=Lieutenant Colonel Merrill L. |date=November 1996 |publisher=usmc1.us |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317021713/http://www.usmc1.us/usmc_mess_night.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; substituting in [[mess dress]] for [[Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform|utilities]] and [[List of United States Marine Corps individual equipment|combat equipment]] (to include camouflage [[facepaint]]), canteen cups, and tentage, while still retaining the formal nature of the ceremony.

[[File:Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner]], who attempted to sort the elements in an order which consisted of triads.]]
In the [[history of the periodic table]], '''Dobereiner's triads''' were an early attempt to sort the elements into some logical order by their physical properties. In 1817, a letter reported [[Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner]]'s observations of the alkaline earths; namely, that strontium had properties that were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|pages=331–334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German}}  From pp. 332–333:  ''"In der Gegend von Jena (bei Dornburg) … Schwerspaths seyn möchte."'' (In the area of Jena (near Dornburg) it is known that [[celestine (mineral)|celestine]] has been discovered in large quantities.  This gave Mr. Dobereiner cause to inquire rigorously into the stoichiometric value of strontium oxide by a great series of experiments.  It turned out that it [i.e., the molar weight of strontium oxide] – if that of hydrogen is expressed by 1 or that of oxygen is expressed by the number 7.5 – is equal to 50.  This number is, however, precisely the arithmetic mean of that which denotes the stoichiometric value of calcium oxide (= 27.55) and of that which denotes the stoichiometric value of barium oxide (= 72.5) ; namely (27.5 + 72.5) / 2 = 50.  For a moment, Mr. Dobereiner found himself thereby caused to doubt the independent existence of strontium; however, this withstood both his analytical and synthetic experiments.  Even more noteworthy is the circumstance that the specific weight of strontium sulfide is likewise the arithmetic mean of that of pure (water-free) calcium sulfide and that [i.e., the sulfide] of barium, namely (2.9 + 4.40) / 2 = 3.65 ; which must cause [one] to believe even more that celestine might be a mixture of equal stoichiometric amounts of anhydrite [i.e., anhydrous calcium sulfate] and barite.) &lt;/ref&gt;  By 1829, Dobereiner had found other groups of three elements (hence "triads") whose physical properties were similarly related.&lt;ref name=D1829&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobereiner|first1=J. W.|title=Versuch zu einer Gruppirung der elementaren Stoffe nach ihrer Analogie|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|date=1829|volume=15|pages=301–307|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015065410634;view=1up;seq=315|series=2nd series|trans-title=An attempt to group elementary substances according to their analogies|language=German}}  For an English translation of this article, see:  [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/dobereiner.html Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner: "An Attempt to Group Elementary Substances according to Their Analogies" (Lemoyne College (Syracuse, New York, USA))]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also noted that some quantifiable properties of elements (e.g. atomic weight and density) in a triad followed a trend whereby the value of the middle element in the triad would be exactly or nearly predicted by taking the arithmetic mean of values for that property of the other two elements.

{{More citations needed|date=November 2012}}
{{US fed civ pro}}
The '''''Erie'' doctrine''' is a fundamental [[law|legal]] [[doctrine]] of [[civil procedure in the United States]] which mandates that a [[United States federal court|federal court]] sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction]] (or in general, when hearing state law claims in contexts like [[supplemental jurisdiction]] or adversarial proceedings in bankruptcy) must apply [[State law|state]] [[Substantive law|substantive]] law to resolve claims under state law.

The doctrine follows from the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [[landmark decision]] in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' (1938). The case overturned ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]'', which allowed [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] sitting in a state to ignore the [[common law]] local decisions of [[State court (United States)|state courts]] in the same state, in cases based on [[diversity jurisdiction]].

==Scope==
There are two main objectives of the ''Erie'' decision: (1) to discourage [[forum shopping]] among litigants, and (2) to avoid inequitable administration of the laws.  Broadly speaking, the second objective is sometimes referred to as "vertical uniformity" and is rooted in the idea that in a given state, the outcome of the litigation should not be grossly different just because a litigant filed a claim in a state court rather than a federal court or vice versa.

The ''Erie'' doctrine today applies regardless of how the federal court may hear a state claim.  Whether the federal court encounters a state law issue in diversity jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction, or bankruptcy jurisdiction, the federal court must honor state [[common law]] when deciding state law issues.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, ''[[United Mine Workers v. Gibbs]]'', 383 U.S. 715 (1966) and ''[[Butner v. United States]]'', 440 U.S. 48 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, when the U.S. Constitution does not control and Congress has not legislated (or cannot legislate) on a topic, then the laws of the states necessarily govern and state judge-made rules are equally binding on the federal courts as state statutes.

The federal court must determine if either 1) state law is clear as to the case in controversy, or 2) if not, then has the state's highest court ruled specifically on a similar case.  If so, the state law or court ruling must be followed.  But if not, then the federal court must determine '''''how''''' the state's highest court would potentially rule on a matter: for example, it may look to state appellate courts to see how they ruled, and if the state chose not to hear further appeals, the federal court could determine that the high court agreed with the appellate courts.  The determination is called an '''Erie guess''', though the term "guess" is a misnomer as the federal court must make a reasoned determination in its ruling.

Alternatively though, the court may elect to certify the question to the state's highest court for a ruling on state law in the matter.  Some states, however, do not allow Federal District Courts to certify questions, only the Supreme Court or Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals.

==Origin==
The ''Erie'' case involved a fundamental question of [[federalism]] and the jurisdiction of federal courts in the United States.  In 1789, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a law still in effect today called the [[Rules of Decision Act]] ({{usc|28|1652}}), which states that the laws of a state furnish the rules of decision for a federal court sitting in that state.  Thus, a federal court in [[Texas]], hearing a case based on diversity (as opposed to a federal question), has to follow the laws of the applicable state in resolving a case before it.

===''Swift v. Tyson''===
The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]'' had defined the laws of the state as meaning only laws passed by legislatures of that state (though Justice [[Joseph Story]] writing for the court suggested that federal courts should pay special attention to how the "local tribunals" of a state would resolve a dispute). Thus, on issues of "general common law," a federal court was free to ignore decisions by a state's highest court.

===Aftermath of ''Swift''===
The decision in ''[[Swift v. Tyson|Swift]]'' resulted in inconsistent judicial rulings in the same state on the same legal issue depending on whether a plaintiff brought a case in state or federal court.  In one case, for example, ''[[Black and White Taxicab Co. v. Brown and Yellow Taxicab Co.]]'' 276 U.S. 518 (1928), the Brown and Yellow Cab Company, a [[Kentucky]] [[corporation]], sought to create a business association with the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], where Brown and Yellow would have a monopoly on soliciting passengers of the railroad, effectively eliminating the competition, the Black and White Cab Co.  Such an agreement was illegal under Kentucky [[common law]], as interpreted by Kentucky's highest court.  Brown and Yellow dissolved itself, reincorporated in [[Tennessee]], and executed the agreement there, where such an agreement was legal, bringing suit against Black and White in a Kentucky federal court to prevent them from soliciting passengers.  The federal court upheld the agreement, citing ''Swift'', and arguing that under general federal common law, the agreement was valid.  If Brown and Yellow had brought suit in a Kentucky state court, the agreement would not have been upheld.

==''Erie''==
The decision in ''Erie'' involved a [[railroad]] accident.  The [[plaintiff]], Tompkins, was walking alongside Erie's railroad tracks in [[Pennsylvania]] when a train passed. An open door struck him and knocked him under the train, severing his arm.  In most states, Tompkins could sue for [[negligence]] of the railroad and recover monetary damages for his loss. In Pennsylvania, however, Tompkins would have been considered a [[trespass]]er. He was not to recover for an ordinary negligence claim in the state court of Pennsylvania, because under the law of that state, a claimant had to show "wanton" negligence on part of the Defendant to recover.

Thus, Tompkins brought his case in federal court to avoid the unfavorable state law. He subsequently won. However, on appeal the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held, in an opinion drafted by Justice Brandeis, that such decisions and inconsistent rulings based on a general federal common law were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]], and that decisions by a state supreme court were "laws" that federal courts were bound to follow under the ''Rule of Decision Act''.  Brandeis noted that the Court felt that ''Swift'' allowed federal courts to make unconstitutional modifications of the substantive law of a state. He noted that it violated the right to equal protection under the law, although he did not mean it in the sense of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Court overturned ''Swift'' on its own initiative, since the parties in ''Erie'' did not ask the Court to do so.

==Development==
Several later [[Legal case|cases]] have added to the vague ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins|Erie]]'' decision (Brandeis cited no provision of the Constitution that ''[[Swift v. Tyson|Swift]]'' violated, although theoretically it might have violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment's]] reservation of powers to the state).  Speaking generally, there are two approaches in determining whether a federal court will apply a state law: (1) the ''[[Hanna v. Plumer|Hanna]]'' &amp; [[Rules Enabling Act]] approach, per {{usc|28|2072}} when there is a [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] and [[statute]] that conflicts with a [[state law]]; and (2) the ''Byrd''-''Erie'' approach when there is not a conflict between a state and federal practice.

===''Byrd''-''Erie''===
This approach suggests that unless there is a major countervailing federal policy that trumps the state practice, if ignoring the state law would lead to forum shopping by plaintiffs and unequal administration of the laws (like in ''Yellow Cab'' above), the court should apply the state law. In ''[[Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc.|Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electrical Cooperative, Inc.]]'', the Court decided that the federal policy allocating responsibilities between judge and jury, as embodied in the 7th Amendment of the US Constitution, outweighed the state rule requiring a judge to decide whether an employer was immune from suit. The main goal of the ''Erie'' decision was to prevent "[[forum-shopping]]," a practice where [[plaintiffs]] choose a [[venue (law)|legal forum]] simply because of the probability of a more favorable ruling.  The main problem with the decision is that  sometimes there is simply no state law or practice on which a federal court may defer. Federal judges are left to guess how a state court would rule on a given legal question, and a state court is in no way bound by a federal decision interpreting their own state law.

Justice Frankfurter in ''[[Guaranty Trust Co. v. York]]'', {{ussc|326|99|1945}} summarizes the main point of Erie differently... 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In essence, the intent of that decision was to ensure that, in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court....&lt;/blockquote&gt;   

This suggests that Erie's main goal was to achieve equal protection under the law.  One way that equal protection is intentionally disregarded would be through  "[[forum shopping]],"  but the reduction of inequality was the main target of the doctrine.

===''Hanna''===
Under the approach in ''[[Hanna v. Plumer]]'', the [[United States district court|federal court]] of a [[U.S. state|state]] hearing a case based on [[diversity jurisdiction]] should apply [[state law]] in the event of conflict between state and federal law if the state law deals with substantive rights of state citizens.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has defined substantive rights as, "rights conferred by the law to be protected and enforced by the adjective law of judicial procedure."   An example of a substantive right would be a state law on [[fraud]], which may vary widely in composition depending on the jurisdiction.    If the state law is merely procedural,  or relating merely to the form and mode of judicial operations, then the federal court does not have to apply the conflicting state law.   However, the substance-procedure distinction is a generality as the Court rejected any test based upon "litmus paper criterion."   Thus, a choice between state and federal law must be made with reference to the underlying policy of the ''Erie'' decision.   The Court announced a modification of the "outcome-determinative" test in ''York'',  whereby the test must be applied in light of the twin aims of ''Erie,''  which are the discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.   Under this rule, state procedural law would not supplant federal procedural law if the differences in the outcome are nonsubstantial or trivial,  fail to raise Equal Protection concerns,  and are unlikely to influence the choice of forum.

=== ''Gasperini'' ===
A recent Supreme Court case that addressed the ''Erie'' problem is ''[[Gasperini v. Center for Humanities]]'', {{ussc|518|415|1996}}.  ''Gasperini'' is a post-''Hanna'' decision addressing a conflict between state and federal law for review of jury verdicts. The plaintiff, a well-known artist and photographer from New York, sued a New York museum in federal court in New York, for damages arising from the loss of some photographs and slides he had loaned the museum. A jury found in his favor and awarded damages. The defendant appealed, and the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] reduced the damages award on appeal. Gasperini appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The New York state provision, a [[Tort reform in the United States|"tort reform"]] measure, allowed reviewing appellate courts to overturn a jury verdict if it "deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation."  Pursuant to this law, the Second Circuit applied the state's appellate standard of review. However, the Supreme Court stated that federal courts, bound by the reexamination clause of the [[Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], could overturn a jury's finding of fact only if it "shocked the conscience."

The Supreme Court could have resolved the case by reading the [[Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] broadly, and treating it as controlling in federal court. However, instead, the Court opted for what can be described as a compromise, holding that the federal court should apply the state's lower standard of review, but in a way that would not run afoul of the Seventh Amendment: instead of the federal appeals court reviewing the jury finding, the trial judge would assume the role.

''Gasperini'', and another recent ''Erie''-area case, ''[[Semtek International Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.]]'', have shown ''Erie'' has gone in a newer and even more complicated direction than the previous controlling cases, and that instead of selecting either federal or state law for a case, the federal court may be required to somehow blend federal and state law, depending on the issue. This is quite frustrating for those who wish to have a black-letter rule that will point them to the answer. However, the possibility of blending in ''Erie'' does not open up an infinitude of possibilities. In both ''Gasperini'' and ''Semtek'', the common thread is that the blending is done in a way that is calculated to advance the aims of ''Erie'' (and ''York''): non-discrimination between litigants, and discouragement of [[forum shopping]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan Ides &amp; Christopher May, Civil Procedure, 3d Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9955">'''Fair trade bananas''' are bananas produced in partnership with an [[alternative trade organization]] which focuses on increasing the price paid to small banana growers and the wages of agricultural workers. This is not a commercial brand, but a marketing strategy.  Fair trade is based on higher prices paid by consumers that allow an equitable distribution of gains from trade over the chain partners.&lt;ref&gt;La Cruz, G. "The Contribution of Fair Trade Towards Market Access by Smallholder Banana Producers." Agro-Food Chains and Networks for Development, 14 (2006): 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many of organizations involved in producing fair trade bananas; for example, an organization called Banafair began importing uncertified/unlabeled fair trade bananas into Germany in the mid-1980s (from 500 to 1 000 tonnes annually). In 1997 Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) was established in Bonn, Germany to consolidate various [[Fair trade#Rise of labeling initiatives|labeling initiatives]] and establish worldwide standards for fair trade bananas. The first fair trade labelled bananas imported to Germany were by TransFair in April 1998.

[[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International]], (now renamed Fair Trade International), is a large importer whose bananas bear the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|International FairTrade Certification Mark]]. FLO-CERT is the international body that inspects the farms to ensure they meet the proper social and environmental according to Fair Trade international standards.

==Global banana industry==
Five companies control about 80% of the conventional banana trade.  This situation, plus the intervention of various governments, has kept the price paid to banana growers and wages to workers a small percentage of the supermarket price.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, James. The Banana: Empires, Trade Wars, and Globalization. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Macdara. "Busting Banana Unions In Belize." Multinational Monitor 17.9 (1996): 27. MasterFILE Premier. Web. 11 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this effect are the [[Banana Wars|banana wars]]; the formation of the [[United Fruit Company]] (now Chiquita Brands Intl.); the [[Bananagate]] bribery scandal; military coups to establish and maintain [[banana republics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/clinton11.htm Washingtonpost.com: Clinton: Support for Guatemala Was Wrong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article23211.htm Honduras: Military Coup Engineered By Two US Companies : Information Clearing House - ICH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is ongoing industry conflict with unions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://usleap.org/banana-unions-launch-initiative-against-chiquita Banana Unions Launch Initiative Against Chiquita | USLEAP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/producers/bananas/winfa_2/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair trade certification ==

FLO has different standards for small banana farms and larger banana plantations. To be eligible to display a Fair Trade Certification Mark, small farmers must create a panel of both workers and management to determine the best use of the fair trade premiums.  Revenues to banana farmers must be equally shared between the working members of the cooperative or association.

On larger plantations, the premiums can only be used for improving working and living conditions. Forced labor and labor of children under 16 years of age is prohibited, as is dangerous work.  Young adults 16 years of age or older must not work so many hours that they have no time for education. Workers must be allowed to join a union, and be paid at least regional industry average or minimum wage.

Although fair trade banana workers’ wages are not significantly above industry averages, they receive wage related benefits which increase their overall livelihood. However, many small banana farmers barely make living wages themselves, and the restriction of premiums to community development projects may prevent them from covering basic living expenses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2011/F/Fairtrade%20in%20the%20Banana%20Sector_IDS%20Final%20Report%20December%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair trade price and premium ==

Monetary premiums are paid for fair trade banana growers to improve their communities. In 2013, FairTrade Certified banana producers receive a FairTrade Minimum Premium of $1 US dollar per 18.14 kilogram box of bananas to invest in community projects.  FairTrade farmers are guaranteed a minimum price to help cover the costs of sustainable production, but the price differs between regions and is subject to market fluctuations in the sustainable cost of agricultural production. Although FairTrade minimum prices vary, FairTrade Minimum premiums do not. Both FairTrade prices and premiums are set at the same level for FairTrade certified [[plantation]]s and small farms.

== Environmental impacts ==

The agricultural production of bananas on a large scale often uses more pesticides (and fungicides, fertilizers) than any other fresh fruit commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Koeppel, Dan.Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World. New York: Hudson Street, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Trade banana production promotes sustainable farming practices,&lt;ref&gt;Frundt, HenryJ. November 20–30, 2000. Toward a Hegemonic Resolution in the Banana Trade, International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Apr., 2005), pp. 215-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. "Resistance, Redistribution, and Power in the Fair Trade Banana Initiative." Agriculture and Human Values, 22.1 (2005): 17-29&lt;/ref&gt; but these result in a higher supermarket price which some consumers are willing to pay for ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Thøgersen, J. (2000), "Promoting green consumer behavior with eco-labels", paper presented at National Academy of Sciences/national Research Council Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change, Washington, DC, November 20–30, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strong, C. (1996), "Features contributing to the growth of ethical consumerism: a preliminary investigation", Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning, Vol. 14, pp. 5-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahé, Thuriane. "Are Stated Preferences Confirmed by Purchasing Behaviours? the Case of Fair Trade-certified Bananas in Switzerland." Journal of Business Ethics, 92.Suppl 2 (2010): 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and discussion==
Because the banana trade is a large world-wide business, a number of studies have been carried out on various aspects of the fair trade banana market, including political ecology,&lt;ref&gt;GROSSMAN, LS. "The Political Ecology of Banana Exports and Local Food-production in St-vincent, Eastern Caribbean." Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 83.2 (1993): 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt; tariffs and quotas,&lt;ref&gt;Desombre, http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol4_1/desombre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; price competition,&lt;ref&gt;Moberg, M. "Fair Trade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-globalization Movement." Human Organization, 64.1 (2005): 4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; organic growing,&lt;ref&gt;Vagneron, I, and S Roquigny. "Value Distribution in Conventional, Organic and Fair Trade Banana Chains in the Dominican Republic." Canadian Journal of Development Studies-revue Canadienne D Etudes Du Developpement, 32.3 (2011): 324-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and retail price wars.&lt;ref&gt;Torgerson, AM. "Fair Trade Banana Production in the Windward Islands: Local Survival and Global Resistance." Agriculture and Human Values, 27.4 (2010): 475-487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/11/banana-price-war-supermarkets UK supermarkets warned over banana price war | Environment | The Observer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair trade certification programs have been criticized on several grounds. Griffiths has challenged the ethics of fair trade labels in the [[fair trade debate]], and, in the Journal of Business Ethics, has pointed out instances in which negative research is not published and academics  choose only successful coops or fair trade organizations for study.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Dominican Republic, Shreck found minimum pricing,&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. (2002b) Just bananas? A Fair Trade alternative for small-scale producers in the Dominican Republic. PhD Dissertation, Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt; and exclusivity of certification worsened socioeconomic disparity within farming communities, and limited access for non-certified farmers to the market.&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. "Just bananas? Fair Trade banana production in the Dominican Republic." International Journal of Sociology of Agriculture and Food, 10 (2002) 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Shrek found that the standards of certification programs prioritized market interests over farmer rights and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrek|first=Aimee|title=What Organic and Fair Trade Labels do not tell us: Towards a place based understanding of certification|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank has argued that fair trade initiatives do not generally foster an empowering partnership between consumers and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, D. (2003) Where are the workers in consumer-worker alliances? Class dynamics and the history of consumer- labor campaigns. Politics and Society, 31, 363–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Media Theorist [[Lisa Nakamura]] notes that "[as] women of color acquire an increasing presence online, their particular interests which spring directly from gender and racial identifications, that is to say, those identities associated with a physical body off-line, are being addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. “Cybertyping and the Work of Race in the Age of Digital Reproduction.” New Media, Old Media. Eds. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Thomas Keenan. Routledge: New York, 2006.p321&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Science, technology and society|Science and Technology Studies]] professor [[Donna Haraway]] has also pioneered specifically feminist approaches to the study of digital humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Wajcman, Judy. “Addressing Technological Change: The Challenge to Social Theory.” Society, Ethics and Technology. Eds. Morton E. Winston and Ralph D. Edelbach. Cengage Learning: 2011. Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

This intervention is notably crystallized in the work of [[FemTechNet]], "an activated network of scholars, artists, and students who work on, with, and at the borders of technology, science and feminism in a variety of fields including STS, Media and Visual Studies, Art, Women’s, Queer, and Ethnic Studies".&lt;ref&gt;http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/directories/&lt;/ref&gt; FemTechNet has collaborated on a number of projects that reflect the aims of Feminist Digital Humanities, including Wikistorming, DOCC: Distributed Open Collaborative Course, and video dialogues. Their methods emphasize distribution through networks to connect diverse institutions, nations, and fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/docc2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors of Digital Humanities, Bethany Nowviskie and Miriam Posner have blogged about the structures in place that have kept women from engaging in digital humanities. There have been efforts to increase the racial representations within the field as well. These feminist digital humanities projects include #transformDH, That Camp Theory, [[Critical code studies|Critical Code Studies]], and [[Crunk Feminist Collective]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Bailey| first= Moya Z.|title=All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave| journal=Journal of Digital Humanities| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Girls Code]] is a project that has recently garnered attention, with founder [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]] receiving a Standing O-vation presented by Toyota and [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Shumaker | first=Laura|title= "Oprah gives San Francisco’s Kimberly Bryant a Standing O-vation"| journal=SFGate| year=2014|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2014/11/17/oprah-gives-san-franciscos-kimberly-bryant-a-standing-o-vation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archiving==
One goal of feminist literary scholars has been to increase the scope of women's literary works in visible archives. [http://orlando.cambridge.org/ The Orlando Project] and [[Women Writers Project|The Women Writers Project]] are two early projects that undertook the task of filling in the gaps that existed in literary history in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities"&gt;{{cite article|last=Wernimont | first=Jacqueline |title=Whence Feminism? Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives | journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly | publisher=The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations |year=2013 |url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000156/000156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both efforts sought to use the electronic format "to overcome the problems of inaccessibility and scarcity which had rendered women’s writing invisible for so long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwp.brown.edu/about/history/|title=WWP has moved|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities" /&gt;
One critique of a content-oriented approach to combating the marginalization of women's literary works is that it's simply not enough to add content to a system that is built upon a patriarchal methodology. "Literary scholars who depend on archival or rare book materials still confront, whether they acknowledge it or not, the legacy of an institutional form through which patriarchal power exercised the authority to determine value, classification, and access."&lt;ref name="Dig. Humanities" /&gt;

[[File:Wrapped fruit basket.jpg|thumb|250px|A standard gift basket]]
A '''gift basket''', or '''fruit basket''' is typically a [[gift]] delivered to the recipient at their home or workplace. A variety of gift baskets exist: some contain [[fruit]]; while others might contain dry or canned foods such as [[tea]], [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[jam]]; or the basket might include a combination of fruit and dried good items. Gourmet gift baskets typically include exotic fruit, and often include quality [[cheese]] and [[wine]], as well as other nonfood items. Gift baskets are often sent for special occasions—such as holidays—or as a thank-you or congratulations gift.&lt;ref name="ConsumerReports"&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Gift Baskets for the Holidays|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/11/best-gift-baskets-for-the-holidays/index.htm|accessdate=23 October 2016|work=Consumer Reports|date=15 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Applegate|first1=Jane|title=Gift basket business is full of opportunity Low starter costs, big demand make it growth industry|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-08-17/business/1992230097_1_basket-business-basket-industry-gift-basket-review|accessdate=23 October 2016|work=Baltimore Sun|date=17 August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fruit bouquet==
[[File:Fruit bouquet.jpg|thumb|Fruit bouquet from [[Edible Arrangements]].]]
{{refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
A '''fruit bouquet''' is a fruit arrangement in the form of [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]]. The fruit is cut in the shape of [[flowers]] and leaves, and is arranged in the container with the help of sticks. A complete arrangement looks like a bouquet of flowers. Typically, a fruit bouquet is delivered to the recipient at their home or workplace.

Often these bouquets will be made to suit the recipients' needs, such as [[diabetic]], [[vegan]], [[vegetarian]], [[gluten intolerance]] or wheat intolerance. Common fruit bouquet items include [[apple]]s, [[Globe artichoke|artichoke]]s, [[avocado]]s, [[banana]]s, [[cheese]]s, [[grape]]s, [[lychee]]s, [[mango]]es, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[papaya]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], and [[Chocolate]]s.

* The three periods are significant to Mahayana adherents, particularly those who hold the [[Lotus Sutra]] in high regard; e.g., [[Tiantai]] ([[Tendai]]) and [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]] Buddhists, who believe that different Buddhist teachings are valid (i.e., able to lead practitioners to enlightenment) in each period due to the different ''capacity to accept a teaching'' (機根 Cn: ''jīgēn''; Jp: ''kikon'') of the people born in each respective period.
* The three periods are further divided into [[#Five five-hundred year periods|five five-hundred year periods]] (五五百歳 Cn: ''wǔ wǔbǎi suì''; Jp: ''go no gohyaku sai''), the fifth and last of which was prophesied to be when the Buddhism of Sakyamuni would lose all power of salvation and a new Buddha would appear to save the people. This time period would be characterized by unrest, strife, famine, and other, natural disasters.
* The three periods and the five five-hundred year periods are described in the Sutra of the Great Assembly (大集経 Cn: ''dàjí jīng''; Jp: ''Daishutu-kyō'', ''Daijuku-kyō'', ''Daijikkyō'', or ''Daishukkyō''). Descriptions of the three periods also appear in other sutras, some of which ascribe different lengths of time to them (although all agree that [[#Mappo|Mappō]] will last for 10,000 years).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32909">'''Habitat destruction''' is the process by which natural [[habitat]] is rendered incapable of supporting its native species. In this process, the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed, reducing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euram     eri                 ca | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 | bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting [[natural resources]] for industrial production and [[urbanization]]. Clearing habitats for [[agriculture]] is the principal cause of habitat destruction. Other important causes of habitat destruction include [[mining]], [[logging]], [[trawling]], and [[urban sprawl]]. Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species [[extinction]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Pimm &amp; Raven, 2000, pp. 843-845&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by [[habitat fragmentation]], geological processes, [[climate change]]&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; or by human activities such as the introduction of [[invasive species]], ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.

The terms '''habitat loss''' and '''habitat reduction''' are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as [[water pollution|water]] and [[noise pollution]].

==Impacts on organisms==
In the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced [[carrying capacity]] so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes &amp; Biggs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Barbault &amp; Sastrapradja, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Temple (1986) found that 82% of [[Endangered species|endangered bird species]] were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beebee|first1=Trevor J.C.|last2=Griffiths|first2=Richard A.|title=The amphibian decline crisis: A watershed for conservation biology?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=31 May 2005|volume=125|issue=3|page=271|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705001825}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Jang|first2=Yikweon|title=Description of a seminatural habitat of the endangered Suweon treefrog Hyla suweonensis|journal=Animal Cells and Systems|date=28 April 2015|volume=19|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[endemism|Endemic]] organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]]. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of [[infertile]] youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's [[giant panda]], once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread [[deforestation]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-sichuan-panda-deforestation-habitat-mountain-conservation|title=The Panda's Forest: Biodiversity Loss|date=24 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bolivia-Deforestation-EO.JPG|thumb|right|Satellite photograph of [[deforestation in Bolivia]]. Originally dry tropical forest, the land is being cleared for [[soybean]] cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Tierras Bajas Deforestation, Bolivia

  | publisher = [[NASA Earth Observatory]]
  | date = 2001-04-16

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Biodiversity hotspot]]s are chiefly [[tropical]] regions that feature high concentrations of [[Endemism|endemic]] species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world’s [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] species.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"&gt;Cincotta &amp; Engelman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction.
Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include [[New Zealand]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Primack"&gt;Primack, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; South and East Asia — especially [[China]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and Japan — and many areas in [[West Africa]] have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated [[coast]]al cities also face degradation of their [[coral reef]]s or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its associated [[island]]s.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Regions of un[[sustainable agriculture]] or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction.  [[Central America]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and the [[Amazonian tropical rainforest]] areas of [[South America]] are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction.  In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the [[Eastern United States|East]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Stein et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

==Ecosystems==
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico]]
[[Tropical rainforest]]s have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The current rate of [[deforestation]] is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.&lt;ref name="Laurance"&gt;Laurance, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forest [[ecosystem]]s have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical [[rainforest]]s.  [[Farming]] and [[logging]] have severely disturbed at least 94% of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forests]]; many [[old growth forest]] stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical deciduous dry forests]] are easier to [[Slash and burn|clear and burn]] and are more suitable for agriculture and [[cattle ranching]] than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast]] and less than 8% in [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|Madagascar]] remain from their original extents.&lt;ref name="Laurance"/&gt;

[[File:Farmland-batang bungo.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers near newly cleared land within Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat ([[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]), [[Sumatra]].]]
Plains and [[desert]] areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's [[drylands]], which include [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]], [[Scrubland|scrub]], and [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]], have been somewhat degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman &amp; Pyke, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The [[tallgrass prairie]]s of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;White et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wetland]]s and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenga et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused [[soil erosion]], [[coastal flooding]], and loss of quality in the UK [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=535|title=United Kingdom: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology|date=2015-06-08|website=AZoCleantech.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Burke et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by [[overfishing]], pollution, and [[invasive species]]; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"&gt;MEA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, over 35% of the [[Coastal ecosystems|mangrove ecosystems]] worldwide have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Natural causes==
Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, [[fire]], and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Human causes==
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|Deforestation and roads in Amazonia, the [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Habitat destruction caused by humans includes [[land conversion]] from forests, etc. to [[arable land]], [[urban sprawl]], [[Public works|infrastructure development]], and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and [[pollution]] are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. [[Desertification]], [[deforestation]], and [[Coral bleaching|coral reef degradation]] are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ([[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[coral reef]]s).

Geist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of [[agricultural expansion]] (96%), [[infrastructure expansion]] (72%), and [[wood extraction]] (67%). Therefore, according to this study, [[forest conversion]] to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), [[permanent cultivation]] (48%), [[cattle ranching]] (46%), shifting ([[slash and burn]]) cultivation (41%), [[subsistence agriculture]] (40%), and [[fuel wood]] extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that [[shifting cultivation]] is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the [[Road construction|construction of new roads]]) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;

=== Global warming ===
Rising global temperatures, caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the [[polar bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Predicting 21st-century polar bear habitat distribution from global climate models|url=|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1890/07-2089.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting [[ice cap]]s promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Jason D.|last2=Littnan|first2=Charles L.|last3=Johnston|first3=David W.|date=2006-05-24|title=Potential effects of sea level rise on the terrestrial habitats of endangered and endemic megafauna in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v2/p21-30/|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=2|pages=21–30|doi=10.3354/esr002021|issn=1863-5407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=H.|last2=Jones|first2=R.|last3=Park|first3=R.|last4=Clough|first4=J.|last5=Herrod-Julius|first5=S.|last6=Harrington|first6=B.|last7=Page|first7=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Global Climate Change and Sea Level Rise: Potential Losses of Intertidal Habitat for Shorebirds|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1675/1524-4695%282002%29025%5B0173%3AGCCASL%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Waterbirds|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–183|doi=10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0173:GCCASL]2.0.CO;2|issn=1524-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers==
[[File:Crowded Nanjing Road in Shanghai.jpeg|thumb|Nanjing Road in Shanghai]]
While the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat.  The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as ''drivers'' of habitat destruction.  [[Demographic]], economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

Demographic drivers include the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]; rate of [[Population growth|population increase]] over time; [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of people in a given area ([[List of urban areas by population|urban]] versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;  Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to [[biodiversity hotspots]].&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of [[threatened species]] across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;McKee et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making [[conservation biology|conservation efforts]] not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.&lt;ref name="Geist"&gt;Geist &amp; Lambin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%).  The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%).  Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%).  The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices.  Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%).  Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density—a result of the first factor—in those areas (25%).

There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts with—and leads to—the establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;  Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.

==Impact on human population==
[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|The draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the Gulf Coast contributed to severe flooding in New Orleans, Louisiana in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Habitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to [[natural disaster]]s like [[flood]] and [[drought]], [[crop failure]], [[spread of disease]], and [[water contamination]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.

Agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via [[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[Soil compaction|compaction]], [[Natural resource#Depletion|nutrient depletion]], [[pollution]], and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as [[birdwatching]], recreational uses like [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and [[ecotourism]] usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.

Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable [[ecosystem services]]. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and [[carbon cycle]]s, which has increased the frequency and severity of [[acid rain]], [[algal bloom]]s, and [[fish kill]]s in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is [[Climate|climate regulation]]. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, [[Transpiration|plant transpiration]] recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere by [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestering carbon dioxide]] through [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include [[watershed management]], [[nitrogen fixation]], oxygen production, [[pollination]] (see [[pollinator decline]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|year=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063421|pmc=3661593|title=Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation|author1=Benoît Geslin|author2=Benoit Gauzens|author3=Elisa Thébault|author4=Isabelle Dajoz|pmid=23717421|page=e63421|bibcode=2013PLoSO...863421G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[waste treatment]] (i.e., the [[Decomposition|breaking down]] and immobilization of [[toxic]] pollutants), and [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] of [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth’s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing [[carbon dioxide]] levels is one of the main contributors to global [[climate change]].

The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of [[fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.

Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Outlook==
The [[Human overpopulation|rapid expansion of the global human population]] is increasing the world’s food requirement substantially. Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food. In fact, as the world’s population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Tilman"&gt;Tilman et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The impending global [[food crisis]] will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more [[fertilizer]]s and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, [[environmental degradation|degradation]], or [[pollution]]. Any efforts to protect the world’s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans’ growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.&lt;ref name="Tilman"/&gt;

==Solutions==
[[File:Hawaii turtle.JPG|thumb|''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' on a Hawaiian coral reef. Although the endangered species is protected, habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of [[green turtle]] nesting beaches.]]
In most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This concept, along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes. In a broader sense, governmental bodies at a local, national, and international scale need to emphasize the following:

#Considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats.
#Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat.
#Educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity.
#Developing [[family planning]] programs in areas of rapid population growth.
#Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production.
#Preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats.
#Reducing [[human population]] and expansion. Apart from improving access to contraception globally, furthering gender equality also has a great benefit. When women have the same education (decision-making power), this generally leads to smaller families.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15468">'''Hiraṇyagarbha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिरण्यगर्भः ; literally the 'golden womb' or 'golden egg', poetically translated as 'universal germ') is the source of the creation of [[universe]] or the manifested [[cosmos]] in [[Vedic philosophy]], as well as an avatar of Vishnu in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266775/Hiranyagarbha Hiranyagarbha] [[britannica.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; It finds mention in one hymn of the [[Rigveda]] ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].121), known as the '''Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta''', suggesting a single creator deity (verse 8: ''{{IAST|yo deveṣv ādhi devā eka āsīt}}'', Griffith: "He is the God of gods, and none beside him."), identified in the hymn as [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]. The concept of the "golden womb" is again mentioned in the [[Vishvakarman]] Sūkta (RV 10.82).

The [[Upanishads|Upanishad]] calls it the Soul of the Universe or [[Brahman]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of the Upanishads'', by Paul Deussen, Alfred Shenington Geden. Published by T. &amp; T. Clark, 1906. ''Page 198''.&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborates that Hiraṇyagarbha floated around in emptiness and the darkness of the non-existence for about a year, and then broke into two halves which formed the ''[[Svarga]]'' and the ''[[Prithvi|Pṛthvi]]''.

In classical [[Puranic|Purāṇic]] Hinduism, Hiraṇyagarbha is the term used in the Vedanta for the "creator". Hiraṇyagarbha is also [[Brahma|Brahmā]], so called because he was born from a golden egg ([[Manusmrti|Manu Smṛti]] 1.9), while the [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] calls it the Manifest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c002.htm The Mahābhārata, Book 12: Santi Parva. Kisari Mohan Ganguli, tr. ''Section CCCIII''] ''[[The Mahabharata]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiraṇyagarbha is also a sacrifice, where it is known as Hiraṇyagarbha Yagna. This sacrifice was performed by the founder of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], [[Dantidurga]], to confer Kshatriyahood on himself, as he was not born a [[Kshatriya]] but wanted to overthrow his [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] overlord to set up the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] empire, and in olden days, the [[Caste System in India]] was very prevalent and he was not accepted by the people as their King, until he conferred Kshatriyahood upon himself.

Some classical yoga traditions consider Hiraṇyagarbha as the originator of [[yoga]], though this may also be a name for Rishi [[Kapila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feuerstein |first= Georg |title= The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |year= 2001 |publisher=  Hohm Press|location= Arizona, USA |isbn= 978-1890772185 |page= Kindle Locations 7299–7300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Aranya |first= Swami Hariharananda |authorlink= Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title= Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year= 2000 |publisher= University of Calcutta |location= Calcutta, India |isbn= 81-87594-00-4|page=xxiii-xxiv | chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
[[Matsya Purana|Matsya Purāṇa]] (2.25-30) gives an account of initial creation. After [[Mahapralaya|Mahāprālaya]], the great dissolution of the Universe, there was darkness everywhere. Everything was in a state of sleep. There was nothing, either moving or static. Then [[Svayambhu]], self-manifested Being arose, which is a form beyond senses. It created the primordial waters first and established the seed of creation into it. The seed turned into a golden womb, Hiraṇyagarbha. Then [[Svayambhu]] entered in the egg.

The [[Narayana sukta|Nārāyaṇa Sūkta]] exclaims that everything that is, visible or invisible, all this is pervaded by [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] within and without.

The [[Ishavasya Upanishad|Īśvara Upaniṣad]] says that the universe is pervaded by [[Ishvara|Īśvara]] (God), who is both within and without it. He is the moving and the unmoving, He is far and near, He is within all these and without all these.

The [[Vedanta Sutra|Vedānta Sūtra]] further states that Brahman is That from Whom this Universe proceeds, in Whom it subsists, and to Whom, in the end, it returns.

The [[Samkhya|Saṃkhya]] school holds that there are only two primary principles, [[Purusha|Puruṣa]] and [[Prakriti|Prākṛti]], and creation is only a manifestation or evolution of the constituents of [[Prakriti|Prākṛti]] due to the action of [[Purusha|Puruṣa]]'s Consciousness.

The [[Bhagavata]] states that [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] alone was in the beginning, who was the pious of principles of creation, sustenance, and dissolution (also known as the Hindu Trinity of [[Brahma|Brahmā]], [[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]] and [[Shiva]]) - the Supreme [[Hari]], multi-headed, multi-eyed, multi-footed, multi-armed, multi-limbed. This was the Supreme Seed of all creation, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, and more magnificent than even the best of all things, more powerful, than even the wind and all the gods, more resplendent than the Sun and the Moon, and more internal than even the mind and the intellect. He is the Creator, the Supreme. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to be considered as the womb of all objects.

==Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta==

The Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta of the [[Rigveda]] declares that God manifested Himself in the beginning as the Creator of the Universe, encompassing all things, including everything within Himself, the collective totality, as it were, of the whole of creation, animating it as the Supreme Intelligence.

===Translation in English===
In the beginning was the Divinity in his [[:wikt:splendour|splendour]], manifested as the sole Lord of land, skies, water, space and that beneath and He upheld the earth and the heavens.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who bestows soul-force and vigor, whose guidance all men invoke, the Devas invoke whose shadow is immortal life and death.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who by His greatness became the One King of the breathing and the seeing, who is the Lord of man and bird and beast.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that through whose glory the snow-clad mountains rose, and the ocean spread with the river, they say. His arms are the quarters of the sky.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings ?

It is that through whom the heaven is strong and the earth firm, who has steadied the light and the sky's vault, and measured out the sphere of clouds in the mid-region.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offering?

It is that to whom heaven and earth, placed in the light by his grace, look up, radiant with the mind while over them the sun, rising, brightly shines.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

When the mighty waters came, carrying the universal germ, producing the flame of life, then dwelt there in harmony the One Spirit of the Devas.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who in its might surveyed the waters, conferring skill and creating worship - That, the God of gods, the One and only One.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

Mother of the world - may that not destroy us who with Truth as his Law made the heavens and produced waters, vast and beautiful.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

Lord of creation! No one other than thee pervades all these that have come into being.

May that be ours, for which our prayers rise, may we be masters of many treasures!

-- ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]]:121)   '''[[Ralph T. H. Griffith]]
'''


1. HIRANYAGARBHA was present at the beginning ;
when born, he was the sole lord of created beings; he
upheld this earth and heaven,

-let us offer worship with
an oblation to the divine KA.

2. (To him) who is the giver of soul, the giver of strength,
Whose commands all (beings), even the gods obey, Whose
shadow is immortality, whose (shadow) is death,

3. (To him) who, by his greatness, has verily become
the sole king of the breathing and seeing world, who rules
over this aggregate of two-footed and four-footed beings,-

let us offer Worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

4. Through whose greatness these snow-clad (moun-
tains exist), whose property men call the ocean with the
rivers, whose are these quarters of space, whose are the
two arms,

tection, and, shining brightly, regarded with their mind,
in whom the risen sun shines forth,

7. When the vast waters overspread the universe
containing the germ and giving birth to AGNI, then was
produced the one breath of the gods,

-let us offer worship
with an oblation to the divine KA.

8. He who by his might beheld the waters all around
containing the creative power and giving birth to sacrifice,
he who among the gods was the one supreme god,-

let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

9. May he do us no harm who is the parent of the
-earth, or who the unerring support (of the world) begat
the heaven, and who generated the vast and delightful
waters,

-let us offer worship with an oblation to the

{{distinguish|Infallibility}}
'''Ineffability''' is concerned with [[idea]]s that cannot or should not be expressed in spoken words (or language in general), often being in the form of a [[taboo]] or incomprehensible term. This property is commonly associated with [[philosophy]], [[ontology|aspects of existence]], and similar concepts that are inherently "too great", complex or abstract to be communicated adequately. A typical example is the name of [[God in Judaism]], written as [[YHWH]] but substituted with "the Lord" or "[[HaShem]]" (the name) when reading.

In addition, [[logic|illogical]] statements, principles, reasons and arguments may be considered intrinsically ineffable along with [[Logical possibility|impossibilities]], contradictions and paradoxes. Terminology describing the nature of [[experience]] cannot be conveyed properly in dualistic [[symbol]]ic language; it is believed that this knowledge is only held by the individual from which it originates. [[Profanity]] and [[vulgarism]]s can easily and clearly be stated, but by those who believe they should not be said, they are considered ineffable. Thus, one method of describing something that is ineffable is by using [[apophasis]], i.e. describing what it is ''not'', rather than what it ''is''. The architect Le Corbusier described his design for the interior of the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamp as ''L'espace indicible'' translated to mean 'ineffable space', a spiritual experience which was difficult to describe.

{{Communication}}
[[File:Two people talking.tiff|thumb|Two people talking]]

'''Interaction''' is a kind of [[action (physics)|action]] that occur as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way [[Causality|causal]] effect. A closely related term is [[interconnectivity]], which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. ''Interaction'' has different tailored meanings in various [[science]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Changes can also involve interaction.

Casual examples of interaction outside science include:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Communication of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each other, or communication among [[Group (sociology)|groups]], organizations, nations or states: trade, migration, [[International relations|foreign relations]], transportation.
* The [[feedback]] during the operation of a machine such as a computer or tool, for example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this information returns to the driver.

== Physics ==
{{main|Force|Fundamental interaction}}

In [[physics]], a fundamental interaction (depending on the nature of the interaction, it might also be called a fundamental force) is a process by which [[elementary particle]]s interact with each other. An interaction is often described as a physical [[quantum field theory|field]], and is mediated by the exchange of [[gauge boson]]s between particles. For example, the interaction of [[electric charge|charged]] particles takes place through the mediation of [[electromagnetic field]]s, whereas [[beta decay]] occurs by means of the [[weak interaction]]. An interaction is fundamental when it cannot be described in terms of other interactions.  There are four known fundamental interactions in nature: The  [[quantum electrodynamics|electromagnetic]],  [[Strong nuclear force|strong]], [[Weak interaction|weak]] and  [[general relativity|gravitational]] interactions. The weak and electromagnetic interactions are unified in  [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], which is unified with the strong force in the [[standard model]].

=== Biochemistry ===

====Molecular biology====
{{Main|List of protein interactions|Interactome}}
In [[molecular biology]], the knowledge on [[gene]]/[[protein]] interaction among themselves and with their [[metabolite]]s is referred to as [[molecular pathway]]s.

==== Medicine and pharmacology ====
{{main|Drug interaction}}
{{also|Poly drug use#Dangerous interactions}}

In [[medicine]], most [[medication]]s can be safely used with other medicines, but particular combinations of medicines need to be monitored for interactions, often by the pharmacist. Interactions between medications fall generally into one of two main categories:
# [[pharmacodynamic]] : Involving the actions of the two interacting drugs.
# [[pharmacokinetic]] : Involving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or both of the interacting drugs upon the other.

In terms of [[efficacy]], there can be three types of interactions between medications: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic.
* Additive interaction means the effect of two chemicals is equal to the sum of the effect of the two chemicals taken separately. This is usually due to the two chemicals acting on the body via same or similar mechanism. Examples are [[aspirin]] and [[motrin]], [[alcohol]] and [[depressant]], [[tranquilizer]] and [[painkiller]].
* [[Synergistic]] interaction means that the effect of two chemicals taken together is greater than the sum of their separate effect at the same doses. An example is [[pesticide]] and [[fertilizer]]; the biological effect is devastating.
* [[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonistic interaction]] means that the effect of two chemicals is actually less than the sum of the effect of the two drugs taken independently of each other. This is because the second chemical increases the excretion of the first, or even directly blocks its toxic actions. Antagonism forms the basis for [[antidote]]s of poisonings.

==Biology and genetics==
{{Main|Biological interaction|Gene–environment interaction|Cell–cell interaction}}
[[Geneticist]]s work with a number of different genetic interaction modes to characterize how the combination of two [[mutation]]s affect (or does not affect) the [[phenotype]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

noninteractive, synthetic, asynthetic, suppressive, epistatic, conditional, additive, single-nonmonotonic and double-nonmonotonic.
Further characterizations is enhancement interaction and nonadditive interaction. [[Biosemiotic]]ists investigate sign-mediated interactions within and between organisms that underlie syntactic, pragmatic and semantic rules.

The word [[epistasis]] is also used for genetic interaction in some contexts.

== Communications ==
{{main|Interactivity}}

== Sociology ==
{{main|Social interaction}}

In [[sociology]], [[social interaction]] is a dynamic, changing sequence of [[social action]]s between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions due to the actions by their interaction partner(s). Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular, and regulated. Social interactions form the basis of [[social relation]]s.

== Statistics ==
{{main|Interaction (statistics)}}

In [[statistics]], an '''interaction''' is a term in a [[statistical model]] in which the effect of two, or more, variables is not simply additive.

=== An example from statistics applied to health science ===
If we were examining the effect of two variables, gender and [[premature birth]], on health outcomes, we would describe any difference in health outcome scores between genders as a [[main effect]]. Similarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as a main effect. The presence of an interaction effect implies that the effect of gender on health outcome varies as a function of premature birth status.

== Computers ==
{{main|Human–computer interaction}}
{{see also|Interaction cost|Interactive computation|Interface (computing)}}

== Media art==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Electronic learning]] --&gt;
In [[Mass media|media]], [[interactivity]] is a feature of the media in question and as digital technology becomes more accessible to the masses interest in interactivity is increasing and becoming a cultural trend especially in the arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''Interception Modernisation Programme''' (IMP) is a [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] initiative to extend the government's capabilities for [[lawful interception]] and storage of [[communications data]]. It has been widely reported that the IMP's eventual goal is to store details of all UK communications data in a central database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/07/detica_interception_modernisation/ Spy chiefs plot £12bn IT spree for comms überdatabase]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal is similar to the NSA Call Database ([[MAINWAY]]) established by [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]'s American counterpart NSA and the [[Titan traffic database]] established by the Swedish [[National Defence Radio Establishment]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2008 plans were being made to collect data on all [[Telephone call|phone calls]], [[email]]s, [[Chat room|chatroom discussions]] and [[World Wide Web|web-browsing]] habits as part of the IMP, thought likely to require the insertion of 'thousands' of [[black box]] probes into the country’s computer and telephone networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There’s no hiding place as spy HQ plans to see all |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4882622.ece |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=October 5, 2008 |accessdate=2009-02-08  | location=London | first=David | last=Leppard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals were expected to be included in the [[Communications Data Bill 2008]]. The "giant database" would include telephone numbers dialed, the websites visited and addresses to which e-mails are sent "but not the content of e-mails or telephone conversations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Concern over giant database idea  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7671046.stm |quote=The government's terror watchdog has expressed concern about proposals for a giant database to store details of all phone calls, e-mails and internet use. |work=[[BBC]] |date=October 15, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Huhne]], the [[Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman|Liberal Democrat Home affairs spokesman]] said: "The government's [[Orwellian]] plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giant database plan 'Orwellian'  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7671046.stm |quote=Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said: "The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying." "I hope that this consultation is not just a sham exercise to soft-soap an unsuspecting public."  |work=[[BBC]] |date=October 15, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Home Office]] denied reports that a prototype of the IMP had already been built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/home-office-denies-prototype-intercept-database-4010012526/ Home Office denies prototype intercept database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports in April 2009 suggest that the government has changed its public stance to one of using legal measures to compel communications providers to store the data themselves, and making it available for government to access, with then [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] stating that "there are absolutely no plans for a single central store."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/legal-and-constitutional/home-office-rules-out-telephone-surveillance-database-$1291053.htm|title=Home Office rules out telephone surveillance database|publisher=politics.co.uk|author=Ian Dunt|date=27 Apr 2009|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new plans are thought to involve spending £2bn on paying [[Internet service provider|ISP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to install [[deep packet inspection]] equipment within their own networks, and obliging them to perform the cross-correlation and profiling of their users' behaviour themselves,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/27/imp_consultation/ UK.gov to spend £2bn on ISP tracking]&lt;/ref&gt; in effect achieving the original goals of the IMP by different means.

A detailed analysis was published by the Policy Engagement Network of the [[London School of Economics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/informationSystems/research/policyEngagement/IMP_Briefing.pdf LSE IMP Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 June 2009.  The All Party Privacy Group held a hearing on IMP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacyappg.org.uk/Documents/imp_enquiry_agenda.pdf APPG IMP Hearing Agenda 1 July 2009]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's new coalition government has apparently revived the IMP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/10/programme-intercept-government A u-turn on reversing the surveillance state]&lt;/ref&gt; in their recent Strategic Defence and Security Review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/News-Stories/2010/Strategic-Defence-and-Security-Review/ Strategic Defence and Security Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611153343/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/News-Stories/2010/Strategic-Defence-and-Security-Review/ |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version of the IMP is known as the [[Communications Capabilities Development Programme]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-2012-02-20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/security/372985/anger-over-mass-web-surveillance-plans|title=Anger over mass web surveillance plans|author=Stewart Mitchell|publisher=PC Pro|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jesse Ernest Wilkins Sr.''' (February 1, 1894 – January 19, 1959)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tHU8AAAAIAAJ ''Chicago Bar Record, Vol. 41'',]&lt;/ref&gt; was a U.S. [[lawyer]], [[Trade union|labor leader]], [[Undersecretary#United States|undersecretary]] in the [[Eisenhower administration]] and both the first [[African-American]] to be appointed to a sub-cabinet position in the United States Government and the first to attend [[White House]] [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet-level meetings]].&lt;ref name="Time1954Aug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time1959Feb" /&gt;

After a public falling-out with the president and his administration, Wilkins was dismissed from his post by Eisenhower, and then went on to join the U.S. [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|Civil Rights Commission]] in 1958.

==Education and early career==
[[File:JE Wilkins Sr.jpg|thumb|J.E. Wilkins, 1918]]
Wilkins studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Illinois]] and then attended the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in the 1920s, becoming one of its first-ever black graduates. He graduated with a [[PhD]] at age 20, a member of its [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] and then practiced law locally for several years.&lt;ref name="SLL"&gt;Lawrence-Lightfoot, Sara, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgo_k8cvJukC Respect], Da Capo Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7382-0318-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7382-0318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public service ==
In 1954, Wilkins was appointed by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs|Undersecretary of Labor for International Labor Affairs]] (UL-ILA),&lt;ref name="Time1954Aug" /&gt; thus becoming the first black to attend [[United States Cabinet|White House cabinet level meetings]] in the absence of his superior, [[Labor Secretary]] [[James P. Mitchell|James Mitchell]].&lt;ref name="Time1954Aug"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891038,00.html "To the White House",] ''Time'', August 30, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Perret|Perret, Geoffrey]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLPJOb9n95oC Eisenhower], Adams Media, 2000, {{ISBN|1-58062-431-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58062-431-2}};&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins had previously served the Eisenhower administration as acting chairman of the ''President's Committee on Government Contracts'' at the request of Val Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Mjagkij, Nina, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUo-zGOurF8C ''Portraits of African American life since 1865''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8420-2967-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8420-2967-4}};&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mjagkij2"&gt;Mjagkij, Nina, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ymp8BOBzACYC ''Organizing Black America: an encyclopedia of African American associations''], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8153-2309-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-2309-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure with the administration he was a member of ''Equality Committee'', working with Frederic Murrow, Val Washington, Joseph Douglas, [[James Nabrit Jr.]] and [[Samuel Pierce]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Weems &amp; Lewis Randolph, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ycb0K1owawC Business in Black and White: American Presidents and Black Entrepreneurs in the Twentieth Century], NYU Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8147-7517-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-7517-2}};&lt;/ref&gt; Still earlier he had been a member of Eisenhower's President's Committee on Governmental Employment Policy (PCGEP) board when he was with the Labor Department.&lt;ref name="Mjagkij2" /&gt;

After a public falling-out with the administration,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Wilkins was dismissed from his post by President Eisenhower, and then went on to join the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Civil Rights Commission]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IXlgtli3dJ0C "Washington Notebook"], ''Ebony'', November 1980, Vol. 36, No. 1, p.27, Johnson Publishing Co, {{ISSN|0012-9011}};&lt;/ref&gt; During a later election campaign, [[John F. Kennedy]] was quick to note that when Wilkins had been fired he had been replaced by the son of one of the Republican Party's outspoken anti-civil rights advocates.

While investigating charges that black voting rights had been violated, his work with the six-member [[U.S. Civil Rights Commission|Civil Rights Commission]] was hampered in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] when he was refused accommodation at the hotel where the other commission members were staying. He subsequently found a room for himself at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name="Time1958Dec" /&gt; When the commission tried to subpoena county voting records, they discovered that then-Circuit Judge [[George Wallace]] had seized the records, and was threatening to jail any commission member who would interfere in his jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Time1958Dec"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810712,00.html Predictable Welcome], ''Time'', December 15, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other achievements ==
In 1953, Wilkins became the first African American to serve on the nine-member Judicial Council of the [[Methodist Church]], when he was elected its secretary. The body is Methodism's nominal and administrative head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jEIDAAAAMBAJ Methodist Council Elects Negro Secretary] ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', July 9, 1953, Johnson Publishing Co., {{ISSN|0021-5996}};&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1954 to 1957, Wilkins served as U.S. representative on the governing body of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="Time1959Feb" /&gt; In 1959, Wilkins also became the first African-American president of the Judicial Council of the Methodist Church.&lt;ref name="Time1959Feb"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894148,00.html Milestones], ''Time'', February 2, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wilkins married Lucille Robinson (b. 1899 (?) - d. November 1964, Brooklyn, N.Y., aged 65), who taught school in Chicago, was secretary to the women's division of the [[Methodist Church]], and who also practiced law with her husband for 33 years.&lt;ref name="Jet2" /&gt;

Together they raised three sons: [[J. Ernest Wilkins Jr.]], who achieved fame as a [[mathematician]] and [[nuclear scientist]]; John Robinson Wilkins, who attended [[University of Wisconsin]] at the age of 14, [[Harvard Law School]] at 19, was elected to the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', and went on to serve President Kennedy as general council for the [[Agency for International Development]] (AID);&lt;ref name="SLL" /&gt; and Julian B. Wilkins, who practiced general and corporate law.&lt;ref name="Jet2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0sADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22J.+ERNEST+WILKINS,+SR.%22&amp;ei=P0cESsW6AZ_OMeTkgeIM "This Week's Census: Died - Mrs. Lucille Robinson Wilkins"], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', December 3, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkins, the son of a Missouri Baptist preacher, also served as the Grand Polemarch (national president) of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] Fraternity, Inc.&lt;ref name="Time1954Aug" /&gt; Wilkins died as a result of a [[heart attack]] in Washington, D.C., in late January 1959, at the age of 64.&lt;ref name="Time1959Feb" /&gt;

In 2010 Wilkins's granddaughter, Carolyn Marie Wilkins, a Professor at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston, wrote of her grandfather and her family more generally in her biography ''Damn Near White: An African American Family's Rise from Slavery to Bittersweet Success''.&lt;ref name="DamnNear"&gt;Wilkins, Carolyn Marie.

'''Katrin Hattenhauer''' (born  10 November 1968 in [[Nordhausen]], [[Thueringen]]) is a German [[painter]] and [[civil rights activist]]. In the late 1980s she was a member of the [[GDR-opposition movement]]. On 4 September 1989 she demonstrated "For an Open Country with Free People", marking the beginning of the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in [[Leipzig]]. Her paintings and social sculptures have been exhibited in Europe.

== Life and work ==

Katrin Hattenhauer was not allowed to sit the Abitur, Germany's secondary-school examinations. Upon completing her school education she worked as a puppeteer at the local theatre in her home town [Nordhausen]. She moved on to working for the [[Wittenberg]] research centre of the East-German churches and completed an internship at the [[Zionsparish]] in Dresden. In 1988 she took up her studies at the church run theological university in [[Leipzig]]. However, due to her increased political activity – among other things she had distributed pamphlets for a demonstration in January 1989 - the GDR government pressured the church to force her to leave the university, which she ultimately did.  Katrin Hattenhauer was an active member of the [[‘Arbeitskreis Gerechtigkeit’]] (Working Committee Justice), an independent Leipzig-based opposition group that was part of the network [[‘Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte’]] (Initiative Peace and Human Rights). Moreover, she was active in the [[Monday Peaceprayers]] at the [[Nikolaichurch]], which were coordinated by pastor [[Christoph Wonneberger]].

Together with the former songwriter Jochen Läßig, who had been ex-matriculated from the theological university Leipzig due to his political activity, she organised the first street music festival in the city centre of Leipzig. The festival took place on 10 June 1989. However, the festival had been illegal and numerous contributors, visitors, and pedestrians were arrested. Importantly, the street festival was the first occasion in the GDR on which passers-by solidarised themselves with political dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lieberwirth|first1=Steffen|title=wer eynen spielmann zy Tode schlaegt ... Ein mittelalterliches Zeitdokument anno 1989|date=1990|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3-369-00272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stasi]] (Staatsicherheitsdienst, state security service) maintained the operational identity check ([[Operative Personenkontrolle]]) 'Meise' (Tit) for the surveillance of Katrin Hattenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturm|first1=Daniel|title=Ich will Täterin bleiben|date=November 1999|publisher=Kreuzer|location=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, despite the regular Stasi-interrogations and an order that prevented her from earning a living almost entirely, she continued to commit herself to political change in the GDR. She went on hunger strike at the Thomas-church Leipzig and criticised the constitutional capacity of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] directly and openly. Referring to [[Vaclav Havel]] she called for the 'bond-slaves' in a system of paternalism' to 'renounce resignation in the society': 'We pray for wisdom and courage, so that what is limited to narrowness and prison for so many may become our home country again'.

On 4 September 1989 she initiated, together with Gesine Oltmanns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Bärbel Bohley, Gerald Praschl, Rüdiger|title=Mut : Frauen in der DDR : mit Fotos und Dokumenten|date=2005|publisher=Herbig|location=München|isbn=978-3-7766-2434-2|pages=194–220, esp. 216–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; a demonstration in front of the Nikolaichurch, after the Monday Peace Prayer held there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckenbach|first1=Niels|editor1-last=Beckenbach|editor1-first=Niels|title=Fremde Brüder : der schwierige Weg zur deutschen Einheit|date=2008|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-428-12727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both women had prepared four banners, had smuggled them into the church circumventing their surveillants from the Stasi. Coming out into the public square the two women then unfolded their banner that called for 'Für ein offenes Land mit freien Menschen' (For an Open Country with Free People),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindner (Hrsg.)|first1=Bernd|title=Zum Herbst 89 : demokratische Bewegung in der DDR|date=1994|publisher=Forum Verlag|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3-86151-062-8|pages=9–10|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speech of the German president Joachim Gauk on the German unity day, Gewandhaus Leipzig 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while more activists followed them with the other banners.

About 50 activists and 250 people who wanted to emigrate from the GDR joined behind them in a first attempt to move on demonstrating, some shouting 'we want to get out', others 'we stay'. Western TV teams, which had been allowed into Leipzig to cover the fair, had secretly been informed that something would be happening in front of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jankowski|first1=Martin|title=Der Tag, der Deutschland veränderte : 9.

Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following Monday, 11 September, Katrin Hattenhauer was targeted demonstrating on [[Nikolaisquare]] and arrested together with other protesters and put in the [[Stasi-prison at Leipzig Beethoven Strasse]], where she was imprisoned until 13.10.1089. In prison she was kept in solitary confinement for most of the time and interrogated brutally. Yet, on each following Monday more and more people joined the Mondaydemonstrations in [[Leipzig]], contributing decisively to the eventual downfall of the GDR regime. Regular services and public vigils in different cities of the GDR called for the release of the unjustly imprisoned. Thus, focal points of protest developed, accelerating the democratic revolution.
Katrin Hattenhauer was well known in opposition-circles and church-groups in the GDR, she had participated in the [[Oecomenical Convention]] and taken part in trans-regional ecological seminars. She was the Leipzig contact person to the [[ecological library]] (Umweltbibliothek) a meeting point of the opposition groups in East-Berlin.

In 1991 she helped to establish the Archiv [[Bürgerbewegung Leipzig]] (The Archiv Bürgerbewegung received the German National Award in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archiv Bürgerbewegung, Deutscher Nationalpreis, 2014|url=http://www.nationalstiftung.de/nationalpreis2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working on the board. On 8 October 2000 she and Jochen Läßig, another dissident, opened the "Lichtfest" (Festival of Light) in Leipzig, speaking in front of 200.000 people to remember the crucial turning point in 1989.  On 7 November 2014 Katrin Hattenhauer spoke at Germany's ceremonial act, celebrating the 25 year anniversary of the fall of the wall and German reunification at the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Welt&amp;nbsp;Online, November 9th 2009|url=https://beta.welt.de/regionales/berlin/article5138142/20-Jahre-Mauerfall-so-feierte-Berlin.html?wtrid=crossdevice.welt.desktop.vwo.article-spliturl&amp;betaredirect=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she addressed the younger generation, urging them to 'take their freedom and live their dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Höher|first1=Sabine|title=Die Welt, November 11th 2009|url=https://beta.welt.de/welt_print/debatte/article5166203/Wenn-sich-einer-die-Freiheit-nimmt-Katrin-Hattenhauer.html?wtrid=crossdevice.welt.desktop.vwo.article-spliturl&amp;betaredirect=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The touring exhibition 'Revolution is female'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archiv Bürgerbewegung|url=http://www.archiv-buergerbewegung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:revolution-ist-weiblich&amp;catid=36:ausstellungen&amp;Itemid=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes her and other women's contributions to the Peaceful Revolution 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Annika|title=Heldinnen der friedlichen Revolution|journal=[[EMMA (magazine)|EMMA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katrin Hattenhauer often comments on the Peaceful Revolution 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wir mussten uns dieses Land zurückerobern|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/montagsdemo-ddr-am-4-september-1989-a-989176.html|website=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questions of German unity. Similarly, she speaks on radio, TV and frequently at schools, answering questions about civil courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katrin Hattenhauer interviewed by Christhardt Läpple: „Helden“, ZDF, aired 14.12.2013,|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvCQ_DAKrgo|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is serving on the board of the [[Kreisau-Initiative]] and on the historical commission of the [[Krzyzowa/Kreisau foundation]] in Poland. In October 2015 she initiated an open letter of former East-German dissidents to [[Angela Merkel]], supporting a policy of open borders for refugees who seek political asylum. The letter was published by the Deutsche Welle in English, French, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former GDR rights activists support Merkel's refugee policy|url=http://www.dw.com/en/former-gdr-rights-activists-support-merkels-refugee-policy/a-18802792|website=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der offene Brief an Merkel im Wortlaut, the open letter to Merkel|url=http://www.dw.com/de/der-offene-brief-an-merkel-im-wortlaut/a-18801502|website=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has got one son and is living together with her husband in Berlin and Oxford.

==Work as an artist==

In the wake of the Peaceful Revolution Katrin Hattenhauer became an artist. Her first exhibition "Magical Theatre"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Freiheit wagen|journal=booklet of the 1999 exhibition at Nikolaichurch Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; was opened in her flat in Leipzig on 9.December 1989. She has had exhibitions in numerous places in Europe and in the United States. The secretary-general of the biennial national Protestant gathering (Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag), [[Ellen Ueberschär]], described her art as follows: "Hattenhauer´s art is not GDR-art, not art of the GDR, it is an answer to the GDR, it is the 'even though' of an art that says 'Yes' to freedom against all odds.” Her figurative paintings focus on human emotion, freedom, and civil engagement. The late [[Freya von Moltke]] wrote about her: In the time before and around 1989, Katrin Hattenhauer has dared to demand freedom and has experienced what that can mean for the personal future. Stemming from this experience her paintings express great courage and joy in life." Katrin Hattenhauer, continually works with young people, using her art to approach questions of personal freedom and civil courage. In the last years Katrin Hattenhauer has turned towards and focused on installation art addressing various political and societal topics. "Lichtgestalten" about role models, Mannheim 2012,  "Müllwiese" (Rubbish Meadow) Hamburg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation of an article by E.Dunckel for Sueddeutsche Zeitung online|url=http://www.katrin-hattenhauer.de/rubbish_meadow_en.html|website=www.katrin-hattenhauer.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; shed and artistic light on the pollution of the oceans through plastic waste, while 'Über das Verschwinden (On Disappearing),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Disappearing - Art Project, Katrin Hattenhauer on Deutsche Welle|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT2AlzYWXMU|website=Youtube|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; London and Leipzig, raised awareness of the murder of political dissidents. At the moment she is linked with the Social Sculpture Unit, [[Brookes University]] Oxford.

Katrin Hattenhauer was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Officer´s Cross of the German Order of Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech of the German Federal President|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/DE/Joachim-Gauck/2015/10/151001-Verdienstorden-Tag-der-deutschen-Einheit.html?nn=1891680|website=www.bundespraesident.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landlord harassment''' is the willing creation, by a [[landlord]] or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in order to induce willing abandonment of a [[Real estate contract|rental contract]].   Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal [[expenses]] and potential problems with [[eviction]].  This kind of activity is common in regions where [[rent control]] laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices.  Landlord [[harassment]] carries specific legal penalties in some [[jurisdiction]]s, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances.  However, when a [[crime]] is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an [[Attendant circumstance|aggravating factor]] in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

==Types==
Various methods may be employed in cases of landlord harassment, such as, but not limited to the following:
* Withholding maintenance on the [[property]], such as [[Waste collection|garbage collection]], [[landscaping]], or repair of broken fixtures
* Verbal and written complaints, imagined or exaggerated, of tenant's supposed improper conduct (see [[notice to quit]])
* Deliberate [[Defacement (vandalism)|defacing]] of the rented facilities or the property of the tenant
* Creating a [[nuisance]] for the tenant (for example, by generating loud noise)
* [[Intimidation]] and [[threats]] of physical or financial injury directed at the tenant
* [[Physical assault]] or other direct [[criminal activity]] directed against the tenant
* Attempt to enter apartment or housing without cause, or without emergency need to check on premises or on tenant activity
* Claiming emergency when no emergency exists to enter apartment, housing, dwelling etc., without proper notice.
* Not letting tenant peace on property via repeated attempts to enter dwelling.
* Harassment about Rent Not Paid, or Not paid in full.
* Disconnecting water supply or electricity, without proper notice

==Protections==
{{Main|Nuisance}}
At [[common law]] tenants were entitled to the "quiet enjoyment" of leased premises.&lt;ref name="Kroll"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kroll, David G.|year=1992|title=The Landlord/Tenant Warranty of Habitability and the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment|journal=Colorado Lawyer|volume=21|issue=June|page=1159}}&lt;/ref&gt; American common law has also adopted the "warranty of habitability" which ensures that residential premises remain in repair.&lt;ref name="Kroll" /&gt;

In the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] may provide a basis to establish what is fair and reasonable between tenant and landlord.  The [[right]] to [[Right to privacy|private]] and family life, and the right to [[Property rights|enjoy one's possessions]], are enshrined in this law.  The right to an effective [[Legal remedy|remedy]] and the right to express oneself freely should give the tenant the confidence to seek timely and reasonable resolution should they be suffering or under [[duress]].  Although [[human rights]] legislation is generally only enforceable against [[public bodies]], it provides a framework of [[Reasonable person|reasonability]].

Depending on the specific circumstances, United Kingdom legislation such as the [[Public Order Act 1986]] and the [[Fraud Act 2006]] may provide specific remedies.  Both common law and public order legislation makes it an offence for persons to behave wrongfully in a dwelling e.g. [[breach of the peace]].  Fraud legislation makes it an offence for a person to make a wrongful or forced gain (monetary or other) personally or for the body they represent.

Many local jurisdictions have very specific landlord-tenant legislation that sets out the duties of the landlord, a breach of which may be considered "harassment".  For example, in [[California]], Civil Code Section 1954, limits the landlord's right of entry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Landlord and Tenant|publisher=California Department of Real Estate|url=http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/refbook/ref09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[New Mexico]], there is an extensive "Owner-Resident Relations Act"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Obligations of Landlords and Tenants for Safety, Maintenance and Repairs|publisher=Law Help New Mexico, New Mexico Legal Aid|url=http://www.lawhelpnewmexico.org/?q=content/obligations-landlords-and-tenants-safety-maintenance-and-repairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasonable entry by the landlord==
The conduct of business inside or at a [[dwelling]] must depend upon the reasonableness and willingness of the parties.  If a landlord desires to inspect the dwelling at reasonable intervals and at reasonable times, it is advisable to have this in a contract proper--- Regardless, the purpose of the inspection must be clear, and the conduct of the inspection must be properly regulated.  The purpose of any inspection is surely to ensure the integrity and good maintenance of the property, and the adherence to the agreement that exists between landlord and tenant.  Entry into a dwelling does not give the landlord the right to gather information on, or to investigate, or interfere with, the privacy of the tenant.  If the tenant is not comfortable dealing with the landlord or agent, then the tenant may wish to appoint a representative or friend.  In either case, a simple and sensible record should be made.

The time taken to carry out the task should be reasonable.  The tenant may not wish to conduct business inside a dwelling, and can reasonably ask the landlord to meet or transact business at an alternate place or address.

For example, the landlord (or agent) may attend at the premises to carry out an inspection which will normally take only a matter of minutes.  The parties may then agree to exchange a simple written [[Agreed statement|statement of facts]], and then meet at a neutral place to discuss the matter or remedy.

==Frequency of landlord visits==
In carrying out repairs, replacements and other work, the landlord should make reasonable efforts to limit the frequency of entries to those actually necessary to accomplish the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltb.gov.on.ca/en/Law/STDPROD_078964.html|title=Landlord and Tenant Board - SJTO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of retention of one’s tenants and the avoidance of strife during tenancy, the keys to exercise of the right to entry are as follows.  1.  Enter as infrequently as possible.  2.  Always give ample notice and, if possible, allow rescheduling of the entry at least once to accommodate the tenant.  3.  Always enter with a clearly defined objective in mind, and notify the tenant of it unless there is a strong reason not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landlord.com/landlord_right_of_entry_by_state.htm#ARIZONA:_|title=Landlord.com Government Housing|website=www.landlord.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landlord entering the unit==
Legally, even a rented home is the tenant's castle, and the landlord does not have an unlimited right of access. Once an individual has rented an [[apartment]], they have legal possession of it for the duration of their tenancy.  The landlord must give the tenant reasonable notice, before he can enter the tenant's private home.

Originally, in an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]], the law expected the landlord to rent the property to a tenant and then leave the tenant alone.  It gave the landlord no right of access, but also no responsibility for repairs.  The modern [[Urban area|urban]] tenancy, especially in a multi-unit [[building]] with many building-wide systems, has forced that law to change.  The landlord now has an [[obligation]] to make repairs and gets a right of access for that purpose.  But that does not supersede the [[Tenant rights|tenant's rights]] to privacy and to "quiet enjoyment" of the premises.

One of the most common landlord-tenant disputes involves access for making repairs.  State [[Sanitary]] [[Legal code (municipal)|Codes]]{{which|date=February 2013}} require tenants to allow the landlord "reasonable access" at reasonable times to repair code violations.  What is "reasonable", however, is the subject of frequent disputes.  A tenant may insist on giving the landlord access only by appointment, but they must be reasonable about scheduling appointments.  To give an extreme example, since the landlord usually must schedule tradespeople during the normal working day, it is not reasonable for the tenant to insist that the [[plumber]] can only come in on [[Sunday]] evening.  Plumbers, [[carpenter]]s, [[House painter and decorator|painter]]s, and other tradesmen sometimes operate on unpredictable or busy schedules, so if they fail to keep appointments, tenants are encouraged to document the missed appointment in writing to the landlord, in a letter or e-mail, and keep a copy.  Because some landlords may use lack of access as an excuse, tenants are also encouraged to keep scheduled appointments and maintain a good written record of their efforts to allow the landlord access to their property to make the desired repairs.  In addition, because of documented cases{{which|date=February 2013}} of tradesmen [[stealing]] property, making [[Long-distance call|long-distance phone call]]s, or committing other abuses while making repairs, tenants are also urged to make sure that the landlord or a representative be with repairmen at all times when they are in the tenant's property during the tenant's absence.

Housing courts can often be helpful in [[Mediation|mediating]] disputes over access.  The tenant's credibility in court will be improved if he or she has consistently cooperated reasonably with the landlord's need for access, and has documented their cooperation with careful record-keeping.  If necessary, with a particularly difficult landlord, the tenant may benefit from asking a [[witness]] to observe interactions, and later [[testify]] about the landlord's conduct.

Many leases give the landlord certain entry rights.  For example, under [[Massachusetts General Laws]], ch.186, §15B, a rental agreement may only provide for the following rights to access:
* to inspect the premises;
* to make repairs;
* to show the premises to a prospective tenant, purchaser, [[mortgagee]], or its agent.

The landlord may also enter the premises in accordance with a [[court order]] or if the tenant appears to have [[Abandoned property|abandoned]] the premises.  If a lease allows the landlord to enter for any other reason, that provision is illegal and [[Void (law)|void]].  In addition, the landlord's right to inspect the premises or to show them to a prospective purchaser does not mean that he or she can do it twice every day; the tenant can limit inspections to reasonable frequency.  Unless the lease provides that the tenant must give the landlord a key to their property, the landlord has no right to one.  The fact that a lease allows the landlord a right to enter for certain purposes also does not mean that the landlord may enter a private residence at any time without an appointment.

The right of the landlord to enter if the tenant appears to have abandoned the premises sometimes causes a problem when tenants are [[Moving (address)|moving out]].  The tenant may have moved out most of their [[furniture]] and intend to return to pick up the last few things and clean up the apartment before turning in the keys.  If the landlord believes the tenant has [[vacated]] the premises, however, he or she may come in ahead of the tenant, remove the remaining property, and attempt to charge the tenant for the "mess" they left.  To avoid this situation, tenants are encouraged to be clear with landlords about plans to vacate, and to do so in writing.  In one documented case,{{which|date=February 2013}} a tenant came back from his [[vacation]] and found someone else living in his apartment, with his furniture stored in the [[Basement|cellar]].  He wasn't behind on his [[Renting|rent]], but he had been away for a while, and the landlord concluded that he had abandoned the apartment.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  To preclude any perception of abandonment, a tenant who is going out of town may benefit from informing his or her landlord of the trip, preferably in writing.  If the tenant is away for an extended time, does not pay the rent, and does not respond to inquiries from the landlord, a [[court]] may find the landlord justified in concluding that the tenant has abandoned the property.

==Retaliation==
A landlord cannot [[Retaliatory eviction|try to evict]] a tenant, raise the rent, or change the terms of tenancy because the tenant has complained in writing to the landlord, or to any government agency, regarding conditions.  The landlord also cannot retaliate in this fashion because a tenant has organized or joined a [[tenant union]], or engaged in certain other protected activities.  Within six months after a tenant has engaged in any of these protected activities, any act by the landlord of raising the rent, attempting eviction (except for non-payment), or making any change in any of the terms of tenancy is presumed to be a retaliation.  This means that in any court proceeding, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden]] will be on the landlord to prove that he or she is not retaliating against the tenant.  In order to defeat a retaliation claim, a landlord must convince the court that he or she took the action for reasons independent of the tenant's protected action, and that he or she would have done the same thing at the same time even if the tenant hadn't engaged in the protected activity.  If the landlord waits until six months after protected actions, retaliation may still be found, but the burden of proof is on the tenant.

If a landlord is found to be retaliating, he or she will not be able to evict the tenant, who may also be awarded [[damages]] from the landlord of one to three months' rent plus [[Lawyer|attorney]]'s fees.  The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of [[Heating|heat]], [[hot water]], [[gas]], [[electricity]], [[Light fixture|lights]], [[water]], or [[refrigeration]] service.  Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure.  The tenant can ask the court to issue a [[restraining order]], [[Filing (legal)|file]] a [[criminal complaint]] against the landlord, or sue him/her for money damages and attorney's fees.  Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase.  If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim.  The court will not find that the landlord was retaliating against the tenant for an action he or she had not yet taken.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Consumer protection law==
[[Consumer protection laws]] also provide some protection against landlord harassment in some states.  One such statute is Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws, commonly called the "Consumer Protection Law".  Like the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] on which it is based, and similar "baby [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]" laws in other states, it prohibits the use of any unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of any trade or business.  Housing rental is generally considered to be a trade or business, and the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] has issued [[regulation]]s which define unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the rental housing field.  Practices defined as unfair include failure by the landlord to disclose, to a tenant or prospective tenant, any fact of the disclosure of which may have influenced the latter not to enter into the transaction.  Also defined as an unfair practice is any violation of any law meant to protect consumers, and any act which is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect.  While the Consumer Protection Law provides some protections for tenants.  If a landlord is the owner-occupant of a two-family or three-family house and owns no other rental property, he or she is not considered to be engaged in a trade or business, and is not subject to this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93a|title=Chapter 93A|website=www.malegislature.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}
{{Cleanup|date=May 2010}}
The '''last clear chance''' is a doctrine in the [[law]] of [[torts]] that is employed in [[contributory negligence]] jurisdictions. Under this doctrine, a negligent [[plaintiff]] can nonetheless recover if he is able to show that the [[defendant]] had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. Though the stated rationale has differed depending on the [[court]] adopting the doctrine, the underlying idea is to mitigate the harshness of the contributory negligence rule. The defendant can also use this doctrine as a defense.  If the plaintiff has the last clear chance to avoid the accident, the defendant will not be liable.

The [[Restatement (Second) of Torts]]&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766C (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; explains the doctrine in detail as follows:

{{quote|§ 479. LAST CLEAR CHANCE: HELPLESS PLAINTIFF

A plaintiff who has negligently subjected himself to a risk of harm from the defendant's subsequent negligence may recover for harm caused thereby if, immediately preceding the harm,

(a) the plaintiff is unable to avoid it by the exercise of reasonable vigilance and care, and

(b) the defendant is negligent in failing to utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm, when he

(i) knows of the plaintiff's situation and realizes or has reason to realize the peril involved in it or

(ii) would discover the situation and thus have reason to realize the peril, if he were to exercise the vigilance which it is then his duty to the plaintiff to exercise.

§ 480. LAST CLEAR CHANCE: INATTENTIVE PLAINTIFF

A plaintiff who, by the exercise of reasonable vigilance, could discover the danger created by the defendant's negligence in time to avoid the harm to him, can recover if, but only if, the defendant

(a) knows of the plaintiff's situation, and

(b) realizes or has reason to realize that the plaintiff is inattentive and therefore unlikely to discover his peril in time to avoid the harm, and

(c) thereafter is negligent in failing to utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm.

The introduction of the doctrine is widely attributed to the English case of ''[[Davies v. Mann]]'', 152 Eng. Rep. 588 (1842).}}

'''''Living High and Letting Die: Our Illusion of Innocence''''' {{ISBN|0-19-510859-0}} is a philosophical book by [[Peter K. Unger]], published in 1996.

==Overview==
Inspired by [[Peter Singer]]'s 1971 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]],"&lt;ref name="Kuhse"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsanctifying human life: essays on ethics|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell|location=New York|isbn=0631225072|editor=Helga Kuhse|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger argues that for people in the developed world to live morally, they are morally obliged to make sacrifices to help mitigate human suffering and premature death in the third world, and further that it is acceptable (and morally right) to lie, cheat, and steal to mitigate suffering.

Unger argues that the intuitive moral judgments most people have of several hypothetical moral scenarios, ''The Shallow Pond'', ''The Vintage Sedan'', and ''The Envelope'', are inconsistent.

Unger presents the hypothetical case of ''The Vintage Sedan'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not truly rich, your one luxury in life is a vintage Mercedes sedan that, with much time, attention, and money, you've restored to mint condition... One day, you stop at the intersection of two small country roads, both lightly traveled.  Hearing a voice screaming for help, you get out and see a man who's wounded and covered with a lot of his blood.  Assuring you that his wound is confined to one of his legs, the man also informs you that he was a medical student for two full years.  And, despite his expulsion for cheating on his second year final exams, which explains his indigent status since, he's knowledgeably tied his shirt near the wound as to stop the flow.  So, there's no urgent danger of losing his life, you're informed, but there's great danger of losing his limb.  This can be prevented, however, if you drive him to a rural hospital fifty miles away.  "How did the wound occur?" you ask.  An avid bird-watcher, he admits that he trespassed on a nearby field and, in carelessly leaving, cut himself on rusty barbed wire.  Now, if you'd aid this trespasser, you must lay him across your fine back seat.  But, then, your fine upholstery will be soaked through with blood, and restoring the car will cost over five thousand dollars.  So, you drive away.  Picked up the next day by another driver, he survives but loses the wounded leg.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Unger reports that most people respond strongly that abandoning the hitchhiker is abominable behavior, and he contrasts this near-universal harsh judgment with the lenient judgments most people give to ''The Envelope'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In your mailbox, there's something from (the U.S. Committee for) [[UNICEF]].  After reading it through, you correctly believe that, unless you soon send in a check for $100, then, instead of each living many more years, over thirty more children will die soon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Unger argues that the factors that distinguish The Envelope from The Vintage Sedan, in which morality compels us to make a sacrifice, are not morally significant, using [[thought experiment]]s such as variations on the [[trolley problem]] to illustrate his point. Unger contends that psychological factors obscure the moral questions, and that our moral intuitions about problems such as these provide an inconsistent window into our true [[moral value]]s.

Unger conspicuously indicates that the author's [[royalties]] from the sales of this book go to [[UNICEF]] and to [[Oxfam America]].

Barry Smith and Berit Brogaard (writing under the pseudonym of Nicola [[Nicolas_Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]) argue in their [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/Livinghigh.pdf "Living High and Letting Die"], that Unger's argument undermines one central approach to the defense of abortion advanced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her famous [[Violinist (thought experiment)]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine that your body has become attached, without your permission, to that of a sick violinist. The violinist is a human being. He will die if you detach him. Such detachment seems, nonetheless, to be morally permissible. Thomson argues that an unwantedly pregnant woman is in an analogous situation. Her argument is considered by many to have established the moral permissibility of abortion even under the assumption that the foetus is a human being. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the strategy adopted by Unger, Smith and Brogaard point to a number of scenarios in which a woman's right to decide what happens in and to her body seems to be outweighed by the right to life of the violinist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12974">'''Lubachevsky-Stillinger (compression) algorithm''' (LS algorithm, LSA, or LS protocol) is a numerical procedure suggested by [[F. H. Stillinger]] and B.D. Lubachevsky that simulates or imitates a physical process of compressing an assembly of hard particles&lt;ref name="StillingerLubachevskyJStat"&gt;B. D. Lubachevsky and F. H. Stillinger, Geometric properties of random disk packings, J. Statistical Physics 60 (1990), 561-583 http://www.princeton.edu/~fhs/geodisk/geodisk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. As the LSA may need thousands of arithmetic operations even for a few particles, it is usually carried out on a [[digital computer]].[[File:1000 triangles packed in rectangle.png|thumb|Using a variant of Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm, 1000 congruent isosceles triangles are randomly packed by compression in a rectangle with periodic (wrap-around) boundary. The rectangle which is the period of pattern repetition in both directions is shown. Packing density is 0.8776]]

==Phenomenology==
A physical process of compression often involves a contracting hard boundary of the container, such as a piston pressing against the particles. The LSA is able to simulate such a scenario.&lt;ref&gt;F. H. Stillinger and B. D. Lubachevsky,  Crystalline-Amorphous Interface Packings for Disks and Spheres, J. Stat. Phys. 73, 497-514 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LSA was originally introduced in the setting without a hard boundary&lt;ref name="StillingerLubachevskyJStat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Lubachevsky, How to Simulate Billiards and Similar Systems, Journal of Computational Physics Volume 94 Issue 2, May 1991 https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/pdf/0503/0503627v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the virtual particles were "swelling" or expanding in a fixed, finite virtual volume with [[periodic boundary conditions]]. The absolute sizes of the particles were increasing but particle-to-particle relative sizes remained constant. In general, the LSA can handle an external compression and an internal particle expansion, both occurring simultaneously and possibly, but not necessarily, combined with a hard boundary. In addition, the boundary can be mobile.

In a final, compressed, or "jammed" state, some particles are not  jammed, they are able to move within "cages" formed by their immobile, jammed neighbors and the hard boundary, if any. These free-to-move particles are not an artifact, or pre-designed, or target feature of the LSA, but rather a real phenomenon. The simulation revealed this phenomenon, somewhat unexpectedly for the authors of the LSA. Frank H. Stillinger coined the term "rattlers" for the free-to-move particles, because if one physically shakes a compressed bunch of hard particles, the rattlers will be rattling.

In the "pre-jammed" mode when the density of the configuration is low and when the particles are mobile, the compression and  expansion can be stopped, if so desired. Then the LSA, in effect, would be simulating a [[granular flow]]. Various dynamics of the instantaneous collisions can be simulated such as: with or without a full restitution, with or without tangential friction.
Differences in masses of the particles can be taken into account. It is also easy and sometimes proves useful to "fluidize" a jammed configuration, by decreasing the sizes of all or some of the particles. Another possible extension of the LSA is replacing the hard collision [[force]] [[potential]] (zero outside the particle, infinity at or inside) with a piece-wise constant [[force]] [[potential]]. The LSA thus modified would approximately simulate [[molecular dynamics]] with continuous
short range particle-particle force interaction. External [[force fields]], such as [[gravitation]], can be also introduced, as long as the inter-collision motion of each particle can be represented by a simple one-step calculation.

Using LSA for spherical particles of different sizes and/or for jamming in a non-commeasureable size container proved to be a useful technique for generating and studying micro-structures formed under conditions of a [[crystallographic defect]]&lt;ref&gt;F. H. Stillinger and B. D. Lubachevsky. Patterns of Broken Symmetry in the Impurity-Perturbed Rigid Disk Crystal, J. Stat. Phys. 78, 1011-1026 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[geometrical frustration]]&lt;ref&gt;Boris D. Lubachevsky and Frank H. Stillinger, Epitaxial frustration in deposited packings of rigid disks and spheres. Physical Review E 70:44, 41604 (2004) https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/pdf/0405/0405650v5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris D. Lubachevsky, Ron L. Graham, and Frank H. Stillinger, Spontaneous Patterns in Disk Packings. Visual Mathematics, 1995. http://vismath5.tripod.com/lub/&lt;/ref&gt; It should be added  that the original LS protocol was designed primarily for spheres of same or different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Kansal, S. Torquato, and F.H. Stillinger, Computer Generation of Dense Polydisperse Sphere Packings, J. Chem. Phys. 117, 8212-8218 (2002) http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13990882&lt;/ref&gt;

Any deviation from the spherical (or circular in two dimensions) shape, even a simplest one, when spheres are replaced with ellipsoids (or ellipses in two dimensions),&lt;ref&gt;A. Donev, F.H. Stillinger, P.M. Chaikin, and S. Torquato, Unusually Dense Crystal Packings of Ellipsoids, Physical Review Letters 92, 255506 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; causes thus modified LSA to slow down substantially.
But as long as the shape is spherical, the LSA is able to handle particle assemblies in tens to hundreds of thousands
on today's (2011) standard [[personal computers]]. Only a very limited experience was reported&lt;ref&gt;M. Skoge, A. Donev, F.H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Packing Hyperspheres in High-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces, Phys. Rev. E 74, 041127 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
in using the LSA in dimensions higher than 3.

==Implementation==
The state of particle jamming is achieved via simulating a [[granular flow]]. The flow is rendered as a [[discrete event simulation]], the events being particle-particle or particle-boundary collisions. Ideally, the calculations should have been
performed with the infinite precision. Then the jamming would have occurred [[ad infinitum]]. In practice, the precision is finite as is the available resolution of representing the real numbers in the [[computer memory]], for example, a [[double-precision]] resolution. The real calculations are stopped when inter-collision runs of the non-rattler particles become
smaller than an explicitly or implicitly specified small threshold. For example, it is useless to continue the calculations when inter-collision runs are smaller than the roundoff error.

The LSA is efficient in the sense that the events are processed essentially in an [[Event-driven programming|event-driven]] fashion, rather than in a 
time-driven fashion. This means almost no calculation is wasted on computing or maintaining the positions and velocities
of the particles between the collisions. Among the [[Event-driven programming|event-driven]] algorithms intended for the same task of simulating [[granular flow]], like, for example, the algorithm of D.C. Rapaport,&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Rapaport, The Event Scheduling Problem in Molecular Dynamic Simulation, Journal of Computational Physics Volume 34 Issue 2, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; the LSA is distinguished by a simpler [[data structure]] and data handling.

For any particle at any stage of calculations the LSA keeps record of only two events: an old, already processed committed event, which comprises the committed event [[time stamp]], the particle state (including position and velocity), and, perhaps, the "partner" which could be another particle or boundary identification, the one with which the particle collided in the past,
and a new event proposed for a future processing with a similar set of parameters. The new event is not committed. The maximum of the committed old event times must never exceed the minimum of the non-committed new event times.

Next particle to be examined by the algorithm has the current minimum of new event times. At examining the chosen particle,
what was previously the new event, is declared to be the old one and to be committed, whereas the next new event is being scheduled, with its new time stamp, new state, and new partner, if any. As the next new event for a particle is being set,
some of the neighboring particles may update their non-committed new events to better account for the new information.

As the calculations of the LSA progress, the collision rates of particles may and usually do increase. Still the LSA successfully approaches the jamming state as long as those rates remain comparable among all the particles, except for the rattlers. (Rattlers experience consistently low collision rates. This property allows one to detect rattlers.) However, 
it is possible for a few particles, even just for a single particle, to experience a very high collision rate along the approach to a certain simulated time. The rate will be increasing without a bound in proportion to the rates of collisions in the rest of the particle ensemble. If this happens, then the simulation will be stuck in time, it won't be able to progress toward the state of jamming.

The stuck-in-time failure can also occur when simulating a granular flow without particle compression or expansion. This failure mode was recognized by the practitioners of granular flow simulations as an "inelastic collapse" &lt;ref&gt;S. McNamara, and W.R. Young, Inelastic collapse in two dimensions, Physical Review E 50: pp. R28-R31, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; because it often occurs in such simulations when the [[restitution coefficient]] in collisions is low (i.e. inelastic). The failure is not specific to only the LSA algorithm. Techniques to avoid the failure have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Drozd, Computer Simulation of Granular Matter: A Study of An Industrial Grinding Mill, Thesis, Univ. Western Ontario, Canada, 2004. {{cite web |url=http://imaging.robarts.ca/~jdrozd/thesisjd.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818102135/http://imaging.robarts.ca/~jdrozd/thesisjd.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The LSA was a by-product of an attempt to find a fair measure of [[speedup]] in [[Parallel algorithm|parallel]] [[simulations]]. The [[Time Warp (algorithm)|Time Warp]] parallel simulation algorithm by David Jefferson was advanced as a method to simulate asynchronous spatial interactions of fighting units in combat models on a [[parallel computer]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Wieland, and D. Jefferson, Case studies in serial and parallel simulations, Proc. 1989 Int'l Conf. Parallel Processing, Vol.III, F. Ris, and M. Kogge, Eds., pp. 255-258.&lt;/ref&gt; Colliding particles models&lt;ref&gt;P. Hontales, B. Beckman, et al., Performance of the colliding pucks simulation of the Time Warp operating systems, Proc. 1989 SCS Multiconference, Simulation Series, SCS, Vol. 21, No. 2, pp. 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; offered similar simulation tasks with spatial interactions of particles but clear of the details that are non-essential for exposing the simulation techniques. The [[speedup]] was presented as the ratio of the execution time on a [[uniprocessor]] over that on a [[multiprocessor]], when executing the same parallel Time Warp algorithm. Boris D. Lubachevsky noticed that such a speedup assessment might be faulty because executing a [[parallel algorithm]] for a task on a uniprocessor is not necessarily the fastest way to perform the task on such a machine. The LSA was created in an attempt to produce a faster uniprocessor simulation and hence to have a more fair assessment of the [[parallel speedup]]. Later on, a parallel simulation algorithm,
different from the Time Warp, was also proposed, that, when run on a uniprocessor, reduces to the LSA.&lt;ref&gt;B.D. Lubachevsky, Simulating Billiards: Serially and in Parallel, Int.J. in Computer Simulation, Vol. 2 (1992), pp. 373-411.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the '''Maitreya''' or '''Lord Maitreya''' is an advanced spiritual entity and high-ranking member of a hidden [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], the so-called ''[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]''. According to Theosophical [[doctrine]], one of the Hierarchy's functions is to oversee the evolution of humankind; in accord with this function the Maitreya is said to hold the so-called ''Office of the World Teacher''. Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical, but ever progressive, [[Evolution (term)|evolutionary]] path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or [[Incarnation|incarnating]] in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of ''World Teacher'' of Humankind.

The Theosophical concept of Maitreya has many similarities to the earlier [[Maitreya]] doctrine in [[Buddhism]]. However, they differ in important aspects. The Theosophical Maitreya has been assimilated or appropriated by a variety of quasi-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] and [[Esoteric]] groups and movements.

==Development of the Theosophical concept of the Maitreya==
The first mention of the Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] (1840–1921), an early Theosophical writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|APS1883}} [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett, Alfred Percy]] (1883). [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpUZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Esoteric Buddhism''] (2nd ed.). London: Trübner. p. 144. {{OCLC|2014685}}. [[Google books|Google Books Search]]. Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', a book originally published 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|HPB1888}} [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, Helena]] (1888). ''[[The Secret Doctrine|The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy]]''. London: The Theosophical Publishing Company. {{OCLC|8129381}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was the magnum opus of [[Helena Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), one of the founders of the [[Theosophical Society]] and of contemporary [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. In it, the [[Messianism|messianic]] Maitreya is linked to both Buddhist and [[Hindu]] religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]]. [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/SDVolume_I.htm '''Volume I: Cosmogenesis''']. p. 384. 2005. [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]. Retrieved 2011-04-13. "MAITREYA is the secret name of the Fifth Buddha, and the Kalki Avatar of the Brahmins—the last MESSIAH who will come at the culmination of the Great Cycle."&lt;/ref&gt; In the same work Blavatsky asserted that there have been, and will be, multiple messianic (or messianic-like) instances in human history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]]. '''Volume I: Cosmogenesis'''. p. 653. "Why see in the ''Pisces'' a direct reference to Christ – one of the several world-reformers, a Saviour but for his direct followers, but only a great and glorious Initiate for all the rest – when that constellation shines as a symbol of all the past, present, and future Spiritual Saviours who dispense light and dispel mental darkness?" [Emphasis in original]. Blavatsky is referring to the actual constellation of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] ([[Latin]] for fish), as well as to its [[Pisces (astrology)|astrological meaning]]. A fish symbol, [[Ichthys]], had been used in religious representations in several ancient cultures and it was an important symbol in [[Early Christianity]]. According to Blavatsky's writings and those of other Theosophists, [[cosmogony]] and [[wikt:theogony#Noun|theogony]] are intimately related, and significant events of a spiritual nature (such as the appearance of a [[messiah]]) correspond to physical, [[cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt; These successive appearances of "emissarie[s] of Truth"&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|HPB1889}} [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, Helena]] (1889).

"From the very beginning of Eons – in time and space in our Round and Globe – the Mysteries of Nature (at any rate, those which it is lawful for our races to know) were recorded by the pupils of those same now invisible 'heavenly men,' in geometrical figures and symbols. The keys thereto passed from one generation of 'wise men' to the other."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]]. "Our Divine Instructors".

===Maitreya and the Spiritual Hierarchy===
{{Main|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom}}

Following Blavatsky's writings on the subject, other Theosophists progressively elaborated on the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|CWL2007}} [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater, Charles W.]] (2007). [Reprint ed. originally published 1925. [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], India: Theosophical Publishing House]. ''The Masters and the Path''. New York: Cosimo Classics. {{ISBN|978-1602063334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are presented as guardians and guides of Earth's total evolutionary process,&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 296–297.&lt;/ref&gt; known in Theosophical [[cosmology]] as the doctrine of ''[[Round (Theosophy)|Planetary Rounds]]''. According to Theosophists, evolution includes an [[occult]] or spiritual component that is considered of a higher order of importance than the related physical evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#APS1883|Sinnett 1883]] "Chapter IV: The World Periods" pp. 45–65. [[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]]. "Our world, its growth and development"; "Theosophical misconceptions"; "Explanations concerning the Globes and Monads". '''Volume I: Cosmogenesis'''.  pp. 136–191 [cumulative].&lt;/ref&gt; The Hierarchy presumably consists of spiritual entities at various evolutionary stages – these stages correspond to ever increasing ranks within the Hierarchy. Lower ranks are populated by individuals who can function more or less normally on the physical plane, while in the highest known rankings are highly evolved beings of the purest spiritual essence and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 4–5, 10, 34; "Part IV: The Hierarchy" pp. 211–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theosophical exposition, in the current stage of Planetary Evolution the position of Maitreya in Earth's Hierarchy is that of the so-called ''[[Boddhisatva]]'', originally a Buddhist concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 31-32, 36, 277–278. Like other aspects of Theosophy, the doctrine of Earth's Spiritual Hierarchy expands or interprets many Buddhist and Hindu concepts within an [[occult]] or [[esoteric]] framework.&lt;/ref&gt; Since this position is thought to be at an exalted state, the Maitreya may have no direct or sustained contact with the physical realm. At this evolutionary level he is below only two other beings in the current Hierarchy: at its apex, the [[Sanat Kumara]], (also referred to as ''The Lord of the World''), followed by the [[Buddha]]; as such the Maitreya is held in high reverence and regard by Theosophists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] "Diagram 8" p. 256; "Chapter XIV: The Wisdom in the Triangles" pp. 261-295.&lt;/ref&gt; He is additionally described as having among other duties overall responsibility for humanity's development, including its education, civilization, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 74, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky held that members of the Hierarchy, often called ''the Masters'' or ''[[Mahātmā#Theosophy|the Mahātmās]]'' in Theosophical literature, were the ultimate guides of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;In this context, ''the Masters'' refer to specific members of the Hierarchy, and not to the Masters of Ancient Wisdom as a group.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society itself was said to be the result of one of the "impulses" from the Hierarchy. These "impulses" are believed to be a regular occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1889|Blavatsky 1889]]. "But I must tell you that during the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by those 'Masters,' of whom I have spoken, to help on the spiritual progress of Humanity in a marked and definite way. Towards the close of each century you will invariably find that an outpouring or upheaval of spirituality – or call it mysticism if you prefer – has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in the world as their agents, and a greater or less amount of occult knowledge and teaching has been given out." [p. 306]. In the same work Blavatsky lamented the fact that the idea of mysterious "Masters" dispensing [[occult]] "impulses" had become the foundation for unscrupulous practices. "Every bogus swindling Society, for commercial purposes, now claims to be guided and directed by 'Masters,' ..." [p. 301].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blavatsky commented in her widely read 1889 work ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' on the next impulse, the "effort of the XXth century" which would involve another "torch bearer of Truth". In this effort the Theosophical Society was poised to possibly play a major role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1889|Blavatsky 1889]]. Context at pp. 306–307.&lt;/ref&gt; More information regarding the future "impulse" was the purview of the Theosophical Society's ''[[Esoteric|Esoteric Section]]'' which was founded by Blavatsky and was originally led by her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, Helena]] (August 1931).

([[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]]: Theosophical Publishing House). {{ISSN|0040-5892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members had access to [[occult]] instruction and more detailed knowledge of the "inner order" and mission of the Society, and of its reputed hidden guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|ML1975}} [[Mary Lutyens|Lutyens, Mary]] (1975). ''[[Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening]]''. New York: [[Farrar Straus and Giroux]]. pp. 10–11. {{ISBN|0374182221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maitreya and the "Christ Principle"===
Blavatsky also elaborated on a so-called ''Christ Principle'', which in her view corresponds to the spiritual essence of every human being.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HPB1889|Blavatsky 1889]] pp. 67, 71, 155; [http://theosophy.org/Blavatsky/Key%20to%20Theosophy/aKEY.htm#c "Glossary: C": ''Chrestos'']. [[Wheaton, Maryland]]: theosophy.org. Retrieved 2011-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt; After Blavatsky’s death in 1891 influential Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] (1854–1934), whose knowledge on [[occult]] matters was highly respected by the Society's leadership, formulated a [[Christology]] in which he identified Christ with the Theosophical representation of the [[Buddhist]] deity [[Maitreya]]. He maintained that an aspect of Maitreya was the prototype for the ''Christ Principle'' described by Blavatsky. Leadbeater believed that ''Maitreya-as-Christ'' had previously manifested on Earth, often through specially prepared people who acted as the entity's "vehicles". The manifested  Maitreya then assumed the role of World Teacher, dispensing knowledge regarding underlying truths of Existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] pp. 31, 192, 232; "Chapter XII: The Trinity and the Triangles" pp. 250-260.&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge, which according to Theosophists eventually crystallized in religious, scientific and cultural practices, had been reputedly disseminated to groups as small as a few carefully selected Initiates and as large as Humanity as a whole.

===Maitreya's incarnations===
In Theosophical texts, the Maitreya is said to have had numerous manifestations or incarnations: in the theorized ancient continent of [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]]; as a [[Hierophant]] in [[Ancient Egypt]];&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|ABCWL1913}} [[Annie Besant|Besant, Annie]] &amp; [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater, Charles W.]] (1913). [[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: How, Whence, and Whither; a record of clairvoyant investigation'']]. [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], India: Theosophical Publishing House. p. 520. {{OCLC|871602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Hindu deity [[Krishna]];&lt;ref name="CWL2007p278"&gt;[[#CWL2007|Leadbeater 2007]] p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; as a high priest in Ancient India;&lt;ref&gt;[[#ABCWL1913|Besant-Leadbeater 1913]] p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Christ]] during the three years of the [[Ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="CWL2007p278"/&gt;

===Maitreya's reappearance===
[[Annie Besant]] (1847–1933), another well-known and influential Theosophist (and future President of the Society) had also developed an interest in this area of Theosophy. In the decades of the 1890s and 1900s, along with Leadbeater (who became a close associate) and others, she became progressively convinced that the "next impulse" from the Hierarchy would happen sooner than Blavatsky's timetable. These Theosophists came to believe it would involve the imminent reappearance of Maitreya as World Teacher, a monumental event in the Theosophical scheme of things.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky's views on the specific matter of the reappearance of Maitreya (as opposed to the regular appearances of other, lower-ranked emissaries) were thought to be in general agreement with mainstream Buddhist [[eschatology]]. [[#HPB1888|Blavatsky 1888]] '''Volume I: Cosmogenesis''' p. 470. "He will appear as Maitreya Buddha, the last of the Avatars and Buddhas, in the seventh Race. This belief and expectation are universal throughout the East. Only it is not in the ''Kali yug'', our present terrifically materialistic age of Darkness, the 'Black Age,' that a new Saviour of Humanity can ever appear." [Emphasis in original].&lt;/ref&gt; Besant had started commenting on the possible imminent arrival of the next "emissary" in 1896, several years before her assumption of the Society's presidency in 1907. By 1909 the "coming" Teacher was a main topic of her lectures and writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ML1975|M. Lutyens]] pp. 11–12, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Besant became President of the Society the belief in Maitreya's imminent manifestation took on considerable weight. The subject was widely discussed and became a commonly held expectation among Theosophists. However, not all Theosophical Society members accepted Leadbeater's and Besant's ideas on this; the dissidents charged them with straying from Theosophical [[orthodoxy]] and, along with other concepts developed by the two, Leadbeater's and Besant's writings on the Maitreya were derisively labeled ''[[Neo-Theosophy]]'' by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Margaret A. (c. 1930s) [Originally compiled by Thomas c. 1920s]. [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/ton1.pdf "Section I: Differences in Teaching"] ([[PDF]]). ''Theosophy or Neo-Theosophy?''. London: Margaret A.

Retrieved 2011-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]] (India)-based international leadership of the Society eventually overcame the protests and by the late-1920s the organization had stabilized, but in the meantime additional World Teacher-related trouble was brewing.

In 1909 Leadbeater encountered fourteen-year-old [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895–1986) near the Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar, and came to believe the boy was a suitable candidate for the "vehicle" of the expected World Teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ML1975|M. Lutyens]] pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Leadbeater placed Krishnamurti under his and the Society's wing.

The project received widespread publicity and enjoyed worldwide following, chiefly among Theosophists. However it also encountered opposition within and without the Theosophical Society, and led to years of upheaval, serious splits within the Society, and doctrinal schisms in Theosophy.

Following the Krishnamurti debacle, major Theosophical organizations and writers became increasingly muted, at least publicly, on the subject of the reappearance of Maitreya and on the possible next "impulse" from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Vernonp188"/&gt; However the concepts of World Teacher, of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, and of Masters of Occult Wisdom as described in Theosophical literature, continued to have vocal supporters. These were found among Theosophical Society members and increasingly, among near-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, Govert W. (1999). [http://www.alpheus.org/html/articles/esoteric_history/story.html "The Masters and Their Emissaries: From H.P.B. to Guru Ma and Beyond"] (2nd ed.). ''Alpheus''. [[Carol Stream, Illinois]]: Govert W.

===Alice A. Bailey===
{{Main|Alice A. Bailey#Teachings regarding Maitreya}}
A major proponent was [[Alice Bailey]] (1880–1949), who left the Theosophical Society in the 1920s to establish the quasi-theosophical ''Arcane School''. She expanded Leadbeater's work and his Christology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Bailey|Bailey, Alice A.]] (1989). [Originally published 1957]. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (4th ed.). New York: Lucis Publishing. [[Paperback]]. {{ISBN|978-0853301066}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to Maitreya as the ''Cosmic Christ'', claiming his [[Second Coming]] would occur sometime after the year 2025.&lt;ref&gt;__ (1996). [Originally published 1947]. ''The Reappearance of the Christ''. New York: Lucis Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0853301141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascended Master Teachings===
The Theosophical Maitreya also holds a prominent position in the so-called ''[[Ascended Master Teachings]]''. These encompass original Theosophical literature, as well as later additions and interpretations by various non-Theosophical commentators and groups – such as the [[I AM Activity]],&lt;ref&gt;Godfré Ray King &amp;#91;[[pseudonym]] of [[Guy Ballard]]&amp;#93; (1934). ''Unveiled mysteries''. Chicago: Saint Germain Press. {{OCLC|6785156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (1939–2009);&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Clare Prophet|Prophet, Elizabeth Clare]] &amp; [[Mark Prophet|Prophet, Mark]] (1986). ''Maitreya: on the image of God: a study in Christhood by the Great Initiator''. [[Livingston, Montana]]: Summit University Press. {{ISBN|978-0916766955}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the validity of this later commentary has been disputed by Theosophical writers.

===Benjamin Creme===
{{Main|Benjamin Creme}}
[[Benjamin Creme]] (1922-2016), a follower of Alice Bailey and founder of [[Share International]], an organization whose doctrines have similarities with those of mainstream Theosophy, is a later promoter of the Maitreya. In 1975 Creme claimed to have started to [[Telepathy|telepathically]] [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the Maitreya. Creme stated that Maitreya communicated to him that he had decided to return to Earth earlier than 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|Creme}} [[Benjamin Creme|Creme, Benjamin]] (1990). [Originally published 1986]. ''Maitreya's Mission'' (2nd ed.). [[Amsterdam]]: [[Share International|Share International Foundation]]. {{ISBN|978-9071484063}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other claimed communications from the Maitreya followed, and Creme eventually announced that Maitreya materialized a physical body for himself in early 1977 in the [[Himalayas]] and then moved to London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Creme|Creme]] p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Creme has made a number of extraordinary statements and predictions based on reputed telepathic messages from the Maitreya that have failed to come true; as a result he has been considered a figure of amusement in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=Alas and alack, on the great issue of the day poor Mr Maitreya seems to have stubbed his toe rather badly. After Saddam sent his tanks across the border last August, Maitreya suggested that 'a mystical power and force in nature will make Iraq withdraw totally and unconditionally from Kuwait'.

In [[microeconomics]], the '''marginal factor cost''' (MFC) is the increment to total costs paid for a [[factor of production]] resulting from a one-unit increase in the amount of the factor employed. It is expressed in [[currency]] units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as [[labour economics|labor]], per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the  number of units of labor hired, the marginal factor cost is identical to the [[wage]] rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the labor factor is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.

Thus for any factor the MFC is the change in total amount paid for all units of that factor divided by the change in the quantity of that factor employed.

A firm that wants to optimize its profits hires each factor up to the point at which its marginal factor cost equals its [[marginal revenue product]] (MFC=MRP).

'''Mario Augusto Bunge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|ŋ|ɡ|i}}; {{IPA-es|ˈbuŋxe|lang}}; born September 21, 1919) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and [[physics|physicist]] who is mainly active in [[Canada]].

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Bunge was born on September 21, 1919 in [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Argentina]]). His mother, Marie Müser, was a German nurse who left Germany just before the beginning of [[World War I]]. His father, Augusto Bunge, also of some German descent, was an Argentinian physician and socialist legislator. Mario, who was the couple's only child, was raised without any religious education, and enjoyed a happy and stimulating childhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Memorias. Entre dos mundos. Barcelona: Gedisa&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wife and children ===
Bunge has four children: Carlos F. and Mario A. J. (with ex-wife Julia), and Eric R. and Silvia A., with his present wife, the Argentinian mathematician [[Marta Cavallo]].
Mario and Marta live in [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]].

=== Studies and career ===
Bunge began his studies at the [[National University of La Plata]], graduating with a [[Ph.D.]] in physico-mathematical sciences in 1952. He was professor of [[theoretical physics]] and philosophy, 1956&amp;ndash;1966, first at La Plata then at [[University of Buenos Aires]]. He was, until his recent retirement at age 90, the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]], where he had been since 1966.&lt;ref name="MG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt;

Bunge's students include Roger Angel, David Blitz, Mike Dillinger, Andrés Kálnay, Jean-Pierre Marquis, Dan A. Seni, Héctor Vucetich, and Miguel A. Quintanilla.

==Work==
Bunge is a prolific intellectual, having written more than 400 papers and 80 books, notably his monumental ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' in 8 volumes (1974–1989), a comprehensive and rigorous study of those philosophical aspects Bunge takes to be the core of modern philosophy: [[semantics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt; Here, Bunge develops a comprehensive [[scientific]] outlook which he then applies to the various natural and social sciences.

His thinking embodies global [[systemics|systemism]], [[emergentism]], [[rationalism]], [[scientific realism]], [[materialism]] and [[consequentialism]]. Bunge has repeatedly and explicitly denied being a [[logical positivism|logical positivist]], and has written on [[metaphysics]]. In the [[politics|political]] arena, Bunge has defined himself as a "[[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[liberalism|liberal]]" and [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], in the tradition of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[José Ingenieros]]. He is also a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&amp;mapgroup=pro|title=Overview: Professors|website=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularly, he is known for his remarks considering [[psychoanalysis]] as an example of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearscience.com/2010/10/06/is_psychoanalysis_science_or_pseudoscience_237794.html RealClearScience - "Is Psychoanalysis Science or Pseudoscience?"] Retrieved 16 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also freely criticized the ideas of well known scientists and philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].{{R|"Alcock"}}

In his review of ''Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist'', [[James Alcock]] sees in Bunge "a man of exceedingly high confidence who has lived his life guided by strong principles about truth, science, and justice" and one who is "[impatient] with muddy thinking".{{R|"Alcock"}}

== Awards ==
Mario Bunge has been distinguished with twenty one honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships by universities from both the Americas and Europe. Bunge is a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1984–) and of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1992–). In 1982 he was awarded the ''Premio Príncipe de Asturias'' ([[Prince of Asturias Award]]), in 2009 the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]],&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UO"/&gt; and in 2014 the [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] Award in Complexity Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcsss.org/research/grants-and-prizes/ludwig-von-bertalanffy-award-in-complexity-thinking/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Thomas Rice Jr.''' (born February 13, 1969) is an American [[college basketball]] coach, formerly the head men's basketball coach at [[Robert Morris University]] and later [[Rutgers-New Brunswick|Rutgers University]]. He is the son of former college basketball coach and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] announcer [[Mike Rice (basketball)|Mike Rice]]. In 2009, he helped lead Robert Morris to its first [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Morris Clinches NCAA Tourney Bid|date=March 12, 2009|accessdate=March 12, 2009|publisher=ThePittsburghChannel|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/sports/18866842/detail.html}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice gained national attention in 2013, when [[ESPN]] aired Rutgers practice videos showing the coach verbally and physically abusing players. Rice was fired the next day. He resides in [[Little Silver, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;via [[Associated Press]].

Accessed April 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Rice was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], to Kathy and Mike Rice. He attended [[Boardman High School]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]] where he was a three year starter as a basketball guard. He was a three-year starter for the [[Fordham University]] basketball team from 1988 to 1991 and was captain of the team his senior year when Fordham went to the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. He received a bachelor's degree in communication. After graduation he was an assistant coach at several programs including Fordham 1991–1994; [[Marquette University]] 1994–1997; [[Niagara University]] 1997–1998; [[Chicago State University]] 1998–2001; [[St. Joseph's University]] 2004–2006; and [[University of Pittsburgh]] 2006–2007. In addition he was associated with the Hoop Group in [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune, New Jersey]] from 2001 to 2004 where he was director of the Eastern Invitational Basketball Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/rice_mike00.html|title=Mike Rice Bio - PittsburghPanthers.com - University of Pittsburgh Official Athletic Site|publisher=PittsburghPanthers.com|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=9212#.UVw_P0rivFI |title=Mike Rice Named Rutgers University Head Men's Basketball Coach |publisher=Scarletknights.com |date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=2013-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080058/http://scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=9212 |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he became head coach at Robert Morris University, and in 2010 he became head coach of Rutgers University.

==Rutgers University suspension and firing==
On December 13, 2012, Rice was suspended three games without pay and fined $50,000 for abusive behavior toward his players. The suspension came after athletic director [[Tim Pernetti]] obtained video footage from a practice during either Rice's first or second season at Rutgers, at which Rice was seen throwing basketballs at players' heads and cursing at them. Assistant coach David Cox led the team during Rice's suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/index.ssf/2012/12/mike_rice_suspended_by_rutgers.html|title=Rutgers suspended Mike Rice because school found coach threw basketballs at players' heads|last=Prunty|first=Brendan|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the suspension, Rice was not only banned from any contact with his players or going on recruiting visits, but was banned from coming onto campus altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy Katz|title=Mike Rice speaks out after suspension, fine|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/blog/_/name/katz_andy/id/8790174/rutgers-scarlet-knights-coach-mike-rice-vows-get-better-suspension-college-basketball|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pernetti characterized the suspension as "a complete removal from the program," but stated that Rice would return to Rutgers for the 2013-14 season pending a review of his behavior.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8744573/mike-rice-coach-rutgers-scarlet-knights-suspended-three-games-fined Mike Rice suspended, fined $50K]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed dramatically on April 2, 2013, when [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' aired several hours of video from Rice's practices. According to ESPN, the video, provided to Pernetti by then-assistant coach [[Eric Murdock]], showed Rice berating, pushing, kicking, cursing, using [[homophobia|homophobic]] slurs, and throwing basketballs at players during practices.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/03/rutgers-fire-basketball-coach-mike-rice Rutgers' firing of coach Mike Rice exposes a toxic locker-room culture], 3 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock said that he first told Pernetti about the abuse in the summer of 2012, but Pernetti took no action until he and other Rutgers officials saw the video in December. Murdock claims he was fired in July for reporting the abuse, and sued Rutgers for wrongful termination.&lt;ref&gt;via [[ESPN]]. [http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9125796/practice-video-shows-rutgers-basketball-coach-mike-rice-berated-pushed-used-slurs-players "Rutgers' Rice Berates Players at Practice"], April 2, 2013. Accessed April 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; An independent investigation found that there was insufficient evidence to support Murdock's claims that Rice created a hostile work environment. It also found the video was not in context, since it depicted practices from Rice's first year at Rutgers. However, it did find that Rice's actions brought "shame and disgrace" to Rutgers–on paper, grounds to fire Rice for cause regardless of the merits of Murdock's claims.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/sports/ncaabasketball/rutgers-officials-long-knew-of-coach-mike-rices-actions.html|title=Rutgers Officials Long Knew of Coach’s Actions|author1=Steve Eder|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernetti later said that his gut feeling had been to fire Rice on the spot, but ultimately concluded that Rutgers policy would not justify a firing.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The video touched off a nationwide outcry, with [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Chris Christie]] condemning Rice's behavior, and [[New Jersey General Assembly|State Assembly]] Speaker [[Sheila Oliver]] among many demanding that Rice be fired.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN. [http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9128825/rutgers-scarlet-knights-fire-coach-mike-rice-wake-video-scandal Rutgers fires coach Mike Rice]&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Rutgers fired Rice as head coach.&lt;ref name="ricefired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=13041#.UVw93KLqk84 |title=Mike Rice Relieved of Duties at Rutgers University |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406045910/http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=13041 |archivedate=April 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The Star-Ledger|The (Newark) Star-Ledger]]'', the move came after school president [[Robert L. Barchi|Robert Barchi]] saw the video for the first time, although he had signed off on Pernetti's decision to suspend Rice in December. When Barchi saw the video, he called in Pernetti and told him that Rice had to leave immediately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/mike_rice_fired_rutgers_univer.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Barchi held Pernetti responsible for the debacle, and forced Pernetti's resignation two days later.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409095655/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sullivan_For_days_Rutgers_athletic_director_knew_he_would_have_to_go.html|title=For days, Rutgers athletic director knew he would have to go|author1=Tara Sullivan|publisher=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post-mortem of the circumstances leading to Rice's firing, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Rutgers officials were so focused on whether Rice created a hostile work environment for his assistants that they ignored "the larger question" of whether Rice's behavior toward his players in and of itself demanded his firing.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

{{About|moral absolutism as a theory of [[normative ethics]]|moral absolutism as a theory of [[meta-ethics]]|Moral universalism}}
{{multiple issues|{{one source|date=January 2015}}
{{original research|date=January 2015}}}}

'''Moral absolutism''' is an [[Ethics|ethical]] view that all [[action (philosophy)|actions]] are intrinsically right or wrong. Stealing, for instance, might be considered to be always [[Immorality|immoral]], even if done for the well-being of others (e.g., stealing food to feed a starving family), and even if it does in the end promote such a good. Moral absolutism stands in contrast to other categories of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] such as [[consequentialism]], which holds that the [[morality]] (in the wide sense) of an act depends on the consequences or the context of the act.

Moral absolutism is not the same as [[moral universalism]]. Universalism holds merely that what is right or wrong is independent of custom or opinion (as opposed to [[moral relativism]]), but not necessarily that what is right or wrong is independent of context or consequences (as in absolutism). Moral universalism is compatible with moral absolutism, but also positions such as consequentialism. [[Louis Pojman]] gives the following definitions to distinguish the two positions of moral absolutism and universalism:&lt;ref name="PojmanDefense"&gt;Pojman, L. P. ''A Defense of Ethical Objectivism'' (p. 50).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral absolutism: There is at least one principle that ought never to be violated.
* Moral objectivism: There is a fact of the matter as to whether any given action is morally permissible or impermissible: a fact of the matter that does not depend solely on social custom or individual acceptance.

Ethical theories which place strong emphasis on [[rights]] and [[duty]], such as the [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], are often forms of moral absolutism, as are many [[religion|religious]] moral codes.

==Religion==
Moral absolutism may be understood in a strictly secular context, as in many forms of deontological [[moral rationalism]]. However, many religions have morally absolutist positions as well, regarding their system of morality as [[divine command theory|deriving from divine commands]]. Therefore, they regard such a moral system as absolute, (usually) perfect, and unchangeable. Many secular philosophies also take a morally absolutist stance, arguing that absolute laws of morality are inherent in the nature of human beings, the nature of life in general, or the universe itself. For example, someone who believes absolutely in [[nonviolence]] considers it wrong to use violence even in self-defense.

[[Catholic philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], but draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]], adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal.{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">A '''moral hierarchy''' is a [[hierarchy]] by which actions are ranked by their [[morality]], with respect to a [[moral code]]. 

It also refers to a relationship – such as teacher/pupil or [[guru]]/disciple – in which one party is taken to have greater moral awareness than the other;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j31/moral-hierarchy.asp Moral hierarchy] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081122224253/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j31/moral-hierarchy.asp |date=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the beneficial hierarchy of parent/child or doctor/patient.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Steiner, in ''The Radical Therapist'' (1974) p. 40-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohlberg==

[[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]] have been read as creating a hierarchy of increasing moral complexity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianwilliamson.id.au/cit/level1/psych1/kohlberg.pdf Society and the Highest Stage of Moral Development]&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from the premoral at the bottom, through the midrange of conventionalism, up to the apex of self-selected morality.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (1976) p. 119-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar fashion, [[Robin Skynner]] viewed moral ideas (such as the 'myths' of [[Charis Katakis]]) as being interpretable at different levels, depending on the degree of mental health attained;&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (1994) p. 247-54&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Eric Berne]] saw the three [[Transactional analysis#Key ideas|ego states]] of Parent/Adult/Child as falling naturally into a moral hierarchy universally respected in both time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy'' (1961) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dante==

[[Dante]]'s universe was structured in a hierarchy of moral sins and moral virtues,&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Jackson, ''The Word and its Witness'' (1999) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; the stratified circles of Hell reaching down for example from the self-indulgent sins at the higher levels, to those of violence below, and the fraudulent at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell'' (1975) p. 75 and p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confucianism==

The [[Confucius|Confucian]] concept of a moral hierarchy traditionally served as a check on arbitrary power in China.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Levinson, ''Confucian China and its Modern Fate'' 2 (1965) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably at least, the concept of a moral hierarchy still influences China's view of its place in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Z &amp; S Shih, ''China's Just World'' (1993) p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics charge that the notion of a moral hierarchy is untenable in cases spanning multiple cultures, because moral codes are not equal but different, and therefore there is no way of showing that certain codes are [[Morality|superior]] to others.

Proponents of Kohlberg argue against such a relativistic view of morality, however, by pointing to cross-cultural evidence from more than 30 societies supporting the concept of a hierarchy of levels of moral complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianwilliamson.id.au/cit/level1/psych1/kohlberg.pdf Society...]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nonkilling''' refers to the absence of killing, threats to kill, and conditions conducive to killing in human society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18 Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the use of the term in the academic world refers mostly to the killing of human beings, it is sometimes extended to include the killing of animals and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Kool and Rita Agrawal, "The Psychology of Nonkilling", in ''Toward a Nonkilling Paradigm'', edited by Joám Evans Pim. Honolulu: Center for Global Nonkilling, 2009 .&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case for the traditional use of the term "nonkilling" (or "non-killing") as part of [[Buddhist ethics]], as expressed in the first precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]],&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 187. Buddhist Scriptures in Pali language have explicit reference to nonviolence and nonkilling: monks should not only themselves abstain from killing but should also refrain from encouraging other people to kill themselves (Vinayapitaka III: .71-74)&lt;/ref&gt; and in similar terms throughout world spiritual traditions. (See [[:en:wikiversity:School:Nonkilling studies#Program on Nonkilling Spiritual Traditions|Nonkilling studies]]). Significantly, "nonkilling" has also been used recently in the "Charter for a World without Violence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/CHARTER/charter.htm 8th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, ''Charter for a World without Violence.'' Rome, December 15, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510024109/http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/CHARTER/charter.htm |date=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the 8th World Summit of [[Nobel Peace Laureate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"To address all forms of violence we encourage scientific research in the fields of human interaction and dialogue and we invite participation from the academic, scientific and religious communities to aid us in the transition to nonviolent, and nonkilling societies".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
In analysis of its causes, nonkilling encompasses the concepts of [[peace]] (absence of war and conditions conducive to war), [[nonviolence]] (psychological, physical, and structural), and [[ahimsa]] (noninjury in thought, word and deed).&lt;ref name="eolss.net"&gt;"Nonkilling Global Society", in Peace Building, edited by [[Ada Aharoni]], in ''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)'', Developed under the auspices of the [[UNESCO]], 2005, [http://www.eolss.net Eolss Publishers, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt; Not excluding any of the latter, nonkilling provides a distinct approach characterized by the measurability of its goals and the open-ended nature of its realization. While the usage of terms such as "nonviolence" and "peace" often follow the classical form of argument through abstract ideas leading to passivity, killing (and its opposite, nonkilling),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Approach==
On the other hand, nonkilling does not set any predetermined path for the achievement of a killing-free society in the same way as some ideologies and spiritual traditions that foster the restraint from the taking of life do. As an open-ended approach it appeals to infinite human creativity and variability, encouraging continuous explorations in the fields of education, research, social action and policy making, by developing a broad range of scientific, institutional, educational, political, economic and spiritual alternatives to human killing. Also, in spite of its specific focus, nonkilling also tackles broader social issues.&lt;ref name="nonkilling.org"&gt;http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to psychological aggression, physical assault, and torture intended to terrorize by manifest or latent threat to life, nonkilling implies removal of their psychosocial causes. In relation to killing of humans by socioeconomic structural conditions that are the product of direct lethal reinforcement as well as the result of diversion of resources for purposes of killing, nonkilling implies removal of lethality-linked deprivations. In relation to threats to the viability of the biosphere, nonkilling implies absence of direct attacks upon life-sustaining resources as well as cessation of indirect degradation associated with lethality. In relation to forms of accidental killing, nonkilling implies creation of social and technological conditions conducive to their elimination.&lt;ref name="eolss.net"/&gt;

In a broad conception, nonkilling opposes [[aggression]], [[assassination]], [[autogenocide]], [[contract killing]], [[corporate manslaughter]], [[cultural genocide]], [[capital punishment]], [[democide]], [[Domestic violence|domestic killings]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[ethnocide]], [[femicide]], [[feticide]], [[gendercide]], [[genocide]], [[honor killing]], [[Human sacrifice|ritual killings]], [[infanticide]], [[language death|linguicide]], [[mass murder]], [[murder–suicide]], [[Human extinction#Omnicide|omnicide]], [[policide]], [[politicide]], [[regicide]], [[school shooting]]s, [[structural violence]], [[suicide]], [[terrorism]], [[thrill killing]], [[tyrannicide]], [[violence]], [[war]], and other forms of killing, direct, indirect or structural.

==Data==
In his book ''[[Nonkilling Global Political Science]]'', [[Glenn D. Paige]] estimated that less than 0.5 percent of all humans that ever existed actually killed other humans.&lt;ref name="nonkilling.org"/&gt; Also, anthropological evidence points out that in certain societies and cultures killing is down to statistically insignificant levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/ peacefulsocieties.org]&lt;/ref&gt; As humans lived exclusively as hunter-gatherers — a form of existence that epitomizes the attributes of a nonkilling society — for 99 percent of their existence, it is also apparent that levels of violence and killing have also been very low during most of the history of ''Homo sapiens sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some philosophers, such as [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Descartes]], have hypothesized that the feelings of '''pain (or suffering) and pleasure''' are part of a continuum.

There is strong evidence of biological connections between the neurochemical pathways used for the perception of both [[pain]] and [[pleasure]], as well as other psychological rewards.

==Perception of pain==

===Sensory input system===

From a stimulus-response perspective, the perception of physical pain starts with the [[nociceptors]], a type of physiological receptor that transmits neural signals to the brain when activated. These receptors are commonly found in the skin, membranes, deep fascias, mucosa, connective tissues of visceral organs, ligaments and articular capsules, muscles, tendons, periosteum, and arterial vessels.&lt;ref name="Almeida"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15053950 Almeida, T. F., Roizenblatt, S., &amp; Tufik, S. (2004). "Afferent pain pathways: a neuroanatomical review." ''Brain Research'', 1000(1-2), 40-56.]&lt;/ref&gt; Once stimuli are received, the various afferent action potentials are triggered and pass along various fibers and axons of these nociceptive nerve cells into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord through the dorsal roots. A neuroanatomical review of the pain pathway, "Afferent pain pathways" by Almeida, describes various specific nociceptive pathways of the spinal cord: [[spinothalamic tract]], [[spinoreticular tract]], spinomesencephalic tract, spinoparabrachial tract, spinohypothalamic tract, spinocervical tract, postsynaptic pathway of the [[human vertebral column|spinal column]].&lt;ref name="Almeida" /&gt;

===Neural coding and modulation===

Activity in many parts of the brain is associated with pain perception. Some of the known parts for the ascending pathway include the [[thalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[midbrain]], [[lentiform nucleus]], [[somatosensory cortex|somatosensory cortices]], insular, prefrontal, anterior and parietal cingulum.&lt;ref name=Apkarian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apkarian|first=A. V.|author2=Bushnell, M. C. |author3=Treede, R. D. |author4=Zubieta, J. K. |title=Human brain mechanisms of pain perception and regulation in health and disease|journal=[[European Journal of Pain]]|year=2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=463–484|url=http://www.apkarianlab.northwestern.edu/publications/Papers/200508_Apkarian.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, there are also the descending pathways for the modulation of pain sensation. One of the brainstem regions responsible for this is the [[periaqueductal gray]] of the midbrain, which both relieves pain by behavior as well as inhibits the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Other brainstem sites, such as the parabrachial nucleus, the [[dorsal raphe nucleus|dorsal raphe]], [[locus coeruleus]], and the medullary reticular formation also mediate pain relief and use many different neurotransmitters to either facilitate or inhibit activity of the neurons in the dorsal horn. These neurotransmitters include [[norepinephrine|noradrenaline]], [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[acetylcholine]].

==Perception of pleasure==

Pleasure can be considered from many different perspectives, from physiological (such as the hedonic hotspots that are activated during the experience) to psychological (such as the study of behavioral responses towards reward). Pleasure has also often been compared to, or even defined by many neuroscientists as, a form of alleviation of pain.&lt;ref name=Kringelbach2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kringelbach |first=M. L. |author2=Berridge, K. C. |title=Towards a functional neuroanatomy of pleasure and happiness |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2009 |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=479–487 |url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&amp;labs/berridge/publications/Kringelbach%20&amp;%20Berridge%202009%20Toward%20functional%20neuroanatomy%20of%20pleasure%20and%20happiness%20TICS.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.006 |pmid=19782634 |pmc=2767390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural coding and modulation===
Pleasure has been studied in the systems of taste, olfaction, auditory (musical), visual (art), and sexual activity. Well known hedonic hotspots involved in the processing of pleasure include the [[nucleus accumbens]], posterior ventral pallidum, [[amygdala]], other cortical and subcortical regions.&lt;ref name=Berridge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berridge|first=K. C.|author2=Kringelbach, M. L.|title=Affective neuroscience of pleasure: reward in humans and animals|journal=[[Psychopharmacology (journal)|Psychopharmacology]] |year=2008|volume=199 |issue=3|pages=457–480 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h10384324x566083/fulltext.pdf |doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1099-6|pmid=18311558|pmc=3004012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The prefrontal and limbic regions of the [[neocortex]], particularly the orbitofrontal region of the prefrontal cortex, [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and the [[insular cortex]] have all been suggested to be pleasure causing substrates in the brain.&lt;ref name="Kringelbach2" /&gt;

==Psychology of pain and pleasure (reward-punishment system)==

One approach to evaluating the relationship between pain and pleasure is to consider these two systems as a reward-punishment based system. When pleasure is perceived, one associates it with reward. When pain is perceived, one associates with punishment. Evolutionarily, this makes sense, because often, actions that result in pleasure or chemicals that induce pleasure work towards restoring homeostasis in the body. For example, when the body is hungry, the pleasure of rewarding food to one-self restores the body back to a balanced state of replenished energy. Like so, this can also be applied to pain, because the ability to perceive pain enhances both avoidance and defensive mechanisms that were, and still are, necessary for survival.&lt;ref name="Esch"&gt;[http://www.nel.edu/pdf_/NEL250404R01_Esch-Stefano_p_.pdf Esch, T., &amp; Stefano, G. B. (2004). "The neurobiology of pleasure, reward processes, addiction and their health implications." ''Neuroendocrinology Letters'', 25(4), 235-251.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opioid and dopamine systems in pain and pleasure==
The neural systems to be explored when trying to look for a neurochemical relationship between pain and pleasure are the [[opioid]] and [[dopamine]] systems. The opioid system is responsible for the actual experience of the sensation, whereas the dopamine system is responsible for the anticipation or expectation of the experience. Opioids work in the modulation of pleasure or pain relief by either blocking neurotransmitter release or by hyperpolarizing neurons by opening up a potassium channel which effectively temporarily blocks the neuron.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;[http://www.medaku.com/images/Dr_Fields_Opioids_Effect_Acu.pdf Fields, H. L. (2007). "Understanding how opioids contribute to reward and analgesia." ''Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.'' 32, 242–246.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pain and pleasure on a continuum==

===Arguments for pain and pleasure on a continuum===
It has been suggested as early as 4th century BC that pain and pleasure occurs on a continuum. [[Aristotle]] claims this antagonistic relationship in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'':

:::"We may lay it down that Pleasure is a movement, a movement by which the soul as a whole is consciously brought into its normal state of being; and that Pain is the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-11.html Aristotle. ''Rhetoric'', 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes pain and pleasure very much like a push-pull concept; human beings will move towards something that causes pleasure and will move away from something that causes pain.

====Common neuroanatomy====
On an anatomical level, it can be shown the source for the modulation of both pain and pleasure originates from neurons in the same locations, including the [[amygdala]], the [[globus pallidus|pallidum]], and the [[nucleus accumbens]]. Not only have Leknes and Tracey, two leading neuroscientists in the study of pain and pleasure, concluded that pain and reward processing involve many of the same regions of the brain, but also that the functional relationship lies in that pain decreases pleasure and rewards increase analgesia, which is the relief from pain.&lt;ref name=Leknes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leknes|first=S.|author2=Tracey, I.|title=A common neurobiology for pain and pleasure|journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]|year=2008|volume=9|issue=4|pages=314–320|doi=10.1038/nrn2333|url=http://66.199.228.237/boundary/Sexual_Addiction/pain_pleasure_endogenous_opiods_sex.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against pain and pleasure on a continuum===

====Asymmetry between pain and pleasure====

Thomas Szasz, the late Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York, explored how pain and pleasure are not opposites ends of a spectrum in his 1957 book, "Pain and Pleasure -a study of bodily feelings".

Szasz notes that although we often refer to pain and pleasure as opposites in such a way, that this is incorrect; we have receptors for pain, but none in the same way for pleasure; and so it makes sense to ask "where is the pain?" but not "where is the pleasure?".  With this vantage point established, the author delves into the topics of metaphorical pain and of legitimacy, of power relations, and of communications, and of myriad others.&lt;ref&gt;Szasz, T.S. (1957) ''Pain and Pleasure – a study of bodily feelings''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary hypotheses for the relationship between pain and pleasure==
Whether or not pain and pleasure are indeed on a continuum, it still remains scientifically supported that parts of the neural pathways for the two perceptions overlap. There is also scientific evidence that one may have opposing effects on the other. So why would it be evolutionarily advantageous to human beings to develop a relationship between the two perceptions at all?

South African neuroscientists presented evidence that there was  a physiological link on a continuum between pain and pleasure in 1980. First, the Neuroscientists, Gillman and Lichtigfeld demonstrated that there were two endogenous endorphin systems, one pain producing and the other pain relieving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman M A,|first=M. A.|last2=Kok|first2=L|last3=Lichtigfeld|first3=F. J.|year=1980|title=Paradoxical effect of naloxone on nitrous oxide analgesia in man|url=|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|volume=61|pages=175–177|via=|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(80)90160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|last2=Lichtigfeld|first2=FJ|year=1981|title=A comparison of the effect of morphine sulphate and nitrous oxide analgesia on chronic pain states in man.|url=|journal=J Neurol Sci|volume=45|pages=41–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman MA|first=|last2=Kimmel|first2=I|last3=Lichtigfeld FJ|first3=FJ|year=1981|title=The dual system hypothesis of pain perception.|url=|journal=Neurolog Res|volume=3|pages=317–327|via=|doi=10.1080/01616412.1981.11739607}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later they showed that these two systems might also be involved in addiction, which is initially pursued, presumably for the pleasure generating or pain relieving actions of the addictive substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichtigfeld|first=FJ|last2=Gillman|first2=MA.|year=1982|title=The treatment of alcoholic withdrawal states with oxygen and nitrous oxide.|url=|journal=S Afr Med J|volume=61|pages=349–351|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|last2=Lichtigfeld|first2=FJ|year=1984|title=. The opioid and anti-opioid system in addiction.|url=|journal=S Afr Med J|volume=66|pages=592|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after they provided evidence that the endorphins system was involved in sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillman|first=MA|last2=Lichtigfeld|first2=FJ|year=1983|title=The effect of nitrous oxide and naloxone on orgasm in human females. A preliminary report|url=|journal=J Sex Res|volume=19|pages=49–57|via=|doi=10.1080/00224498309551168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Kringelbach suggests that this relationship between pain and pleasure would be evolutionarily efficient, because it was necessary to know whether or not to avoid or approach something for survival. According to Dr. [[Norman Doidge]], the brain is limited in the sense that it tends to focus on the most used pathways. Therefore, having a common pathway for pain and pleasure could have simplified the way in which human beings have interacted with the environment (Dr. [[Morten Kringelbach]], personal communication, October 24, 2011).

Leknes and Tracey offer two theoretical perspectives to why a relationship could be evolutionarily advantageous.

===Opponent process theory===
The [[opponent-process theory]] is a model that views two components as being pairs that are opposite to each other, such that if one component is experienced, the other component will be repressed. Therefore, an increase in pain should bring about a decrease in pleasure, and a decrease in pain should bring about an increase in pleasure or pain relief. This simple model serves the purpose of explaining the evolutionarily significant role of homeostasis in this relationship. This is evident since both seeking pleasure and avoiding pain are important for survival. Leknes and Tracey provide an example:&lt;ref name="Leknes2"/&gt;

:::"In the face of a large food reward, which can only be obtained at the cost of a small amount of pain, for instance, it would be beneficial if the pleasurable food reduced pain unpleasantness."&lt;ref name="Leknes2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leknes S. |author2=Brooks J. C. W. |author3=Wiech K. |author4=Tracey I. | year = 2008 | title = Pain relief as an opponent process: a psychophysical investigation | url = | journal = European Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 794–801 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06380.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then suggest that perhaps a common currency for which human beings determine the importance of the motivation for each perception can allow them to be weighed against each other in order to make a decision best for survival.&lt;ref name="Leknes2"/&gt;

===Motivation-decision model===
The Motivation-Decision Model, suggested by [http://archives.drugabuse.gov/meetings/painopioides/pdf/fields.pdf Fields], is centered around the concept that decision processes are driven by motivations of highest priority. The model predicts that in the case that there is anything more important than pain for survival will cause the human body to mediate pain by activating the descending pain modulation system described earlier.&lt;ref name="Leknes" /&gt;  Thus, it is suggested that human beings have developed the unconscious ability to endure pain or sometimes, even relieve pain if it can be more important for survival to gain a larger reward. It may have been more advantageous to link the pain and pleasure perceptions together to be able to reduce pain to gain a reward necessary for fitness, such as childbirth. Like the opponent-process theory, if the body can induce pleasure or pain relief to decrease the effect of pain, it would allow human beings to be able to make the best evolutionary decisions for survival.

==Clinical applications==

===Related diseases===
The following neurological and/or mental diseases have been linked to forms of pain or anhedonia: [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[addiction]], [[cluster headache]], [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, A.L., Pereira, E.A., Aziz, T.Z.

[[File:Parkinson surgery.jpg|thumb|250px|Insertion of electrode during [[Deep Brain Stimulation]] surgery using a [[Stereotactic surgery#How it works#Types of stereotactic frame systems|stereotactic frame]]]]

===Deep brain stimulation===

[[Deep brain stimulation]] involves the electrical stimulation of deep brain structures by electrodes implanted into the brain. The effects of this neurosurgery has been studied in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[tremor]]s, [[dystonia]], [[epilepsy]], depression, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], [[cluster headache]] and [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; A fine electrode is inserted into the targeted area of the brain and secured to the skull. This is attached to a pulse generator which is implanted elsewhere on the body under the skin. The surgeon then turns the frequency of the electrode to the voltage and frequency desired. Deep brain stimulation has been shown in several studies to both induce pleasure or even addiction as well as ameliorate pain. For chronic pain, lower frequencies (about 5–50&amp;nbsp;Hz) have produced analgesic effects, whereas higher frequencies (about 120–180&amp;nbsp;Hz) have alleviated or stopped pyramidal tremors in Parkinson's patients.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

There is still further research necessary into how and why exactly DBS works. However, by understanding the relationship between pleasure and pain, procedures like these can be used to treat patients suffering from a high intensity or longevity of pain. So far, DBS has been recognized as a treatment for [[Parkinson's disease]], [[tremor]]s, and [[dystonia]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In October 2005, the report focused on the detention of suspects in the [[War on Terror]], including those held in [[Guantánamo Bay]].  This particular Periodic Report is significant as the first official response of the U.S. government to allegations that prisoners are mistreated in Guantánamo Bay and in [[Afghanistan]]. The report denies those allegations. The report does not address detainees held by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

In [[philosophy]] and [[bioethics]], '''potential (future) person''' (in plural, sometimes termed '''potential people''') has been defined as an entity which is not currently a person but which is capable of developing into a person, given certain biologically and/or technically possible conditions.&lt;ref name=warren1977&gt;''Do Potential People Have Moral Rights?'' By Mary Anne Warren. Canadian Journal of Philosophy. Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jun., 1977), pp. 275-289 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40230690]&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''unconceived''' has also been used in a similar sense, but does not necessarily include the capability of being conceived or developing into a person.

==Definitions==
In 1977, Canadian Philosopher Mary Anne Warren discussed various definitions for ''potential people''.  Most simply, a ''potential person'' could be defined as the currently existing genetic material that will constitute them, such as a sexually viable egg and sperm cell taken together, also when still being located in separate places.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;  Potential people may also be defined from reproductive capability, which also includes the presence of other necessary factors for becoming a person,&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; such as the availability of a womb to grow in, the will and means of parents to conceive, or even the care after birth to raise the individual into a complete sentient being. Thus the progression towards existence of a potential person usually lies mainly in the maturation of previous people to develop the will and ability to become potential parents. 

In this sense, destroying sperm cells, for instance, does not significantly reduce the number of potential persons, because, provided the will and other means to conceive a person remains the same, there is still the possibility to extract the genetic information from remaining sperm cells or, theoretically, even from somatic cells such as skin cells (by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]). Actually, in this sense, for a man that intends to conceive only two children, the billions on sperm cells he produces throughout his lifetime may, taken together, still only be regarded as a contributing factor to a maximum of two potential persons. 

If including the will to conceive as a necessary component of a potential person, the mere certain decision of a woman to not let an embryo grow inside her uterus may be regarded as sufficient to disqualify that embryo as a potential person, because a will that is strong enough would make that woman turn to even [[unsafe abortion]], and a certain future abortion makes it certain that there won't be a necessary uterus for the embryo to grow inside to become a person. 

Strangely, in such a view, an act of a woman in changing her mind from abortion to proceeding with the pregnancy may be regarded as creating a potential person rather than saving the life of one, but other views may be applied once the [[beginning of human personhood|beginning of actual human personhood]] has been reached. When taking this view to a larger scale, a population that is very intent on reproducing can be expected to constitute a larger number of potential persons than a population refusing to reproduce, all other factors being equal. When there is only one or a few factors absent to constitute a potential person, that entity may still be termed "a potential person except for...", but the ensuing arguments from this may differ.

The people of the twenty-fifth century have been taken as an example of potential persons, because, although their particular [[gamete]]s or [[embryo]]s do not currently exist, there is reproductive capability of the currently living people and [[resource]]s to make the future existence of those people possible.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; The mere likelihood of future existence is usually regarded as sufficient to apply the term, as there is a risk that, for example, the people of the twenty-fifth century will never exist because of an event of [[human extinction]].&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; 

The [[beginning of human personhood]], where a potential person is instead regarded as a proper person, is a concept currently debated by religion and philosophy. However, there could theoretically be no beginning of ''potential'' human personhood because it is dependent on the reproductive capability of the previous generation, which, in turn, is dependent on the reproductive capability of the generation before that etc. etc.

==Value of potential persons==
It has been argued that the mere potential of becoming a person confers moral rights on a [[prima facie]] basis,&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=hare1975p212-213&gt;Page 212 and 213 in: ''Abortion and the Golden Rule'' By R. M. Hare. Philosophy and Public Affairs. Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1975), pp. 201-222 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265083]&lt;/ref&gt; or by holding that they are really in some sense actuals.&lt;ref name=bigelow/&gt; On the other hand, there is the opinion that the potential itself is not of significance.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;

Among views that reject a prima facie right to potential people, there are, on one hand, claims that potential people are non-actuals and cannot be either benefited or harmed.&lt;ref name=bigelow/&gt; Also, there are views that, although a potential person has no value in the present, the rightfulness of actions that we make today are still dependent on how they will affect such people in the future, and that we have moral obligations for future generations.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; An argument for such a view is in finding it logical that the value of an action can be seen as equivalent to the total [[instrumental value]] at any time of the chain of events that that action started, which in turn can be seen as equivalent to the total [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of whatever [[ends-in-themselves]] are generated or benefited at the end of that chain of events. For example, a remote friend has a baby, and is about to conceive another, and, for example, happiness is taken as the end-in-itself and receiving a toy is taken as an instrument to it, then, the yet unconceived baby may not be regarded as currently having ethic value, in contrast to the existing baby, but nevertheless, the instrumental value in the action of posting a toy to either of them can be regarded as equivalent, because either alternative would generate equal amount of intrinsic value in the form of happiness in the future, with some modification for, for example, the risk of failing to conceive again, and the burden for the post office or parent in storing the toy until, at least, birth. In such a view, it is uncertain to which extent a lesser probability of becoming a person affects the moral value of that potential person, putting uncertainty to claiming, for example, that a potential person with 50% probability of becoming a person should be treated as having 50% the value of an actual person.

===Bringing people into existence===
Even among views that the rightfulness of current actions depend on how they will affect yet non-existent people, there may still be differences regarding the justification of bringing people into existence in the first place, or the prevention of it.

A major factor in this issue is whether ends-in-themselves are generally regarded to optimally be maximized or minimized on a total basis or as an average among the people (such as, for example, [[average and total utilitarianism|total versus average utilitarism]]). A view that favors maximizing an end-in-itself on a total basis may consider it beneficial to have more people brought into existence by the motivation that there are more people to generate it. On the other hand, a view that favors maximizing an end-in-itself on an average basis has suggested that the benefit or harm in an action that supports or prevents bringing a potential person into existence depends on whether that person, on average, will constitute or generate more or less end-in-itself than the average.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; For example, if happiness is regarded as the end-in-itself, then, it has been claimed to be morally objectionable to bring a potential person into existence that is predicted to be very unhappy.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;

Another factor that has been suggested is the possible positive or negative value of nonexistence, which can be regarded as weighting against or adding to the values of existence when considering the rightfulness of bringing potential people into existence.&lt;ref name=bigelow&gt;''Morality, Potential Persons and Abortion''. By John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. American Philosophical Quarterly. Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr., 1988), pp. 173-181 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20014236]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Practical consequences====
The personal opinion on the value of bringing potential people into existence may be a major factor in many issues, including:
*[[Natalism]] (promoting [[human reproduction]]) or [[antinatalism]]
*Issues of [[optimum population]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], or [[population decline]]
*[[Pro-choice]] or [[pro-life]]

From a view that favors the act of bringing people into existence, it has been argued that avoidance from conceiving a child when there are prerequisites for raising it is comparable to causing the death of one.&lt;ref name=Savulescu2002&gt;''Abortion, embryo destruction and the future of value argument'' By J Savulescu. J Med Ethics 2002 28: 133-135. {{doi|10.1136/jme.28.3.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it has been argued that contraception, and even the decision not to procreate at all could be regarded as immoral on a similar basis as [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; However, holding value in potential persons does not necessarily decrease support for [[abortion]] rights. It has been regarded as justified to induce abortion of a severely disabled fetus in favor for conceiving a new child. However, a major reason that has been given to be cautious about performing abortion with such motivation is the fact that the likelihood of successfully bringing the new child into existence is substantially lower, as the parents may separate, one of them may become sterile, or they may change their minds about having children.&lt;ref name=hare1975p212-213/&gt; A comparable situation is the abortion of an [[unintended pregnancy]] in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions.&lt;ref name=Savulescu2002/&gt;

{{Sociology}}
In [[social science]] and [[politics]], '''power''' is the ability to [[Social influence|influence]] or outright [[Social control|control]] the behaviour of people. The term "[[authority]]" is often used for power perceived as [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] by the [[social structure]]. Power can be seen as evil or [[injustice|unjust]], this sort of primitive exercise of power is historically [[wikt:endemic|endemic]] to humans, however as social beings the same concept is seen as good and as something inherited or given for exercising [[Humanism|humanistic]] objectives that will help, enable and move people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Luthans|author2=Brett C. Luthans|author3=Kyle W. Luthans|title=Organizational Behavior: An Evidence Based Approach, 13th Ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogYoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|date=1 June 2015|publisher=IAP Inc|isbn=978-1-68123-121-1|pages=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it is derived by the factors of interdependence between two entities and the environment. In &lt;!--the corporate environment--&gt;[[business]], the ethical instrumentality of power is achievement, and as such it is a [[zero-sum game]]. In simple terms it can be expressed as being "upward" or "downward". With downward power, a company's superior influences subordinates for attaining organizational goals. When a company exerts upward power, it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of their leader or leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schein |first=Larry E. Greiner, Virginia E. |title=Power and organization development : mobilizing power to implement change |date=1988 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading, Mass. |isbn=0201121859 |edition= Repr. with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of power need not involve force or the threat of force ([[coercion]]). On one side, it closely resembles what egalitarian and consensual nations (Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) might term as "influence," contrasted with the extreme what some authors identify as "intimidation" in capitalist nations, a means by which power is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handy |first=Charles |title=Understanding organizations |date=1993 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=9780140156034 |edition= 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of using power without oppression is the concept "[[soft power]]," as compared to [[hard power]].

Much of the recent [[Sociology|sociological]] debate about power revolves around the issue of its means to enable{{spndash}}in other words, power as a means to make [[social actions]] possible as much as it may constrain or prevent them. The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] saw power as a [[Structuralism|structural]] expression of "a complex strategic situation in a given [[social setting]]"&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Collin (1980). Forward. In  ''Power/Knowledge'', Foucault, Michel, Pantheon Books, New York, 1980. {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires both constraint and enablement.

== Theories ==

=== Five bases ===
{{Main|French and Raven's five bases of power}}
Social psychologists [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]], in a now-classic study (1959),&lt;ref&gt;French, J.R.P., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). 'The bases of social power,' in D. Cartwright (ed.) Studies in Social Power. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press. {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.

According to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs which holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely. Conceived this way, power is fundamentally ''relative'' – it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship, and requires B's recognition of a quality in A which would motivate B to change in the way A intends. A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship, to effect the desired outcome. Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A's own power.

French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities, while not excluding other minor categories. Further bases have since been adduced – in particular by [[Gareth Morgan (author)|Gareth Morgan]] in his 1986 book, ''[[Images of Organization]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1873&amp;context=utk_graddiss|title=Everyday Experiences of Power|date=August 2010|first=Kelly E.|last=de Moll|page=22|format=PDF|publisher=University of Tennessee|location=Knoxville, TN|type=Ph.D. dissertation|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legitimate power ====
{{Main|Legitimate power}}
Also called "positional power," it is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization. Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position. It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power such as a [[uniform]], a title, or an imposing physical office.

==== Referent power ====
{{Main|Referent power}}
Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build [[loyalty]]. It is based on the [[charisma]] and [[interpersonal skills]] of the power holder. A person may be admired because of specific personal trait, and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence. Here the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities, and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower. [[Nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] count towards an intangible sort of referent power. For example, soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country. This is the second least obvious power, but the most effective. Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for products endorsements, for example. The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement, although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management|date=2008|first1=Patrick J.|last1=Montana|first2=Bruce H.|last2=Charnov|edition= 4th|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJIQ2XGhneUC&amp;pg=PA257 257]|isbn=9780764139314|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=Hauppauge, NY|oclc=175290009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse is possible when someone that is likable, yet lacks integrity and honesty, rises to power, placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position. Referent power is unstable alone, and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect. When combined with other sources of power, however, it can help a person achieve great success.

==== Expert power ====

[[Expert]] power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise. Unlike the others, this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified. When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation, suggest solutions, use solid judgment, and generally out perform others, then people tend to listen to them. When individuals demonstrate expertise, people tend to trust them and respect what they say. As subject matter experts, their ideas will have more value, and others will look to them for [[leadership]] in that area.

==== Reward power ====
{{Main|Reward power}}
[[Reward system|Reward]] power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards, it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind such as benefits, time off, desired gifts, promotions or increases in pay or responsibility. This power is obvious but also ineffective if abused. People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or 'moving things too quickly'. If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants, there's a high probability that they'll do it. The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required. Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases, and managers often can't control promotions all by themselves. And even a CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions. So when somebody uses up available rewards, or the rewards don't have enough perceived value to others, their power weakens. (One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they're to have the same motivational impact. Even then, if rewards are given frequently, people can become satiated by the reward, such that it loses its effectiveness).

==== Coercive power ====
{{Main|Coercive power}}
{{See also|Coercive control}}
[[Coercive]] power is the application of negative influences. It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards. The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power. Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it. Threats and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] are common tools of coercion. Implying or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges, or given undesirable assignments – these are characteristics of using coercive power. Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting, and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership. This is a type of power is commonly seen in fashion industry by coupling with legitimate power, it is referred in the industry specific literature's as "glamorization of structural domination and exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/02/academic-exposing-ugly-reality-high-fashion-giulia-mensitieri&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles in interpersonal relationships ===
According to Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen in "Close encounters: Communication in Relationships":&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Laura K., and Peter A. Andersen. Close encounters: Communication in Relationships. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE, 2011. Print. p.267-261&lt;/ref&gt;
# Power as a Perception: Power is a perception in a sense that some people can have objective power, but still have trouble influencing others. People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others. Some people become influential even though they don't overtly use powerful behavior.
# Power as a Relational Concept: Power exists in relationships. The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one's partner. Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas.
# Power as Resource Based: Power usually represents a struggle over resources. The more scarce and valued resources are, the more intense and protracted are power struggles. The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand. However, scarce resource leads to power only if it's valued within a relationship.
# The Principle of Least Interest and Dependence Power: The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship. Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful, especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them. According to interdependence theory, quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship. The [[principle of least interest]] suggests that if a difference exists in the intensity of positive feelings between partners, the partner who feels the most positive is at a power disadvantage. There's an inverse relationship between interest in relationship and the degree of relational power.
# Power as [[Enabling]] or Disabling: Power can be enabling or disabling. Research{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} has been shown that people are more likely to have an enduring influence on others when they engage in dominant behavior that reflects [[social skill]] rather than [[intimidation]]. Personal power is protective against pressure and excessive [[Social influence|influence]] by others and/or situational stress. People who communicate through self-confidence and expressive, composed behavior tend to be successful in achieving their goals and maintaining good relationships. Power can be disabling when it leads to destructive patterns of communication.  This can lead to the chilling effect where the less powerful person often hesitates to communicate dissatisfaction, and the demand withdrawal pattern which is when one person makes demands and the other becomes defensive and withdraws(mawasha, 2006).Both effects have negative consequences for relational satisfaction.
# Power as a Prerogative: The prerogative principle states that the partner with more power can make and break the rules. Powerful people can violate norms, break relational rules, and manage interactions without as much penalty as powerless people. These actions may reinforce the powerful person's dependence power. In addition, the more powerful person has the prerogative to manage both verbal and nonverbal interactions. They can initiate conversations, change topics, interrupt others, initiate touch, and end discussions more easily than less powerful people. (See [[expressions of dominance]].)

=== Rational choice framework ===
[[Game theory]], with its foundations in the [[Neoclassical economics|Walrasian]] theory of [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]], is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships. One rational choice definition of power is given by [[Keith Dowding]] in his book ''Power''.

In rational choice theory, human individuals or groups can be modelled as 'actors' who choose from a 'choice set' of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes. An actor's 'incentive structure' comprises (its beliefs about) the costs associated with different actions in the choice set, and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes.

In this setting we can differentiate between:
# '''outcome power''' – the ability of an actor to bring about or help bring about outcomes;
# '''social power''' – the ability of an actor to change the incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes.

This framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others. For example, a 'powerful' actor can take options away from another's choice set; can change the relative costs of actions; can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome; or might simply change the other's beliefs about its incentive structure.

As with other models of power, this framework is neutral as to the use of 'coercion'. For example: a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions; so can a financial penalty in a 'voluntarily agreed' contract, or indeed a friendly offer.

=== Cultural hegemony ===
In the [[Marxism|Marxist]] tradition, the [[Italy|Italian]] writer [[Antonio Gramsci]] elaborated the role of [[ideology]] in creating a [[cultural hegemony]], which becomes a means of bolstering the power of [[capitalism]] and of the [[nation-state]]. Drawing on [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in [[The Prince]], and trying to understand why there had been no [[Communist]] revolution in [[Western Europe]], while it was claimed there had been one in [[Russia]], Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a [[centaur]], consisting of two halves. The back end, the beast, represented the more classic, material image of power, power through coercion, through brute force, be it physical or economic. But the capitalist hegemony, he argued, depended even more strongly on the front end, the human face, which projected power through 'consent'. In Russia, this power was lacking, allowing for a revolution. However, in Western Europe, specifically in [[Italy]], capitalism had succeeded in exercising ''consensual'' power, convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists. In this way revolution had been avoided.

While Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures, Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life. The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a '[[reserve army of labour]]'. In wartime it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks, while after the war the roles are easily reversed. Therefore, according to Barrett, the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women.&lt;ref&gt;Pip Jones, ''Introducing Social Theory'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 2008, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group. If the group conforms to the leader's commands, the leader's power over an individual is greatly enhanced while if the group does not conform the leader's power over an individual is nil.

=== Foucault ===
For [[Michel Foucault]], the real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents. No single human, group nor single actor runs the dispositif (machine or apparatus) but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible, ensuring its agents to do whatever is necessary. It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected that it remains elusive to 'rational' investigation. Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon]], entitled ''Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France'' (1778), but turns out to be written by his secretary [[Jean-Baptise Moheau]] (1745–1794) and by emphasizing [[Biologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] who constantly refers to [[Milieu]]s as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water air and light confirming the genus within the milieu, in this case the human species, relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu. This milieu(both artificial and natural) appears as a target of intervention for power according to Foucault which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty, territory and disciplinary space inter woven into from a social and political relations which function as a species (biological species).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Lectures at the College de France, 1977–78: Security, Territory, Population'', 2007, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault originated and developed the concept of "docile bodies" in his book ''Discipline and Punish.'' He writes, "A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32367111|title=Discipline and punish : the birth of the prison|last=1926-1984.|first=Foucault, Michel,|date=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679752552|edition= 2nd Vintage books |location=New York|oclc=32367111}}&lt;/ref&gt; " Foucault claims that there is a shift, during the 18th century, in which political power changed. Instead of using corporeal punishment in order to convince people to adhere to the laws of the day, Foucault says power becomes internalized during this period. Instead of watching someone be drawn and quartered in a public space, political power is exerted on individuals in a way that compels them to obey laws and rules on their own - without this show of force. He builds on the ideas of [[Jeremy Bentham]] regarding the [[Panopticon]] in which prison inmates are compelled to behave and control themselves because they might be in the view of the prison guard. The physical shape of the Panopticon creates a situation in which the prison guard need not be present for this to happen, because the mere possibility of the presence of the guard compels the prisoners to behave. Foucault takes this theory and makes it generalize to everyday life. He claims that this kind of surveillance is constant in modern society, and the populous at large enacts it. Therefore, everyone begins to control themselves and behave according to society's rules and norms.

Feminist philosophers took up Foucault's ideas regarding docile bodies and applied them to the different ways men and women are socialized to use their bodies. For one example, philosopher Sandra Bartky says in her essay, ""Foucault, Femininity, and the Modernization of Patriarchal Power" that “The disciplinary techniques through which the ‘docile bodies’ of women are constructed aim at a regulation that is perpetual and exhaustive - a regulation of the body’s size and contours, its appetite, posture, gestures and general comportment in space, and the appearance of each of its visible parts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartky, Sandra Lee. ''Foucault, femininity, and the modernization of patriarchal power''. na, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;" Bartky theorizes that there is a specific and relentless pressure on women when it comes to bodily movements and comportment; this "docility" manifests as women make themselves smaller, groom themselves in ways that make them appear more feminine, and control their bodily movements in order to be as minimally obtrusive as possible. She also cites diet, exercise, and skin care, among other processes, as sites in which the feminine body is made docile.

=== Clegg ===
[[Stewart Clegg]] proposes another three-dimensional model with his "circuits of power"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deji|2011|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA267 267]}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory. This model likens the production and organizing of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at "obligatory passage points" which are channels for [[empowerment]] or disempowerment.

=== Galbraith ===
[[John Kenneth Galbraith|JK Galbraith]] summarizes the types of power as being "condign" (based on force), "compensatory" (through the use of various resources) or "conditioned" (the result of [[persuasion]]), and their sources as "personality" (individuals), "property" (their material resources) and "organizational" (whoever sits at the top of an organisational power structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galbraith|first=John Kenneth|authorlink=John Kenneth Galbraith|title=[[The Anatomy of Power]]|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene Sharp ===
[[Gene Sharp]], an American professor of political science, believes that power depends ultimately on its bases. Thus a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates, laws and policies. Sharp cites the insight of [[Étienne de La Boétie]].

Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state – regardless of its particular structural organization – ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Gene|title=From dictatorship to democracy: A conceptual framework for liberation|publisher=The Albert Einstein Institution|location=East Boston, MA|url=http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf|format=PDF|date=May 2010|edition= 4th U.S.|isbn=978-1-880813-09-6}} (See [[From dictatorship to democracy|book article]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Björn Kraus ===
[[Björn Kraus]] deals with the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective upon power regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of [[constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] (named [[relational constructivism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heiko Kleve: ''Vom Erweitern der Möglichkeiten''. In: [[Bernhard Pörksen]] (ed.): ''Schlüsselwerke des Konstruktivismus''. VS-Verlag, Wiesbaden/Germany 2011. pp. 506–519, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power, he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all.&lt;ref name=Kraus2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Björn|title=Introducing a Model for Analyzing the Possibilities of Power, Help and Control|journal=Social Work &amp; Society|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:464-sws-582|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from [[Max Weber]]'s definition of power,&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber: ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.

By using this distinction, proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way, helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kraus2013&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|139 f.}} This perspective permits to get over an "either-or-position" (either there is power, or there isn't), which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories,&lt;ref&gt;Reimund Böse, Günter Schiepek: ''Systemische Theorie und Therapie: ein Handwörterbuch''.

Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main/Germany 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and to introduce the possibility of an "as well as-position".&lt;ref name=Kraus2013/&gt;{{Rp|120}}

=== Unmarked categories ===
The idea of ''unmarked categories'' originated in [[feminism]]. The theory analyzes the culture of the powerful. The powerful comprise those people in society with easy access to resources, those who can exercise power without considering their actions. For the powerful, their culture seems obvious; for the powerless, on the other hand, it remains out of reach, élite and expensive.

The ''unmarked category'' can form the identifying mark of the powerful. The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else. For most Western readers, it is posited that if a protagonist's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is [[Whites|Caucasian]]; if a sexual identity is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is [[heterosexual]]; if the gender of a body is not indicated, will be assumed by the reader that it is [[male]]; if a disability is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is able bodied, just as a set of examples.

One can often overlook unmarked categories. Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful, as they often fall within this category. The unmarked category becomes the norm, with the other categories relegated to deviant status. Social groups can apply this view of power to race, [[gender identity|gender]], and [[disability]] without modification: the able body is the neutral body.

=== Counterpower ===
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
The term 'counter-power' (sometimes written 'counterpower') is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites. A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as 'a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias'.&lt;ref name="David Graeber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Fragments of an anarchist anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-9728196-4-9|page=24|edition= 2nd pr.}} The examples given (self-governing communities, radical labour unions, popular militias) reflect the Idea/Economics/Physical taxonomy&lt;/ref&gt; Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as 'anti-power' and 'when institutions [of counter-power] maintain themselves in the face of the state, this is usually referred to as a 'dual power' situation'.&lt;ref name="David Graeber"/&gt;  [[Tim Gee]], in his 2011 book ''Counterpower: Making Change Happen'',&lt;ref name="gee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Tim|title=Counter power : making change happen|date=2011|publisher=World Changing|location=Oxford|isbn=1780260326}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forward a theory that those disempowered by governments' and elite groups' power can use ''counterpower'' to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newton|first=Mark|title=Counterpower: Making Change Happen (book review)|journal=The Ecologist|date=17 November 2011|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/1135297/counterpower_making_change_happen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Gee's model, ''counterpower'' is split into three categories: ''idea counterpower'', ''economic counterpower'', and ''physical counterpower''.&lt;ref name="gee" /&gt;

Although the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/[[anti-globalization movement]] of the 1990s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|issue=360|date=September 2003|journal=New Internationalist|first=Graeme|last=Chesters|title=Ideas about power: Representation and counterpower|url=http://newint.org/features/2003/09/01/theories-of-power/|quote=Counterpower is the shadow realm of alternatives, a hall of mirrors held up to the dominant logic of capitalism – and it is growing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word has been used for at least 60 years; for instance [[Martin Buber]]'s 1949 book 'Paths in Utopia' includes the line 'Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buber|first1=Martin|title=Paths in Utopia|date=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=9780815604211|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MXGSnCcRaUwC&amp;pg=PA104 104]|edition= Reprint|origyear=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gee2011Introduction&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Tim|chapter=Introduction|title=Counter Power Making Change Happen|date=2011|chapterurl=http://www.newint.org/books/politics/2011/09/20/reviews%2C%20introduction%20%26%20contents.pdf|isbn=978-1-78026-032-7|location=Oxford|publisher=New Internationalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|13}}

=== Other theories ===
* [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) defined power as a man's "present means, to obtain some future apparent good" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Ch. 10).
* The thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] underlies much 20th century analysis of power. Nietzsche disseminated ideas on the "[[will to power]]," which he saw as the domination of other humans as much as the exercise of control over one's environment.
* Some schools of [[psychology]], notably that associated with [[Alfred Adler]], place power dynamics at the core of their theory (where orthodox [[Freudian]]s might place [[human sexuality|sexuality]]).

== Psychological research ==
Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has, the less one takes on the perspective of others, implying that the powerful have less [[empathy]]. [[Adam Galinsky]], along with several coauthors, found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead, they are 3 times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Lauren|title=Power Hour: Psychology test at the Time 100 party|journal=New Yorker|date=26 May 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/05/26/080526ta_talk_collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics and Faculty: Adam Galinsky|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bio/galinsky.htm|website=Kellogg School of Management|publisher=Northwestern University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191910/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bio/galinsky.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful people are also more likely to take action. In one example, powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people. Researchers have documented the [[bystander effect]]: they found that powerful people are three times as likely to first offer help to a "stranger in distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henretty|first1=Aubrey|title=How power shapes executive choice|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/whatsnew/mbaupdate08.htm|website=Kellogg School of Management|publisher=Northwestern University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908051020/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/whatsnew/mbaupdate08.htm|archivedate=8 September 2008|date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study involving over 50 college students suggested that those primed to feel powerful through stating 'power words' were less susceptible to external pressure, more willing to give honest feedback, and more creative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Olanike F.|last=Deji|title=Gender and Rural Development: Introduction|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90103-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA272 272]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of power has evolved from centuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Gaining prestige, honor and reputation is one of the central motives for gaining power in human nature.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the power differences. Having power or not having power can cause a number of psychological consequences. It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Research experiments were done{{by whom|date=March 2017}} as early as 1968 to explore power conflict.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Handgraaf|first= Michel J.

==== Past research ====
Earlier{{when|date=March 2017}}, research proposed that increased power relates to increased rewards and leads one to approach things more frequently.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In contrast, decreased power relates to more constraint, threat and punishment which leads to inhibitions. It was concluded{{by whom|date=March 2017}} that being powerful leads one to successful outcomes, to develop negotiation strategies and to make more self-serving offers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Later{{when|date=March 2017}}, research proposed that differences in power lead to strategic considerations. Being strategic can also mean to defend when one is opposed or to hurt the decision-maker. It was concluded{{by whom|date=March 2017}} that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

Bargaining games were explored{{by whom|date=March 2017}} in 2003 and 2004. These studies compared behavior done in different power given{{clarify|date=March 2017}} situations.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

In an ''ultimatum game'', the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

In a ''dictator game'', the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer. The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

===== Conclusion =====
The dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient. The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game. [[Self-serving]] also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

When the counterpart recipient is completely powerless, lack of strategy, social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given (the one with the power).&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

=== Abusive power and control ===
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
{{See also|Coercive power}}
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) involve the ways in which abusers gain and maintain power and control over victims for [[abusive]] purposes such as [[psychological abuse| psychological]], [[physical abuse| physical]], [[sexual abuse| sexual]], or [[financial abuse| financial]] abuse. Such abuse can have various causes - such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation| devaluation]], [[envy]] or just for the sake of it - as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism| economic abuse]], thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

== Tactics ==
In everyday situations people use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt people into particular action. There are plenty of examples of power tactics that are quite common and employed every day. Some of these tactics include [[bullying]], collaboration, complaining, criticizing, demanding, disengaging, evading, humor, inspiring, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]], negotiating, socializing, and supplicating. These power tactics can be classified along three different dimensions:&lt;ref name="Falbo, T. 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Falbo | first1 = Toni | last2 = Peplau | first2 = Letitia A.  | title = Power strategies in intimate relationships | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 618–628 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.38.4.618 | date = April 1980 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.38.4.618 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Falbo%20%26%20Peplau%201980.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Raven | first1 = Bertram H. | last2 = Schwarzwald | first2 = Joseph | last3 = Koslowsky | first3 = Meni | title = Conceptualizing and measuring a power/interaction model of interpersonal influence | journal = [[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 307–332 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01708.x | date = February 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01708.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Soft power|Soft]] and [[Hard power|hard]]''': Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between person and the target. They are more indirect and interpersonal (e.g., collaboration, socializing). Conversely, hard tactics are harsh, forceful, direct, and rely on concrete outcomes. However, they are not more powerful than soft tactics. In many circumstances, fear of [[social exclusion]] can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment.
# '''Rational and nonrational''': Rational tactics of influence make use of reasoning, logic, and sound judgment, whereas nonrational tactics rely on emotionality and misinformation. Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion, and evasion and put downs, respectively.
# '''Unilateral and bilateral''': Bilateral tactics, such as collaboration and negotiation, involve reciprocity on the part of both the person influencing and their target. Unilateral tactics, on the other hand, are enacted without any participation on the part of the target. These tactics include disengagement and [[fait accompli]].

People tend to vary in their use of power tactics, with different types of people opting for different tactics. For instance, interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics.&lt;ref name="Falbo, T. 1980"/&gt; [[Machiavellians]], however, tend to use nonrational tactics. Moreover, extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bratko | first1 = Denis | last2 = Butkovic | first2 = Ana | title = Stability of genetic and environmental effects from adolescence to young adulthood: Results of Croatian longitudinal twin study of personality | journal = [[Twin Research and Human Genetics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–157 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1375/twin.10.1.151 | date = February 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1375/twin.10.1.151 | pmid = 17539374 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation, and based on whom they are trying to influence. People also tend to shift from soft to hard tactics when they face resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = Paula P. | last2 = Carson | first2 = Kerry D. | last3 = Roe | first3 = C.

=== Balance of power ===
Because power operates both relationally and reciprocally, [[sociologists]] speak of the balance of power between parties to a [[personal relationship|relationship]]: all parties to all relationships have ''some'' power: the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths: equal or unequal, stable or subject to periodic change. Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of ''constraint'' rather than of power. Thus 'power' has a connotation of unilateralism. If this were not so, then all relationships could be described in terms of 'power', and its meaning would be lost. Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others, to acquire power you must possess or control a form of power currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCornack|first=Steven|title=Reflect &amp; Relate: An introduction to interpersonal communication|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston/NY|isbn=0-312-48934-X|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Power changes those in the position of power and those who are targets of that power.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010). ''Group Dynamics'' (5th Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approach/inhibition theory ===
Developed by D. Keltner and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Keltner, D., Gruenfeld, D.H., &amp; Anderson, C. (2003). Power, approach, and inhibition. ''Psychological Review, 110,'' 265-284.&lt;/ref&gt; approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals. The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways. The reaction of ''approach'' is associated with action, self-promotion, seeking rewards, increased energy and movement. ''Inhibition'', on the contrary, is associated with self-protection, avoiding threats or danger, vigilance, loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity.

Overall, approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies, while reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies.

== Reactions ==

=== Tactics ===
A number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics (e.g. punishment (both personal and impersonal), rule-based sanctions, and non-personal rewards) are less effective than soft tactics (expert power, referent power, and personal rewards).&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Berdahl, J. L. (2007). Social power. In A. Kruglanski &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), Social psychology: A handbook of basic principles (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. H. (2008). Motivated compliance with bases of social power. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38,'' 1921–1944.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility, depression, fear, and anger, while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Krause D. E. (2006) Power and influence in the context of organizational innovation. In Schriesheim C. A., Neider L. L. (Eds.), Power and influence in organizations: new empirical and theoretical perspectives (A volume in research in management). Hartford, CT: Information Age. Pp. 21–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work, while instilling a feeling of autonomy in one’s subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, L. G., &amp; Vallerand, R. J. (1996). Supervisors’ beliefs and subordinates’ intrinsic motivation: A behavioral confirmation analysis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71,'' 331–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning. When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded, the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work, leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group. This effect is called ''Disruptive contagion or ripple effect'' and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group, and authority’s requests are vague and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Kounin, J., &amp; Gump, P. (1958). The ripple effect in discipline. ''Elementary School Journal, 59,'' 158–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resistance to coercive influence ===
Coercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful,&lt;ref&gt;Michener, H. A., &amp; Lawler, E. J. (1975). Endorsement of formal leaders: An integrative model. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31,'' 216-223.&lt;/ref&gt; the leader is trusted, and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms.&lt;ref&gt;Michener, H. A., &amp; Burt, M.R. (1975) Components of authority as determinants of compliance. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31'', 606-614.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions.&lt;ref&gt;Molm, L. D. (1994) Is Punishment Effective? Coercive Strategies in Social Exchange. ''Social Psychology Quarterly, 57,'' 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some cases, group members chose to resist the authority’s influence. When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity, they are more likely to form a ''Revolutionary Coalition'', a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the group’s authority structure.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. J. (1975a). An experimental study of factors affecting the mobilization of revolutionary coalitions. ''Sociometry, 38,'' 163-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power, uses coercive methods, and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments. It is because these conditions create ''reactance'', a complex emotional and cognitive reaction that occurs when individuals feel that their freedom to make choices has been threatened or eliminated.  When reactance occurs, individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their authority.

=== Kelman's compliance-identification-internalization theory of conversion ===
Herbert Kelman&lt;ref&gt;[null Kelman, H. (1958). Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change. ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 1, 51-60].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H.C. Processes of opinion change. Public Opinion Quarterly, 25, 57–78.&lt;/ref&gt; identified three basic, step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence: [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], and [[internalization]]. This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time.

At the stage of ''compliance,'' group members comply with authority’s demands, but personally do not agree with them. If authority does not monitor the members, they will probably not obey.

''Identification'' occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority, mimics authority’s actions, values, characteristics, and takes on behaviours of the person with power. If prolonged and continuous, identification can lead to the final stage – internalization.

When ''internalization'' occurs, individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system. At this stage, group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions. Extreme obedience often requires internalization.

==Power literacy==
Power literacy refers to how one perceives power, how it is formed and accumulates, and the structures that support it and who is in control of it. Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Rightmyer|first2=Elizabeth|title=Literacy for All Students: An Instructional Framework for Closing the Gap|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136879692|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JDbfh3M55lgC|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincheloe|first1=Joe|last2=Steinberg|first2=Shirley|title=Students as Researchers: Creating Classrooms that Matter|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135714710|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mj2RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2002-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be helpful for heightening power literacy. In a 2014 [[TED talk]] [[Eric Liu]] notes that "we don't like to talk about power" as "we find it scary" and "somehow evil" with it having a "negative moral valence" and states that the pervasiveness of power illiteracy causes a concentration of knowledge, understanding and clout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Eric|title=Transcript of "Why ordinary people need to understand power"|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_liu_why_ordinary_people_need_to_understand_power/transcript?language=en|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe L. Kincheloe]] describes a "cyber-literacy of power" that is concerned with the forces that shape [[knowledge production]] and the construction and transmission of meaning, being more about engaging knowledge than "mastering" information, and a "cyber-power literacy" that is focused on transformative knowledge production and new modes of [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincheloe|first1=Joe L.|title=Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402082245|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GZm4H8HjAz4C|accessdate=12 February 2017|language=en|date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LEO Propellant Depot.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of a proposed [[United Launch Alliance]] propellant depot with sun shields.]]

An orbital '''propellant depot''' is a cache of [[propellant]] that is placed in orbit around Earth or another body to allow [[spacecraft]] or the transfer stage of the spacecraft to be fueled in space.  It is one of the types of space resource depot that have been proposed for enabling infrastructure-based [[space exploration]].&lt;ref name=iac2012/&gt;
Many different depot concepts exist depending on the type of fuel to be supplied, location, or type of depot which may also include a '''propellant tanker''' that  delivers a single load to a spacecraft at a specified orbital location and then departs.  In-space fuel depots are not necessarily located near or at a [[space station]].

Potential users of in-orbit refueling and storage facilities include [[List of space agencies|space agencies]], defense ministries and [[communications satellite]] or other [[private spaceflight|commercial]] companies.

Satellite servicing depots would extend the lifetime of satellites that have nearly consumed all of their orbital maneuvering fuel and are likely placed in a geosynchronous orbit. The spacecraft would conduct a [[space rendezvous]] with the depot, or ''vice versa'', and then transfer propellant to be used for subsequent [[orbital maneuver]]s. In 2011, [[Intelsat]] showed interest in an [[Space Infrastructure Servicing|initial demonstration mission]] to refuel several satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]], but all plans have been since scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.space.com/14287-satellite-refueling-deal-scrapped-mda-intelsat.html |title=Plans Scrapped for Private Robotic Gas Station in Space |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=January 19, 2012 |access-date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A low earth orbit (LEO) depot's primary function would be to provide propellant to a transfer stage headed to the moon, Mars, or possibly a geosynchronous orbit.  Since all or a fraction of the transfer stage propellant can be off-loaded, the separately launched spacecraft with payload and/or crew could have a larger mass or use a smaller launch vehicle.  With a LEO depot or tanker fill, the size of the launch vehicle can be reduced and the flight rate increased—or, with a newer mission architecture where the beyond-Earth-orbit spacecraft also serves as the second stage, can facilitate much larger payloads—which may reduce the total launch costs since the fixed costs are spread over more flights and fixed costs are usually lower with smaller launch vehicles.  A depot could also be placed at Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange point]] 1 (EML-1) or behind the Moon at EML-2 to reduce costs to travel to the moon or Mars.  Placing a depot in Mars orbit has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf |title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots |author=Jon Goff |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2009 |display-authors=etal}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== LEO depot fuels ==
For rockets and space vehicles, propellants usually take up 2/3 or more of their total mass.

Large upper-stage rocket engines generally use a [[cryogenic fuel]] like [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as an oxidizer because of the large specific impulse possible, but must carefully consider a problem called "boil off". The boil off from only a few days of delay  may not allow sufficient fuel for higher orbit injection, potentially resulting in a mission abort. Lunar or Mars missions will require weeks to months to accumulate tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilograms of propellant, so additional equipment may be required on the transfer stage or the depot to mitigate boiloff.

Non-cryogenic, earth-storable [[liquid rocket propellants]] including [[RP-1]] ([[kerosene]]), [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (NTO), and mildly cryogenic, space-storable propellants like [[liquid methane]] and [[liquid oxygen]], can be kept in liquid form with less boiloff than the cryogenic fuels, but also have lower specific impulse.&lt;ref name=aiaa2004&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2014/37950 |title=Advanced Space Storable Propellants for Outer Planet Exploration |conference=40th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, Ft.

== Propellant launch costs ==
Ex-NASA administrator Mike Griffin commented at the 52nd AAS Annual Meeting in Houston, November 2005, that "at a conservatively low government price of $10,000/kg in LEO, 250 MT of fuel for two missions per year is worth $2.5 B, at government rates."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/138033main_griffin_aas1.pdf Remarks For AIAA Space 2005 Conference &amp; Exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

If one assumes that a 130 metric tonne launch vehicle could be flown twice a year for $2.5B, the price is about $10,000/kg.

== Cryogenic depot architectures and types ==
In the depot-centric architecture, the depot is filled by tankers, and then the propellant is transferred to an upper stage prior to orbit insertion, similar to a gas station filled by tankers for automobiles.  By using a depot, the launch vehicle size can be reduced and the flight rate increased.  Since the accumulation of propellant may take many weeks to months, careful consideration must be given to boiloff mitigation.

In simple terms, a passive cryogenic depot is a transfer stage with stretched propellant tanks, additional insulation, and a sun shield.  In one concept, hydrogen boiloff is also redirected to reduce or eliminate liquid oxygen boiloff and then used for attitude control, power, or reboost.  An active cryogenic depot is a passive depot with additional power and refrigeration equipment/cryocoolers to reduce or eliminate propellant boiloff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf |title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots |author=Jon Goff |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2009 |display-authors=etal}} page 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Other active cryogenic depot concepts include electrically powered attitude control equipment to conserve fuel for the end payload.

== Heavy lift versus depot-centric architectures ==
In the heavy lift architecture, propellant, which can be two thirds or more of the total mission mass, is accumulated in fewer launches and possibly shorter time frame than the depot centric architecture.  Typically the transfer stage is filled directly and no depot is included in the architecture.  For cryogenic vehicles and cryogenic depots, additional boiloff mitigation equipment is typically included on the transfer stage, reducing payload fraction and requiring more propellant for the same payload unless the mitigation hardware is expended.

Heavy lift advocates{{who|date=February 2013}} state that the total mass to orbit required for a mission can actually increase because of the need to launch more propellant tanks and boil-off mitigation hardware.  Heavy launch vehicles are not developed, so these costs are added to the trade, rather than using existing smaller rockets.  Heavy lift advocates{{who|date=February 2013}} question the cost model for propellant depots and cite the need for development and demonstration.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Depot advocates claim this increase in mission mass would be offset by a decrease in the cost per launch and the elimination of the fixed costs of the heavy lift launch vehicle when not required in a given time frame.  Further, long life components including insulation, power and cryocoolers could be placed on the depot and not expended, further reducing the mass per mission and hence costs.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Heavy Lift is compared with using Commercial Launch and Propellant Depots in this power point by Dr. Alan Wilhite given at FISO Telecon.&lt;ref name=PDref049&gt;{{cite web |last=Dr Alan Wilhite |title=A Sustainable Evolved Human Space Exploration Architecture Using Commercial Launch and Propellant Depots |url=http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Wilhite_2-13-13/Wilhite_2-13-13.pdf |publisher=FISO Telecon (February 13, 2013) |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704093405/http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Wilhite_2-13-13/Wilhite_2-13-13.pdf |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feasibility of propellant depots ==

Both theoretical studies and funded development projects that are currently underway aim to provide insight into the feasibility of propellant depots. Studies have shown that a depot-centric architecture with smaller launch vehicles could be {{USD|57 billion}} less expensive than a heavy-lift architecture over a 20-year time frame.&lt;ref name="images.spaceref.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/F9Prop.Depot.pdf |title=Near Term Space Exploration with Commercial Launch Vehicles Plus Propellant Depot |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology / National Institute of Aerospace |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost of large launch vehicles is so high that a depot able to hold the propellant lifted by two or more medium-sized launch vehicles may be cost effective and support more payload mass on [[beyond Earth orbit|beyond-Earth orbit]] trajectories.

In a 2010 NASA study, an additional flight of an [[Ares V|Ares V heavy]] launch vehicle was required to stage a US government Mars reference mission due to 70 tons of boiloff, assuming 0.1% boiloff/day for [[hydrolox]] propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20100042324 |title=Ares V Utilization in Support of a Human Mission to Mars |author=J. Holiday |date=November 1, 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study clearly identified the need to decrease the design boiloff rate by an order of magnitude or more.

Approaches to the design of [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) propellant depots were also  discussed in the  [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|2009 Augustine report]] to [[NASA]], which "examined the [then] current concepts for in-space refueling."&lt;ref name=hsf200910&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf HSF Final Report: Seeking a Human Spaceflight Program Worthy of a Great Nation], October 2009, ''Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee'', p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;  The report determined there are essentially two approaches to refueling a [[spacecraft]] in LEO:&lt;ref name=hsf200910/&gt;
* '''Propellant tanker'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] since this term is redirected to here. --&gt; delivery. In this approach, a single tanker performs a rendezvous and docking with an on-orbit spacecraft.  The tanker then transfers propellant, then departs.  This approach is "much like an [[Aerial refueling|airborne tanker]] refuels an aircraft."
* In-space depot.  An alternative approach is for many tankers to rendezvous and transfer propellant to an orbital depot.  Then, at a later time, a spacecraft may dock with the depot and receive a propellant load before departing Earth orbit.
Both approaches were considered feasible with 2009 spaceflight technology, but anticipated that significant further engineering development and in-space demonstration would be required before missions could depend on the technology. Both approaches were seen to offer the potential of long-term life-cycle savings.&lt;ref name=hsf200910/&gt;

Beyond theoretical studies, since at least 2016, [[SpaceX]] has undertaken funded [[New product development|development]] of an [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] set of technologies called the [[Interplanetary Transport System]] (ITS).  While the [[system]] consists of a combination of [[Interplanetary_Transport_System#Description|several elements]] that are considered by SpaceX to be key to making long-duration [[beyond Earth orbit]] (BEO) spaceflights possible by reducing the cost per ton delivered to Mars by multiple [[orders of magnitude]] over what NASA approaches have achieved,&lt;ref name="spacex-itsvideo201609-09:20"&gt;

refilling of propellants in orbit is one of the four key elements.  In a novel mission architecture, the SpaceX design intends to enable the [[Interplanetary Spaceship|long-journey spacecraft]] to expend most all of its propellant load during the launch to [[low Earth orbit]] while it serves as the second stage of the [[ITS launch vehicle|launch vehicle]], and then—after refilling on orbit by an ''[[ITS tanker]]''—provide the significant amount of [[delta-V|energy]] necessary to put the spacecraft onto an interplanetary trajectory. The ''ITS tanker'' is designed to transport approximately {{convert|380|tonne|lb}} of propellant to low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927&gt;

A second propellant tanker concept is underway.  [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) has a proposed [[Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage]] (ACES) tanker—a concept that dates back to work by Boeing in 2006,&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Zegler |first1=Frank |last2=Kutter |first2=Bernard |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |conference=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference &amp; Exposition |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |accessdate=October 31, 2016 |date=September 2, 2010 |quote=''ACES design conceptualization has been underway at ULA for many years.

The baseline 41-mT propellant load is contained in a 5m diameter, common bulkhead stage that is about the same length as ULA's existing upper stages. ACES will become the foundation for a modular system of stages to meet the launch requirements of a wide variety of users.

== Advantages ==
Because a large portion of a rocket is propellant at time of launch, proponents point out several advantages of using a propellant depot architecture. Spacecraft could be launched unfueled and thus require less structural mass,&lt;ref name="Simberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.competitivespace.org/2011/11/04/the-sls-empire-strikes-back/ |title=The SLS Empire Strikes Back |work=Competitivespace.org |date=November 4, 2011 |last=Simberg |first=Rand}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the depot tanker itself could serve as the second-stage on launch when it is reusable.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt; An on-orbit market for refueling may be created where competition to deliver propellant for the cheapest price takes place, and it may also enable an economy of scale by permitting existing rockets to fly more often to refuel the depot.&lt;ref name="Simberg" /&gt; If used in conjunction with a [[Colonization of the Moon|mining facility on the moon]], [[Lunar water|water]] or propellant could be exported back to the depot, further reducing the cost of propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.spudislunarresources.com/Bibliography/p/102.pdf |title=Using the resources of the Moon to create a permanent, cislunar space faring system |journal=AIAA Space 2011 Conference &amp; Exposition |first1=Paul D |last1=Spudis |first2=Anthony R |last2=Lavoie |date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sei.aero/eng/papers/uploads/archive/IAC-07-A5.1.03_present.pdf |title=ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF A LUNAR IN-SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION (ISRU) PROPELLANT SERVICES MARKET |work=space works engineering |first=A.C |last=Charania |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exploration program based on a depot architecture could be cheaper and more capable, not needing a specific rocket or a heavy lift such as the [[Space Launch System|SLS]]&lt;ref name="images.spaceref.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowing2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/21.jul2011.vxs.pdf |title=Internal NASA Studies Show Cheaper and Faster Alternatives to the Space Launch System |last=Cowing |first=Keith |date=October 12, 2011 |work=SpaceRef.com |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://satellite.tmcnet.com/topics/satellite/articles/230642-did-nasa-hide-in-space-fuel-depots-get.htm |title=Did NASA Hide In-space Fuel Depots To Get a Heavy Lift Rocket? |work=Satellite Spotlight |first=Doug |last=Mohney |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/21.jul2011.pdf |title=Propellant Depot Requirements Study |publisher=SpaceRef.com/nasawatch.com |work=HAT Technical Interchange Meeting |date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support multiple destinations such as the Moon, Lagrange points, asteroids, and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120001435_2012001131.pdf |title=Space Transportation Infrastructure Supported By Propellant Depots - Smitherman, David; Woodcock, Gordon - AIAA Space 2011 - 26 pages |publisher=ntrs.nasa.gov |date=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and plans ==

Propellant depots were proposed as part of the [[Space Transportation System]] (along with nuclear "tugs" to take payloads from LEO to other destinations) in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=dewar2003&gt;Dewar, James.  "To The End Of The Solar System: The Story Of The Nuclear Rocket".  Apogee, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) performed an experimental [[low Earth orbit|on-orbit]] demonstration on a modified [[Centaur (rocket stage)#Test bed for cryogenic fluid management experiments|Centaur upper stage]] on the [[DMSP-18]] [[Atlas V#Atlas V launches&lt;!-- Atlas launch ID "AV-017" --&gt;|launch]] to improve "understanding of [[Propellant depot#Propellant settling|propellant settling]] and [[Slosh dynamics|slosh]], pressure control, [[RL10]] chilldown and RL10 two-phase shutdown operations."

NASA's [[Launch Services Program]] is working on an ongoing [[Launch Services Program#Slosh Fluid Dynamics Experiments|slosh fluid dynamics experiments]] with partners called CRYOTE. ULA is also currently&lt;!-- 2010, and now also in Aug 2011 --&gt; planning additional in-space laboratory experiments to further develop [[Centaur (rocket stage)#Test bed for cryogenic fluid management experiments|cryogenic fluid management]] technologies using the Centaur upper stage after primary payload separation.

The "Simple Depot" mission was proposed by NASA in 2011 as a potential first PTSD mission, with launch no earlier than 2015, on an [[Atlas V#Versions|Atlas V 551]].  ''Simple Depot'' would utilize the "used" (nearly-emptied) [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage LH2 tank for long-term storage of LO2 while LH2 will be stored in the Simple Depot LH2 module, which is launched with only ambient-temperature gaseous Helium in it.  The SD LH2 tank was to be {{convert|3|m}} diameter and {{convert|16|m}} long, {{convert|110|m3}} in volume, and store 5 mT of LH2.  "At a useful mixture ratio (MR) of 6:1 this quantity of LH2 can be paired with 25.7 mT of LO2, allowing for 0.7 mT of LH2 to be used for vapor cooling, for a total useful propellant mass of 30 mT. ... the described depot will have a boil-off rate of approaching 0.1 percent per day, consisting entirely of hydrogen."&lt;ref name=ns20110810&gt;

In September 2010, ULA released a ''Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture'' concept to propose propellant depots that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel—either in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO)  for beyond-LEO missions, or at [[Lagrangian point]] {{L2}} for interplanetary missions—at the [[AIAA]] Space 2010 conference.  The concept proposes that waste gaseous [[hydrogen]]—an inevitable byproduct of long-term [[liquid hydrogen]] storage in the [[Radiative heat transfer|radiative heat]] environment of [[outer space|space]]—would be usable as a [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] in a [[Solar thermal rocket|solar-thermal propulsion system]].  The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both [[orbital stationkeeping]] and [[attitude control]], as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for [[Orbital maneuver#Non-impulsive maneuvers|orbital maneuvers]] to better [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902p3&gt;

As part of the Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture, ULA has proposed the [[Advanced Common Evolved Stage]] (ACES) [[upper stage]] [[rocket]].  ACES hardware is designed from the start to as an in-space propellant depot that could be used as way-stations for other rockets to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO or [[interplanetary mission|interplanetary]] missions, and to provide the [[delta v|high-energy]] technical capacity for the cleanup of [[space debris]].&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902/&gt;

== Engineering design issues ==
There are a number of design issues with propellant depots, as well as several tasks that have not, to date, been tested in space for [[On-orbit satellite servicing|on-orbit servicing]] missions.  The design issues include propellant settling and transfer, propellant usage for attitude control and reboost, the maturity of the refrigeration equipment/cryocoolers, and the power and mass required for reduced or zero boiloff depots with refrigeration.

=== Propellant settling ===
Transfer of liquid propellants in [[microgravity]] is complicated by the uncertain distribution of liquid and gasses within a tank. Propellant settling at an in-space depot is thus more challenging than in even a slight gravity field. ULA plans to use the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]]-18 mission to flight-test centrifugal propellant settling as a cryogenic fuel management technique that might be used in future propellant depots.&lt;ref name=goff2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf |title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots |author=Jon Goff |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2009 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed Simple Depot PTSD mission utilizes several techniques to achieve adequate settling for propellant transfer.&lt;ref name=ns20110810/&gt;

=== Propellant transfer ===
In the absence of gravity, propellant transfer is somewhat more difficult, since liquids can float away from the inlet.

As part of the [[Orbital Express]] mission in 2007, [[hydrazine]] propellant was successfully transferred between two single-purpose designed technology demonstration spacecraft.  The [[Boeing]] servicing spacecraft [[ASTRO (satellite)|ASTRO]] transferred propellant to the [[Ball Aerospace]] serviceable client spacecraft [[NEXTSat]].  Since no crew were present on either spacecraft, this was reported as the first autonomous spacecraft-to-spacecraft fluid transfer.&lt;ref name="boeing20070417"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q2/070417c_nr.html |title=Boeing Orbital Express Conducts First Autonomous Spacecraft-to-Spacecraft Fluid and Component Transfer |publisher=Boeing |date=April 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505101041/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q2/070417c_nr.html |archivedate=May 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refilling ===
After propellant has been transferred to a customer the depot's tanks will need refilling. Organizing the construction and [[space logistics|launch of the tanker rockets bearing the new fuel]] is the responsibility of the propellant depot's operator. Since space agencies like NASA hope to be purchasers rather than owners, possible operators include the aerospace company that constructed the depot, manufacturers of the rockets, a specialist space depot company, or an oil/chemical company that refines the propellant. By using several tanker rockets the tankers can be smaller than the depot and larger than the spacecraft they are intended to resupply.  Short range chemical propulsion tugs belonging to the depot may be used to simplify docking tanker rockets and large vehicles like Mars Transfer Vehicles.

Transfers of propellant between the LEO depot, reachable by rockets from Earth, and the deep space ones such as the [[Lagrange Point]]s and Phobos depots can be performed using [[Solar electric propulsion]] (SEP) tugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar_knowledge/connolly.pdf |title=Human Lunar Exploration Mission Architectures, page 22 |publisher=NASA |date=March 1–2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two missions are currently under development or proposed to support propellant depot refilling.  In addition to refueling and servicing [[geostationary]] communications satellites with the fuel that is initially launched with the MDA [[Space Infrastructure Servicing]] vehicle, the SIS vehicle is being designed to have the ability to [[orbital maneuver|orbitally maneuver]] to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with a replacement fuel canister after transferring the {{nowrap|2000 kg}} of fuel in the launch load, enabling further refueling of additional satellites after the initial multi-satellite servicing mission is complete.&lt;ref name=sn20110318&gt;

These canisters would be much lighter than the SIS vehicle and thus much less expensive to launch.

The proposed Simple Depot cryogenic PTSD mission utilizes "remote berthing arm and docking and fluid transfer ports" both for propellant transfer to other vehicles, as well as for refilling the depot up to the full 30 tonne propellant capacity.&lt;ref name=ns20110810/&gt;

S.T. Demetriades&lt;ref name=Demetriades&gt;{{cite journal |last=Demetriades |first=S.T. |title=The Use of Atmospheric and Extraterrestrial Resources in Space Propulsion Systems |journal=Electric Propulsion Conference |date=March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a method for refilling by collecting atmospheric gases. Moving in [[low Earth orbit]], at an altitude of around 120&amp;nbsp;km, Demetriades' proposed depot extracts air from the fringes of the atmosphere, compresses and cools it, and extracts liquid oxygen. The remaining nitrogen is used as propellant for a nuclear-powered [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] engine, which maintains the orbit, compensating for atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Demetriades /&gt; This system was called “PROFAC” ([[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator|PROpulsive Fluid ACcumulator]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Demetrades |first=S.T. |title=Plasma Propulsion |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |date=April 1962 |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=392 |bibcode=1962JBIS...18..392D}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, safety concerns with placing a nuclear reactor in low Earth orbit.

Demetriades' proposal was further refined by Christopher Jones and others&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.,  Masse, D.,  Glass, C.,  Wilhite, A., and Walker, M. (2010), "PHARO: Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit," IEEE Aerospace Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; In this proposal, multiple collection vehicles accumulate propellent gases at around 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude, later transferring them to a higher orbit. However, Jones' proposal does require a network of [[Space-based solar power|orbital power-beaming satellites]], to avoid placing nuclear reactors in orbit.

Asteroids can also be processed to provide liquid oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576506001147 |title=A captured asteroid : Our David's stone for shielding earth and providing the cheapest extraterrestrial material |author=Didier Massonnet, Benoît Meyssignac |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=July–September 2006 |volume=59 |issue=1-5 |pages=77–83 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.02.030 |bibcode=2006AcAau..59...77M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orbital planes and launch windows ===

Propellant depots in LEO are of little use for transfer between two low earth orbits when the depot is in a different orbital plane than the target orbit. The [[delta-v]] to make the necessary [[Orbital inclination change|plane change]] is typically extremely high. On the other hand, depots are typically proposed for exploration missions, where the change over time of the depot's orbit can be chosen to align with the departure vector. This allows one well-aligned departure time minimizing fuel use that requires a very precisely-timed departure. Less efficient departure times from the same depot to the same destination exist before and after the well-aligned opportunity, but more research is required to show whether the efficiency falls off quickly or slowly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  By contrast, launching directly in only one launch from the ground without orbital refueling or docking with another craft already on orbit offers daily launch opportunities though it requires larger and more expensive launchers.&lt;ref name=spaceshow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/06-sep-2010/broadcast-1420-special-edition |title=Broadcast 1420 (Special Edition) |work=The Space Show |first1=David M. |last1=Livingston |first2=Dan |last2=Adamo |date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions on departure windows arise because low earth orbits are susceptible to significant perturbations; even over short periods they are subject to [[nodal regression]] and, less importantly, [[precession]] of perigee. Equatorial depots are more stable but also more difficult to reach.&lt;ref name=spaceshow/&gt;

However, it is possible to do a three-burn orbital transfer which includes a plane change, and which wastes very little propellant to reach almost any final trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/AAS-17-696-1.pdf |title=Practiacal Methodologies for Low Delta-V Penalty, On-Time Departures to Arbitrary Interplanetary Destinations From a Medium-Inclination Low-Earth Orbit Depot |conference=2017 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference. 20-24 August 2017.

=== Specific issues of cryogenic depots ===

==== Boil-off mitigation ====
Boil-off of [[cryogenic]] propellants in space may be mitigated by both technological solutions as well as system-level [[space logistics|planning and design]].
From a technical perspective:  for a propellant depot with passive insulation system to effectively store [[cryogenic]] fluids, boil-off caused by heating from [[Radiative heat transfer|solar]] and other sources must be mitigated, eliminated,&lt;ref name=goff2009/&gt; or used for economic purposes.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902/&gt;  For non-cryogenic propellants, boil-off is not a significant design problem.

Boil off rate is governed by heat leakage and by the quantity of propellant in the tanks. With partially filled tanks, the percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant in the tanks depends on volume. So by the [[cube-square law]], the smaller the tank, the faster the liquids will boil off.
Some propellant tank designs have achieved a liquid hydrogen boil off rate as low as approximately 0.13% per day (3.8% per month) while the much higher temperature cryogenic fluid of liquid oxygen would boil off much less, about 0.016% per day (0.49% per month).&lt;ref name="Drawbacks ThinkQuest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Drawbacks of Cryogenic Propellants |publisher=Space Travel Guide on Oracle ThinkQuest Education Foundation |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/text/propulsion/propellents/crydraw.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628054254/http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/text/propulsion/propellents/crydraw.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to achieve zero boil-off (ZBO) with cryogenic propellant storage using an active thermal control system. Tests conducted at the NASA [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]]'s Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) over the summer of 1998 demonstrated that a hybrid thermal control system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants. The hardware consisted of a pressurized 50-ft³ (ca. 1416 litres) tank insulated with [[multi-layer insulation]] (MLI) of 34 layers, a condenser, and a [[Cryocooler#GM-refrigerators|Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler]] that has a cooling capacity of 15 to 17.5 watt (W). Liquid hydrogen was the test fluid. The test tank was installed into a vacuum chamber, simulating space vacuum.&lt;ref name="SMIRF test"&gt;{{cite web |title=Zero Boiloff Storage of Cryogenic Propellants Achieved at Lewis’ Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility |publisher=Glenn Research Center |url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1998/5000/5870plachta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, a cooperative effort by NASA's [[Ames Research Center]], [[Glenn Research Center]], and [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) was implemented to develop zero-boiloff concepts for in-space cryogenic storage. Main program element was a large-scale, zero-boiloff demonstration using the MSFC multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) - 18.10 m3 LH2 tank (about 1300&amp;nbsp;kg of H2). A commercial cryocooler was interfaced with an existing MHTB spray bar mixer and insulation system in a manner that enabled a balance between incoming and extracted thermal energy.&lt;ref name="ZBO Large-Scale Demonstration"&gt;{{cite web |title=Large-Scale Demonstration of Liquid Hydrogen Storage With Zero Boiloff for In-Space Applications |publisher=Glenn Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110004377_2011003898.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another NASA study in June 2003 for conceptual Mars mission showed mass savings over traditional, passive- only cryogenic storage when mission durations are 5 days in LEO for oxygen, 8.5 days for methane and 64 days for hydrogen. Longer missions equate to greater mass savings. Cryogenic xenon saves mass over passive storage almost immediately. When power to run the ZBO is already available, the break-even mission durations are even shorter, e.g. about a month for hydrogen. The larger the tank, the fewer days in LEO when ZBO has reduced mass.&lt;ref name="ZBO LEO"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Updated Zero Boil-Off Cryogenic Propellant Storage Analysis Applied to Upper Stages or Depots in an LEO Environment |publisher=Glenn Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030067928_2003079547.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to technical solutions to the challenge of excessive boil-off of cryogenic rocket propellants, system-level solutions have been proposed.  From a systems perspective, reductions in the standby time of the [[LH2]] cryogenic storage in order to achieve, effectively, a [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] (JIT) delivery to each customer, matched with the balanced [[Oil refinery|refinery]] technology to split the long-term storable feedstock—water—into the [[stoichiometric]] [[LOX]]/[[LH2]] necessary, is theoretically capable of achieving a system-level solution to boil-off.  Such proposals have been suggested as supplementing good technological techniques to reduce boil-off, but would not replace the need for efficient technological storage solutions.&lt;ref name=ss20121214&gt;

==== Sun shields ====
[[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) has proposed a cryogenic depot which would use a conical sun shield to protect the cold propellants from solar and Earth radiation.

==== Other issues ====
Other issues are [[hydrogen embrittlement]], a process by which some metals (including [[iron]] and [[titanium]]) become brittle and fracture following exposure to hydrogen. The resulting leaks makes storing cryogenic propellants in zero gravity conditions difficult.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen embrittlement"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jewett |first=R.P. |title=Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement of Metals |publisher=NASA CR-2163 |year=1973 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In-space refueling demonstration projects ==

In the early 2010s, several in-space refueling projects got under-way.  Two [[Private spaceflight|private initiatives]] and a government-sponsored test mission were in some level of [[New product development|development]] or testing {{asof|2010|lc=y}}.

=== Robotic Refueling Mission ===

The NASA [[Robotic Refueling Mission]] was launched in 2011 and successfully completed a series of [[robotics|robotically-actuated]] [[propellant transfer]] experiments on the exposed facility platform of the International Space Station in January 2013.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125&gt;
{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |title=Satellite refueling testbed completes demo in orbit |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1301/25rrm/#.UQQMpvJ5GIR |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |newspaper=Spaceflight Now |date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of experiments included a number of propellant [[valve]]s, [[nozzle]]s and [[Seal (mechanical)|seals]] similar to those used on many satellites and a series of four [[prototype]] tools that could be attached to the distal end of a Space Station [[robotic arm]].  Each tool was a prototype of "devices that could be used by future satellite servicing missions to refuel spacecraft in orbit.  RRM is the first in-space refueling demonstration using a platform and fuel valve representative of most existing satellites, which were never designed for refueling. Other satellite servicing demos, such as the U.S. military's [[Orbital Express]] mission in 2007, transferred propellant between satellites with specially-built pumps and connections."&lt;ref name=sfn20130125/&gt;

=== MDA in-space refueling demonstration project ===
{{Main|MDA Space Infrastructure Servicing vehicle}}
{{as of|2010|03}}, a small-scale refueling demonstration project for [[reaction control system]] (RCS) fluids is under development. [[Canada]]-based [[MDA Corporation]] announced in early 2010 that they were designing a single spacecraft that would refuel other spacecraft in orbit as a satellite-servicing demonstration.  "The business model, which is still evolving, could ask customers to pay per kilogram of fuel successfully added to their satellite, with the per-kilogram price being a function of the additional revenue the operator can expect to generate from the spacecraft’s extended operational life."&lt;ref name=sn20100303&gt;

The plan is that the fuel-depot vehicle would [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] to an operational [[communications satellite]], dock at the target satellite’s [[Apogee kick motor|apogee-kick motor]], remove a small part of the target spacecraft’s thermal protection blanket, connect to a fuel-pressure line and deliver the propellant.

{{as of|2011|03}}, MDA has secured a major customer for the initial demonstration project.  [[Intelsat]] has agreed to purchase one-half of the {{convert|2000|kg}} propellant payload that the MDA spacecraft would carry into [[geostationary orbit]].  Such a purchase would add somewhere between two and four years of additional service life for up to five Intelsat satellites, assuming 200&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel is delivered to each one.&lt;ref name=sn20110314&gt;

=== Space tug alternatives to direct refueling ===

[[Competition|Competitive]] design alternatives to in-space [[reaction control system|RCS]] fuel transfer exist.  It is possible to bring additional propellant to a space asset, and utilize the propellant for attitude control or orbital velocity change, without ever [[propellant transfer|transferring]] the propellant to the target space asset.

The [[ViviSat]] [[Mission Extension Vehicle]], also under development since the early 2010s, illustrates one alternative approach that would connect to the target satellite similarly to MDA SIS, via the kick motor, but will not transfer fuel.  Rather, the Mission Extension Vehicle will use "its own thrusters to supply [[attitude control]] for the target."&lt;ref name=av20110321&gt;
{{cite news |last=Morring |first=Frank, Jr. |title=An End To Space Trash? |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awst/2011/03/21/AW_03_21_2011_p23-297586.xml&amp;headline=An%20End%20to%20Space%20Trash?&amp;channel=awst |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=March 22, 2011 |quote=''ViviSat, a new 50-50 joint venture of U.S. Space and ATK, is marketing a satellite-refueling spacecraft that connects to a target spacecraft using the same probe-in-the-kick-motor approach as MDA, but does not transfer its fuel. Instead, the vehicle becomes a new fuel tank, using its own thrusters to supply attitude control for the target. ... [the ViviSat] concept is not as far along as MDA.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ViviSat believes their approach is more simple and can operate at lower cost than the MDA propellant transfer approach, while having the technical ability to dock with and service a greater number (90 percent) of the approximately 450 [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellites in orbit.&lt;ref name=av20110321/&gt;
{{asof|2013|01}}, no customers have signed up for a ViviSat-enabled mission extension.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125/&gt;

In 2015, [[Lockheed Martin]] proposed the [[Jupiter (spacecraft)|Jupiter]] [[space tug]].  If built, Jupiter would operate in [[low Earth orbit]] shuttling [[Exoliner|cargo carriers]] to and from the [[International Space Station]], remaining on orbit indefinitely, and refueling itself from subsequent transport ships carrying later cargo carrier modules.&lt;ref name=sn20150313&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2491">'''Psychomotor learning''' is the relationship between [[cognitive functions]] and [[kinesiology|physical movement]]. Psychomotor learning is demonstrated by physical skills such as movement, coordination, manipulation, dexterity, grace, strength, speed—actions which demonstrate the fine motor skills, such as use of precision instruments or tools.

[[Behavioral]] examples include driving a car, throwing a ball, and playing a [[musical instrument]].  In psychomotor learning [[research]], attention is given to the learning of [[motor coordination|coordinated]] activity involving the arms, hands, fingers, and feet, while verbal processes are not emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/psychomotor-learning|title=Psychomotor learning|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of psychomotor development==
When learning psychomotor skills, individuals progress through the [[cognitive]] stages, the [[Association (psychology)|associative]] stage, and the [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] stage.  The cognitive stage is marked by awkward slow and choppy movements that the learner tries to control.  The learner has to think about each movement before attempting it. In the associative stage, the learner spends less time thinking about every detail, however, the movements are still not a permanent part of the [[brain]]. In the autonomic stage, the learner can refine the skill through practice, but no longer needs to think about the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essortment.com/all/psychomotordeve_pqs.htm |title=Psychomotor development and learning.Ada taik2 bintik2 |publisher=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2012-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512184538/http://www.essortment.com/all/psychomotordeve_pqs.htm |archivedate=2010-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors affecting psychomotor skills===
*Psychological feedback
*Amount of practice
*Task complexity
*Work distribution
*Motive-incentive conditions 
*Environmental factors

==How motor behaviors are recorded==
When an individual learns physical movements, this leads to changes in the [[motor cortex]].  The more practiced a movement is, the stronger the neural encoding becomes.  Psychomotor learning is not limited to the motor cortex, however.

'''Recognition-primed decision''' ('''RPD''') is a model of how people make quick, effective [[decision making|decision]]s when faced with complex situations. In this model, the decision maker is assumed to generate a possible course of action, compare it to the constraints imposed by the situation, and select the first course of action that is not rejected. RPD has been described in diverse groups including Whitewater kayaking Trauma nurses, fireground commanders, chess players, commercial Whitewater river guides and  stock market traders. It functions well in conditions of time pressure, and in which information is partial and goals poorly defined. The limitations of RPD include the need for extensive experience among decision-makers (in order to correctly recognize the salient features of a problem and model solutions) and the problem of the failure of recognition and modeling in unusual or misidentified circumstances. It appears{{to whom?|date=May 2017}} to be a valid model for how human decision-makers make decisions.

==Overview==
The RPD model identifies a reasonable reaction as the first one that is immediately considered. RPD combines two ways of developing a decision; the first is recognizing which course of action makes sense, and the second, evaluating the course of action through [[imagination]] to see if the actions resulting from that decision make sense. However, the difference of being experienced or inexperienced plays a major factor in the decision-making processes. 

RPD reveals a critical difference between experts and novices when presented with recurring situations. Experienced people will generally be able to come up with a quicker decision because the situation may match a prototypical situation they have encountered before. Novices, lacking this experience, must cycle through different possibilities, and tend to use the first course of action that they believe will work. The inexperienced also have the tendencies of using [[trial and error]] through their imagination.

==Variations==
There are three variations in RPD strategy. In Variation 1, decision makers recognize the situation as typical: a scenario where both the situational detail and the detail of relevant courses of action are known. Variation 1 is therefore essentially an “If… then…” reaction. A given situation will lead to an immediate course of action as a function of the situation's typicality. More experienced decision makers are more likely to have the knowledge of both prototypical situations and established courses of action that is required for an RPD strategy to qualify as Variation 1. 

Variation 2 occurs when the decision maker diagnoses an unknown situation to choose from a known selection of courses of action. Variation 2 takes the form of “If (???)… then…,” a phrase which implies the decision maker's specific knowledge of available courses of action but lack of knowledge regarding the parameters of the situation. In order to prevent situational complications and the accrual of misinformation, the decision maker models possible details of the situation carefully and then chooses the most relevant known course of action. Experienced decision makers are more likely to correctly model the situation, and are thus more likely to more quickly choose more appropriate courses of action.

In Variation 3, the decision maker is knowledgeable of the situation but unaware of the proper course of action. The decision maker therefore implements a mental trial and error simulation to develop the most effective course of action. Variation 3 takes the form of “If… then… (???)” wherein the decision maker models outcomes of new or uncommon courses of action. The decision maker will cycle through different courses of action until a course of action appears appropriate to the goals and priorities of the situation. Due to the time constraint fundamental to the RPD model, the decision maker will choose the first course of action which appears appropriate to the situation. Experienced decision makers are likely to develop a viable course of action more quickly because their expert knowledge can rapidly be used to disqualify inappropriate courses of action.

==Application==
Recognition primed decision making is highly relevant to the leaders or officers of organizations that are affiliated with emergency services such as fire fighters, search and rescue units, police, and other emergency services. It is applied to both the experienced and the inexperienced, and how they manage their decision making processes. The Recognition primed decision making model is developed as samples for organizations on how important decisions can affect important situations which may either save lives or take lives. The model developed can be used as a study for organizations to fill in the gaps and to determine which type of RPD variation is more applicable to the organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9785">In mathematics, a '''regular semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] ''S'' in which every element is '''regular''', i.e., for each element ''a'', there exists an element ''x'' such that ''axa'' = ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular semigroups are one of the most-studied classes of semigroups, and their structure is particularly amenable to study via [[Green's relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Howie 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Regular semigroups were introduced by [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J. A. Green]] in his influential 1951 paper "On the structure of semigroups"; this was also the paper in which [[Green's relations]] were introduced.  The concept of ''regularity'' in a semigroup was adapted from an analogous condition for [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], already considered by [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Green's study of regular semigroups which led him to define his celebrated [[Green's relations|relations]].  According to a footnote in Green 1951, the suggestion that the notion of regularity be applied to [[semigroup]]s was first made by [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]].

The term '''inversive semigroup''' (French: demi-groupe inversif) was historically used as synonym in the papers of [[Gabriel Thierrin]] (a student of [[Paul Dubreil]]) in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~gab/pubr.html&lt;/ref&gt; and it is still used occasionally.&lt;ref name="Golan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan S. Golan|title=Power Algebras over Semirings: With Applications in Mathematics and Computer Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JuvyWYv7f4C&amp;pg=PA104|year=1999|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-5834-3|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The basics ==
There are two equivalent ways in which to define a regular semigroup ''S'':
:(1) for each ''a'' in ''S'', there is an ''x'' in ''S'', which is called a '''pseudoinverse''',&lt;ref&gt;Klip, Knauer and Mikhalev : p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; with ''axa'' = ''a'';
:(2) every element ''a'' has at least one '''inverse''' ''b'', in the sense that ''aba'' = ''a'' and ''bab'' = ''b''.
To see the equivalence of these definitions, first suppose that ''S'' is defined by (2).  Then ''b'' serves as the required ''x'' in (1).  Conversely, if ''S'' is defined by (1), then ''xax'' is an inverse for ''a'', since ''a''(''xax'')''a'' = ''axa''(''xa'') = ''axa'' = ''a'' and (''xax'')''a''(''xax'') = ''x''(''axa'')(''xax'') = ''xa''(''xax'') = ''x''(''axa'')''x'' = ''xax''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Preston 1961 : Lemma 1.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of inverses (in the above sense) of an element ''a'' in an arbitrary [[semigroup]] ''S'' is denoted by ''V''(''a'').&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, another way of expressing definition (2) above is to say that in a regular semigroup, ''V''(''a'') is nonempty, for every ''a'' in ''S''.  The product of any element ''a'' with any ''b'' in ''V''(''a'') is always [[idempotent]]: ''abab'' = ''ab'', since ''aba'' = ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Preston 1961 : p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of regular semigroups ===
*Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a regular semigroup.
*Every [[band (mathematics)|band]] (idempotent semigroup) is regular in the sense of this article, though this is not what is meant by a [[band (mathematics)#Regular bands|regular band]].
*The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is regular.
*Any [[transformation semigroup|full transformation semigroup]] is regular.
*A [[Rees matrix semigroup]] is regular.
* The [[homomorphic image]] of a regular semigroup is regular.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : Lemma 2.4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unique inverses and unique pseudoinverses ===
A regular semigroup in which idempotents commute is an [[inverse semigroup]], or equivalently, every element has a ''unique'' inverse.  To see this, let ''S'' be a regular semigroup in which idempotents commute.  Then every element of ''S'' has at least one inverse.  Suppose that ''a'' in ''S'' has two inverses ''b'' and ''c'', i.e.,
:''aba'' = ''a'', ''bab'' = ''b'', ''aca'' = ''a'' and ''cac'' = ''c''. Also ''ab'', ''ba'', ''ac'' and ''ca'' are idempotents as above.
Then
:''b'' = ''bab'' = ''b''(''aca'')''b'' = ''bac''(''a'')''b =''bac''(''aca'')''b = ''bac''(''ac'')(''ab'') = ''bac''(''ab'')(''ac'') = ''ba''(''ca'')''bac'' = ''ca''(''ba'')''bac'' = ''c''(''aba'')''bac'' = ''cabac'' = ''cac'' = ''c''.
So, by commuting the pairs of idempotents ''ab'' &amp; ''ac'' and ''ba'' &amp; ''ca'', the inverse of ''a'' is shown to be unique.  Conversely, it can be shown that any [[inverse semigroup]] is a regular semigroup in which idempotents commute.&lt;ref name="Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1"&gt;Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a unique pseudoinverse implies the existence of a unique inverse, but the opposite is not true. For example, in the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]], the empty transformation Ø does not have a unique pseudoinverse, because Ø = Ø''f''Ø for any transformation ''f''. The inverse of Ø is unique however, because only one ''f'' satisfies the additional constraint that ''f'' = ''f''Ø''f'', namely ''f'' = Ø. This remark holds more generally in any semigroup with zero. Furthermore, if every element has a unique pseudoinverse, then the semigroup is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], and the unique pseudoinverse of an element coincides with the group inverse.&lt;ref&gt;Proof: http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=6391&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green's relations ==
Recall that the [[principal ideal]]s of a semigroup ''S'' are defined in terms of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the ''semigroup with identity adjoined''; this is to ensure that an element ''a'' belongs to the principal right, left and two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s which it generates.  In a regular semigroup ''S'', however, an element ''a'' = ''axa'' automatically belongs to these ideals, without recourse to adjoining an identity.  [[Green's relations]] can therefore be redefined for regular semigroups as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{L}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, ''Sa'' = ''Sb'';
:&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{R}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, ''aS'' = ''bS'';
:&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{J}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, ''SaS'' = ''SbS''.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a regular semigroup ''S'', every &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;-class contains at least one [[idempotent]].  If ''a'' is any element of ''S'' and α is any inverse for ''a'', then ''a'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;-related to ''αa'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;-related to ''aα''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Preston 1961 : Lemma 1.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem.'''  Let ''S'' be a regular semigroup, and let ''a'' and ''b'' be elements of ''S''.  Then
*&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{L}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, there exist α in ''V''(''a'') and β in ''V''(''b'') such that α''a'' = β''b'';
*&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{R}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, there exist α in ''V''(''a'') and β in ''V''(''b'') such that ''a''α = ''b''β.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : Proposition 2.4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]], then the idempotent in each &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;-class is unique.&lt;ref name="Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1"/&gt;

== Special classes of regular semigroups ==
Some special classes of regular semigroups are:&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : Section 2.4 &amp; Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Locally inverse semigroups'': a regular semigroup ''S'' is '''locally inverse''' if ''eSe'' is an inverse semigroup, for each [[idempotent]] ''e''.
*''[[Orthodox semigroup]]s'': a regular semigroup ''S'' is '''orthodox''' if its subset of [[idempotent]]s forms a subsemigroup.
*''Generalised inverse semigroups'': a regular semigroup ''S'' is called a '''generalised inverse semigroup''' if its [[idempotent]]s form a normal band, i.e., ''xyzx'' = ''xzyx'', for all [[idempotent]]s ''x'', ''y'', ''z''.
The [[class (set theory)|class]] of generalised inverse semigroups is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the class of locally inverse semigroups and the class of orthodox semigroups.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

All inverse semigroups are orthodox and locally inverse. The converse statements do not hold.

==Life==

Broom was born at 66 Back Sneddon Street in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the son of John Broom, a designer of calico prints and [[Paisley design|Paisley shawls]], and Agnes Hunter Shearer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 he married Mary Baird Baillie.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald &amp; Maitland Edey. ''Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-671-25036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, George H. ''Robert Broom F.R.S.

In his medical studies at the University of Glasgow Broom specialised in midwifery.&lt;ref&gt;South African History online (23/03/2017) http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/robert-broom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAHO" /&gt; After graduating in 1895 he travelled to Australia, supporting himself by practising medicine. He settled in South Africa in 1897,&lt;ref name="SAHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Broom|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/robert-broom|website=South African History Online|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; just prior to the [[South African War]]. From 1903 to 1910 he was professor of Zoology and Geology at Victoria College, Stellenbosch (later [[Stellenbosch University]]), but was forced out of this position for promoting belief in evolution.&lt;ref name="SAHO" /&gt; He established a medical practice in the [[Karoo]] region of South Africa, an area rich in [[Therapsid]] fossils. Based on his continuing studies of these fossils and mammalian anatomy he was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1920. Following the discovery of the [[Taung child]] he became interested in the search for human ancestors and commenced work on much more recent fossils from the dolomite caves north-west of Johannesburg, particularly [[Sterkfontein]] Cave (now part of the [[Cradle of Humankind]] World Heritage Site). As well as describing many mammalian fossils from these caves he identified several hominin fossils, the most complete of which was an [[Australopithecine]] skull, nicknamed [[Mrs Ples]], and a partial skeleton that indicated that Australopithecines walked upright.&lt;ref name="SAHO" /&gt;

Broom died in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] in 1951.

== Contributions ==
Broom was first known for his study of [[therapsid|mammal-like reptiles]]. After [[Raymond Dart]]'s discovery of the [[Taung Child]], an infant australopithecine, Broom's interest in paleoanthropology was heightened. Broom's career seemed over and he was sinking into poverty, when Dart wrote to [[Jan Smuts]] about the situation. Smuts, exerting pressure on the South African government, managed to obtain a position for Broom in 1934 with the staff of the [[Transvaal Museum]] in [[Pretoria]] as an Assistant in [[Palaeontology]].

In the following years, he and John T. Robinson made a series of spectacular finds, including fragments from six hominins in [[Sterkfontein]], which they named ''Plesianthropus transvaalensis'', popularly called [[Mrs. Ples]], but which was later classified as an adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'', as well as more discoveries at sites in [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]]. In 1937, Broom made his [[SK 48|most famous discovery]] of ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]''. These discoveries helped support Dart's claims for the Taung species.

The remainder of Broom's career was devoted to the exploration of these sites and the interpretation of the many early hominin remains discovered there. For his volume, ''The South Africa Fossil Ape-Men, The Australopithecinae'', in which he proposed the Australopithecinae subfamily, Broom was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write to the very last. Shortly before his death he finished a monograph on the Australopithecines and remarked to his nephew:&lt;br/&gt;
::"Now that's finished ... and so am I." &lt;ref&gt;Virginia Morell, ''Ancestral Passions'', Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual evolution ==

Broom was a [[nonconformist]] and was deeply interested in the [[paranormal]] and [[spiritualism]]; he was a critic of [[Darwinism]] and [[materialism]]. Broom was a believer in [[spiritual evolution]]. In his book ''The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?'' (1933) he claimed that "spiritual agencies" had guided [[evolution]] as animals and plants were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom, there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and psychics are capable of seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling science and religion: the debate in the early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J. Bowler]], 2001, pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom "Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in."&lt;ref&gt;''Bones of contention: controversies in the search for human origins'', [[Roger Lewin]], 1997, p. 311, {{ISBN|0226476510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After discovering the skull of Mrs. Ples, Broom was asked if he excavated at random, Broom replied that [[spirits]] had told him where to find his discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;A century of Sundays: 100 years of breaking news in the Sunday times, 1906-2006, Nadine Dreyer, 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6775">The '''Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia''' ('''SADS''')&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SADS is not available via the major psychological test companies, but must be obtained directly from one of its coauthors, Jean Endicott, PhD, Professor of Clinical Psychology (in Psychiatry) at Columbia University Medical Center via email (je10 [at] columbia [dot] edu) or fax (212-543-5386). Keep in mind that the SADS does not map as precisely onto current nosology, i.e., DSM-5, compared to diagnostic structured interviews such as the [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV]].&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collection of psychiatric diagnostic criteria and symptom rating scales originally published in 1978.&lt;ref name= Endicott&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Endicott | first1 = J | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL | year = 1978 | title = A diagnostic interview: the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/35/7/837 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 837–43 | pmid = 678037 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1978.01770310043002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized as a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The structured aspect is that every interview asks screening questions about the same set of disorders regardless of the presenting problem; and positive screens get explored with a consistent set of symptoms. These features increase the sensitivity of the interview and the inter-rater reliability (or reproducibility) of the resulting diagnoses. The SADS also allows more flexibility than fully structured interviews: Interviewers can use their own words and rephrase questions, and some clinical judgment is used to score responses. There are three versions of the schedule, the regular SADS, the lifetime version (SADS-L) and a version for measuring the change in symptomology (SADS-C). Although largely replaced by more structured interviews that follow diagnostic criteria such as [[DSM-IV]] and DSM-5, and specific mood rating scales, versions of the SADS are still used in some research papers today.

==Diagnoses covered==
The diagnoses covered by the interview include [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[anxiety disorders]] and a limited number of other fairly common diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Endicott/&gt;

==Relationship with the Research Diagnostic Criteria==
The SADS was developed by the same group of rearchers as the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] (RDC). While the RDC is a list of diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders, the SADS interview allows diagnoses based on RDC criteria to be made, and also rates subject's symptoms and level of functioning.&lt;ref name=Endicott/&gt;

==K-SADS==
The '''[[Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia|K-SADS]]''' (or '''Kiddie-SADS''') is a version of the SADS adapted for [[school-age]]d children of 6–18 years. There are various different versions of the K-SADS, each varying slightly in terms of disorders and specific symptoms covered, as well as the scale range used. All of the variations are still semi-structured interviews, giving the interviewer more flexibility about how to phrase and probe items, while still covering a consistent set of disorders.

The K-SADS-E (Epidemiological version) was developed for epidemiological research. It focused on current issues and episodes only. Most of the items used a four point rating scale.

The [http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/assessments/ksads-pl.pdf K-SADS-PL] (Present and Lifetime version) is administered by interviewing the parent(s), the child, and integrating them into a summary rating that includes parent report, child report, and clinical observations during the interview. The interview covers both present issues (i.e., the reason the family is seeking an evaluation) as well as past episodes of the disorders. Most items use a three point rating scale for severity (not present, subthreshold, and threshold—which combines both moderate and severe presentations). It has been used with preschool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birmaher|first=Boris|last2=Ehmann|first2=Mary|last3=Axelson|first3=David A.|last4=Goldstein|first4=Benjamin I.|last5=Monk|first5=Kelly|last6=Kalas|first6=Catherine|last7=Kupfer|first7=David|last8=Gill|first8=Mary Kay|last9=Leibenluft|first9=Ellen|date=2009-04-01|title=Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS-PL) for the Assessment of Preschool Children- A Preliminary Psychometric Study|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=43|issue=7|pages=680–686|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.10.003|issn=0022-3956|pmc=2736874|pmid=19000625}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as school-aged children. A [http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/node/8234 2009 working draft] removed all reference to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III-R]] criteria (which were replaced with the publication of the DSM-IV in 1994) and made some other modifications.

A '''sense of wonder''' is an intellectual and emotional state frequently invoked in discussions of [[science fiction]].

__TOC__

==Definitions==
This entry focuses on one specific use of the phrase "sense of wonder." This phrase is widely used in contexts that have nothing to do with science fiction. The following relates to the use of "sense of wonder" within the context of science fiction. In ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'' the term ''sense of wonder'' is defined as follows:
{{quote|SENSE OF WONDER  ''n''. a feeling of awakening or awe triggered by an expansion of one’s awareness of what is possible or by confrontation with the vastness of space and time, as brought on by reading science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Prucher, Jeff (ed.). ''Brave New Words. The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'' (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}}}

[[Jon Radoff]] has characterised a sense of wonder as an emotional reaction to the reader suddenly confronting, understanding, or seeing a concept new in the context of new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |title=The Attack on Imagination |last=Radoff |first=Jon |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926222855/http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introductory section of his essay 'On the Grotesque in Science Fiction', Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., Professor of English, [[DePauw University]], states:

{{quote|The so-called sense of wonder has been considered one of the primary attributes of sf at least since the pulp era. The titles of the most popular sf magazines of that period—''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'', ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', ''Thrilling'', ''Startling'', etc.—clearly indicate that the putative cognitive value of sf stories is more than counter-balanced by an affective power, to which, in fact, the scientific content is expected to submit.&lt;ref name="ronay"&gt;Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., Istvan. 'On the Grotesque in Science Fiction', ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Mar., 2002), pp. 71–99&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}}}

John Clute and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] associate the experience with that of the "conceptual breakthrough" or "[[paradigm shift]]" (Clute &amp; Nicholls 1993).  In many cases, it is achieved through the recasting of previous narrative experiences in a larger context. It can be found in short scenes (e.g., in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', it can be found, in a small dose, inside the line "That's no moon; it's a space station.") and it can require entire novels to set up (as in the final line to [[Iain Banks]]'s ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]''.)

[[George Mann (writer)|George Mann]] defines the term as “the sense of inspired awe that is aroused in a reader when the full implications of an event or action become realized, or when the immensity of a plot or idea first becomes known;”{{rp|508}} and he associates the term with the [[Golden Age Science Fiction|Golden Age]] of SF and the pulp magazines prevalent at the time. One of the major writers of the Golden Age, Isaac Asimov, agreed with this association: in 1967 commenting on the changes occurring in SF he wrote,

{{quote|And because today’s real life so resembles day-before-yesterday’s fantasy, the old-time fans are restless. Deep within, whether they admit it or not, is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain. They feel the loss of a “sense of wonder” because what was once truly confined to “wonder” has now become prosaic and mundane.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ‘Forward 1 – The Second Revolution’ in Ellison, Harlan (ed.). ''Dangerous Visions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

==Sense of wonder as numinosity==
{{main article|Numinous}}
Numinous is defined in this encyclopedia as that which arouses "spiritual or religious emotion" or is "mysterious or awe-inspiring".

==Sense of wonder as a concept especially connected with science fiction==

[[George Mann (writer)|George Mann]] suggests that this  ‘sense of wonder’ is associated only with science fiction as distinct from science fantasy, stating:

{{quote|It is this insistence on fundamental realism that has caused [[Jules Verne|Verne]]’s novels to be retrospectively seen as of key importance in the development of SF. …—people in droves came to the books looking for adventure and got it, but with an edge of scientific inquiry that left them with a new, very different sense of wonder. The magic of the realms of fantasy had been superseded by the fascination of speculation rooted in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, George (ed.). ''The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (London: Robinson, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}}}

However, the editor and critic [[David Hartwell]] sees SF’s ‘sense of wonder’ in more general terms, as ”being at the root of the excitement of science fiction.” He continues:

{{quote| Any child who has looked up at the stars at night and thought about how far away they are, how there is no end or outer edge to this place, this universe—any child who has felt the thrill of fear and excitement at such thoughts stands a very good chance of becoming a science fiction reader.}}

To say that science fiction is in essence a religious literature is an overstatement, but one that contains truth. SF is a uniquely modern incarnation of an ancient tradition: the tale of wonder. Tales of miracles, tales of great powers and consequences beyond the experience of people in your neighborhood, tales of the gods who inhabit other worlds and sometimes descend to visit ours, tales of humans traveling to the abode of the gods, tales of the uncanny: all exist now as science fiction.

{{quote|Science fiction’s appeal lies in combination of the rational, the believable, with the miraculous. It is an appeal to the sense of wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, David. ''Age of Wonders'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}}}

Academic criticism of science fiction literature (Robu 1988) identifies the idea of the [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]] described by Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant—infinity, immensity, "delightful horror"—as a key to understanding the concept of "sense of wonder" in science fiction. For example, Professor of English at the [[University of Iowa]], Brooks Landon says:

{{quote|Reference to this “sense of wonder,” a term appropriated and popularized by [[Damon Knight]], appear over and over in twentieth-century discussions of SF and may at least in part reflect SF’s debt to its Gothic and Romantic forerunners.&lt;ref name="landon"&gt;Landon, Brooks. ''Science Fiction after 1900. From the Steam Man to the Stars'' (New York: Twayne, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}}}

[[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]] quotes from [[Brian Aldiss|Aldiss]] and Wingrove’s history of science fiction in support of the above suggestion as to the origin of the ‘sense of wonder’ in SF, as follows:

{{quote| In the Gothic mode, emphasis was placed on the distant and unearthly … Brooding landscapes, isolated castles, dismal old towns, and mysterious figures … carry us into an entranced world from which horrid revelations start …. Terror, mystery and that delightful horror which Burke connected with the sublime … may be discovered … in science fiction to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Brian and David Wingrove (eds.).''Trillion Year Spree'' quoted in James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th Century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}}}

Paul K. Alkon in his book ''Science Fiction before 1900. Imagination Discovers Technology'' makes a similar point:

{{quote|The affinities of science fiction and Gothic literature also reveal a common quest for those varieties of pleasing terror induced by awe-inspiring events or settings that Edmund Burke and other eighteenth-century critics call the sublime. A looming problem for writers in the nineteenth century was how to achieve sublimity without recourse to the supernatural. ... The supernatural marvels that had been a staple of epic and lesser forms from Homeric times would no longer do as the best sources of sublimity. ... writers sought new forms that could better accommodate the impact of science.&lt;ref name="alkon"&gt;Alkon, Paul K. ''Science Fiction before 1900. Imagination Discovers Technology'' (New York: Routledge, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}}}

Alkon concludes that "science fiction ever since [the 19th century] has been concerned as often to elicit strong emotional responses as to maintain a rational basis for its plots. Far from being mutually exclusive, the two aims can reinforce each other ...",&lt;ref name="alkon" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Edward James, in a section of his book entitled ‘The Sense of Wonder’ says on this point of the origin of the 'sense of wonder' in SF:

{{quote|That the concept of the Sublime, a major aesthetic criterion of the Romantic era, has a close connection with the pleasures derived from reading sf has long been recognized by readers and critics, even if that word has seldom been used. The phrase that ''has'' been used, and which to a large extent corresponds, is ‘Sense of Wonder’ (sometimes jocularly or cynically abbreviated to ‘sensawunda’). The very first collection of sf criticism was Damon Knight’s ''In Search of Wonder'' (1956).&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th Century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}}}

James goes on to explore the same point as made by David Hartwell in his book ''Age of Wonders'' (and quoted above) as regards the relationship of the ‘sense of wonder’ in SF to religion or the religious experience. He states that,

{{quote| … in doing so, it [science fiction] can create a rival sense of wonder, which acts almost as a replacement religion: a religion for those deprived of all traditional certainties in the wake of Darwin, Einstein, Plank, Godel, and Heisenberg.&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|106}}}}

As an example James takes the short story ‘[[The Nine Billion Names of God]]’ by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. He explains:

{{quote| A computer is installed by Western technicians in a Tibetan lamasery; its task is in to speed up the compilation of all the possible names of God. This, the monks believe, is what the human race was created for, and on its completion the earth, and perhaps all creation, will come to an end. The technicians do their job, with some condescension, and flee back to civilization.

{{quote| ‘Wonder if the computer’s finished its run. It was due about now.’

Chuck didn’t reply, so George swung round in his saddle. He could just see Chuck’s face, a white oval toward the sky.

‘Look,’ whispered Chuck, and George lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)

Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.}}

… what this reader (at the age of 13 or 14) learned from the story was the unimaginable size of the universe and the implausibility of some of the traditional human images of God. An almost religious sense of awe (or wonder) was created in me, as I tried to perceive the immensity of the universe, and contemplate the possibility of the non-existence of God.&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|106–107}}}}

It is appropriate that Edward James chooses a story by Arthur C. Clarke to make the point. One critic is of the opinion that Clarke "has dedicated his career to evoking a "sense of wonder" at the sublime spaces of the universe ..."&lt;ref&gt;Seed, David. 'Introduction' in David Seed (ed.) ''A Companion to Science Fiction'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Editor and SF researcher [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] agrees:

{{quote|If there is one writer whose work epitomizes that sense of wonder, it is without doubt, Arthur C. Clarke. It's almost impossible to read any of his stories or novels without experiencing that trigger-moment when the mind expands to take in an awe-inspiring concept. ... It's there in his novel's ''Childhood's End,'' ''The City and the Stars,'' ''Rendezvous with Rama'' and his short stories "The Star", "Jupiter V" and "The Nine Billion Names of God"—possibly the definitive "sense of wonder" story.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike. Introduction to 'Out of the Sun' in Ashley, Mike (ed.) ''The Mammoth Book of Mindblowing SF'' (London: Constable and Robinson, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

Kathryn Cramer in her essay ‘On Science and Science Fiction’ also explores the relationship of SF’s ‘sense of wonder’ to religion, stating that “the primacy of the sense of wonder in science fiction poses a direct challenge to religion: Does the wonder of science and the natural world as experienced through science fiction replace religious awe?”
&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Kathryn. ‘Introduction: On Science and Science Fiction,’ in David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer (eds.), ''The Ascent of Wonder. The Evolution of Hard SF'' (London: Orbit, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|28}}

However, as Brooks Landon shows, not all 'sense of wonder' needs to be so closely related to the classical sense of the Sublime. Commenting on the story 'Twilight' by [[John W. Campbell]] he says:
{{quote|... Campbell stresses how long seven million years is in human terms but notes that this time span is nothing in the life of the sun, whose "two thousand thousand thousand" risings ... As Campbell well knew, one sure path to a sense of wonder was big numbers."&lt;ref name="landon"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}}}

Perhaps the single most famous example of "sensawunda" in all of science fiction involves a [[neologism]], from the work of [[A. E. van Vogt]] (Moskowitz 1974):

{{quote|The word "sevagram" appears only once in the series, as the very last word of ‘[[The Weapon Makers]]’; in its placing, which seems to open universes to the reader's gaze, and in its resonant mysteriousness, for its precise meaning is unclear, this use of "sevagram" may well stand as the best working demonstration in the whole genre sf of how to impart a sense of wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John and Nicholls, Peter (eds.).''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (New York: St. Martin Griffin, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1269}}}}

Despite the attempts above to define and illustrate the 'sense of wonder' in SF, Csicsery-Ronay Jr. argues that "unlike most of the other qualities regularly associated with the genre, the sense of wonder resists critical commentary."&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|71}} The reason he suggests is that,

{{quote|A "literature of ideas," as sf is often said to be, invites discussion of ideas; but the sense of wonder seems doubly to resist intellectual investigation. As a "sense," it is clearly not about ideas and indeed seems in opposition to them; wonder even more so, with its implications of awe that short-circuits analytic thought.&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|71}}}}

Nevertheless, despite this "resistance to critical commentary," the 'sense of wonder' has "a well-established pedigree in art, separated into two related categories of response: the expansive sublime and the intensive grotesque."&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|71}} Csicsery-Ronay Jr. explains the difference between these two categories as follows::

{{quote| The sublime is a response to an imaginative shock, the complex recoil and recuperation of consciousness coping with objects too great to be encompassed. The grotesque, on the other hand, is a quality usually attributed to objects, the strange conflation of disparate elements not found in nature. This distinction is true to their difference. The sublime expands consciousness inward as it encompasses limits to its outward expansion of apprehension; the grotesque is a projection of fascinated repulsion/attraction out into objects that consciousness cannot accommodate, because the object disturbs the sense of rational, natural categorization. In both cases, the reader/perceiver is shocked by a sudden estrangement from habitual perception, and in both cases the response is to suspend one's confidence in knowledge about the world, and to attempt to redefine the real in thought's relation to nature. Both are concerned with the states of mind that science and art have in common: acute responsiveness to the objects of the world, the testing (often involuntary) of the categories conventionally used to interpret the world, and the desire to articulate what consciousness finds inarticulable.{{rp|71}}}}

Later in this same essay the author argues that "the sublime and the grotesque are in such close kinship that they are shadows of each other," and that "it is not always easy to distinguish the two, and the grotesque of one age easily becomes the sublime of another."&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|79}} He gives as an example the android (T-1000) in the second '[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]' film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', saying that "the T-1000, like so many liminal figures in sf, is almost simultaneously sublime and grotesque. Its fascinating shape-shifting would be the object of sublime awe were it not for its sadistic violation of mundane flesh&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

There is no doubt that the term 'sense of wonder' is used and understood by readers of SF without the need of explanation or elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Donald. [http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/FandBook/FandBook.html "A Key to the Terminology of science fiction fandom"]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, SF author and critic [[David Langford]] reviewing an SF novel in the [[New York Review of Science Fiction]] was able to write "I suppose it's all a frightfully mordant microcosm of human aspirations, but after so much primitive carnage, the expected multiversal sense-of-wonder jolt comes as a belated infodump rather than ..."&lt;ref&gt;Langford, David. 'Random Reading 2' in ''New York Review of Science Fiction'' April 2002, Number 164, Vol 14, No. 8&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

[[Jack Williamson]] in 1991 said that the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] did not last in science fiction because it "failed to move people. I'm not sure if this failure was due to its pessimistic themes or to people feeling the stuff was too pretentious. But it never really grabbed hold of people's imaginations".&lt;ref&gt;Larry McCaffery and Jack Williamson. 'An Interview with Jack Williamson' in ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jul., 1991), pp. 230–252: page 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural vs synthetic origin==

Sharona Ben-Tov in her book ''The Artificial Paradise: Science Fiction and American Reality''&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Tov, Sharona. ''The Artificial Paradise: Science Fiction and American Reality'' (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; explores science-fiction's (SF) 'sense of wonder' from a feminist perspective. Her book is a "thought-provoking work of criticism that provides a new and interesting perspective on some basic elements in science fiction," including the 'sense of wonder'.&lt;ref name="dalgleish"&gt;Dalgleish, David. Book review: 'The ambivalent paradise: Or, nature and the transcendent in British SF,' review of ''The Artificial Paradise'' by Sharona Ben-Tov', ''Extrapolation'' Kent: Winter 1997.Vol. 38, Iss. 4; pg. 327&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|327}} In his review of Ben-Tov’s work for the SF critical journal ''Extrapolation'' David Dalgleish, quoting from the text, points out that,

{{quote| Ben-Tov asserts that SF's (in)famous "sense of wonder" is an attempt to evoke a sublime transcendence, achieved through Nature, and "Nature is an animate, feminine, and numinous being" (23). But in SF as Ben-Tov sees it, this natural transcendence is merely an illusion; in fact, the transcendent is only achieved through technology, achieved by alienating feminine Nature. SF has "appropriated the qualities of abundance and harmony from the romance's Earthly paradise, banishing the figure of feminine nature from the man-made, rationalized world ...(22) ... The SF ideology that Ben-Tov examines is rooted in the scientific revolution, in the changing view of nature—from living, feminine Mother, Nature becomes inert, dead matter. This twentieth-century ideology has, for Ben-Tov, disturbing implications, especially from a feminist standpoint. "Our society," writes Ben-Tov, "lost the basis for transcendent experience by losing the relationship with numinous nature"(23). Thus, SF's "sense of wonder" is a lie: "it reflects white American fantasies about nature, machines, and the `frontier' . . . . The American mythological apparatus must be comprehended thoroughly to be handled, or dismantled, effectively" (92–93).&lt;ref name="dalgleish"/&gt;{{rp|327}}}}

==Examples of the 'casual' use of the term 'sense of wonder' in science fiction criticism==
*"Most science fiction writers wish to make their readers feel the thrill, the sense of wonder, that so marked SF's youth that the genre still claims it as a sort of trademark, even though it is scarcely to be found today." [[Tom Easton]]. [[Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact]]. New York: May 2000. Vol. 120, Iss.5; page. 134
*"The backstory. Two previous Mars expeditions have failed. ... An American crew perished further south, leaving an empty base ... and return vehicle, the Dulcinea. ... Now it's the turn of the international free-lancers ...The landing is successful, right on target and just a few minute' stroll from the Dulcinea. Sense of wonder oozes from the pages as the crew steps onto the Martian surface." Tom Easton. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jan 2001. Vol. 121, Iss. 1; page. 135
*"I first read Thrust Into Space by Maxwell W. Hunter II 30 years ago when I was around 11 or 12. At a time when I was just discovering real science fiction, and first reading the works of Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke, this book evoked for me exactly the same " sense of wonder" as did the works of that great trinity." Jeffrey D Kooistra. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jul/Aug 2002. Vol. 122, Iss. 7/8; page. 128
*"The story is also far less melodramatic than it might have been if published during the 1950s. Included are brief discussions of mathematical and other scientific problems that evoke a kind of old-fashioned sense of wonder about the universe without disrupting the flow of the story." [[Don D'Ammassa]]. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: May 2009. Vol. 129, Iss. 5; page.101
*David E. Nye brings a keen eye to the history of technology in the United States. I used his American Technological Sublime in classes for years. I may well use his latest ... too. ... The thesis of the earlier book was—in extreme brief—that in America technological wonders—from railroads to the nuclear bomb—evoked the same emotional response as natural wonders such as the Grand Canyon. This response was the blend of awe and terror and wonder that had long been called "the sublime." There was, to me, a clear connection to the sfnal "sense of wonder" that helped explain why twentieth-century science fiction was predominantly American." Tom Easton. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jun 2005. Vol. 125, Iss. 6; pg. 136
*"The sense of wonder that marks the SF sensibility is hard to teach and certainly cannot be dictated or overlain on a soul that lacks it. It must come from within, and when it does, all the wonders of the universe are within reach." Tom Easton. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Dec 1998. Vol. 118, Iss. 12; pg. 133
*"...if we take note of [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] (and Clarke's) film [[2001: A Space Odyssey]], a powerful meditation on the relations of the sublime and the banal. To get into space we seem to have needed to suspend the imagination and sense of wonder that was a very important part of what made us want to get into space in the first place.

*"The best writers observe things. Sometimes these are details about the universe. Sometimes they are grand visions that instill the sense of wonder about which science fiction fans wax lyrical.

Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jan/Feb 2010. Vol. 130, Iss. 1/2; page. 56
*"It was that vision of exciting new technologies and the bright tomorrows they might create that gave us the "sense of wonder" veteran fans lament with such nostalgia. It made us the unhonored prophets of a new faith, lonely pioneers in a world of critical unbelievers bewildered by the term "science fiction.

Wilson Company|isbn=0824207971|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Brombert was born in [[Berlin]] in 1923 into a well-to-do Russian-Jewish family that had fled Russia at the outbreak of the Revolution and settled in [[Leipzig]]. When Hitler came to power in Germany, the family left for Paris, and Brombert received his secondary education at the [[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]]. As the German army advanced on Paris in 1940, the family fled to the unoccupied zone under the control of the Vichy government and a year later, in 1941, escaped via Spain to the United States.

In May 1943 Brombert was drafted into the U.S. army. Due to his fluency in French, German, and Russian he was placed in a special unit, composed chiefly of refugees from Nazi-occupied European countries, that was trained in front-line military intelligence at [[Fort Ritchie|Camp Ritchie, Maryland]], and featured in a documentary film "The [[Ritchie Boys]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435725/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritchieboys.com/EN/boys_brombert.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docurama.com/docurama/the-ritchie-boys/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.tvguide.com/The+Ritchie+Boys/The+Ritchie+Boys/8150782?autoplay=true&amp;partnerid=OVG]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 he took part in the Normandy landings with the 2nd Armored Division at [[Omaha Beach]] and also saw action with the 28th Infantry Division in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. After the war, Brombert studied at Yale University, where he received a B.A. in 1948 and a Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures in 1953. As a graduate student, he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship (1950–51) to study in Rome, adding Italian to the languages in which he has native fluency. He is married to Beth Archer Brombert, a translator from French and Italian, and the author of the biographies ''Cristina: Portraits of a Princess'' and ''Édouard Manet: Rebel in a Frock Coat''. The Bromberts have two children, Lauren and Marc.

==Academic career==

On completion of his graduate studies Brombert joined the Yale Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. He was appointed Benjamin F. Barge Professor in 1968 and was chair of his Department from 1964 to 1973. In 1975 he moved to Princeton, where he had been appointed Henry Putnam University Professor and was affiliated with the Departments of Comparative Literature and Romance Languages and Literatures. At Princeton, he was also Director of Princeton's Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism and chairman of its Council of the Humanities. He entered emeritus status in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/fit/people/display_person.xml?netid=brombert Princeton biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brombert has been a visiting professor at many universities in the U.S. and Europe: the University of California (Berkeley), the Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, New York University, the University of Colorado, the Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy), the Collège de France (Paris), the University of Bologna, the University of Puerto Rico.

==Awards==

Brombert has held fellowships from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1967) and from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] (1954–55; 1970). He was [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Visiting Scholar in 1986-87 and 1989–90, and a scholar-in-residence at the Rockefeller Foundation in [[Bellagio, Italy]] in 1975 and in 1990. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1974, and to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1987.

==Publications==

Brombert’s work is primarily on 19th and 20th century [[French literature]], and also on the [[history of ideas]]; the theory of literary criticism; and comparative studies of Italian, Russian, and German narrative writers. In addition to his books, he has contributed to edited volumes and written journal articles on French writers from Pascal to Malraux, Sartre, and Camus, and on many non-French writers: Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tolstoy; Büchner, Max Frisch, Kafka, Thomas Mann; Giorgio Bassani, Primo Levi, Italo Svevo; J. M. Coetzee, Virginia Woolf.

Brombert is also the author of a memoir, ''Trains of Thought: Memories of a Stateless Youth'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 2002; paperback, Anchor Books, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Trains of Thought'' by [[Frank Kermode]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Trains of Thought'' by [[Richard Howard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/books/engine-of-escape.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently working on a sequel, to be entitled ''The Sabbatical Years''.
 
In the words of a reviewer in ''The Wall Street Journal'' (December 27, 2013), “Victor Brombert...has been for more than 50 years one of the glories of humanistic scholarship at Yale and Princeton. Though a generation younger than scholarly patriarchs like Erich Auerbach and Leo Spitzer, Mr. Brombert has nonetheless shown himself comparably learned and cosmopolitan in his studies...”

The '''world3 nonrenewable resource sector''' is the portion of the [[world3]] model that simulates the [[nonrenewable resource]]s.  The World3 model was a simulation of human interaction with the environment designed in the 1970s to predict population and living standards over the course of the next 100 years.  The nonrenewable resource sector of the world3 model was used to calculate the cost and usage rates of nonrenewable resources.  In the context of this model, nonrenewable resources were resources that there is a finite amount of on Earth, such as iron ore, oil, or coal. This model assumes that regardless of how much money is spent on extraction, there is a finite limit for the amount of nonrenewable resources that can be extracted.

== Overview ==

The model combines all possible nonrenewable resources into one aggregate variable, &lt;tt&gt;nonrenewable_resources&lt;/tt&gt;.  This combines both energy resources and non-energy resources.  Examples of nonrenewable energy resources would include oil and coal.  Examples of material nonrenewable resources would include aluminum and zinc.  This assumption allows costless substitution between any nonrenewable resource.  The model ignores differences between discovered resources and undiscovered resources.

The model assumes that as greater percentages of total nonrenewable resources are used, the amount of effort used to extract the nonrenewable resources will increase.  
The way this cost is done is as a variable &lt;tt&gt;fraction_of_capital_allocated_to_obtaining_resources&lt;/tt&gt;, or abbreviated &lt;tt&gt;fcaor&lt;/tt&gt;.  The way this variable is used is in the equation that calculates industrial output.  Basically, it works  as &lt;tt&gt;effective_output = industrial_capital*other_factors*(1-fcaor)&lt;/tt&gt;.  This causes the amount of resources expended to depend on the amount of industrial capital, and not on the amount of resources consumed.

The consumption of nonrenewable resources is determined by a nonlinear function of the per capita industrial output.  The higher the per capita industrial output, the higher the nonrenewable [[resource consumption]].

== Cost of obtaining nonrenewable resources ==

The fraction of capital allocated to obtaining resources is dependent only on the &lt;tt&gt;nonrenewable_resource_fraction_remaining&lt;/tt&gt;, or abbreviated &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt;.  This variable is the current amount of non-renewable resources divided by the initial amount of non-renewable resources available.  As such &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt; starts out as 1.0 and decreases as world3 runs.  Fraction of capital allocated to obtaining resources is dependent on &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt; as interpolated values from the following table:

{| border="1" 
! NRFR !! FCAOR 
|-
| 0.0 || 1.0
|-
| 0.1 || 0.9
|-
| 0.2 || 0.7
|-
| 0.3 || 0.5
|-
| 0.4 || 0.2
|-
| 0.5 || 0.1
|- 
| 0.6 || 0.05
|-
| 0.7 || 0.05
|-
| 0.8 || 0.05
|-
| 0.9 || 0.05
|-
| 1.0 || 0.05
|}

Qualitatively, this basically states that the relative amount of non-renewable resources decreases, the amount capital required to extract the resources increases.  To more deeply examine this table requires examining the equation that it comes from, &lt;tt&gt;effective_output = industrial_capital*other_factors*(1-fcaor)&lt;/tt&gt; So, if industrial capital and the other factors (described in the capital sector) are the same, then 1 unit of the effective capital when &lt;tt&gt;nrfr&lt;/tt&gt; is 1.0 the effective output is 0.95 (= 1.0 * ( 1 - 0.05)).  So, when nrfr is 0.5, the effective output is 0.90 (= 1.0 * (1 - 0.10)).  Another useful way to look at this equation is to reverse it and see how much effective capital is required to get 1 unit of effective output (i.e. effective_output / (1 - fcaor) = effective_capital).  So, when nrfr is 1.0, the effective capital required for 1 unit of effective output is 1.053 (=1.0/(1-0.05)), and when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2 (=1.0/(1-0.5)).  Lastly is looking at the relative cost required for obtaining the resources.  This based on the fact that it requires 1/19 of a unit of effective capital extra when the nrfr is 1.0.  So, (effective capital required - 1.0) / (1 / 19) will give the relative cost of obtaining the resources compared to the cost of obtaining them when nrfr was 1.0.  For example, when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2.0, and 1.0 of that is for obtaining resources.  So, the cost of obtaining the resources is (2.0 - 1.0) / ( 1 / 19) or 1.0*19 or 19 times the cost when nrfr was 1.0.  Here is a table showing these calculations for all the values:

{| border="1" 
! NRFR !! FCAOR !! Required Capital !! Relative Resource Cost
|-
| 0.0 || 1.0 || ∞ || ∞
|-
| 0.1 || 0.9 || 10.0 || 171.0
|-
| 0.2 || 0.7 || 3.333 || 44.333
|-
| 0.3 || 0.5 || 2.0 || 19.0
|-
| 0.4 || 0.2 || 1.250 || 4.750
|-
| 0.5 || 0.1 || 1.111 || 2.111
|- 
| 0.6 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 0.7 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 0.8 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 0.9 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|-
| 1.0 || 0.05 || 1.053 || 1.0
|}

== Consumption of Nonrenewable Resources ==
The world3 model does not directly link industrial output to resource utilization. Instead, the industrial output per capita is calculated, and that is used to determine resource usage per capita.  This is then multiplied by the total population to determine the total resource consumption.   
Per capita resource utilization multiplier (PCRUM) and Industrial Output per Capita (IOPC)
